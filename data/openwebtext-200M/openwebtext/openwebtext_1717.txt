Parking your two - wheeler in a shady neighborhood , but left your secondary lock at home ?
No problem -- to protect your wheels , just bend your bike around a nearby post and thread your U - lock through the whole kit at once .
That 's the idea behind UK designer Kevin Scott 's folding bicycle , which is rigid enough to freely ride , but releases its flexible ratcheting mechanism when you push a lever on the side .
The design won the 21 - year - old student £ 500 at the New Designers exhibition in London this week .
He 's presently looking for partners to help commercialize the concept , which looks more some , so we expect it 'll be only a few years before you 'll see his creation zipping down the street .
One question , though -- why not go the whole nine yards and give it a built - in lock , too ?
SO MUCH for Russia 's “ zone of privileged interests ” and the West 's worries about it .
The phrase was coined by Dmitry Medvedev , Russia 's president , in the aftermath of the 2008 war with Georgia , when Russian rhetoric reached shrill levels .
The events of the past two weeks in Belarus and Kyrgyzstan have provided a humble reality check and exposed the hollowness of Russia 's neo-imperialist ambitions among the states that once made up the Soviet Union .
Russia has long wished to keep the West away from its backyard .
Now that America and the EU are tied up with their own problems , Russia has had its wish partly granted .
Left to its own devices , however , it has shown little leadership , vision or sense of imperial responsibility in its vaunted “ zone ” .
A spat over gas with Belarus has exposed the fragility of the embryonic customs union between Russia , Kazakhstan and Belarus , put forward by Moscow as the nucleus of a new Russia - dominated economic club .
The bloody pogroms in Kyrgyzstan ( see article ) reveal the Collective Security Treaty Organisation — a post -Soviet military alliance of Russia , Kyrgyzstan , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan , Tajikistan , Belarus and Armenia — to be a chimera .
In its dispute with Belarus this week Russia started to cut gas supplies to its supposed close ally , claiming it was owed some $ 200 m .
The debt stems from Belarus 's decision to pay last year 's price of $ 150 per thousand cubic metres of gas , ignoring a Gazprom price increase .
Alyaksandr Lukashenka , Belarus 's maverick leader , upped the stakes by ordering a cut in transit shipments of Russian gas to the EU , arguing it was also owed money .
On June 24th Gazprom resumed full supply but Belarus maintained its claim .
This is not the first spat between Russia and Belarus , and it will not be the last .
But , as Fyodor Lukyanov , the Russia editor for Global Affairs , argues , this time the row has a political flavour .
For all his authoritarianism and anti-Americanism , Mr Lukashenka is disdained by Russian officials for reneging on his promises and dragging his feet on agreements .
He has skilfully managed to extract large subsidies from Russia while poking it in the eye and playing it off against the EU .
Last year the Belarusian president refused to recognise the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , the two breakaway Georgian territories over which Russia had warred with Georgia .
That was followed by a Russian ban on Belarus 's milk products .
More recently , Mr Lukashenka has decided to shelter Kurmanbek Bakiyev , the overthrown authoritarian leader of Kyrgyzstan , who is loathed by Moscow .
Mr Lukashenka has also sabotaged the customs union with Kazakhstan and Russia , demanding that Russia scrap its export duty on oil and oil products , which would allow Belarus to buy them at Russia 's domestic prices and to re-export them at a profit .
( Russia wants to keep oil out of the union for now . )
Russia 's response is to reach for its favourite weapon : the gas taps .
In its relations with its neighbours , Russia has mostly relied on coercion .
Consider its response to Mr Bakiyev 's fall and the subsequent pogroms in Kyrgyzstan .
The Kremlin shed no tears for Mr Bakiyev , whom it saw as two - faced and greedy .
Last year Mr Bakiyev extracted a $ 2 billion aid package from Russia in exchange for a promise to close an American military air base in Kyrgyzstan , as Russia insisted .
He then raised the rent for the American base and allowed it to stay .

When , earlier this month , the Kyrgyz clashed with the Uzbek minority in the southern Kyrgyzstani city of Osh and the interim government appealed to Russia for military help , the Kremlin stood back .
To the outside world it looked like the opportunity Russia had been waiting for to show that it dominates its backyard .
To Russia it was a nightmare that evoked memories of Soviet involvement in Afghanistan in the 1980s .
Russia 's official line was that it could not interfere in Kyrgyzstan 's internal affairs ( a statement that sat oddly with Russia 's war against Georgia ) .
In fact , Russia has neither the capacity nor the will for such intervention .
As Alexander Golts , an expert on Russia 's armed forces , argues , the Russian army — which largely consists of unskilled recruits and is plagued by bullying — is not equipped for the sort of peacekeeping operation they were asked to carry out in Kyrgyzstan .
Besides , Russia's “ allies ” in the CSTO , particularly nearby Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan , have no desire to see Russian troops setting a precedent by sorting out the internal affairs of a neighbouring state .
Russia 's intervention would be unpopular at home too .
Xenophobia towards migrant workers from Central Asia and memories of Afghanistan would make any sacrifice of Russian lives in Kyrgyzstan unacceptable to most Russians .
Yet , if Russia was right not to send troops to Kyrgyzstan , it was wrong to claim the country as part of a zone of privileged Russian interest .
When ethnic clashes broke out in Osh 20 years ago , Mikhail Gorbachev sent in Soviet troops .
Today 's government , for all its Soviet nostalgia , seems to feel no such obligation .
What Russia 's response to Kyrgyzstan has made clear , Mr Golts observes , is that “ Moscow bosses imitate imperial ambitions in the same way they imitate democracy . ”
That the Cold War is back ,
the Cold War is back , That , given that the Cold War is over , the point of such outmoded intelligence operations is questionable ,
And that the Russian spy ring was spending its time aimlessly nosing around in think tanks and open meetings in an archaic and incompetent effort .

Twin Goals and the Espionage Challenge
The Intelligence Assumption
The United States has captured a group of Russian spies and exchanged them for four individuals held by the Russianson espionage charges .
The ways the media have reported on the issue fall into three groups :
It is said that the world is global and interdependent .
This makes it vital for a given nation to know three things about all of the nations with which it interacts .
First , it needs to know what other nations are capable of doing .
Whether militarily , economically or politically , knowing what other nations are capable of narrows down those nations ' possible actions , eliminating fantasies and rhetoric from the spectrum of possible moves .
Second , the nation needs to know what other nations intend to do .
This is important in the short run , especially when intentions and capabilities match up .
And third , the nation needs to know what will happen in other nations that those nations ' governments did n't anticipate .
The more powerful a nation is , the more important it is to understand what it is doing .
The United States is the most powerful country in the world .
It therefore follows that it is one of the prime focuses of every country in the world .
Knowing what the United States will do , and shifting policy based on that , can save countries from difficulties and even disaster .
This need is not confined , of course , to the United States .
Each country in the world has a list of nations that it is interdependent with , and it keeps an eye on those nations .
These can be enemies , friends or just acquaintances .
It is impossible for nations not tokeep their eyes on other nations , corporations not to keep their eyes on other corporations and individuals not to keep their eyes on other people .
How they do so varies ; that they do so is a permanent part of the human condition .
The shock at learning that the Russians really do want to know what is going on in the United States is , to say the least , overdone .
Let 's consider whether the Russian spies were amateurish .
During the 1920s and 1930s , the Soviets developed a unique model of espionage .
They would certainly recruit government officials or steal documents .
What they excelled at , however , was placing undetectable operatives in key positions .
Soviet talent scouts would range around left - wing meetings to discover potential recruits .
These would be young people with impeccable backgrounds and only limited contact with the left .
They would be recruited based on ideology , and less often via money , sex or blackmail .
They would never again be in contact with communists or fellow travelers .
They would apply for jobs in their countries ' intelligence services , foreign or defense ministries , and so on .
Given their family and academic backgrounds , they would be hired .
They would then be left in place for 20 or 30 years while they rose in the ranks — and , on occasion , aided with bits of information from the Soviet side to move their careers ahead .
The Soviets understood that a recruited employee might be a double agent .
But stealing information on an ad hoc basis was also risky , as the provenance of such material was always murky .
Recruiting people who were not yet agents , creating psychological and material bonds over long years of management and allowing them to mature into senior intelligence or ministry officials allowed ample time for testing loyalty and positioning .
The Soviets not only got more reliable information this way but also the ability to influence the other country 's decision - making .
Recruiting a young man in the 1930s , having him work with the OSS and later the CIA , and having him rise to the top levels of the CIA — had that ever happened — would thus give the Soviets information and control .
These operations took decades , and Soviet handlers would spend their entire careers managing one career .
There were four phases :
The longer the third phase took , the more effective the fourth phase would be .
It is difficult to know what the Russian team was up to in the United States from news reports , but there are two things we know aboutthe Russians :
They are not stupid , and they are extremely patient .
If we were to guess — and we are guessing — this was a team of talent scouts .
They were not going to meetings at the think tanks because they were interested in listening to the papers ; rather , they were searching for recruits .
These were people between the ages of 22 and 30 , doing internships or entry - level jobs , with family and academic backgrounds that would make employment in classified areas of the U.S. government easy — and who in 20 to 30 years would provide intelligence and control to Moscow .
In our view , the media may have conflated two of Moscow 's missions .
One of the Russian operatives , Don Heathfield , once approached a STRATFOR employee in a series of five meetings .
There appeared to be no goal of recruitment ; rather , the Russian operative tried to get the STRATFOR employee to try out software he said his company had developed .
We suspect that had this been done , our servers would be outputting to Moscow .
We did not know at the time who he was .
( We have since reported the incident to the FBI , but these folks were everywhere , and we were one among many . )
Thus , the group apparently included a man using software sales as cover — or as we suspect , as a way to intrude on computers .
As discussed , the group also included talent scouts .
We would guess that Anna Chapman was brought in as part of the recruitment phase of talent scouting .
No one at STRATFOR ever had a chance to meet her , having apparently failed the first screening .
Each of the phases of the operatives ' tasks required a tremendous amount of time , patience and , above all , cover .
The operatives had to blend in ( in this case , they did n't do so well enough ) .
Russians have always had a tremendous advantage over Americans in this regard .
A Russian long - term deployment took you to the United States , for example .
Were the Americans to try the same thing , they would have to convince people to spend years learning Russian to near - native perfection and then to spend 20 - 30 years of their lives in Russia .
Some would be willing to do so , but not nearly as many as there are Russians prepared to spend that amount of time in the United States or Western Europe .
The United States can thus recruit sources ( and sometimes it gets genuine ones ) .
It can buy documents .
But the extremely patient , long - term deployments are very difficult for it .
It does n't fit with U.S. career patterns or family expectations .
The United States has substituted technical intelligence for this process .
Thus , the most important U.S. intelligence - collection agency is notthe CIA ; it is the National Security Agency ( NSA ) .
The NSA focuses on intercepting communications , penetrating computer networks , encryption and the like .
( We will assume that they are successful at this . )
So whereas the Russians seek to control the career of a recruit through retirement , the NSA seeks access to everything that is recorded electronically .
The goal here is understanding capabilities and intentions .
To the extent that the target is unaware of the NSA 's capabilities , the NSA does well .
In many ways , this provides better and faster intelligence than the placement of agents , except that this does not provide influence .
In the end , both the U.S. and Russian models — indeed most intelligence models — are built on the core assumption that the more senior the individual , the more knowledge he and his staff have .
To put it more starkly , it assumes that what senior ( and other ) individuals say , write or even think reveals the most important things about the country in question .
Thus , controlling a senior government official or listening to his phone conversations or e-mails makes one privy to the actions that country will take — thus allowing one to tell the future .
Let 's consider two cases : Iran in 1979 and the Soviet Union from 1989 to 1991 .
The fall of the shah of Iran and the collapse of the Soviet empire were events of towering importance for the United States .
Assume that the United States knew everything the shah 's senior officials and their staffs knew , wrote , or said in the period leading up to the Iranian Revolution .
Or assume that the shah 's prime minister or a member of the Soviet Union 's Politburo was a long - term mole .
Either of those scenarios would not have made any difference to how events played out .
This is because , in the end , the respective senior leadership did n't know how events were going to play out .
Partly this is because they were in denial , but mostly this is because they did n't have the facts and they did n't interpret the facts they did have properly .
At these critical turning points in history , the most thorough penetration using either American or Russian techniques would havefailed to provide warning of the change ahead .
This is because the basic premise of the intelligence operation was wrong .
The people being spied on and penetrated simply did n't understand their own capabilities — i.e. , the reality on the ground in their respective countries — and therefore their intentions about what to do were irrelevant and actually misleading .
In saying this , we must be very cautious , since obviously there are many instances in which targets of intelligence agencies do have valuable information and their decisions do actually represent what will happen .
But if we regard anticipating systemic changes as one of the most important categories of intelligence , then these are cases where the targets of intelligence may well know the least and know it last .
The Japanese knew they were going to hit Pearl Harbor , and having intelligence on that fact was enormously important .
But that the British would collapse at Singapore was a fact not known to the British , so there would have been no way to obtain that information in advance from the British .
We started with three classes of intelligence : capabilities , intentions and what will actually happen .
The first is an objective measure that can sometimes be seen directly but more frequently is obtained through data held by someone in the target country .
The most important issue is not what this data says but how accurate it is .
Intentions , by contrast , represent the subjective plans of decision - makers .
History is filled with intentions that were never implemented , or that , when implemented , had wildly different outcomes than the decision - maker expected .
From our point of view , the most important aspect of this category is the potential for unintended consequences .
For example , George W. Bush did not intend to get bogged down in aguerrilla war in Iraq .
What he intended and what happened were two different things because his view of American and Iraqi capabilities were not tied to reality .
American and Russian intelligence is source - based .
There is value in sources , but they need to be taken with many grains of salt , not because they necessarily lie but because the highest - placed source may simply be wrong — and at times , an entire government can be wrong .
If the purpose of intelligence is to predict what will happen , and it is source - based , then that assumes that the sources know what is going on and how it will play out .
But often they do n't .
Russian and American intelligence agencies are both source - obsessed .
On the surface , this is reasonable and essential .
But it assumes something about sources that is frequently true , but not always — and in fact is true only with great infrequency on the most important issues .
From our point of view , the purpose of intelligence is obvious :
It is to collect as much information as possible , and surely from the most highly placed sources .
But in the end , the most important question to ask is whether the most highly placed source has any clue as to what is going to happen .
Knowledge of what is being thought is essential .
But gaming out how the objective and impersonal forces will interact and play out it is the most important thing of all .
The focus on sources allows the universe of intelligence to be populated by the thoughts of the target .
Sometimes that is of enormous value .
But sometimes the most highly placed source has no idea what is about to happen .
Sometimes it is necessary to listen to the tape of Gorbachev or Bush planning the future and recognize that what they think will happen and what is about to happen are very different things .
The events of the past few weeks show intelligence doing the necessary work of recruiting and rescuing agents .
The measure of all of this activity is not whether one has penetrated the other side , but in the end , whether your intelligence organization knew what was going to happen and told you regardless of what well - placed sources believed .
Sometimes sources are indispensable .
Sometimes they are misleading .
And sometimes they are the way an intelligence organization justifies being wrong .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Google removed two free applications from Android phones this week , using a feature that allows them to delete the applications from phones remotely .
Google has not revealed the names of the applications but said they were applications built for research purposes by a security researcher .
The researcher voluntarily removed the applications from Android Market , which led Google to decide to use their remote application removal feature to complete the cleanup by removing copies already installed on phones .
The applications were removed because they violated the Android Market terms and intentionally misrepresented their purpose to encourage user downloads .
The applications posed no threat , there was no malicious intent in their design , and they had no permission to access private information .
Google said most users uninstalled the applications soon after they downloaded them because they were “ practically useless ” .
The technologies required to remove installed applications from phones remotely were developed in case a malicious application did pose a threat , and provide what Google describes as a “ powerful security advantage ” to protect Android users .
Users receive notification via their phone applications have been remotely removed .
According to a filing with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission last year Google has removed around one percent of applications uploaded to the Android Market because of failure to comply with the terms and conditions .
A Google spokesman said the company disclosed the most recent removals to highlight a security feature of the Android phones , and said it can and will rapidly disable malicious applications to protect users , and this capability has been described in the Market terms of service since the Android phone was launched .
Google also pointed out that users control whether or not applications have access to their personal data because they must give permission before downloading the applications .
Security is also maintained because developers must go through billing background checks to confirm their identities before they can upload applications to the Android Market .

POLICE have dug up over one million dollars ' worth of cocaine believed to be part of a huge shipment dumped off a central Philippine island by a South American cartel .
Agents recovered almost 20kg of cocaine in different areas of Samar island on Saturday following a tip - off by a fisherman , said Antonio Villar , who heads a government anti-smuggling task force .
The cocaine , kept in 17 individual packs , was valued at 76 million pesos ( $ 1.95 million ) and is said to be part of a cache that was dumped off the waters of Samar this year , Villar said in a statement .
More than 200kg of sealed bricks of cocaine had already washed up on the beaches of Samar , the Philippines ' third biggest island , earlier this year , authorities said previously .
Government officials earlier said that some of the cocaine had been confiscated from fishermen who had tried to sell them to criminal syndicates .
An unknown drug cartel , believed to be from South America , was reportedly shipping the cocaine to Hong Kong early this year but dumped the drugs into the sea due to fears they were under surveillance .
The Philippines is considered a major hub for illegal drugs in Southeast Asia , with crime syndicates known to corrupt politicians by funding their campaigns .

Microsoft should abandon or entirely reboot its mobile strategy because its latest product is barely as good as the iPhone from 2007 on the present developer offer
The as - yet unreleased Windows Phone 7 is a " waste of time and money " , a " disaster " that Microsoft should kill as soon as possible .
So says Galen Gruman of Infoworld , who has watched an in - depth demonstration of the new phone software at Microsoft 's Worldwide Partners Conference which has been going on all week at the company 's headquarters in Redmond , Washington .
Windows
Phone uses a " contact - centric " approach , where rather than doing " tasks " ( in the iPhone app way ) , you are presented generally with contacts , and informed when someone has done something ( updated their Facebook / Twitter feed , called you , etc ) .
My personal first impression of the screenshots was " that 's really not going to scale to the point where you have 300 people in your contacts book and 20 Facebook friends and 50 emails and 100 people you follow on Twitter and 30 apps " , but I thought that was just me not following the thinking behind it .
But it looks like I may have been right .
Gruman started the year being impressed with early demos of Windows Phone 7 - but that 's worn off in a big way .
" Announced to much bravado in February as the platform that would breathe life into Microsoft 's mobile ambitions , Windows Phone 7 looked based on very early previews as if it might bring something new and exciting to the table .
Back then , I noted that I was impressed by what I saw -- with the caveat " so far . "
" No caveats now : Windows Phone 7 is a waste of time and money .
It 's a platform that no carrier , device maker , developer , or user should bother with .
Microsoft should kill it before it ships and admit that it 's out of the mobile game for good .
It is supposed to ship around Christmas 2010 , but anyone who gets one will prefer a lump of coal .
I really mean that . "
Ouch .
What 's happened , Galen ?
" The early demos were intriguing due to the use of the card metaphor to organize apps and information , providing a possible fluidity among apps and information that would let users swim through their business and social activities .
And the distinct UI -- though based on the unsuccessful Zune media player -- looked as if it would stand out from the crowd of mobile devices that have largely copied the iPhone UI , such as Google 's Android , RIM 's touch - oriented BlackBerry Storm , and Palm's WebOS . "
Hmm .
" But that was just the lipstick .
Now , in Microsoft 's in - depth demo this week at the Mobile Beat conference , there 's no mistaking the big pig behind the gloss .
Seeing the UI in action across several tasks , not just in a highly controlled presentation , shows how awkward and unsophisticated it is -- I had the same feeling you get when you got a movie based on a great trailer , only to discover that all the good stuff was in the trailer and the rest of the movie was a mess .
A pig , in fact . "
There 's plenty more ; it 's worth reading in depth .
Gruman says that as well as resting on old technology , Windows Phone 7 is simply outdated :
" The bottom line is this : Windows Phone 7 is a pale imitation of the 2007 - era iPhone .
It 's as if Microsoft decided in summer 2007 to copy the iPhone and has shut its developers in a bunker ever since , so they do n't realize that several years have passed , that the iPhone has advanced , and that competitors such as Google Android and Palm WebOS have also pushed the needle forward .
Microsoft is stuck in 2007 , with a smartphone OS whose feature checklist might match that era's iPhone but whose fit and finish would look like a Pinto next to a Maserati . "
Gruman went along to a presentation at WPC ( which has been generally described as " lacklustre " - and certainly seems to have been much smaller than in previous years by all accounts ) and was worried by what seemed like poor responses to the handful of outside developers who had come along .
Arguably , WPC is not the place where you 're going to find the hottest WP7 developers ; it 's more about geeing up the people who will resell Microsoft products .
But the fact that only a few months short of the grand launch of WP7 it can't wow even developers for the platform sounds bad .
Gruman 's description of the presentation makes it sound like one of those uncomfortable events where the tumbleweed was always at risk of rolling past .
And as for the " locked in a bunker since 2007 " jibe - do n't forget the Kin , which seems to have been the victim of political infighting at Microsoft , as the incoming developer team from Danger ( which Microsoft bought to produce the Kin ) found themselves mired in layers of management that effectively brought them to a dead stop .
Read the full horror of it at the Mini-Microsoft blog ( by a disaffected Microsoft manager , but the comments are from ex-Danger staff and others ) .
Back to Gruman , who points to the flaws with the " tiles " method :
" ... the big tiles quickly eat up screen real estate ( about four fit ) , so you do n't get the compact access to apps that all the other major mobile operating systems provide .
I bet this will depress app sales for those poor souls unlucky enough to get seduced by the Microsoft brand or the inevitable discounts at the cellular stores as the carriers try to dump these devices in January 2011 for $ 25 ( shades of the unlamented Kin ) .
" Plus , Microsoft has done its usual trick of gumming up the UI , even though this one is relatively simple .
There are two ways to navigate through tiles : in panorama mode and in pivot mode .
In both cases , the tile continues to the right , and you swipe to see more .
In panorama mode , cut - off text on the right indicates there 's more ( at Mobile Beat , a developer asked if users knew what that cut - off text was for , and the Microsoft rep essentially admitted they did n't get it was a way to say " more " ) .
In pivot mode , each tile is self - contained , and there is an icon to indicate there is more .
It 's a subtle difference : Using a panorama basically means the tile continues because it wo n't fit on screen , while using a pivot means you have a series of what are essentially pages .
I bet developers and users will get confused very fast .
" Visions of Vista 's litter of control panel dialog boxes , Microsoft Bob , the Office ribbon , Clippy , and Windows 3 flew through my head -- not that Windows Phone 7 looks like any of these ; it just shares the same flaw of being obtuse . "
And that 's only for starters .
Other complaints : the browser , IE7 with a bit of IE8 , does n't support HTML5 ; there 's no multitasking except for Microsoft 's own apps ( Android and , now , the iPhone both support cooperative multitasking by all apps ) ; there does n't seem to be interapplication communication for third - party apps ; there 's no copy - and - paste ( emphasis added ) - even though Apple was roundly and rightly criticised for not introducing it until summer 2009 , and Windows Mobile 6.1 did have it .
Gruman says there 's going to be no come - from - behind take - over - the - world for Microsoft if this does n't succeed : RIM ( prepping BlackBerry 6 ) , Android , Apple and Nokia will all eat its lunch and dance on its grave .
At this point , people usually begin an ad - hominem , to ask whether Gruman is biased or ( sigh ) in the pay of company X or Y. Judge for yourself from the Infoworld author bio and item list .
Meanwhile , if anyone else has had a hands - on with Windows Phone 7 - via the developer kit or other methods - we 'd love to hear about it .
Good ?
Bad ?
Indifferent ?
What 's it really like ?
Daniel Sadek played Orange County ’s subprime lending boom like a card shark dealt the ace and jack of spades .
Just five years ago he was selling cars .
Then , in January 2002 , he anted up $ 250 for a state lender license and started selling home loans through his company , Quick Loan Funding .
Over the next five years , Quick Loan wrote $ 3.8 billion in mortgages , lending money fast – and often on onerous terms – to people with shaky credit .
Boosted by high fees and interest rates – high even for the subprime industry – Quick Loan ’s after - tax profits averaged 29 percent of revenue .
In 2005 , Quick Loan ’s biggest year , profit topped $ 37 million .
Sadek used the earnings to live the high life , buying a fleet of Ferraris , Lamborghinis and Porsches , dating a soap opera starlet and producing movies .
He flew private jets to Las Vegas , where he gambled with high rollers at the Bellagio Resort .
He cultivated a rebel image , wearing a beard and hair to his shoulders , dressing in T - shirts and flip - flops , eschewing the typical mortgage banker ’s pinstripes .
“ How many thieves are wearing a suit ? ” he asks , sitting in the kitchen of his $ 4 million Newport Coast mansion .
Quick Loan Funding ’s name still crowns a Costa Mesa office tower .
But Sadek , like the subprime lending industry , is holding a bad hand .
His staff , once 700 strong , has shriveled to about 125 .
Monthly loan volume plunged to $ 30 million from a record $ 218 million in December 2005 .
“ I ’ve sold all my cars to keep the company going , ” says Sadek , 38 .
“ Every property I own is mortgaged to the max . ”
Sadek is more than a poster child for the riches produced in the Orange County - centered subprime industry .
His career arc shows how :
In California , almost anyone could open a lending business .
It ’s harder to get a barber ’s license .
Subprime lenders reaped billions in profits by charging high fees and interest rates .
For the most part , these practices are legal .
Borrowers often either misunderstood , were misinformed or simply paid no attention to the loan terms .
Thousands would lose their homes .
State oversight is almost non-existent , with 58 examiners to oversee 5,000 lenders , some doing billions in business .
Quick Loan has been accused of predatory lending , deceptive underwriting and fraud in at least eight lawsuits .
In addition , Department of Corporations records show 33 complaints against Quick Loan , most alleging unfair business practices .
Most of the lawsuits were settled out of court .
And state regulators have never disciplined Quick Loan .
Sadek denies that Quick Loan ever broke the law or engaged in unfair business practices .
“ I work very hard to do the best I can , to keep the mortgage company as clean as possible , ” he says .
“ Simple as that .
I ca n’t say it to you any better . ”
Truth in lending
Roman and Maria Partida of National City won a $ 28,696 settlement last November after they sued Quick Loan for understating the interest rate on a $ 150,000 mortgage .
They received notice of the higher rate 16 months after they signed the loan agreement .
“ I ca n’t compare them to others in the business , but I know in my clients ’ case it was an open - and - shut case of violation of the Truth in Lending Act , ” says the Partidas ’ attorney , Matthew Powell .
Dinora Nava -Oleson of Yucaipa learned about Quick Loan through a late night TV infomercial in the summer of 2005 .
At the time she was desperate to refinance $ 524,000 in debt .
Quick Loan ’s slogan was “ You ca n’t wait .
We wo n’t let you . ”
Within days of her call to the company , Nava - Oleson was offered a $ 530,000 loan to consolidate all her debts and refinancing costs .
The papers she signed in September 2005 raised her total mortgage to $ 543,000 , the total boosted by loan fees and a 9.75 percent interest rate .
The rate was fixed for 30 years .
Monthly payments were $ 4,678.45 .
“ My attitude was just get me out of my mess and I ’ll deal with the rest later , ” Nava - Oleson says .
“ I admit I ’m partially to blame .
But at the same time I do n’t believe people should be taken advantage of . ”
Nava -Oleson , who recently started working as a mortgage account executive , believes that given her credit score she could get the same loan today for a 6.75 percent interest rate .
That would slash her monthly payments by almost one - third .
Nava - Oleson sued Quick Loan for predatory lending last year .
The lawsuit alleged Quick Loan double - billed Nava - Oleson for a $ 475 appraisal and questions $ 1,500 in other charges .
Sadek says it was not the company ’s practice to pad fees or jack up interest rates .
Nava - Oleson settled the case to avoid foreclosure on her home , after working out a deal with two companies that had assumed Quick Loan ’s mortgage .
Quick Loan was not a party to the settlement .
Subprime lenders typically charge 2.75 percentage points above the prime rate , says Michael Lacour - Little , a professor of finance at Cal State Fullerton who has researched lending practices .
At the time of her refinancing , Nava - Oleson ’s loan was 4 percentage points above prime .
A Register analysis of federal mortgage data shows Quick Loan ’s median interest rate was about 5 to 6 percentage points above prime in 2005 .
The average for the subprime industry was 4 to 5 percentage points above prime .
In 2005 , Quick Loan was the 49 {+t} {+h} - largest subprime lender in the nation , according to Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data , charging “ high rate ” interest for 94.6 percent of its loans .
High rate loans are 3 percentage points above prime for first - lien mortgages .
Only two other lenders relied more heavily on high - rate loans – Finance America LLC , an Irvine company owned by Lehman Brothers , and Brea - based ResMAE Mortgage Corp. , which filed for bankruptcy in February .
Financial statements filed with the Department of Corporations show Quick Loan ’s revenue in 2004 was 7 percent of its loan originations .
Its revenue in 2005 was 6 percent of originations .
There were two sources for that revenue :
Fees for processing loans and interest rate spreads – the gap between what Quick Loan charges borrowers and what it costs to raise money for loans through Wall Street securities .
Jeff Lazerson of Laguna Niguel , president of MortgageGrader.com , a company that evaluates mortgages online , says Quick Loan ’s revenues “ seem eye popping .
Mortgage profits are always at the consumer ’s expense . ”
No cop on the beat
Nava - Oleson ’s mortgage included a prepayment penalty – six months of interest , or more than $ 28,000 – if she refinanced within two years .
She will keep paying the loan until August .
Prepayment penalties are banned in 10 states , according to the Center for Responsible Lending .
They ’re legal in California .
That ’s one of several reasons companies like Quick Loan thrive here .
Another reason is the lack of oversight .
The state Department of Corporations employs 58 examiners to oversee about 5,000 licensed lenders and brokers in California .
In 2005 and 2006 , the department filed only 11 enforcement actions for lending violations , typically after another agency , such as the state attorney general , had already acted .
Department of Corporations records list 33 complaints against Quick Loan since 2002 , 24 of them alleging fraud , underwriting errors or other unfair business practices .
Mark Leyes , spokesman for the Department of Corporations , says no action was taken against Quick Loan because the number of complaints is relatively small – less than 1 percent of its loans .
He says enforcement action will occur if a company repeatedly violates the law or the violation is egregious and the company does not make refunds or corrections required .
Leyes notes that last week ’s budget proposal by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger would add 25 people to the department ’s oversight staff .
He also says the department is sponsoring a bill that would give it authority to suspend or bar licenses if a lender loses a criminal or civil judgment , a power consumer groups complain the department lacks .
“ They have not been the cop on the beat , ” says Paul Leonard , director of the California office of the Center for Responsible Lending .
They have not been much of a gatekeeper , either .
To obtain his lending license , Sadek completed an application , passed a criminal background check and posted a $ 25,000 surety bond .
There is no required training or degree ; no exam .
Barbers need 1,500 hours of training to get a state license .
“ The barriers to entry are rather low , ” Leyes concedes .
Skin in the game
Quick Loan targeted customers who needed cash – fast – to refinance , consolidate debt or use their home equity as a piggy bank .
Ads on billboards and TV informercials offered money on easy terms : “ No income verification .
Instant qualification !! ” said one Quick Loan ad offering 1 percent financing .
Monthly payments on $ 1 million for qualified borrowers would be as low as $ 3,216.40 , the ad said .
“ Prior bankruptcy .
Tax Liens . Foreclosures .
Collections and Credit Problems . OK ! ”
Like most subprime lenders , Quick Loan financed loans based on stated income , known in the industry as “ liar loans . ”
The rates were typically adjustable , and could notch up 3 percentage points after two years , driving many borrowers to default if they could n’t refinance .
“ He did some of the nastiest , dirtiest loans out there , loans other companies would n’t touch , ” says Lou Pacific , a Mission Viejo Realtor and former vice president of Quick Loan ’s real estate division .
“ But he had a lower default rate . ”
Sadek says he had lower losses than other subprime lenders because he avoided 100 - percent financing and focused on refinancing , not purchase loans .
“ I want the borrowers to have skin in the game , ” he says .
“ If I ’m maxed out on my house and I have no equity left , what ’s the easiest way to go ?
Walk out . ”
At Quick Loan , Sadek set the pace for hard work and salesmanship .
“ At sales and executive meetings , he ’d have calls routed through and answer them to show the loan officers how it ’s done , ” Pacific says .
“ He would n’t stop asking questions until he got what he wanted .
What ’s your Social Security number ?
Do you want an appraisal ?
He would n’t let the guy hang up until he said yes . ”
Some ex-employees accuse Quick Loan of pressuring or misleading borrowers .
Mai -Hanh Tran , who worked as a senior loan funder , alleged in an Orange County Superior Court suit that she was fired in January 2005 in part because she complained about “ a pattern of unlawful and deceptive practices by QLF employees and agents , ” including forging borrowers ’ signatures on loan documents and violating truth in lending laws by under - disclosing fees .
Quick Loan countered that Tran was fired for chronic tardiness and failing to meet loan quotas .
Tran ’s suit was dismissed last year after a confidential settlement .
In another suit pending in Orange County Superior Court , Tabatha Owens of Temecula alleges she was fired as Quick Loan ’s director of training after she attempted to get the company to comply with industry disclosure and truth - in - lending laws .
The suit says managers told employees to ignore her , when Owens attempted to stop loan officers from fabricating borrowers ’ incomes and “ bullying , lying to or harassing consumers . ”
Sadek says people sued because they saw a deep pocket , because they were jealous of his success and because they are prejudiced against him because he ’s from the Middle East .
He says if he had broken any laws , someone in the state would have taken action .
As evidence of his company ’s fair practices , Sadek cites its “ BBB ” rating from the Better Business Bureau , a rating for companies that “ would not have a significant number of complaints or other considerations that could pose a problem to consumers . ”
‘ Risk everything .
Fear nothing .’
Sadek is , in many ways , a classic immigrant success story .
He was born in Tripoli , Lebanon , in July 1968 , the son of a construction manager who worked overseas .
When Lebanon ’s civil war broke out in the 1970s , Sadek got caught in the crossfire .
Sadek says he stopped attending school after third grade .
He points to a white scar on his right forearm that he says was from a gunshot wound when he was 9 .
He points to a bump behind his ear , a piece of metal from another wound he suffered at age 12 .
He says he has no idea who shot him .
“ Unfortunately , wars traumatize people , ” he says .
“ They also make people , in some ways , stronger . ”
In 1987 , at age 18 , he followed an older brother to California .
Speaking only a few words of English , he landed a job at a gas station in Cypress .
“ I believe if you want to do something , America ’s got the tools and the opportunities to do it , ” he says .
Friends said he got the idea of going into lending after selling so many Mercedes - Benz at Fletcher Jones Motorcars to customers in the mortgage business .
Sadek says he got the idea when he bought his first home in 2001 ; a friend who brokered his loan pocketed thousands of dollars in fees for a few hours ’ work .
“ It ’s the least expensive way to own your own business , ” Sadek says .
“ It does n’t require a lot of capital . ”
Even so , it took more money than he first had .
“ I had to go to Vegas once to make payroll , ” he says .
“ I put a $ 5,000 chip on a blackjack table and I came home with the money I needed . ”
Quick Loan soon became a cash cow .
In its Department of Corporations filings , Quick Loan reported net profits of $ 1 million in 2002 , $ 5.8 million in 2003 , $ 20 million in 2004 , $ 37.4 million in 2005 and $ 15.8 million in 2006 – a total $ 80 million in five years
Sadek shared the wealth – supporting an employee diagnosed with cancer , giving jobs to friends of friends , donating to AIDS charities .
He threw office parties at Tentation Ultra Lounge , a Newport Beach night club he co-owned , paying for everyone to ride home in a taxi .
He also lavished money on his cars and gambling .
On one November 2005 trip , bank records show , he signed three markers at the Bellagio for a total $ 1 million .
“ It ’s my personal money , ” Sadek says .
“ There ’s only one owner of the company .
It ’s me .
So , I ’m not gambling your money .
I ’m not gambling the public money . ”
Perhaps his greatest extravagance was “ Redline , ” a movie Sadek wrote , produced and bankrolled about ultra-rich people betting on illegal road races .
( Read “ Behind the wheel of ‘ Redline ’ “ ) Its ad slogan was “ Risk everything .
Fear nothing . ”
Sadek says “ Redline ” cost $ 17 million to shoot and $ 16 million to market and distribute .
It starred comedian Eddie Griffin , whose biggest previous role was the lead in “ Undercover Brother , ” and Sadek ’s former fiancé¥ ¬ Nadia Bjorlin , who played Chloe Lane on the TV soap opera , “ Days of Our Lives . ”
For one “ Redline ” scene , Sadek crashed and destroyed his $ 575,000 Porsche Carrera GT .
During a March publicity event at the Irwindale Speedway , Griffin wrecked Sadek ’s $ 1.3 million Ferrari Enzo .
( Read “ Griffin uninjured after crashing Ferrari “ )
Critics panned “ Redline . ”
The Boston Globe called it “ an action flick loaded with cars , chrome , and silicone ?
everything you ’d expect it to be , and yet so much less : less character development , less believability , and most unforgivably , less escapist entertainment . ”
The $ 33 million movie grossed $ 3.8 million on opening weekend and soon vanished from theaters .
“ Redline ” premiered as layoffs , asset sales and bankruptcy filings soared in the subprime industry – a fate that threatens Quick Loan , too .
Sadek says Quick Loan had to buy back $ 29 million in loans that defaulted in the first two months .
That ’s a number that ’s likely to grow .
Today he is $ 16 million in debt , he says .
Sadek says he raised $ 13 million for Quick Loan by selling his cars and refinancing his Newport Coast mansion , an Irvine penthouse and a Las Vegas condo .
He believes the company is a good bet .
“ Tough times do n’t last , ” he says .
“ Tough people do . ”

Colorado gubernatorial candidate Scott McInnis has apologized for lifting pages and pages of material for a series of essays he wrote , comically titled " Musings on Water , " from a judge 's work 20 years earlier .
He 's in trouble !
McInnis was a member of Congress until 2004 and then took a two - year fellowship with the Hasan Family Foundation , for which he wrote the very philosophical " Musings on Water " essays .
" Whole sections " of the essays about " the history of Colorado water rights " were lifted straight from a judge 's 1984 account , because why not ?
Oh right , ethics .
Totaling 150 pages over 23 installments , the articles discussing state water policy are devoid of footnotes , endnotes or other forms of attribution .
In at least four of those articles , McInnis ' work mirrors Hobbs ' 1984 essay published by the Colorado Water Congress , " Green Mountain Reservoir : Lock or Key ? "
In one of his installments of the musings , titled " Pumpbacks and Roundtables , " McInnis uses four full pages that are nearly reprinted verbatim from Hobbs ' earlier work .
The Hasan Family Foundation paid McInnis $ 300,000 for this stuff .
They want their money back .

When drug dealers get ripped off , they can't call police but they can hire a Houston crew of thugs to even the score .
That 's the contention of federal agents , who Tuesday night arrested a four - person team whose leader supposedly said they were willing to kill , torture or pistol - whip guards at a rival dealer 's house to steal a load of cocaine .
The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives charges in an affidavit filed in federal court that the crew was led by Chris Montelongo , a hefty repeat felon who describes himself as an experienced home invader with plenty of jobs under his belt .
The team was caught on the way to what the ATF says was a faux attack in Houston set up by agents ,
They were charged not with plotting an assault , but conspiracy to possess cocaine , about $ 90,000 worth , to pay for the job of getting back a load worth about $ 500,000 .
Their tools were n't battering rams and machine guns , but handguns , ski masks , gloves and zip ties , according to the ATF affidavit , filed by agent Tommy Doyle .
The scheme seemed typical of attack squads in which victims are criminals and hesitant to call law enforcement .
Doors are kicked in and homes are torn apart as invaders search for drugs , bulk cash or other hidden wealth , said Don Clark , a retired FBI agent who headed the agency 's Houston and San Antonio offices and is now a consultant .
" It is all about them getting the goods and stealing , " he said .
Torture and murder is not unusual , according to past cases .
" It is not uncommon , even with the organized crime mob , " Clark said .
" If a particular mobster has done something that has ticked the rest of the mob off , they are going to go after him . "
2006 incident
In Houston , there have been numerous attacks linked to gangs and drug cartels .
One of the more infamous incidents came in 2006 , when four gunmen attacked a Houston home .
The resident , who had a long criminal history , shot one , injured another and sent the survivors scurrying .
He was not charged with a crime , as authorities ruled he acted in self defense .
The others arrested Tuesday along with Montelongo were Johnny Hernandez ; Mark Diaz ; and Alfredo Garcia Jr , according to the ATF .
Ages and hometowns were not immediately available .
To snare them , an ATF undercover agent posed as a disgruntled drug courier who was part of an organized crime network .
He wanted to hire the team to steal a load .
Undercover agent
They first met at a Houston restaurant and used face - to - face talks , cell phone conversations and text messages to seal the deal , according to the affidavit .
Stealing drugs from drug traffickers required planning and expertise the revenge squad told an undercover agent , according to the ATF .
They needed a diagram of the stash house as well as to know about any counter surveillance there and how many guards would be in place , according to the affidavit .
A member assured the undercover agent posing as the courier that he'd be safe during the rip - off because harming him would hurt their reputation , the document continues .

The Republican Party is enjoying a burst of raw enthusiasm among rank - and - file conservatives that has shot some relatively little - known candidates straight into the national spotlight — stirring concern among party leaders about how well some of them will fare with the broader electorate in November .
In North Carolina , national party officials make no secret of their displeasure at the possibility of the GOP banner being carried by a “ tea - party " - backed candidate with an apparent history of religious zealotry and drug use .
In divorce records , the man ’s ex-wife said he planned to raise his stepfather from the dead in New Jersey .
In South Carolina , the tea party favorite for governor is trying to bat down accusations of infidelity .
In Nevada , a leading conservative contender is facing questions about her ties to the Church of Scientology .
And the newest hero of the tea party movement , Rand Paul , who won the GOP Senate primary in Kentucky , startled more - mainstream Republicans by questioning part of the historic 1964 Civil Rights
Act that allowed the government to force lunch counters to desegregate .
Of these disparate candidates , some are truly outsiders ; others are fairly experienced politicians getting their first real shot in the searing spotlight of national politics .
And though their potential problems are quite different , they have at least two things in common :
They have not undergone the testing and vetting that candidates traditionally face .
And they are making some Republicans nervous about whether they will be able to beat their Democratic opponents in the fall .
“ Nonpoliticians are being given an increased level of credibility , ” said Nathan Gonzales , political editor for the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report .
“ A consequence of not being a politician is never having been a candidate before , never being in the spotlight and never facing the media . ”
To be sure , plenty of candidates backed by the movement have political experience and broad appeal , perhaps most notably Marco Rubio , the Senate candidate and former speaker of the state House of Representatives in Florida who pushed Gov. Charlie Crist from the Republican primary .
Crist is now running as an independent .
Some in the movement also have shown a pragmatic streak , particularly in aligning themselves behind moderate Sen. Scott Brown in Massachusetts .
But the tea party movement has not yet elected one of its own in a general election for federal office , so it ’s unclear how strongly its candidates will appeal beyond the party ’s base .
“ This is n’t a college debate about who made the best points , ” said Republican strategist David Winston , who has seen tea party candidates rising as they focus their arguments on deficit spending and federal overreach .
“ If they ’re going to win races , they have to prove they can build a coalition . ”
In most districts , that means attracting independent voters .
And polls show that the swing of independents toward the GOP has created the party ’s widespread optimism about taking control of the House .
But it has also made some question the political viability of the tea party ’s small - government rhetoric , heated critiques of the administration and uncompromising stance on immigration .
In at least a few cases , movement enthusiasm has embraced candidates with personal and other problems that may make them unacceptable to voters in November .
The clash between primary and general election rhetoric went national recently , when Paul publicly questioned the federal government ’s role in ending racial segregation in private businesses .
Paul ’s comments were in line with his libertarian views , but made little political sense to many Republican strategists .
Paul later said he would have voted for the legislation .
In Nevada , Democrats are casting former Assemblywoman Sharron Angle as another Paul .
Angle , who has been endorsed by a national tea party group , has been surging in the Republican Senate primary , where a lineup of candidates is vying to take on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
Last week , the Las Vegas Sun found her campaign removing from her website references to famous Scientologists after it emerged that she once pushed for a prison rehabilitation program , modeled on the teachings of church founder L. Ron Hubbard , that aimed to treat drug addiction with saunas , massages , organic foods and a vitamin regimen .
Angle ’s campaign said the timing was a coincidence .
Her opponent , Sue Lowden , has jumped on the Scientology controversy in a campaign ad showing prisoners in orange jumpsuits receiving spa treatments .
A framed picture of actor and Scientologist Tom Cruise sits nearby .
Polls show Angle leading Lowden , the GOP establishment ’s preferred candidate , who has had her own troubles with holding unusual positions on political issues .
Lowden drew a wave of criticism and poultry puns when she spoke nostalgically about a time when people bartered with chickens for healthcare .
Reid allies are rooting for an Angle win — and that has become Lowden ’s primary message .
“ If Sharron Angle wins , you will hear the champagne corks popping in Reid ’s office all the way in Nevada , ” said Lowden campaign manager Robert Uithoven .
While national Republicans have avoided meddling publicly in Nevada , they have n’t shown the same restraint in North Carolina ’s 8th Congressional District .
Party officials spoke out against political newcomer Tim D’Annunzio , who has fought his way through a Republican primary and is now in a runoff with the Republican establishment candidate .
After sitting on the sidelines as D’Annunzio attracted tea party support and spent $ 1 million of his own money , the party felt it could no longer be quiet about his history .
Divorce papers show that D’Annunzio ’s ex-wife said he was delusional and since a religious conversion believed he was the Messiah .
The 15 - year - old records also show a history of drug use .
D’Annunzio has acknowledged drug use in his past and has described himself as reformed .
“ What we have in this runoff is two conservatives , and one of them is a well - liked former sportscaster and the other one is a guy with a very troubling criminal background that the Democrats would be all too happy to exploit in the fall , ” said Andy Sere , spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee .
Careful not to offend the candidate ’s supporters , he added , “ I think we ’ve been clear from the outset that our issue has everything to do with electability and nothing to do with ideology . ”
A handful of tea party leaders in the district have since distanced themselves from D’Annunzio ’s campaign .
In South Carolina , tea party groups appear to be sticking by Nikki Haley , who is embroiled in a far more familiar political scandal .
A blogger and former political aide to Gov. Mark Sanford said last week that he ’d had an affair with the married state lawmaker .
Haley denies it , as well as a second allegation from a lobbyist .
Her strongest backers have defended her .
“ The establishment is very scared and is known for dirty tricks .
This is a way to bring her down .
I do n’t believe it , ” said Colen Lindell , founder of the Aiken County Tea Party , who then acknowledged he worried that the allegation might doom Haley if she becomes the nominee .
“ I would much rather have a Republican in office than not , ” he said .

Early next year , Yahoo !
intends to open source its internal " cloud serving " platform , described as something halfway between Amazon 's Elastic Compute Cloud and Google 's App Engine .
Known simply as " Cloud " within the company , the platform is that piece of Yahoo !
infrastructure that serves up its online applications .
In short , it provides the company 's internal developers with on - demand access to computing resources .
But rather than offering raw virtual machines as Amazon EC2 does , it spins up " containers " of server power that are pre-configured for things like load - balancing and security .
That way , developers need n't handle the load - balancing on their own .
Google App Engine also handles this sort of nitty - gritty on behalf of the developer , but it goes much further .
It hides even more of the underlying infrastructure , and it puts tight restrictions on the design of applications so they 'll conform with this infrastructure .
It restricts what languages you use .
It limits the libraries you can choose from .
It even prevents you from making system requests that take more than 30 seconds or return more than 10 MB of data .
With its " Cloud , " Yahoo !
abstracts some of the infrastructure , but it also lets you develop with all those standard LAMP stack tools you 're used to .

The company says its current plan is to open source the platform early in 2011 .
And eventually , it will open source all its back - end platforms .
The company already uses the open source Hadoop for distributed number crunching - this is used to build its search webmap , among so many other tasks - and last June , it released its very own Hadoop distro .
Then , in November , it released its Traffic Server , which handles edge caching , edge processing , and load balancing , while also managing traffic on the company 's storage and server - virtualization services .
At some point , it will also open source its storage platform and its data pipeline .
All of which makes Yahoo !
quite different from Google , which likes to keep its custom - built back - end platforms to itself .
That said , Google has published papers describing its GFS distributed file system and MapReduce distributed number cruncher , and these became the basis for Hadoop .
Since then , however , the company has developed a new file system known at least informally as GFS2 , and this will eventually be rolled out as part of the company 's " Caffeine " search infrastructure .
Amazon 's EC2 is also closed , but using its APIs the open source Eucalyptus project has mimicked its setup for those looking to operate their own internal clouds .

Penguin United will soon be launching a new product known as “ Eagle - Eye ” which will allow PS3 owners to seamlessly use standard keyboard and mouse for playing fps games with the same accuracy and dexterity as enjoyed by PC gamers .
Many console gamers might argue otherwise but this seems like a welcome alternative for PC gamers looking to get some action on console exclusive games with familiar controls for a few extra bucks .
Check out the demonstration video below
Richard Huang , President of Penguin United said ,
One of the drawbacks with playing first - person shooters is the lack of speed and accuracy offered by traditional controllers .
We found a simple solution by bypassing the controller and transferring the button features directly to the computer keyboard and mouse .
The Eagle - Eye offers an amazing alternative for fans of shooting games .
One of the most impressive features about the Eagle - Eye is the accuracy and effectiveness converted to the computer mouse , with a 1 to 1 translation from a PS3 controller to the mouse .
Product Highlights :
+ Converts any standard USB HID Keyboard and Mouse into a PS3 Controller
+ Adjust Mouse sensitivity through the game ’s option menu .
+ 1 to 1 translation from the PS3 right analog stick to the mouse movement for an ultra accurate aim in FPS .

The “ Heavy ” Follower
As a professional dance instructor in the time of COVID - 19 , my income for at least five months of the year has been erased .
If you read this article and find it useful or thought provoking , please consider a donation .
You will be * literally * helping support an artist , and have my sincerest gratitude .
In 2010 , this post was the first viral hit of Swungover * .
A lot has changed and grown in my understanding of the dance , and were I to write this post today , it would be pretty different .
First off , I ’d rewrite the article so that all use of the word follower was gender - neutral , as well as the illustrations .
Secondly , I ’d stress that followers can come into the dance with their own desired connection , they do n’t have to completely match the leader if they do n’t like the kind of connection the leader is bringing to it .
The dance connection should be a compromise if the follower does n’t like what the leader is asking for .
I will update this article with those changes ( and others ) when I have a chance .
— Bobby White , 2016/2017
Over the years , I have come to believe that one of the least helpful pieces of advice a follower can get is to be told she is simply “ too heavy . ”
“ Are you calling me fat ? ”
My partner Kate asks , with a straight face , whenever someone says this .
People have freaked out slightly , backtracking and apologizing before she suddenly can’t hold it anymore and starts to crack up .
Telling a follower they are “ heavy ” is like describing an animal as “ wounded ” and expecting that to be enough information for the blind vet ( weird analogy . )
If a follower is described as “ heavy , ” there are several different possibilities of what ’s going wrong , some of which could be the leader ’s fault .
I ’m going to try to collect them here , starting with these 12 .
I ’ll keep adding and editing this post , too , as I continue my research .
Before we get to those , however , I want to address the problem at its root .
A follower ’s goal is not simply to be “ light ” –“ light ” does n’t necessarily mean “ better . ”
A follower ’s goal should be to give what they think the leader ’s asking for .
( Sure , there are exceptions to the rule that followers can do for specific reasons , usually in the name of asking for more or less tension in order to do something artistically expressive , but more on that later . )
Many advanced leads will sometimes do moves that require a lot of counterbalance–and expect a follower to respond as such , which could easily be described as “ heavy . ”
A great follower is someone who can dance like a feather or a lead zeppelin , depending on what the lead requests at that moment .
Possible Reasons
Why a Follower Might Be Described as “ Heavy . ”
1. Follower in general carrying more tension in arm than needed .
This one is tricky –it can easily be the problem itself , or , more likely , a symptom of some greater problem .
For instance , almost any issue with the follower ’s posture can result in the follower using her arms to compensate .
But first , let ’s address the problem as if it ’s the only problem .
It only takes a little bit of tension in small parts of the arm to create a “ heavier ” follower .
Just your fingers might be tense .
Or your elbow .
That ’s all .
Make sure all the arm muscles have a natural give and take throughout your dancing –that none of them are rigid , or become rigid at a certain point through their motions .
2 . A follower is using her arms to create stretch …
Now for some more specific arm tension - related problems .
Let ’s say a leader with a relaxed frame sits away from his follower and asks for some form of counterbalance –if she does n’t know how to match that by moving her own body , then she will probably result to using her arm muscles to keep the couple balanced –which means she ’s pulling on the guy , and thus “ heavy . ”
Our arm muscles are small and frail compared to the muscle network of the back , core , and shoulders .
In dancing , we can accomplish so much more , and with much greater comfort to ourselves and our partners , if we let that muscle network handle as much as possible .
3 . Follower is using her arm to pull herself in ( for instance , the 1 - 2 - 3 of a swingout . )
This is a specific problem , and is often linked to number 4 on the list .
Basically , a follower is asked to come in on a swing out or turn , or something that moves the follower , and the follower pulls on the leader ’s hand in order to do so .
4 . A follower ’s pelvis is in front of her shoulders .
Aside from this looking as if a follower is attacking you with her crotch on the first half of a swing out , in its subtler forms , it might not even be noticeable .
Basically , this will feel like the follower is countering the lead with the top half of her body .
It might feel slightly like a “ falling backward effect ” for the follower , and thus the leader feels he has to hold her up to some extent , hence “ heavy . ”
BTW , Nina Gilkenson has a great impression of a follower attacking a leader with her crotch .
5 . A Follower allows her arm to get fully extended at the end of movements .
Sort of the opposite of the “ too much arm tension problem , ” this happens when a follower allows her arm to fully extend at the end of movements .
As a default , this has several problems : it means at the end of the movement , you ’re a lot further out than the leader expected , and so he has to move you sooner / quicker / hold tension in his arm and all sorts of other things in order to compensate .
Stretch can die , you wo n’t respond as specifically to momentum requests , etc .
6 . Follower ’s posture is fine , feet too close to leader
This is rare to see , but bringing the feet forward is an old school ( and awesome ) way to create counterbalance .
( Check out this picture of Dean and Jewel , for instance . )
The only problem is , if the leader is n’t asking for that counter balance , you will definitely come off as “ heavy . ”
Dean Collins - studier David Rehm first pointed this out to me , which I ’ve always thought is a really cool idea of counterbalance .
As you ’ve probably noticed by now , most of the times a follower feels heavy is either ( 1 ) when the dance is stretching and asking for some form of counter balance ( like the end of a swing out ) or ( 2 ) when the leader tries to move the follower , usually from the stretch .
So , number 6 is just a very specific way of saying …
7 . Follower is perfectly fine mechanically , but asks for more counterbalance than Lead is offering .
A follower might chose a default stretch or counterbalance that is greater than the leader they are dancing with , the result being that at the end of every move , the follower feels heavy .
Though a follower should try as a default to match exactly the amount of counterbalance asked for , she can also use this as a neat trick :
If she wants to , say , really work her swivels at a certain part of the music , she can ask for a lot of counterbalance , and a good leader will be there to adjust his own and give it to her .
8 . In closed position , or in the middle of a swing out , a follower is seeking connection with the wrong part of her back .
The very obvious example of this is a follower who is used to having a leader ’s hand high on her back ( or shoulder ) during a swing out .
She then dances with a leader who prefers a mid or lower back connection during the closed position .
The follower , not used to responding with her lower back , suddenly arches her back when the leader connects in closed .
She feels he ’s clothes - lining her , he feels she ’s heavy .
A follower should be prepared to respond with whatever part of the back the leader asks for during closed position .
9 . Follower automatically “ sits ” into the leader ’s arm when he brings her into closed position ( Added Dec 2010 )
Many , many follows will automatically sit into the leaders arm when he brings her into closed position .
( And often , it ’s at a slightly diagonal angle into his arm . )
If it ’s more than he ’s leading her to , it will feel heavy as well as limit what he can do .
Just as an advanced leader may ask for different amounts of counterbalance at different times in open position , he may do the same in closed–a leader should be very specific about how much he ’s asking his follower to sit into his arm on swing outs , circles , and other closed position leads , and a follower should be specific about how much she responds .
10 . Leader expects follower to move even though he does n’t give her what she needs to move .
Some times , if a Leader is used to dancing with girls who are eager to move and finish all the movements , he will , unawares , become lazy .
He wo n’t lead the follower to move , expecting her to do so .
When he comes along a follower who does n’t move without the proper leads , she will feel heavy .
He has been living the life of luxury , having had followers do half of his leading for him .
11 . Leader is asking follower to be heavier than he expects ; does n’t realize it .
On the other flip side ( “ the other flip side ? ” ) , if a leader has been dancing almost only with follower ’s who are always light , he might be asking his follower to be heavy and not expect it .
Or , if the dance floor is slippier than usual , he might be compensating weirdly and will ask the follower to be heavier than he expected ( this happened to me a few months ago .
In trying to stay grounded with slippery shoes , I tensed up weird and took my follower down with me ( into the land of heaviness , that is . ) )
12 . Follower is putting too much momentum into the ground .
Perhaps the product of trying to “ sit into it ” or put a pulse into the ground , some followers will find themselves sunk up to their hips into the dance floor , and all movements feel sluggish .
But please do n’t compensate by dancing out of the ground .
The way you walk / run are probably good determinations of how much weight to put into the ground and how to find your natural downward pulse .
12 . Follower is trying to protect herself ; dancing with gorilla
If a follower is dancing with a leader who is using a lot of brute force , a follower might protect herself by tensing up , clamping up , trying to keep things under control .
But , if such a leader thinks such a follower is “ heavy , ” she probably will be better off not correcting him .
At least , if he thinks she ’s heavy , she ’ll never have to dance with him again .
Conclusion
Though there are many different ways and reasons a follower can be “ heavy , ” you can sense some common themes : tension , weird posture , inability to counterbalance , and often , all three mixed together .
Another common theme is giving the leader more than he asks for , or giving him weight in places he ’s not asking for .
A Quick Note on the inherent sex generalizations in dance language :
All followers in this text are referred to as “ she , ” though this is only for the sake of clear understanding and flow throughout the writing .
“ He / She ” “ or “ She / He ” felt too clunky , and using “ it ” only adds to the sexist problem .
Also , in all the diagrams , I have given my follower a rather charming 1937 blonde hair cut ( those are the yellow bumps ) .
This is , again , so I can use generalization for clarity ’s sake .
In truth , almost every male - follower I ’ve ever danced with could be described as a “ heavy ” follower–mainly for reasons mentioned below .
This leads me to …
A Quick note on actual follower size ( Or Physics : Our Best Friend , Our Worst Enemy . )
Kate ’s
“ Are you calling me fat ? ” joke is just that .
A joke .
But , as a way of coming full circle , I do want to talk about relative size .
If you are an eighty - pound winged pixie follower , you might have many of these problems to small degrees and have never been called “ heavy . ”
Ironically , all people probably say to you is “ I bet you ’d be great at aerials ! ” **
If you are a lumbering 250 pound guy follower with the exact same problems as the 80 - pound pixie winged follower , and to the exact same extent , you will be the one getting the “ you ’re too heavy ” comments .
Only because physics has magnified the problem .
So , if you ’re an 80 - pound winged pixie follower , beware that many of these things might apply to you even though you ’ve never been called “ heavy . ”
And if you truly want to be a great follower , you ’ll probably often have to check in and see what problems you ’re getting away with because of your size .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
**– Another thing I ’m annoyed by is when some guy introduces me to his beginner dancer 80 pound winged pixie partner and says “ I now have someone to do aerials with . ”
I usually want to tell them “ You ’ve always had plenty of people to throw around .
For instance , the three or four advanced followers you dance with all the time , that would love to do aerials . ”
What he ’s thinking is that now he has less weight to throw around .
Now he can learn aerials faster because he wo n’t have to concentrate on technique as much .
Now , he can really get some height out of those flips .
He has n’t taken into account that a follower has to be a good follower to do an air step consistently and safely .
That she has to do a lot of intricate work herself to make things happen effortlessly .
That , in most aerials done well , physics does the bulk of the heavy lifting , so what you really want out of an aerial partner is a girl who knows how to control her body , whatever body that may be .
And , what is more annoying , is that he usually has n’t once thought about the idea of going to a gym himself .
Until other leaders around him start going to the gym , that is .
But I do n’t worry about it .
Sooner or later he will realize just how heavy 80 pounds can be .
However , a follower ’s guide to aerials is another essay topic unto itself .

Millions of Australians are set to reap higher retirement savings , funded by a tax on miners , as the Federal Government makes major changes to the country 's superannuation system .
The Federal Government today revealed in its much - anticipated response to the Henry tax review that it will lift compulsory superannuation contributions from 9 to 12 per cent by 2020 .
The Government 's move to increase compulsory superannuation goes against the Henry review recommendations , which instead preferred changing the rate of tax on compulsory contributions to make the system more equitable .
Key points of today 's announcement include :
Lifting compulsory superannuation from 9 to 12 per cent by 2019 - 20
Lifting compulsory superannuation from 9 to 12 per cent by 2019 - 20 More Government payments for low - income workers into their superannuation

An infrastructure fund to be paid to the states each year to start at $ 700 million in 2012
Unveiling the Government 's response , Treasurer Wayne Swan described the announced changes as historic .
" These are very big steps in a decade - long process of reform , " he said .
" We 've chosen to build everyone up rather than rearrange the tax concessions . "
The country 's mining boom will be used to help fund the superannuation overhaul with the resources sector to be slugged with a 40 per cent tax on profits .
Mr Swan warned the Opposition that if they blocked the tax on mining profits they would be blocking the increase in compulsory superannuation .
" This is only doable if it can be funded , " he said .
" There are big gains to come from these reforms we have announced today . "
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the superannuation increase would deliver more security for people as they age .
" This plan means that working families of the future will have to worry less about their retirement , " he said .
The increase in compulsory superannuation is part of several changes the Government will implement to the system in an effort to prepare the country for the costs of a growing and ageing population .
While the mining industry is set for pain , small businesses will make gains through a company tax reduction , a cut in red tape and other concessions .
But the Government is yet to reveal how it may act on other changes that were expected , such as optional tax returns and reforms to family benefit payments .
Changes ' fully funded '
The Government says its changes are fully funded over the next four years and will not breach its promise to keep taxes below 23.6 per cent of GDP .
With concerns that low - income earners will not have enough to retire on , the Federal Government will provide a payment of up to $ 500 annually for those earning under $ 37,000 on top of the existing co-contribution as a way to offset the tax paid on contributions .
Workers over 50 who have superannuation under $ 500,000 will be able to top it up by $ 50,000 a year in concessional contributions .
Those over 70 who are still working will now receive compulsory superannuation contributions until they are 75 .
Over 8 million Australians are expected to benefit from the changes which will cost about $ 2.4 billion over the next four years .
The Government says the changes will give a worker who is aged 30 over $ 100,000 in extra superannuation by the time they retire .
And it expects that a woman aged 30 who may leave the workforce to have children will still be almost $ 80,000 better off .
The changes will put $ 85 billion into the country 's national savings over the next 10 years , some of which will be pumped back into the economy to be used on infrastructure .
The Federal Government is keen to increase the national savings and add to the $ 1 trillion already saved to avoid a reliance on overseas borrowing in the wake of the financial crisis .
While superannuation is set for an overhaul , the Government has rejected several other more contentious recommendations of the review , which was calling for a major shake - up of the tax system .
Mr Swan rejected assertions the Government had a lack of political will .
" I completely and utterly repudiate that assertion , " he said .
Some recommendations that the Government will not be making include :
Replacing state stamp duties on homes with a national land tax
Replacing state stamp duties on homes with a national land tax Removing tax concessions on the not - for - profit sector
Removing tax concessions on the not - for - profit sector Imposing a flat tax on all alcohol

The Government announced last week it would increase taxes on cigarettes by 25 per cent .
With some changes to be implemented soon and others ruled out completely , it remains to be seen what further action the Government may take on other measures in the lead - up to the next election .
The Government has indicated that today 's announcements are only a " first step " with more to come that will make the personal income tax system simpler and fairer .
Optional tax returns had been mooted as well as a congestion tax for drivers .
A Google - backed research project is to map out the relationship between location and literature , visualising works related to a specific era or place using Google Earth .
A joint project between the Open University , the University of Southampton and the University of California at Berkeley , Google Ancient Places will let users search for books related to specific geographic location during a particular time period , which are then visualised on Google Earth or Google Maps .
Academics will be able to access data compiled from a broad swathe of literature , including many out of print and rare material often kept just a small number of institutions .
Researchers say the project will help to open up interested in history , classics and archaeology , but will also help develop new tools and research methods as well as expertise in using data in this way .

Another project , led by Dr Alfonso Moreno at Magdalen College Oxford , is producing an index of translated European literature from 1701 to 1917 .
The Bibliotheca Academica Translationum will be used to research what Moreno describes as the changes in the transmission of knowledge in this period .
In total , Google has announced $ 1 m ( £ 665,000 ) in funding for 12 projects at 15 universities exploring ' digitised literature ' , which its defines as the " use of quantitative techniques to analyse large amounts of literature and identify trends over selected periods of time , by language , by geography and by topic " .
A post by Google explains the projects in more detail , including one that aims to analyse all literature written in the Victorian era to identify trends in the use of vocabulary , while another could compare every version of the opening line to Virgil 's Aeneid to see where and how often it has been quoted .
The researchers will also have support from various Google tools and technologies and access to parts of Google Books catalogue that includes book scans and histograms .
Clearly this project is very far from a direct money - spinner for Google but part of a well - orchestrated , long - term campaign to reassure and win over academics and publishers concerned by the scale and impact of Google 's wider books initiative .
Following Israel ’s bloody interdiction of the Gaza Flotilla , I called a life - long friend in Israel to inquire about the mood of the country .
My friend , an intellectual and a kind and generous man , has nevertheless long sided with Israeli hardliners .
Still , I was entirely unprepared for his response .
He told me — in a voice trembling with emotion — that the world ’s outpouring of condemnation of Israel is reminiscent of the dark period of the Hitler era .
He told me most everyone in Israel felt that way , with the exception of Meretz , a small Israeli pro-peace party .
“ But for all practical purposes , ” he said , “ they are Arabs . ”
Like me , my friend personally experienced those dark Hitler years , having lived under Nazi occupation , as did so many of Israel ’s Jewish citizens .
I was therefore stunned by the analogy .
He went on to say that the so - called human rights activists on the Turkish ship were in fact terrorists and thugs paid to assault Israeli authorities to provoke an incident that would discredit the Jewish state .
The evidence for this , he said , is that many of these activists were found by Israeli authorities to have on them ten thousand dollars , “ exactly the same amount ! ” he exclaimed .
When I managed to get over the shock of that exchange , it struck me that the invocation of the Hitler era was actually a frighteningly apt and searing analogy , although not the one my friend intended .
A million and a half civilians have been forced to live in an open - air prison in inhuman conditions for over three years now , but unlike the Hitler years , they are not Jews but Palestinians .
Their jailers , incredibly , are survivors of the Holocaust , or their descendants .
Of course , the inmates of Gaza are not destined for gas chambers , as the Jews were , but they have been reduced to a debased and hopeless existence .
Fully 80 % of Gaza ’s population lives on the edge of malnutrition , depending on international charities for their daily nourishment .
According to the UN and World Health authorities , Gaza ’s children suffer from dramatically increased morbidity that will affect and shorten the lives of many of them .
This obscenity is a consequence of a deliberate and carefully calculated Israeli policy aimed at de-developing Gaza by destroying not only its economy but its physical and social infrastructure while sealing it hermitically from the outside world .
Particularly appalling is that this policy has been the source of amusement for some Israeli leaders , who according to Israeli press reports have jokingly described it as “ putting Palestinians on a diet . ”
That , too , is reminiscent of the Hitler years , when Jewish suffering amused the Nazis .
Another feature of that dark era were absurd conspiracies attributed to the Jews by otherwise intelligent and cultured Germans .
Sadly , even smart Jews are not immune to that disease .
Is it really conceivable that Turkish activists who were supposedly paid ten thousand dollars each would bring that money with them on board the ship knowing they would be taken into custody by Israeli authorities ?
That intelligent and moral people , whether German or Israeli , can convince themselves of such absurdities ( a disease that also afflicts much of the Arab world ) is the enigma that goes to the heart of the mystery of how even the most civilized societies can so quickly shed their most cherished values and regress to the most primitive impulses toward the Other , without even being aware they have done so .
It must surely have something to do with a deliberate repression of the moral imagination that enables people to identify with the Other ’s plight .
Pirkey Avot , a collection of ethical admonitions that is part of the Talmud , urges : “ Do not judge your fellow man until you are able to imagine standing in his place . ”
Of course , even the most objectionable Israeli policies do not begin to compare with Hitler ’s Germany .
But the essential moral issues are the same .
How would Jews have reacted to their tormentors had they been consigned to the kind of existence Israel has imposed on Gaza ’s population ?
Would they not have seen human rights activists prepared to risk their lives to call their plight to the world ’s attention as heroic , even if they had beaten up commandos trying to prevent their effort ?
Did Jews admire British commandos who boarded and diverted ships carrying illegal Jewish immigrants to Palestine in the aftermath of World War II , as most Israelis now admire Israel ’s naval commandos ?
Who would have believed that an Israeli government and its Jewish citizens would seek to demonize and shut down Israeli human rights organizations for their lack of “ patriotism , ” and dismiss fellow Jews who criticized the assault on the Gaza Flotilla as “ Arabs , ” pregnant with all the hateful connotations that word has acquired in Israel , not unlike Germans who branded fellow citizens who spoke up for Jews as “ Juden ” ?
The German White Rose activists , mostly students from the University of Munich , who dared to condemn the German persecution of the Jews ( well before the concentration camp exterminations began ) were also considered “ traitors ” by their fellow Germans , who did not mourn the beheading of these activists by the Gestapo .
So , yes , there is reason for Israelis , and for Jews generally , to think long and hard about the dark Hitler era at this particular time .
For the significance of the Gaza Flotilla incident lies not in the questions raised about violations of international law on the high seas , or even about “ who assaulted who ” first on the Turkish ship , the Mavi Marmara , but in the larger questions raised about our common human condition by Israel ’s occupation policies and its devastation of Gaza ’s civilian population .
If a people who so recently experienced on its own flesh such unspeakable inhumanities cannot muster the moral imagination to understand the injustice and suffering its territorial ambitions — and even its legitimate security concerns — are inflicting on another people , what hope is there for the rest of us ?

All this leaves an important question : Can public pressures affect private preferences as well as public preferences ?
Kuran thinks so , and he offers a subtle and intriguing explanation , focusing not on the concealment of private preferences but on their transformation .
Let 's start with individuals .
Suppose that you tend to believe that women , like men , should be educated , and that everyone should have the chance to become literate regardless of gender .
Suppose , too , that this belief is inconsistent with existing social pressures ( as it is in many parts of the world ) .
Eventually you may change your private belief , making it conform with those pressures .
This is because it can be extremely frustrating , even distressing , to believe something that other people think implausible , offensive or stupid .
In order to reduce cognitive dissonance , dissenters may bring their private preferences into line with perceived public opinion .
And in this way people who are oppressed by the status quo can come to collaborate in their own oppression .
Thus , in discussing the caste system in India , Kuran adduces evidence that " Hindu ideology has contributed to the untouchables ' acceptance of their deprivations as fair , that it has made many treat their wretched existence as natural , and that it has facilitated their complicity in an order that degrades them . "
But Kuran is interested not only in what happens with individual agents .
He wants to explain also how certain private beliefs get lost or abandoned as the content of public information changes over time .
If certain thoughts are " unthinkable " -- in the sense that people who entertain them are seen as uncivil or immoral -- they may eventually become " unthought , " that is , they disappear altogether .
And so social pressures can make certain ideas disappear from public discussion .
As this happens , people become less conscious of the disadvantages of what is publicly favored and more conscious of the advantages .
In the long run , private opinion itself moves against the thought that is publicly disfavored .
If you have never heard that women should be educated equally with men , or that caste systems offend equality of opportunity , or that likes and dislikes are a function of social pressures , you may well not think of these things at all .
Thus Kuran offers an account of how ideas can change across generations .
In the end , the effects of public opinion on private preferences come from a collective process , in which millions of people affect one another 's views through interdependent acts of knowledge and " preference falsification . "
Kuran applies these basic ideas to three case studies : the fate of communism ; the caste system in India ; and the spread of affirmative action in the United States ( which , in his view , was " unwanted " ) .
The discussion of communism is a highlight of the book .
Offering many vivid anecdotes , he shows that communism persisted not only , or not mostly , because of brute terror , but also because of a " pervasive culture of mendacity . "
People joined organizations they abhorred , followed orders they considered nonsensical , cheered speakers they despised and ostracized dissidents they greatly admired .
How could this have been ?
Kuran shows that all this could not have been the consequence of terror -- state resources were often far too limited for that -- and that it was largely a product of widespread perceptions of what other people thought , or thought normal .
Thus , for example , a unanimous vote of the Writers ' Union denounced Boris Pasternak as an enemy of the Soviet Union for producing Doctor Zhivago , even though they widely admired the writer and his novel .
There were countless similar examples .
In the Soviet Union , of course , force was relevant ; but preference falsification also played a role .
In some cases , preference falsification produces a situation of stability , but in other cases it is possible to get rapid , unforeseen , even unforeseeable shifts .
Recall that public preferences are a function of what people think that other people think .
It follows that when in Eastern Europe the level of apparent public opposition started to rise , people 's public preferences changed quickly , as they came closer to their private preferences .
Not only governments , but also policies , customs and fashions " can be abruptly abandoned when people who have helped sustain [ them ] suddenly discover a common desire for change . "
In fact , societies reach a tipping point when social pressures no longer support the status quo , but even undermine it .
Eventually it is support for the status quo that produces reputational loss .
( Think of recent civil rights movements for blacks and women . )
Thus " a revolutionary bandwagon may help create the discontent that keeps it in motion .
Switches from the government to the opposition may alert essentially content people to the government 's failings ; or they may make people who had been resigned to the status quo recognize the possibility of political change . "
The Cheapest Muppet Movie Ever Made ! is an idea for a film that Jim Henson , Jerry Juhl and Frank Oz first developed in 1985 .
Juhl , the Muppets ' head writer from the late 1970s through the 1990s , discussed the film 's concept in a 1998 interview with Muppet Central :
“ There was a project for a Muppet movie that we kept returning to .
Jim and I worked on it and just loved it .
It grew out of the fact that Jim was talking about finances and if we did another Muppet movie at the time , it would need to be done inexpensively , since we were using bigger and bigger budgets for all our other projects ... So we conceived of a movie slated as " The Cheapest Muppet Movie Ever Made . "
That was the original working title and that later became the subtitle with the title along the lines of , " Into the Teeth of the Demons of Death . "
The idea being that this was a film that Gonzo directed .
Kermit was too busy so when Gonzo asked , Kermit said , " Sure , go ahead .
I can't take on the responsibilities behind the scenes at this time , but I 'll perform in it . "
So Gonzo wrote this cheesy , terrible plot that made absolutely no sense whatsoever about something being stolen that led to a chase around the world .
Unfortunately Gonzo blows half the movie 's budget on the opening titles !
So as the film progresses , it gets cheaper and cheaper where they 're using a shot of the same street corner for every city in the world !
We were still talking about this project in the last meeting I ended up having with Jim .
Every now and then , we still bring up the movie .
Six months ago , Frank had said to me , " You know , there 's still something in that movie , it would be a lot of fun to do . "
One thing that kept it from happening though was that for " The Cheapest Muppet Movie Ever Made , " it still turned out to be expensive to shoot .
Things like a tranquil island blowing up with a volcano and such . [ 1 ] ”
Additional plot details were recounted in Jim Henson : The Biography : Gonzo's film , titled Into the Jaws of the Demons of Death , would eventually get cheaper and cheaper in looks , turning into " black - and - white Super 8 film , " then to a slideshow and storyboards .
Eventually , Gonzo would gain some corporate sponsorship , ending the movie in hi-def widescreen . [ 2 ]
Frank
Oz discussed resurrecting the 15 - year old script in a 2000 interview . [ 3 ]
The script was again mentioned as a next movie for the Muppets in September 2009 as discussed at the D23 Expo .
It was later set aside yet again in favor of The Muppets . [ 4 ]
Frank
Oz responded to a question about the project on a Reddit AMA in January 2018 :
“ When Dick Cook was head of Disney , he asked me to get involved with a Muppet movie , so because the previous script was dated from being written 40 years ago , I did rewrite it with the help of Jim Lewis .
And personally , I love it .
And I wish it could be made .
But maybe it 's time now is gone because it feels like Disney would like to go their own way . [ 5 ] ”
In a live stream for the Museum of the Moving Image in 2020 , Jim Lewis revealed one scene in the rewritten script took place during The Muppet Movie , showing the action behind the curtains of the Miss Bogen County Beauty Pageant moments before Miss Piggy 's entrance . [ 6 ]
The IDF 's Civil Administration destroyed a Palestinian village Monday morning that had earlier been cleared out when its water supply was cut off .
The IDF demolished about 55 structures in the West Bank village of Farasiya , including tents , tin shacks , plastic and straw huts , clay ovens , sheep pens and bathrooms .
These structures served the 120 farmers , hired workers and their families who lived in the Jordan Valley village .
The Civil Administration said they had declared the area a live fire zone and posted eviction orders for 10 families in tents on June 27 .
" Since no appeal was filed in the following three weeks , and given the danger posed by the location of the tents , they were removed , " they said in response .
The villagers made a living by sheep farming and working land owned by families in the town of Tubas .
Some of them have been living in Farasiya for decades .
A packaging warehouse that was built together with Agrexco in the late 1970s was also torn down .
Atef Abu al - Rob , a photographer for the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem , who arrived at the village hours after the demolition , said mattresses , pipes and broken furniture were lying on the ground in the debris .
Since 1967 , Israel has prevented Palestinian communities in the Jordan Valley from growing , whether by cutting off their water supply , declaring large areas as live fire zones or banning all construction .
About a year ago the IDF set up hundreds of warning signs near Palestinian farming communities , marking them closed military areas .
Such a sign was set up at the entrance to Farasiya .
The families had recently been forced to leave the village when the Israeli authorities cut it off from its water sources , said the popular committees ' coordinator in the valley , Fathi Hadirat .
The villagers were forbidden to use the water wells the Mekorot Water Company had dug in the area .
Hadirat said a few years ago the Civil Administration destroyed the pipe the villages had laid from a nearby stream used for drinking water and irrigation .
Since then they have been watering the sheep and fields with water unfit for human consumption , pumped from a salt water source .
They received drinking water in tanks .
About four months ago the IDF confiscated their pumps .
On Sunday , 10 families from Bardala , a village north of Farasiya , were given demolition notices .
A farmer who owns 300 sheep was told to leave in 24 hours or his herd would be confiscated .

I recoiled on the first reading of Noam Schrieber ’s “ The Breakup , ” an account of the recently - cooled relationship between JP Morgan and the White House at The New Republic this week .
And I do n’t like it much better upon a second perusal .
So much of the piece is devoted to uncritical recitation of pure JP Morgan flattering bunk that it outweighs , by a considerable margin , the tidbits in the story .
This is particularly unfortunate in the case of The New Republic , which is read primarily by political junkies and will thus serves to reinforce JP Morgan ’s widely accepted hype .
Sadly , this style of article is becoming increasingly common among writers who do n’t even seem to recognize that they ’ve been captured via access journalism .
Many have fallen so completely in the orbit of those in power that they ’ve come to think that poking them with a toothpick is tantamount to Serious Reporting .
The arc of this discursive piece ( it runs seven pages ) is :
1. Jamie Dimon and the Administration were best buddies once upon a time
2. JP Morgan was particularly aggressive in undermining reform efforts
3. Jamie Dimon and the Administration are not such good friends right now
When you strip the article down to what it is all about , you can see there is n’t much to it .
Yes , because this is an inside the beltway story with Big Names , the detail might seem titillating ( particularly to those who see politics as an elite sport ) .
And it does discuss two that appear to be new : first , that it was JP Morgan that was the moving force behind the clearly orchestrated push to have corporations say that they liked the derivatives market just the way it was .
An amusing bit is how low the yield was on the efforts to get companies to shill for Wall Street :
“ What they wanted was , ‘ Hey , let ’s get the dopey end users to go out and be the face of reform , ’ ” recalls another person who participated in the strategizing .
“ ‘ We do n’t have the credibility . ’ ” …
The hope , according to a source privy to the calls and to internal planning documents , was that pressure from end users would help preserve the status quo on the derivatives the dealers sold to firms like hedge funds — which is to say , many of their most lucrative bets .
“ What you really had was fear , ” says this person , fear that the profits from derivatives would evaporate …..
A handful of end users were on the initial calls and grumbled about their role in the plan .
But , as a group , the end users did eventually become the public face of a well - financed campaign
Yves here .
This is every rapist ’s fantasy : to get the victim to say in public she really did want it .
Needless to say , this salvo , and JP Morgan ’s generally aggressive anti-regulatory posture ( “ Congressional aides I spoke with proclaimed JP Morgan ’s Capitol Hill contingent the most relentless in fighting reform ” ) did n’t put them in very good standing with Team Obama .
The article also reports a very peculiar volte face : the Administration announcing the Volcker Rule in the wake of Scott Brown ’s election in Massachusetts ( widely regarded as a “ populist ” move to garner public support and loathed on Wall Street ) with a sudden need to pull out all stops on the Bernanke reappointment :
The next day , though , it was as if all had been forgotten .
The nomination of Ben Bernanke for a second term as Federal Reserve chairman was suddenly losing altitude in the Senate .
For a brief moment , it looked like it might crash , something the administration feared could damage the financial markets .
Treasury officials asked Scher if senior JP Morgan executives could call a few senators to help put the nomination back on track , which they agreed to do without hesitation .
By the time the White House called the following Monday to invite Dimon to lunch , Bernanke ’s nomination looked assured .
Yves here .
Notice two things : the desperation to secure the Bernanke reappointment , not because he ’s the best choice , or because failure would represent a blow to the Administration ’s credibility , but because Mr. Market might get in a snit .
And JP Morgan rolled into action , knowing the importance of collecting favors when the Administration was ratcheting up the anti-bankster rhetoric ( horrors , they might start to believe their own PR ! ) .
The problem with the story is that the good bits are larded down with fever chart reporting of how in or out of grace Dimon was at various points in time , and even worse , overlong doses of complete rubbish about JP Morgan ’s condition .
For instance :
If Dimon took these shots personally , it was n’t hard to see why .
On one level , the crisis brought him vindication .
For years , he ’d preached the virtues of conservative risk - management and a “ fortress balance sheet ” that would arm JP Morgan to withstand any turmoil it faced .
He ’d largely abstained as other banks gorged on subprime securities .
When Weill ’s chosen successor , Chuck Prince , resigned in disgrace from Citigroup in late 2007 , Dimon was increasingly regarded as the industry ’s best manager .
“ [ His view is ] the other guys screwed up — Citi and those idiots .
We did well .
Had I been there , they would have been fine , ” says an administration official .
And yet , for all the adulation Dimon received on Wall Street , these distinctions largely eluded the public consciousness , to Dimon ’s everlasting frustration .
Indeed , if there was a common strand to Dimon ’s comments after the crisis , it was his resentment over being viewed as a bailed - out CEO , when in fact he took the government money as an act of good faith — so that rivals who really needed it would n’t be stigmatized .
( Of course , even JP Morgan ’s unassailable balance sheet would have been assailed had the crisis spread further . )
But , instead of being heralded for this public - mindedness , Dimon found himself the target of populist attacks and an escalating reform offensive .
“ The incessant broad - based vilification of the banking industry is n’t fair and it is damaging , ” Dimon told The Wall Street Journal .
Yves here ,
It appears that Dimon is possessed of a reality - distortion sphere as powerful as Steve Jobs ’ .
And like Jobs , he has come to believe what he is selling .
The difference between Jobs and Dimon , however , is that Jobs ’ distortion are far less significant and consequential than Dimon’s .
Start with the myth that because JP Morgan was less involved in subprime , it was sound and did n’t need a bailout .
Utter tripe .
In case you missed it , the efforts to save the CDS market were to prevent JP Morgan from going under .
Financial services analysts Josh Rosner has repeatedly said that JP Morgan would have collapsed had the authorities not intervened to salvage the CDS market .
As Chris Whalen noted , JP Morgan is a $ 1.3 trillion bank attached to a $ 76 trillion derivatives clearing operation .
The risks in the clearing operation vastly exceed what goes on at the bank .
During the crisis , JP Morgan scored poorly on Whalen ’s credit risk metrics in comparison to other large banks .
And even in banking terms , JP Morgan is a “ fortress ” with a lot of holes in the battlements .
JP Morgan is also the beneficiary of dubious accounting .
Year end 2009 total equity was $ 165 billion .
Per Mike Konczal ’s conservative analysis , JPM ’s losses on second mortgages are between $ 58 and $ 87 billion , if not higher .
But with front page magazine stories that talk your book for you , who needs to worry about messy realities ?
The welfare state has never been successfully rolled back .
That is the blunt conclusion Emeritus Professor Howard Glennerster has reached after spending a working lifetime studying it .
He has seen governments come and go - some hostile some keen .
Image caption Some argue that universal payments like child benefit should be means - tested
And every failure to row back the state has its reasons .
Sometimes it is a changing population - the massive rise in school - age children after the baby boom , for example , that sent education costs soaring ; or the increase in the numbers of the elderly ; or the high unemployment of the 1980s .
Short - term containment is as much as anyone ever achieved , former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher included .
And what is Prof Glennerster 's analysis of the task facing the coalition ?
" The challenge is to threaten the interests of the median middle - class voter on whom the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats depend .
Only by challenging their core vote , it seems to me , can they deliver . "
Will the coalition confront the voting power of its own supporters ?
Why should it ?
Prof Glennerster , a specialist in social policy at the London School of Economics , continues : " This is a battle to stop the middle classes assuming that the state is there to provide for their university education and comfort in old age . "
Universal no more ?
The debate about the public finances has so far concentrated on the question of fairness to the poor , but should it be about the middle classes ?
The arguments for a shift of focus come from all sides .
For Analysis on Radio 4 , we asked four politicians from across the spectrum to tell us how to cut the infamous deficit , basing their ideas on consistent principles .
Image caption
Will we have to work into our seventies to pay for middle - class state pensions ?
The thrust of their answers was fascinating .
First up , for three of the four , was ending universal benefits .
These are paid regardless of people 's means , like child benefit or , for pensioners , the winter fuel allowance , free TV licences or free bus passes .
Concentrate what you have got on the poor , we were told , and so , by implication , take it away from the better off .
On the right , the argument was that the cause of greater self - reliance - and lower tax - justified forcing people who can to look after themselves .
On the left , it was a question of prioritising those in most need .
But that is small beer compared with what followed .
Even the core state pension itself came under attack .
This too is a universal benefit , but one that the coalition has made substantially more generous .
Later retirement
The government 's argument is that if people see their state pension reduced as soon as they save for themselves , they will not save , so the state pension cannot be means - tested .
But to make it more generous for all is hugely expensive - and that is a large part of the reason for the rising retirement age .
Less well known is the calculation by the Pensions Commission of how high the retirement age would have to go to make the arithmetic work .
The answer : 73 .
Services for the poor are poor services Lord Hattersley , Former deputy Labour leader
That would be one way of paying the price of persuading people who can to save for themselves rather than rely on the state .
It is a price paid by all , either in years , or in tens of billions of pounds , for preserving middle - class entitlement .
The potential costs of long - term care for anyone who might be thought to have the income or assets to pay for it themselves will be another big pressure .
So will university - from which the middle classes benefit most .
It will have to cost more , says Kitty Ussher , a former New Labour Treasury minister .
Hitherto , university - goers have been subsidised at the expense of people who do not go - often the poor , she said .
Maintain consent
Who will defend the middle classes ?
Do they not deserve to get something back ?
One hope is that efficiency will deliver everything they want from the public services , while cutting what needs to be cut - an argument that so divides believers and sceptics that each scoffs at the other 's naivety .
But , among our panel of four , the staunchest defender of middle - class entitlement turned out , believe it or not , to be old Labour 's Roy Hattersley .
The former Labour deputy leader told us that universalism - whether in welfare or the public services - was essential to maintaining the consent of the better off who overwhelmingly pay for it .
" Services for the poor are poor services , " Lord Hattersley said .

But does that turn services for the better off into little more than a bribe to keep them in the welfare state club ?
There was only area for our contributors where there was real unease about challenging middle - class entitlement : healthcare .
But some is already means - tested , like dentistry or eye care : free for some , charged to others .
And that could be extended , to systems of co-payment for non-urgent treatment , for example .
But there was no rush among our four to suggest it .
To the question of why the welfare state has taken an ever - larger share of national income for the past 60 years , the answer seems obvious : public and political demand .
If demand for what the state does cannot be contained , nor can the bill .
But who , really , has been most demanding ?

Up to 1,000 protesters demanding electoral reform have converged on Smith Square in London outside a meeting of Liberal Democrat MPs .
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is meeting his MPs and peers to discuss a power - sharing offer from the Conservatives .
The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg spoke to Power2010 Director Pam Giddy .
It 's being billed as " the nation 's first wholesale - only integrated wireless broadband and satellite network . "
LightSquared is a new , coast - to - coast 4G - LTE wireless broadband operation backed up by satellite coverage .
The company will provide wholesale wireless to ISPs and cable operators — even device makers , content providers , and just about anybody else .
And the venture will do so as the " first truly open and net neutral wireless network , " according to LightSquared 's elatedly worded press release , with build - out expected to produce over 100,000 " direct and indirect private sector jobs within five years . "
LightSquared will function as " a disruptive force " in US wireless " by democratizing wireless broadband services , " the firm 's new Chair and CEO Sanjiv Ahuja proclaimed on Tuesday .
" We 're providing everyone , including underserved communities , with a fast , reliable experience regardless of where they are located in the United States .
This network will return our country to its rightful position as a leader in wireless broadband technology and solidify its reputation as the center of global innovation . "
Anybody can
We spoke with LightSquared spokesperson Tom Surface and asked him about that " open and net neutral " phrase .
Surface emphasized that those last two words should n't be confused with " net neutrality . "
But the idea is that all comers will be able to buy into LightSquared 's capacity on a wholesale basis for resale to the public , even a big - box retail store .
" Anybody can use our network , " Surface promised .
When we suggested Best Buy as a hypothetical wholesale customer , he called that a " good example , " but went mum about actual prospects .
" We are in direct talks with these potential partners , " Surface told us .
Still , the potential win here is pretty obvious .
By selling wholesale broadband access to entities that you do n't usually associate with the broadband business , there 's huge potential to get high - speed access into less populated regions where there are n't any traditional ISPs , but are plenty of retailers who might consider filling the gap .
I was pleased
This consortium came into existence following the Harbinger Capital Partners investment group 's acquisition of SkyTerra Communications ( now LightSquared ) .
SkyTerra will provide the spectrum for this venture .
Nokia Siemens will design the network , install equipment , and manage the operation , which consists of about 40,000 cellular base stations .
And the whole shebang will cover over 92 percent of the US population by 2015 , the new company pledges .
Even FCC Chair Julius Genachowski has given the news his public blessing .
" I was pleased to learn of the formation of LightSquared today , " Genachowski announced .
" This new nationwide 4G wireless broadband network represents more than $ 7 billion of new investment , with the potential to create more than 100,000 new private - sector jobs within five years .
Today 's announcement shows that FCC policies are helping grow the U.S. economy by catalyzing investment and job creation . "
Three conditions
That last piece of credit - taking stems from the fact that the Commission approved this deal , although not everybody 's crazy about some of the conditions to which Harbinger agreed .
Condition one has Harbinger promising that SkyTerra will not enter into an agreement to make its 1525 to 1660.5 MHz band spectrum available to any entity that happens to be " the largest or second largest wireless provider " in the US , without receiving prior Commission approval .
Those unnamed providers would be AT&T and Verizon , who now rake in over 60 percent of mobile wireless sector revenue , according the FCC 's latest mobile competition report .
Approval , the fine print adds , " shall be at the sole discretion of the Commission ( or one of its Bureaus , acting on delegated authority ) . "
On top of that , SkyTerra will not provide more than 25 percent of its terrestrial network access to those aforementioned providers without the Commission 's prior blessing .
That 's condition three .
The point , again , is to " promote competition and more access to the less densely populated areas , " Surface reiterated .
Big is n't bad
Needless to say , AT&T and Verizon take strong exception to these measures , based as they are , AT&T charges , on a " big is bad " set of assumptions about revenue .
" Singling AT&T out for disparate secondary market treatment through conditions that create regulatory hurdles that discourage other spectrum holders from attempting to make spectrum or even excess wholesale capacity available to AT&T is simply unacceptable , " the company complained to the agency in mid-April .
Ditto says Verizon , which has gotten into a bit of a tussle over the issue with smaller carrier Sprint .
The latter company supports the network restriction conditions ( which would not apply to Sprint , obviously ) .
Like AT&T , Verizon says they should be rescinded , but short of that the company wants them applied to the entire wireless sector .
" Verizon Wireless 's new proposal , " Sprint insists , " is simply a collateral attempt to nullify the narrowly tailored conditions SkyTerra proposed to enhance the public interest benefits of the transaction . "
The wireless giant 's " proposal to extend the conditions across the industry demonstrates its lack of conviction in its own arguments against them . "
Even various Senators have gotten into the act — Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - TX ) , Jim DeMint ( R - SC ) and two others questioning the propriety of the conditions and the FCC 's legal authority in this area .
The FCC is " presently reviewing " AT&T , Verizon , and Sprint 's positions on this issue , Genachowski wrote back to them the same day .
According to LightSquare 's filings , the venture plans trial market test runs in Phoenix and Denver early next year .
Congress Or Fed Too Big To Fail ?
The mark of political sovereignty is legal immunity from failure .
For example , the government of the United States can not be sued without its consent .
It is above the law .
It must consent to expose itself to the possibility of failure in a court .
In school , we are taught about an ancient idea that is long out of favor : the divine right of kings .
What did it mean ?
I think most people would find it difficult to say .
It meant that there was no earthly court of appeal above the king .
The king 's judicial word was law , because no higher authority could lawfully overturn his word .
The two revolutions of the seventeenth century brought that doctrine to an end in England and the colonies .
First Cromwell ( 1649 ) , then Parliament ( 1688 ) removed kings from their thrones .
Over the next century , the West substituted a new doctrine : the divine right of legislatures .
This sovereignty was never called divine right , because in the era of the Enlightenment , intellectuals have been hostile to the idea of a God who interferes in history .
Civil governments have claimed autonomy , which is another word for divinity .
Maybe we can say that divinity abhors a vacuum .
Officially , there is a right of revolution .
The People – capital P – are said to be sovereign .
This is a convenient legal fiction .
It keeps the citizenry satisfied and subdued .
All civil governments have made armed revolution illegal .
Every revolutionary movement claims the right of revolution .
In all cases , when a revolutionary movement topples the previous regime , the right of revolution officially ceases within the formerly revolutionary camp .
Maybe you think this : " If the sovereignty of the citizens is a legal fiction , then why are they allowed to vote ? "
Answer : for the same reason they were allowed to vote in the Soviet Union .
Voting provided the Communist government with a bogus sense of legitimacy .
In Western political theory , the process of voting supposedly legitimizes the despotic regime .
The choices on the ballot were screened by the Communist Party .
So , the citizens ' votes counted for only one thing : to provide a religious sanction from the official god who then submitted , namely , the People .
The People was a phony collective god without meaningful sanctions .
Conclusion : the agency that imposes final sanctions in terms of its own final word is the god of a society .
This brings me to the topic at hand : central banking .
CENTRAL BANKING
The advent of the Bank of England in 1694 , just six years after Parliament 's " Glorious Revolution , " added a new factor to the doctrine of political sovereignty .
To what extent is a central bank sovereign ?
That is , to what extent is it immune from lawsuits ?
To what extent is it its own court of final appeal ?
To what extent can it impose autonomous sanctions ?
Over the last three centuries , battles have raged between central banks and legislatures for the title of " final sovereign . "
Central banks have usually won the war over the last century .
The Bank for International Settlements is the representative institution of this victory .
It was established in 1930 .
It operated during World War II as a way for central banks to conduct business with each other despite the deaths of 60 million people .
The cause of central banking triumphed over the competing causes of the battlefields .
We are seeing this battle being played out in the United States .
This is the first surfacing of the battle ever since the Federal Reserve System was created by the government in the last days of December 1913 .
Ron Paul persuaded a majority of the House of Representatives to demand that the Government Accountability Office audit the Federal Reserve System .
The FED resisted .
The senior members of Congress resisted .
The bill was killed .
The new financial reform bill gutted the original bill .
Here is another example .
Last year , Bloomberg LLC sued the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to produce evidence of which banks received TARP loans .
The FED refused to comply .
A Federal judge last August told the FED to comply .
The FED appealed the case .
On March 19 , the appeals court told the FED to comply .
The FED has not complied .
I have been unable to find out what the status of the case is today .
Bloomberg has not mentioned it as far as I can discover on Google .
The FED has hired Lawyer Delay .
He seldom loses a case .
Bloomberg has hired Lawyer Silence .
He rarely wins one .
This is functional sovereignty .
Legally , the Board of Governors is a Federal agency and is therefore under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act .
Yet in fact , it is almost as sovereign as the CIA or the NSA ( " No Such Agency " ) .
The latter have guns .
The FED does not .
This is most peculiar .
How can this be ?
Because the FED has the authority to make or break a bank that gets into trouble .
The FED holds the hammer over the economy , because the big banks are at the center of the economy .
It is the lender of last resort .
The FED is not legally required to buy Treasury debt .
It does , or rather used to .
These days , it sits on old Treasury debt – not much – and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt : lots .
It sits on toxic assets that it swapped at face value for Treasury debt in order to restore the big banks ' balance sheets to official solvency .
The FED answers to no one about its balance sheets .
It keeps all assets at whatever price it chooses .
Gold is held at $ 42.22 per ounce .
Toxic assets are held at face value .
The Federal Reserve System possesses so much sovereignty that it holds the U.S. Government 's gold in trust .
Anyway , it says it does .
There has been no government audit of the gold since 1951 .
No one in government knows how much gold there is in Fort Knox and the vault of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , a private bank .
The government does not assert its right to know .
The FED reigns supreme over commercial banks .
It is going to be granted far more authority if the proposed bank reform bill passes .
Bernanke recently praised the bill in a June 16 speech .
The Federal Reserve System is universally regarded as too big to fail .
Put another way , it is beyond negative sanctions .
It therefore possesses what was once called divine right .
It is beyond legal constraints .
It is beyond market constraints .
It answers to no one .
It is autonomous .
Nice work if you can get it .
The Board of Governors got it .
Also , only 12 private entities in the United States possess comparable sovereignty : the regional Federal Reserve Banks .
They are under the legal umbrella of the Board of Governors .
Nice work if you can get it .
Federal Reserve sovereignty is premised on two things : ( 1 ) the government 's refusal to exercise Constitutional authority over the FED , which was created by the government ; ( 2 ) the FED 's ability to create money .
It decides who is too big to fail and who is n't .
This is the mark of sovereignty .
WHO WINS ?
WHO LOSES ?
Year after year , decade after decade , century after century , we hear warnings about banking institutions that are too big to fail .
This goes back decades before British author Walter Bagehot wrote " Lombard Street " ( 1873 ) .
He argued that the Bank of England should serve as a lender of last resort .
In an economic crisis , the Bank should make credit available .
As it turned out , no such policy was adopted by the Bank for over 50 years , yet there were no major financial crises until after World War I .
That was when the Bank began serving as the lender of last resort .
The result was the suspension of the gold standard in 1931 .
Without the threat of a drain of gold , the Bank could then function as the lender of last resort by creating fiat money at will .
This is what the phrase " lender of last resort " really means : the creation of fiat money by the central bank .
It means breaking the normal rules of the fiat money game .
It means bailouts .
The problem of moral hazard was seen by Bagehot .
If the central bank stays in the background as the lender of last resort , the commercial bankers ' need for prudence and restraint is reduced .
They will get bailed out if their investment portfolios shrink due to unforeseen conditions .
Then there is the question of questions :
Which banks or institutions will get bailed out ?
The answer in both theory and practice is the same : big banks .
Why ?
Because they could take down the fractionally reserved banking system if they were to suspend payment and default on their contractual obligations .
With the central bank ready to bail out the big banks , the senior managers of these banks can put their banks ' capital at risk by investing in high - return , high - risk investments .
Think " derivatives . "
Then think " toxic assets . "
Then think " exchange our toxic assets at face value for liquid T - bills . "
This is what the Federal Reserve did for the major banks .
The result ?
The six largest American banks have been highly profitable in 2010 – far more so than in 2009 .
But they have made their money through trading , especially high - risk derivatives .
They did not make it by lending to businesses .
In short , they are back to the pre-2008 , pre-TARP world .
Happy days are here again !
For them .
This is why Wall Street is on the fast track to Easy Street , while Main Street remains on the detour .
The FED decided who would win and who would lose .
Main Street is losing .
But this is nothing new .
This is as old as the Federal Reserve System .
THE POWER TO DESTROY
In the case that established the sovereignty of central banking in the United States , " McCulloch v. Maryland " ( 1819 ) , Chief Justice John Marshall wrote the famous words , " The power to tax is the power to destroy . "
Because historians have never read the actual trial documents , they are unaware of the context .
The state of Maryland was trying to tax a branch of the Second Bank of the United States .
The Bank was refusing to pay , on this legal basis : its sovereignty as an agency of the government .
Its lawyer was the ever - indebted Daniel Webster .
The following never makes it into the textbooks .
The state 's attorney argued that the Bank did not possess Federal sovereignty , because it was a private agency .
The Court rejected this argument , 7 to 0 .
We still live under the burden of that decision .
John Marshall stole Webster 's slogan : " The power to tax is the power to destroy . "
He saw his opportunity , and he took it .
It is his most famous aphorism .
Yet it came from the lawyer who was defending the sovereignty of the central bank .
Here are some additional powers to destroy :
The power to inflate is the power to destroy .
The power to deflate is the power to destroy .
The power to subsidize members of one group by transferring wealth from members of another group is the power to destroy .
The power to keep large bankrupt institutions from failing , yet let other institutions just like it fail , is the power to destroy .
In short , anything that places the power to manipulate the economy into the hands of salaried bureaucrats who do not personally bear the consequences of their actions is the power to destroy .
Such power will eventually be used .
The Federal Reserve System has created the boom - bust cycle , just as Ludwig von Mises described it in 1912 .
The FED 's prior policies of monetary inflation created the boom .
Its policies of monetary stabilization created the bust .
It then doubled its balance sheet ( the nation 's monetary base ) in October 2008 .
The only thing keeping this from doubling the money supply and possibly doubling consumer prices is the fear of commercial bankers .
They refuse to lend the money they are legally entitled to create .
They are hoarding digital money at the FED .
To put this in terms even a central banker can understand :
Commercial bankers , acting on their depositors ' behalf , are hiding the depositors ' digital money under the mattress : the FED 's excess reserve account .
FUNDING THE FEDERAL DEFICIT
At some point , lenders will refuse to lend money to the Treasury at low rates .
At some further point , the Federal debt will have to be funded by the FED in order to keep rates from rising .
If the FED keeps funding the Treasury , this will produce monetary inflation .
This will go to mass inflation : over 20 % per annum .
If it continues , this will go to hyperinflation .
That will destroy the dollar .
The power to inflate is the power to destroy .
The FED will transfer massive , comprehensive destruction to the general population .
To stop this from happening , it will have to cease buying Treasury debt .
It will stabilize the money supply .
That will create the great depression .
At that point , we will see who is sovereign : Congress or the FED .
If Congress nationalizes the FED and inflates , then the FED will have failed .
It will be proven for all to see that it was not too big to fail .
On the other hand , if the FED refuses to buy the Treasury 's debt , the Federal government will default .
It will be proven as not too big to fail .
CONCLUSION
For freedom 's sake , both should be allowed to fail : the FED 's fiat money and the Federal debt .
The very concept of too big to fail rests on the idea of coercive wealth redistribution by the state .
Such power is the power to destroy .
The problem is this : to get people to act like the People will take a lot of failures of very large banks .
The big banks will fight this outcome .
The FED will fight on their behalf .
Central banks have won this battle for over 300 years .
This is why there is going to be a great deal of economic destruction .

CAUSE AN EFFECT
In the early sixties meteorologist Edward Lorenz gave us the chaos theory example of a butterfly flapping its wings in Beijing , and how this could set off a chain reaction that would end up with a hurricane in New York .
All of the world 's power structures depend on people 's co-operation to stand .
We all together make them possible .
While it remains true that we support injustice by not objecting to it , 1 surely this implies we could withdraw our support at any time .

Just call it the latest in a two month series of public relations disasters by the CEO of BP :
( AP ) In what one environmentalist described as “ yet another public relations disaster ” for embattled energy giant BP , CEO Tony Hayward took time off Saturday to attend a glitzy yacht race around England ’s Isle of Wight .
As social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook lit up with outrage , BP spokespeople rushed to defend Hayward , who has drawn withering criticism as the public face of BP ’s halting efforts to stop the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
Spokeswoman Sheila Williams said Hayward took a break from overseeing BP efforts to stem the undersea gusher in Gulf of Mexico so he could watch his boat “ Bob ” participate in the J.P. Morgan Asset Management Round the Island Race .
The 52 - foot yacht is made by the Annapolis , Maryland - based boatbuilder Farr Yacht Design .
The annual one - day race is one of the world ’s largest , attracting more than 1,700 boats and 16,000 sailors as world - renown yachtsmen compete with wealthy amateurs in the 50 - nautical mile course around the island .
Robert Wine , a BP spokesman at the company ’s Houston headquarters , said it was the first break that Hayward has had since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and setting off the undersea oil gusher .
“ He ’s spending a few hours with his family at a weekend .
I ’m sure that everyone would understand that , ” Wine said Saturday .
“ He will be back to deal with the response .
It does n’t detract from that at all . ”
Wine described the race as “ one of the biggest sailing events in the world and he ’s well known to have a keen interest in it . ”
He said Hayward will be returning to the United States , though it ’s unclear when .
What 's going on with the world 's economy ?
Foreclosures are everywhere , unemployment is skyrocketing - and this may only be the beginning .
Could it be that solutions to the world 's economic problems could have been embedded in the most beloved children 's story of all time , " The Wonderful Wizard of Oz " ?
The yellow brick road ( the gold standard ) , the emerald city of Oz ( greenback money ) , even Dorothy 's silver slippers ( changed to ruby slippers for the movie version ) were powerful symbols of author L. Frank Baum 's belief that the people - not the big banks -- should control the quantity of a nation 's money .

WASHINGTON — The administrator of the $ 20 billion fund established to compensate victims of the Gulf oil spill said he did n't know if the amount would be enough to help all those who would ultimately be affected .
Kenneth Feinberg , named last month by the White House to oversee the process of awarding claims , said he would n't know the full scope of legitimate requests as long as oil continued to gush from the broken well a mile beneath the ocean 's surface .
" Until the oil stops , you do n't know how pervasive the oil spill will be , so you do n't know if somebody who has not been harmed at all today will be harmed by additional oil next week , " he told CNN 's " State of the Union " on Sunday .
" Once the oil stops , I believe we 'll be able to very quickly get a handle on the comprehensiveness of the claims population . "
BP agreed last month to pay out $ 20 billion to an independently managed fund over four years under pressure from the Obama administration .
The agreement does n't cap the company 's liabilities in the spill , however .
Google chief executive Eric Schmidt says that the experience of reading news will move to digital devices quite rapidly – and that it will involve personalised and local news which will be alert to your interests and existing knowledge .
Speaking at the Activate 2010 summit held at the Guardian , Schmidt also warned that organisations should think of their mobile strategy ahead of their internet strategy – but that the two were intertwined so deeply that it was impossible to think of one without the other .
" The internet is the most disruptive technology in history , even more than something like electricity , because it replaces scarcity with abundance , so that any business built on scarcity is completely upturned as it arrives there , " Schmidt said .
" You have to plan your corporate strategy around what the internet does . "
There are now three fundamental technology trends , he said : the growth of mobile internet connectivity , the growth of cloud computing and networking .
" Mobile is the hottest area of computer technology , " Schmidt said .
" The smartest developers now are writing apps for mobile before they write for Windows or Apple Mac desktop operating systems .
Part of that is because these devices are hugely personal to us when we use them . "
Asked what he thought of the future of newspapers , Schmidt said : " What does the newsreading experience look like many years from now ?
I think it 's delivered to a digital device , which has text , obviously , but also colour , and video , and the ability to dig very deeply into what you are supplied with .
At the moment we have readers , but it 's not intelligent enough ; newspapers often tell me what I already know .
We 'll have advertising products that are much more media - centric .
The most important thing is that it will be more personalised . "
But Schmidt refused to condemn paywalls , such as the Times's , which goes into operation from today – despite Rupert Murdoch having described Google as a " thief and a parasite " for its indexing operation of the Times site .
Interviewed by Alan Rusbridger , the Guardian 's editor - in - chief , Schmidt said he had an " extremely good relationship " with Murdoch , head of News International , and that he had " not asked or expected " an apology for the description .
" At Google we want to offer every publisher pieces for you to do with as you see fit , " he said .
" Murdoch 's comment was really about paywalls .
There 's a dispute in the [ news ] industry about subscriptions versus advertising .
We want to enable both , and let users choose .
But there are many publishers with large sites which have been offered the choice to go to a paywall , but do n't , because they reckon they can make it work .
Others want a subscription because that 's the model they 're used to . "
But he said that newspapers faced real challenges because " they 're replacing analogue dollars with digital cents , and a lot of people are losing their jobs as a result .
It 's much less bad here in Britain , perhaps because of the history of newspapers here , but in the US there are unhappy people who are losing audience at a faster and faster rate . "
Instead , he said , organisations should build their strategies around the internet – and especially mobile .
" The corollary of ' internet first ' is ' mobile first ' , " he said .
But he said that the improved targeting of news and information , possibly with more personalised services , " opens fundamental questions : news will become more personal , because we will be reading what we know we 're interested in .
But is that too narrow ?
How does serendipity occur ?
Does that personalisation narrow our social view ?
If you follow the results of studies , it turns out that can lead to all sorts of biases .
I do n't know the answer , but to me this is a very fundamental question . "
Asked what keeps him awake at night – and what will eventually kill Google – Schmidt , an industry veteran , replied : " Almost all deaths in the IT industry are self - inflicted .
Large - scale companies make mistakes because they do n't continue to innovate .
For example , ' nowness ' – real - time information – is a new concept that was n't around when Google started , or even a few years ago .
Now we integrate it into our searches .
" My fundamental fear about Google is that we have the same feature as other companies , which is that we lose that edge .
If you lose that edge ...
But I think that will be a long , long time from now .
External threats are likely to come from a truly innovative company that builds itself a big enough business quickly enough that we can't catch it .
It 's not different from other industries in that sense , except that in IT it happens so fast .
" The next great success will be built even faster than Google , and the one after that even faster .
It 's just how it is . "

Image 6 of 6 Lance Armstrong responds to the allegations made by his former US Postal Service teammate Floyd Landis ( Image credit : Jonathan Devich )
While the federal investigation into Floyd Landis 's allegations against Lance Armstrong and the former US Postal team continues , media attention surrounding the details of his time in the squad gathers momentum .
The Wall Street Journal published new revelations of alleged doping practices early Saturday , just prior to the start of the Tour de France .
Several months ago Landis provided the publication with details of secret blood transfusions during the 2004 Tour de France , training camps in St Moritz with banned doctor Michele Ferrari , lavish parties featuring strippers in addition to the sale of team bikes to fund doping practices .
Landis also told the paper that after his ill - fated 2006 Tour de France campaign , Armstrong had advised him to deny taking performance - enhancing substances , while Garmin - Transitions boss and former US Postal rider Jonathan Vaughters had invited him to stay in New York to avoid the pressure cooker situation that had arisen , and told him he should ' come clean ' about everything he had done .
Landis also revealed several situations where US Postal riders had transfused blood , namely at the 2004 edition of the Tour , which was convincingly won by Armstrong .
The first instance allegedly took place in a hotel in Saint - Léonard - de - Noblat on July 12 , the first rest day of that year 's race .
According to Landis ' account , staff members ' guarded ' the hotel hallway , riders were told not to talk inside the room and elaborate measures had been taken to obscure the view of any possible hidden cameras .
While not hiding the fact he had taken a blood transfusion himself , Landis also alleged that he had seen members of the US Postal team partaking in the procedure in the room .
Armstrong and Team RadioShack manager ( former US Postal team manager ) Johan Bruyneel have constantly denied all of Landis ' allegations , including those outlining doping during the 2004 Tour de France .
While the Wall Street Journal said that some riders from the team have explained what they saw , others have vehemently denied ever using performance - enhancing drugs .
Landis also recalled a training camp that had taken place during 2002 in St Moritz , known by riders as a haunt of now - banned physician Dr Michele Ferrari .
Over a period of weeks , the Italian would follow training rides with Armstrong and Landis and monitor the riders ' performance before they went to the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré where they finished first and second respectively .
According to the Journal , Landis returned to St. Moritz at the behest of team manager Bruyneel , where he was given testosterone patches for recovery and had blood extracted - by Dr Ferrari - to be used at the Tour de France several weeks later .
During that race Landis said he had one blood transfusion and received a $ 40,000 bonus for helping Armstrong win his fourth Tour .
He was also offered a two - season , $ 200,000 per year contract .
The second instance , also detailed in e-mails sent out by Landis in May , recalled of US Postal doping at the Tour in 2004 , when the team 's bus stopped on a mountainside road , and while the driver appeared to be fixing a ' broken ' engine riders lay on the bus ' long benches - or in Armstrong 's case , on its floor - and transfused blood , with the bags taped to the sides of the bus cabin .
Perhaps the most surprising new allegation revealed in the story details Landis discovering , following a request for a new bike after a problem with his own at Paris - Nice , that not all the team 's
Trek bikes were making their way to the squad members .
Bruyneel allegedly revealed that the some 60 bikes not used by the squad were being sold to fund its doping program .
According to the Wall Street Journal , federal investigators called the company , which revealed that indeed bikes went missing and would be seen for sale on the internet .
Trek 's general counsel , Robert Burns , did n't provide details whether the company sought the purpose of the sale of its bikes .
Finally , Landis explained that he had undertaken a ' self - organised ' doping program after leaving US Postal , culminating in his provisional victory at the 2006 Tour de France and subsequent rescinding of the win .
He told the paper that he had approached then - Phonak team boss Andy Rihs about the program , although the Swiss businessman has denied that he knew of Landis ' actions .
In the world of political journalism , it 's the end of an era : Helen Thomas has retired just months shy of her 90th birthday .
The longtime White House journalist has covered every president since Dwight Eisenhower and broke several barriers for female journalists but stepped down from her latest role -- a columnist for Hearst Newspapers -- in the wake of controversial remarks made in late May about the need for Jews to " get the hell out of Palestine " and return to Poland and Germany .
" Helen Thomas announced Monday that she is retiring , effective immediately , " read a statement from Hearst Newspapers on Monday .
" Her decision came after her controversial comments about Israel and the Palestinians were captured on videotape and widely disseminated on the Internet . "
Thomas said in a statement that , " I deeply regret my comments I made last week regarding the Israelis and the Palestinians .
They do not reflect my heart - felt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance .
May that day come soon . ’’
The decision to retire came as Thomas faced rebuke from nearly every corner after video of her remarks during an interview with RabbiLive.com 's Rabbi David Nesenoff emerged online late last week .
" Those remarks were offensive and reprehensible , " Gibbs said during the Monday briefing , adding that Thomas 's remarks " do not reflect certainly most of the people here and certainly not those of the administration . "
Thomas did not attend Monday 's briefing and journalists , perhaps sensing the closing of an era , were spotted taking pictures of Thomas ' empty front row .
Over the weekend , Thomas ' agency dropped her as a client and a high school that had asked Thomas to speak at its commencement ceremony revoked the invitation .
Such political bigwigs as Dana Perino , Ari Fleischer , Rep. Rick Lazio , Lanny Davis and Joe Lockhart denounced Thomas ' remarks , as did many Jewish organizations .
During Thomas ' fifty - seven years as a correspondent for United Press International , Thomas earned a reputation as a tough questioner willing to put the feet of politicians to the fire , while simultaneously becoming a whipping boy for conservatives who objected to her liberal viewpoints and , later , for her privileged position within the White House press corps ( the middle seat in the front row was -- first by protocol and then by mandate -- designated for Thomas ) .
She became the first female officer of the National Press Club as well as the first female member of the White House Correspondents Association and the Gridiron Club .
When UPI was acquired by News World Communications , Inc. in 2000 , Thomas resigned from the organization and later joined Hearst Newspapers as a columnist , where she covered national affairs .

Abstract
Numerous incidents of aspen decline have been recorded in North America over the past half century , and incidents of very rapid mortality of aspen clones have been observed in Colorado since 2004 .
The radio frequency ( RF ) environment of the earth has undergone major changes in the past two centuries due to the development and use of electricity in power and communications applications , and the anthropogenic RF background continues to increase in intensity and complexity .
This study suggests that the RF background may have strong adverse effects on growth rate and fall anthocyanin production in aspen , and may be an underlying factor in aspen decline .
1. Introduction
Incidents of aspen decline in North America have been observed since the mid-20th Century [ 1 –3 ] .
Stands at the limits of aspen ’s lower elevation range , on sites with poor drainage , with limited water [ 4 ] or nutrient supply [ 5 ] , are more susceptible to decline .
Stand age and clonal differences are also factors in susceptibility to decline [ 6 ] .
Factors initiating decline include : defoliation by insects , damage caused by wildlife , severe drought , and extreme weather incidents [ 7 ] .
Damage caused by these factors can diminish the vigor of affected clones and make them vulnerable to opportunistic fungal pathogens and insects [ 8 ] .
The concept of forest decline has been used to describe the interaction of these various factors ; however , the underlying causes of aspen decline are not well understood [ 9 ] .
Since 2004 , incidents of very rapid aspen clone mortality have been seen in Colorado [ 10 ] .
Because the electromagnetic ( EM ) environment of the earth has changed radically in the past two centuries , this study investigates the possibility that anthropogenic changes in this environment , particularly in the radio frequency ( RF ) spectrum , are adversely affecting growth and health of aspen populations , making them vulnerable to decline .
Electromagnetic energy from the sun is essential for life on earth .
Plants rely on inputs of EM energy for photosynthesis and for regulation of periodic functions ( flowering , shoot and root growth , respiration , and dormancy ) .
A plant ’s response to EM energy is dependant on frequency , timing , and intensity of the signal .
The source of the EM input , however , makes no difference .
Timing of plant processes is an important mechanism for plant protection and efficient functioning in changing day / night and seasonal environmental conditions [ 11 ] .
Although photosynthesis requires fairly strong energy input in the blue and red visual frequencies ( full sun / shade ) [ 12 ] , photoperiodic responses in plants are typically triggered by energy inputs in the red and far - red frequencies that are in the range of 10−4 times the energy required for photosynthesis , and even a brief flash of light during a plant ’s subjective night can be enough to trigger a short night response , strongly affecting plant behavior and morphology [ 13 ] .
The radio frequencies , lower than 300 gigahertz , are below visual and infrared frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum .
The earth ’s natural RF environment has a complex periodicity that has been more or less the same within the lifespan of modern tree taxa .
Before 1800 , the major components of this environment were broadband radio noise from space ( galactic noise ) , from lightning ( atmospheric noise ) , and a smaller RF component from the sun [ 14 ] .
Because of the periodic nature of the naturally occurring RF background , plants may have evolved to use those environmental signals , as well as visible light , to regulate periodic functions , and therefore they may be sensitive to anthropogenic RF input .
The intensity of the human - generated RF environment has increased gradually since about 1800 .
This background of RF pollution is now many times stronger than the naturally occurring RF environment .
From the perspective of evolutionary time , the change can be considered sudden and dramatic [ 14 , 15 ] .
Many experiments have been conducted investigating possible effects of RF exposure on plants and animals .
Generally , exposures to particular single frequencies at particular , usually fairly high intensities , have been used in these previous experiments [ 16 ] .
However , the assumption seems to have been made that the low - level background of RF pollution has no effect on biological systems .
Therefore , not only has this particular phenomenon not been studied , but it has been generally disregarded in earlier experiments designed to look for effects of RF exposure .
Results of those previous experiments are often difficult to duplicate , and it may be that the anthropogenic RF background has been a confounding factor .
However , for some RF effects on biological systems , consistent results have been documented in previous experiments : growth rates of plants [ 17 ] and fungi [ 18 ] can be increased or decreased by RF exposure .
Exposure to RF signals can induce plants to produce more meristems [ 19 ] , affect root cell structure [ 20 , 21 ] , and induce stress response in plant species , causing biochemical changes [ 22 ] .
Effects on circadian rhythms in several animal species have been documented [ 23 ] .
Some possible mechanisms of effect have been identified [ 24 ] .
This experiment investigates the effects of the radio frequency background on aspen seedlings .
The objective of this preliminary study was to determine if aspens respond to the current RF background in ways that result in reduced growth , or in increased susceptibility to pathogens .
1.1. Study Area
The experiment was conducted in a rural area near Lyons , Colorado : at 40.29 Latitude and − 105.28 Longitude , at an altitude of 1,700 meters , and on a north - facing slope .
The ecological system in the area of the experiment is Rocky Mountain Lower Montane .
The site was about 400 meters below the lower elevation of aspen ’s natural range in Colorado .
The north - facing slope was chosen as a somewhat cooler microclimate than other aspects .
Vegetation included various grasses , which were mowed on the 8 × 10 m experimental plot .
Vegetation in the east , south , and west directions from the experiment included : wild grasses and various low shrubs , rabbit brush ( Chrysothamnus nauseosus ) , sage ( Artemisia tridentata ) , wild currant ( Ribes cereum ) , chokecherry ( Prunus virginiana ) , yucca ( Yucca angustifolia ) , and skunkbush ( Rhus trilobata ) .
North of the experiment , there were large cottonwood trees along the river , with grass and chokecherry undergrowth .
1.2 . Materials and Methods
In order to create an environment free of RF signals , a Faraday cage was built , using two layers of aluminum window screen supported by a bamboo frame .
Cage dimensions were 75 cm by 75 cm by 120 cm .
The aluminum screen material in the configuration used for this experiment was tested at a laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) in Boulder , CO .
From 1.0 MHz to 3.0 GHz , its effectiveness in attenuating RF signals was found to vary from 40 dB to 73 dB across the entire range of frequencies ( Figure 1 ) .
Theoretically , an enclosure made of this material would reduce signal intensity by a factor of 10−4 to 10 − 7.3 , blocking essentially all ambient RF energy , including the naturally occurring RF background .
In practice , the shielding effectiveness of a Faraday cage made of this material could be somewhat less than that of the material itself due to gaps or imperfect electrical contact at seams and closures , and to the internal RF acoustical properties of the cage .
A similar cage was constructed as a control , with fiberglass screen , which is not conductive and which does not block RF signals , instead of aluminum .
A transistor radio was used to test the effectiveness of the cages to block the RF background .
No radio stations could be picked up inside the Faraday cage .
In both the mock - Faraday cage and the uncaged area , numerous stations were received in the AM and FM bands .
A sweep of RF background at the site , June 6 , 2009 , using an Anritsu spectrum analyzer , showed that field intensity ranged from − 117 dBm to − 87 dBm at frequencies from 1 to 1,000 MHz .
Mean field intensity was − 109 dBm .
On May 28 , 2007 , 30 aspen seedling plugs were obtained from the Colorado State Forest Service ( CSFS ) nursery in Fort Collins , Colorado .
Seed for these seedlings came from Caffey County near Salida Colorado , approximately 195 km SSW of the experiment site , at an elevation of about 2,100 meters .
The seeds were germinated in June 2006 at the CSFS Nursery , and the resulting seedlings were grown in a shade house in a Styrofoam planter - block of 30 seedling plugs .
The seedlings had leafed out in early spring and , when purchased on May 28 , 2007 , were not producing new leaves .
Seedlings were transplanted into no .
1 black gallon plastic pots on June 5 , 2007 using a commercial potting medium , Black Gold , composed of : 45 – 55 % Canadian sphagnum peat moss , compost , pumice , perlite , and composted worm castings ( N .05 % : water soluble .006 % , water insoluble .044 % ) .
Since only 27 seedlings were needed for the experiment , due to space restrictions , the three smallest seedlings were discarded .
The remaining seedlings were relatively uniform in height , stem diameter , and leaf development , and the leaves appeared healthy and green .
The 27 seedlings were assigned to 3 groups of 9 seedlings each , with variation in size distribution distributed equally among the 3 groups .
After potting , the three groups were photographed and randomly assigned to the mock - shielded cage , the shielded cage , or to the unshielded area .
The experiment began June 6 , 2007 .
All treatments in the experiment were exposed to full sun from sunrise to late afternoon .
There was a distance of three meters between treatment enclosures .
All seedlings in the experiment were watered at the same time 1 - 2 × per week , depending on the weather , using Lyons water .
Seedlings were watered with a weak solution of fertilizer ( 5 - 10 - 5 ) on July 29 , 2007 , and otherwise were not fertilized .
Two sets of a calibrated thermometer and humidity gauge were used to compare temperature and humidity readings between cages under various weather conditions and times of day and night .
The monitoring devices were placed in the middle of the monitored treatment enclosure , just above the top of the pots .
A board was placed south of the devices to provide shade .
A lux meter was used to measure light intensity in the treatment areas .
Shielding reduced light intensity by 35 % for the mock - shielded enclosure and 40 % for the RF - shielded enclosure .
Naturally occurring sunlight intensity was not reduced for the group that was not shielded .
Except for the difference in RF background intensity , conditions in the shielded and mock - shielded enclosures were very similar .
The unshielded seedlings were exposed to higher light levels ( full sun ) , higher airflow , and generally lower humidity than the shielded and mock - shielded treatments since they were not in a screened enclosure .
1.3 . Measurements
After seedlings were transplanted and placed in the three treatment enclosures in early June , they began to grow again .
Because of that , there was a shoot node dividing spring growth from the summer growth phase that was easy to identify .
Measurement of active leader ( shoot ) length was taken from the tip of the shoot down to that first shoot node , so leader length measured was only that produced after the experiment began on June 6 , 2007 .
For leaves emerging directly from a main stem , leader length was recorded as 0.00 cm .
On July 28 - 29 , 2007 , measurements of active leader length and width of each leaf on each active leader were made on all seedlings in the experiment .
Leaves had not begun to drop at that time , and the great majority of them in all treatment groups appeared healthy and green .
Leaf width was converted into estimated leaf area using an algorithm ( Leaf Area ( cm ) = 0.637 * Leaf Diameter ( cm ) ) developed by W.D. Shepperd of the USDA forest Service ’s Rocky Mountain Research Station [ 25 ] .
After measurements were taken , all seedlings were returned to their cages .
October 5 - 6 photos were taken showing differences in leaf coloration , and relative leaf area affected by necrotic lesions .
2. Results
Seven seedlings in each RF - exposed group and eight seedlings in the shielded group produced active leaders and new leaves during the experiment .
The RF shielded group evidenced more vigorous growth , producing 74 % more total leader length and 60 % more leaf area than the mock - shielded group , though the number of leaves produced by both groups was nearly the same ( Table 1 ) .
The two RF - exposed groups ’ morphology and behavior were very similar and within the current norm for aspen , including absence of fall anthocyanin production , and extensive leaf area affected by necrotic lesions in fall senescing leaves .
On active leaders , the shielded group showed fall production of anthocyanins far outside the norm , absence of fall leaf tissue necrotic lesions , and a wide range of fall colors : bright orange , yellow , green , dark red , and black ( a combination of dark green leaf tissue with red veins ) .
Shielded leaves produced in the spring flush ( before treatment ) , however , were similar in appearance to leaves in the two exposed groups in color , size , and incidence of lesions .
All of the shielded leaves on active leaders had dark to bright red veins and petioles indicating strong anthocyanin production ( Figure 2 ) .
On October 5 , 2007 , unshielded and mock - shielded seedlings had leaf tissue ranging in color from yellow to green , and a high percentage of leaf tissue in both exposed groups displayed necrotic lesions ( Figures 3 and 4 ) .
Shielded seedlings had larger leaves , petioles and leaf veins were red , and tissue colors varied from yellow to dark green ( Figure 5 ) .
Some shielded leaves looked black because of the combination of red veins and dark green tissue ( Figure 6 ) .
Leaves on active leaders in the shielded group were substantially free of leaf tissue lesions ( Figure 7 ) , but unshielded and mock - shielded leaves were all affected to some extent by leaf tissue necrosis ( Figure 8 ) .

3. Discussion
Because only one treatment enclosure was established for each treatment , differences among groups could not be analyzed statistically .
Results of this experiment do , however , suggest several possible effects of RF exposure on aspen .
Those effects include reduction of shoot length and leaf area , suppression of fall anthocyanin production , and increased incidence of necrotic leaf tissue in fall senescing leaves .
Reduced vigor in the two RF - exposed groups is demonstrated by lower total leader length and diminished production of leaf area relative to the shielded group .
A study [ 26 ] comparing mutant nonanthocyanin- producing strains of fall anthocyanin - producing species , Cornus sericea , Vaccinium elliottii , and Viburnum sargentii , showed very similar results to this experiment with regard to fall color in that extensive necrotic leaf tissue was seen in nonanthocyanin - producing mutants during fall leaf senescence and leaves dropped while still green .
Wild - type strains of those species , which produced anthocyanins , did not exhibit necrotic lesions .
In that study , leaf tissue damage in mutant strains was shown to be caused by photooxidative stress .
During fall leaf senescence photosynthetic mechanisms become vulnerable to damage by visible light .
Anthocyanins shield the photosynthetic apparatus from high light levels , preventing photoinhibition and damage to leaf tissue due to light stress .
Transport of foliar nutrients requires energy provided by photosynthesis [ 27 ] , and since the majority of nutrients in overwintering deciduous trees are derived from foliar nutrient transport during autumn leaf senescence , differences in anthocyanin production could have major effects on plant fitness [ 28 ] .
Since all leaves on active leaders in the shielded aspen group showed striking fall coloration , and since each of the seedlings was genetically distinct , it appears that the Faraday cage environment favored strong production of anthocyanins during fall leaf senescence .
Five bright sunny days , Sept. 30 –Oct. 4 , accompanied by cool nights ( ~5 C ) preceding the appearance of red leaf coloration , provided optimal conditions for anthocyanin production .
Although shielding materials substantially reduced light levels in the two caged groups ( mock - shielded and shielded ) , the behavior and appearance of the two RF - exposed groups ( mock - shielded and unshielded ) were most similar , both showing no apparent anthocyanin production , leaf tissue remaining light green or yellow , and a high percentage of leaf tissue affected by necrotic lesions .
3.1 . Radio Frequency Environment
Beginning around 1800 , EM experimentation , establishment of electrical telegraph systems , generation and distribution of electricity , and the use of broadcast signals gradually began to fill the region of the electromagnetic spectrum below 300 GHz .
Currently , the RF spectrum is quite crowded , and new technologies are constantly being developed to allow more information to be transmitted on the available frequencies [ 29 ] .
Unintended broadband RF noise is created as a by - product of electrical power generation , transmission , and use .
These human - made RF sources create a background noise ( as differentiated from signal ) level generally 10 to 100 times stronger than the naturally occurring background of galactic noise and atmospheric noise at frequencies below 30 MHz [ 14 ] .
Human - generated signal intensities in large regions of the RF spectrum are in the range of 103–106 times stronger than the naturally occurring RF background in urban areas [ 15 ] .
Because terrestrial and satellite RF sources are numerous and widely dispersed globally , and since below 30 MHz radio signals can travel great distances around the earth by bouncing between the ionosphere and the earth ’s surface [ 14 ] , currently a strong human - generated RF background exists at every point on the earth ’s surface , although radio field strength is relatively greater in the most populous and urbanized areas .
Globally , the highest field strengths occur in central Europe , the eastern United States , and in China ( Figure 9 ) .
Forest decline was first recognized and defined based on observed events in central Europe and the eastern US , and China , at this time , is experiencing rapid desertification .
3.2 . Forest Decline
The first widely recognized incidents of forest decline [ 30 ] began in the late 1970s .
In a European study [ 31 ] , stress factors related to forest defoliation were found to be age , altitude , drought , and various types of air pollution , in descending order of importance .
Although the statistical correlation was high for some of these effects , because the number of samples was large , the effects documented were quite small and altogether could account for only 15 – 55 % of the observed decline , depending on species .
No temperature variables were found to have significant effects .
In several studies , climate change was found not to be a causal agent in forest decline [ 32 , 33 ] .
There is evidence , however , that trees involved in forest decline are less tolerant of extreme weather conditions .
Freeze damage , possibly indicating disrupted dormancy , for instance , has been noted as one symptom of forest decline where temperature and / or precipitation pattern changes were not evident [ 32 , 34 ] .
More recently , it has been shown that mortality rates of all dominant tree species in the western United States have been doubling every 17 – 29 years in old growth forests , and that recruitment of new trees is now occurring at a lower rate than mortality [ 35 ] .
Since aspen decline and other tree decline incidents worldwide have similar symptoms , and since no definitive explanation has been found for those events , it seems plausible that their decline may be related to RF exposure .
Changes in health and growth rates of aspen and other plants , due to increasing RF exposure , would have been difficult to detect for two reasons : first , because the RF background is widely dispersed globally , comparisons between plant populations , even over great distances , would always have been between RF - exposed groups , even though exposure levels would vary with relative proximity to RF sources .
Second , it is difficult to compare the health and appearance of plants living today to those living 200 years ago , though some comparisons can be made from previous research data , tree ring data , and pollen samples , for instance .
Changes would have occurred very slowly over time , from the human perspective , and would have been widely dispersed geographically so that , at any particular time , RF - altered plant morphology and behavior would have been normal , the norm , by definition .
Plants and animals have in previous experiments been shown to respond in various ways to RF exposure .
Growth of organisms may be inhibited or accelerated by RF exposure , thus possibly affecting interactions at the level of communities and ecosystems from microscopic to global scales .
In the case of aspen , reduced plant vigor and adverse effects on fall storage of nutrients due to RF exposure could leave seedlings vulnerable to pathogens and less able to accommodate other environmental stress .
4. Conclusions
The results of this preliminary experiment indicate that the RF background may be adversely affecting leaf and shoot growth and inhibiting fall production of anthocyanins associated with leaf senescence in trembling aspen seedlings .
These effects suggest that exposure to the RF background may be an underlying factor in the recent rapid decline of aspen populations .
Further studies are underway to test this hypothesis in a more rigorous way .

In a shooter landscape increasingly populated with sprawling openworld environments and RPG excess , it 's sometimes refreshing to find a game willing to rein it all in and focus on nailing the " tightly crafted " experience .
No tedious grinding , no pointless padding or waffling generic characters , just an absorbing episodic journey peppered with memorable set - pieces , an interesting cast and ever - present narrative intrigue .
It certainly worked for Half - Life , so Metro 2033 's combination of this cinematic approach with the post - apocalyptic dystopia of Fallout certainly has an obvious allure .
Based on the best - selling Dmitry Glukovsky novel of the same name , Metro 2033 sees you playing as Artyom , an unlikely hero born in the days before the apocalyptic events of two decades prior .
Forced to scratch out a desperate subterranean battle for survival in the sprawling tendrils of the Moscow underground metro network , it soon transpires that Artyom has developed a unique immunity to the strange psychic attacks by the ' Dark Ones ' which prowl the tunnels .
Sent out on a desperate mission to warn the remnants of mankind about this menace , he gets rather more than he bargained for .
Facing a barrage of vicious mutants , merciless bandits , Russian Neo -Nazis , and a routinely inhospitable environment , every step of the journey is fraught with the kind of ever - present danger normally associated with an ill - advised night out in Barking .
Leaving the austere surroundings of his ' home ' station , you depart with little more than a gas mask , torch , hand charger , compass , map case and a selection of battered weaponry ( think pistol , shotgun , machine gun , grenades ) and home - made ammo .
Exploring the fetid tunnels and abandoned stations en-route to your destination , Metro 2033 settles into a groove that 's a curious blend of run-and - gun and survival horror .
Perhaps the most striking element of the game is the atmosphere it creates , aided no end by 4A 's mastery of every audio trick in the book .
The rising , claustrophobic dread from hearing your own suppressed breathing and heartbeat inside the gas mask fills every tentative step into the inky gloom with mortal danger .
Elsewhere , the permanent sense of unhinged malevolence from screeching discordant strings , clanking bells and crying children make it impossible to stop for a moment and gather your thoughts .
It 's almost preferable just to keep moving , to block out the otherworldly hum that emanates from some indefinable noxious corner of the netherworld you inhabit .
With resources in extremely short supply , the need to manually scavenge and loot every corpse you come across becomes an essential part of the proceedings .
Being so hard to come by , military grade ammo has become this subterranean economy 's currency of choice .
You can either jealously hoard it for your own use as a more powerful alternative to the rather craptastic home - made ammo scattered around , or risk trading them in for upgrades and more powerful weaponry .
One of the key Bush administration lawyers in the evolution of the CIA ’s interrogation program cast doubt on whether the Justice Department approved some of the harsh steps the agency took to get terrorist suspects to talk .
Former Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee ’s remarks were contained in a transcript sent to the special prosecutor investigating CIA interrogations by House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich . , who also made a copy public on Thursday .
ADVERTISEMENT
Interviewed by Judiciary Committee members on May 26 , Bybee stressed the limits that he helped set on how far the CIA could go while at the same time acknowledging that his legal advice helped pave the way for tactics such as waterboarding , which evokes the sensation of drowning .
“ I do wish to repeat that we said on page 2 of the techniques memo … that repetition will not be substantial ” on waterboarding , Bybee reminded the committee in quoting from one of his own legal memoranda .
The professed mastermind of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , was waterboarded 183 times .
Terrorist suspect Abu Zubaydah was subjected to the procedure at least 83 times .
“ We were not given any number of sessions as a range by the CIA , ” Bybee told the committee .
Now a federal appeals court judge , Bybee said there is “ ambiguity ” as to whether 83 and 183 refer to the number of times water was poured on a detainee , the number of sessions in which waterboarding was used or something else .
ADVERTISEMENT
What the Justice Department lawyers advised was that if “ there are substantial repetitions , we told the CIA ‘ you do n’t have a legal opinion from us ' ” providing legal protection for an interrogator ’s conduct , Bybee said .
Bybee was the head of the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , which has been criticized by Bush administration critics as an enabler for abuse rather than a traffic cop telling the CIA not to violate legal prohibitions on torture .
Bybee ’s statements “ are highly relevant to the pending criminal investigation of detainee abuse , and I have provided the committee ’s interview to the Justice Department , ” Conyers said in a statement .
ADVERTISEMENT
The committee ’s top Republican , Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas , said he appreciated Bybee ’s “ thorough effort to be truthful and forthcoming . ”
Smith said the Democrats ’ agenda was to criticize Bush administration policies “ that kept America safe . ”
In response Thursday , CIA spokesman George Little said : “ Opinions from the Office of Legal Counsel were the foundation for the CIAs past detention and interrogation practices .
That program , now over , has been Ã¢â‚¬â€ and continues to be Ã¢â‚¬â€ the subject of extensive review by the Department of Justice , among others .
As the attorney general has said , the focus is to see if anyone involved in the program may have gone beyond the legal guidance Justice provided . ”

Last August , Attorney General Eric Holder appointed federal prosecutor John Durham to look into abuse allegations after the release of an internal CIA inspector general ’s report that revealed agency interrogators once threatened to kill a 9/11 terror suspect ’s children and suggested another would be forced to watch his mother be sexually assaulted .
President Barack Obama has said interrogators would not face charges if they followed legal guidelines .
However , the inspector general ’s report said some CIA interrogators went beyond Bush administration restrictions that gave them wide latitude to use severe tactics , including waterboarding .
Three high - level suspects underwent waterboarding scores of times .
The American Civil Liberties Union , whose Freedom of Information lawsuit helped make some of the interrogation documents public , said the criminal investigation should be expanded .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Judge Bybee ’s testimony underscores what we ’ve been saying for a long time : that the Justice Department should be conducting an investigation that encompasses not just low - level interrogators but senior government officials who authorized torture , ” said Jameel Jaffer , ACLU deputy legal director .
Bush administration officials obtained legal advice on the CIA ’s interrogation tactics by bringing lists of planned techniques , or assumptions , to Bybee ’s office for analysis .
Bybee was questioned on whether his office gave specific authorization for reported practices such as dousing detainees with water and repetitive noise or loud music to keep prisoners awake .
“ So if these things occurred , dousing with cold water , subjecting to loud music to keep people from falling asleep , if that occurred , that means they were done without specific OLC authorization ? ”
Bybee was asked .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ That ’s right , ” Bybee replied .
“ So the answer is ‘ yes ? ’ ” a questioner asked .
“ Those techniques were not authorized , ” Bybee replied .
Bybee subsequently modified his statements .
ADVERTISEMENT
Under questioning about some of the reported techniques , Bybee said “ the assumptions on which we were given this were not authorized specifically ” by OLC .
The transcript shows that Bybee later proposed a change in his testimony to say that “ if the assumptions that we were given changed , they were not authorized specifically ” by OLC lawyers .

In the end , it was n’t even close :
Among the most curious what - if scenarios in Tuesday night ’s primary was the possibility that Orly Taitz , widely known as the Birther Queen , might win the Republican primary for secretary of state in California .
It was n’t even close .
Former NFL player Damon Dunn beat Taitz by about 3 - to - 1 . He will face Democratic incumbent Debra Bowen in the fall .
Taitz gained national attention for filing lawsuits alleging President Barack Obama was not born in the U.S. and therefore was ineligible for the highest office in the land .
Taitz fared poorly on a night when GOP women generally performed well at the polls .

It 's no secret that the use of difficult CAPTCHAs ( Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart ) in Web forms can confound ordinary people , drop conversion rates , and increase errors in addition to ( hopefully ! ) keeping the bad guys out of your site .
As a result , I 'm always interested in alternatives to standard CAPTCHA techniques .
Once such approach brought to my attention recently can be found on They Make Apps .
Instead of the distorted text strings that typify most modern CAPTCHAs ( above ) , the sign up form on They Make Apps uses a slider that asks people to : " show us your human side ; slide the cursor to the end of the line to create your account . "
Moving the slider to the right completely submits the form and triggers error validation just like a standard Submit button would .
I do n't have any data that suggests this implementation impacts conversion rates ( up or down ) .
It does n't seem to cover accessibility issues since it requires a mouse or drag gesture to work ( no keyboard support ) .
And at large scale , it wo n't keep spammers out effectively .
CAPTCHA busting farms already employ human labor to crack distorted text CAPTCHAs at incredibly cheap rates ( moving a slider would be even faster & easier ) and it's likely trivial to develop a script that will adjust the slider automatically to submit the form .
But it is still nice to see people exploring different approaches .
The growing debate over Islam 's place in America , which is escalating in light of plans to build a mosque near ground zero , is increasingly playing out on city streets across the country .
On the sides of buses , to be precise .
Several groups are engaging in something of a religious ad war over the merits and misconceptions of Islam , a religion that remains a mystery to many Americans .
Ads by a group calling itself Stop Islamization of America , which aims to provide refuge for former Muslims , read : " Fatwa on your head ?
Is your family or community threatening you ?
Leaving Islam ?
Got questions ?
Get answers ! "
IN PICTURES : Billboards around the world
Those ads , appearing on dozens of buses in the San Francisco Bay Area , Miami , and New York , are a response to ones from a Muslim group that say , " The way of life of Adam , Noah , Abraham , Moses , Jesus and Muhammad .
Islam .
Got questions ?
Get answers . "
In New York , the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community sponsored this campaign : " Muslims for Peace .
Love for All – Hatred for None . "
The ads are part of a larger conversation over Islam 's image , which Muslim organizations say has been hurt by extremists both at home and abroad .
But many conservative groups say that concern about the spread of Islam is n't alarmist , pointing to evidence of imams in this country inciting militancy and a growing number of American Muslims arrested for plotting terror attacks .
A self - described " anti-jihadist , " Pamela Geller is the conservative blogger and executive director of Stop Islamization of America who conceived of the " Leaving Islam " ad campaign .
Her bus posters , she says , were partly inspired by the ongoing Florida case involving a teenage girl who ran away from her Muslim parents after converting to Christianity .
The girl , Rifqa Bary , made headlines last year when she claimed her father threatened to kill her for becoming a Christian .
Ms. Geller described her campaign as " a defense of religious freedom , " in an e-mail response to questions .
The goal , she says , is mainly " to help ex-Muslims who are in trouble " and also " to raise awareness of the threat that apostates live under even in the West . "
But some religious rights organizations contend that the real intent is to incite fear about a faith that , according to recent studies , remains misunderstood .
A 2009 poll by the Pew Research Center found that 38 percent believe Islam is more likely to encourage violence than other religions .
" In this post - 9/11 world … it 's almost like there 's some political and spiritual currency to be gained by being anti-Islamic , " says Steve Spreitzer , programs director for the Detroit - based interfaith group Michigan Roundtable for Diversity and Inclusion .
RefugeFromIslam.com , the website promoted on Geller 's ads , contends that Muslim Americans who " long to be free " of their religion are in danger of being killed , and offers protection , including " safe houses , " for those who want out .
Muslim rights groups and religious leaders say there is no penalty for leaving Islam and that the Koran condemns killing as a sin .
The campaign has whipped up controversy in several cities .
In Detroit , which has one of the highest Muslim populations in the country , Geller sued the SMART transit agency in federal district court after it rejected the ads .
In the Bay Area , more than 125 religious leaders of various faiths signed a statement in July denouncing the ads as " Islamophobic " and saying they " promote fear of Muslim Americans . "
Geller says calling the ads anti-Islam is " a tactic to divert attention " away from the " plight " of ex-Muslims .
In Florida , the Miami - Dade Transit agency initially pulled the ads but then reinstated them days later after Geller and her group threatened to sue .
Miami -Dade Transit spokeswoman Karla Damian says the county attorney had reviewed the ad campaign and determined that " although considered offensive by some , it did not constitute removal . "
And in the Bay Area , where both tolerance and free speech are regarded as sacred , the 30 bus ads that recently began rolling through San Mateo County have been met with surprise and bewilderment .
Omar Ahmad , a Muslim city council member in San Mateo who also sits on the board of directors for SamTrans , the bus agency running the ads , says he found the campaign " bizarre " but did n't think it would have much effect .
" I have a great deal of faith in folks in the Bay Area to take a critical eye to what they see and read , " he says .
Geller and her supporters point out that transit agencies in Detroit and elsewhere had no problem with a controversial campaign sponsored by a group of atheists last year .
Those ads , also on buses and billboards in many cities , read : " Do n't believe in God ?
You 're not alone . "
Although the ads offended some , they were deemed free speech .
The ads in New York City sponsored by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community recently began appearing on 100 New York City buses and promote the website MuslimsForPeace.org , which condemns terrorism and advocates for a separation of church and state .
Waseem Sayed , Ahmadiyya Muslim Community spokesperson , says the campaign is not a response to Geller 's ads but an ongoing effort to reclaim the public image of Islam , which he says has been " hijacked by extremists . "
" It 's an effort to have the Muslims , the silent majority , snatch the flag of Islam away from these extremists and hoist it above ourselves , " he says .

Oh hell nah son !
this 3 - D printer concept is a personal food factory that fuses the digital world with the realm of cooking by storing , precisely mixing , depositing , and cooking layers of ingredients with no waste .
Cornucopias ' printing process begins with an array of food canisters filled with the " cook 's " foods of choice .
After a meal selection has been made using the device 's multi - touch translucent screen , users are able to see their meal being assembled while simultaneously manipulating real - time parameters , such as calories or carbohydrate content .
Each ingredient is then piped into a mixer and then very precisely extruded , allowing for very exact and elaborate combinations of food .
Once each ingredient has been dropped , the food is then heated or cooled by Cornucopia 's chamber or via the heating and cooling tubes located on the printing head .
Mmmm , that sounds .... like Taco Bell .

LuxRender using GPU with SmallLuxGPU for Architecture
In a few months the use of GPU power to render scenes will be just like a global illumination render is today .
Almost all tools specialized on rendering offers some kind of GI method to improve rendering .
I still remember that a few years ago it was quite expansive to get GI renders .
By the end of the 90â€™s only a bunch of tools had that .
A couple years on the future we may have the same happening with GPU render .
Today I will talk about SmallLuxGPU , which is an experiment to implement GPU Render in LuxRender .
The first time I mentioned the use of LuxRender to render scenes with GPU Power , SmallLuxGPU was still an experiment from David Bucciarelli .
In the past few weeks the tool was upgraded and it is now in version 1.50 , showing some amazing render speeds and managing complex scenes .
The video below is a demo of SmallLuxGPU rendering a few scenes , including some of the scenes used to show Arion Render and even iRay from mental images .
SmallLuxGPU v1.5 ( OpenCL ) from David Bucciarelli on Vimeo .
Visit this link to know more about SmallLuxGPU .
By the time we see LuxRays , we may have a dramatically decrease on Render times for projects using LuxRender .
For me , I think itâ€™s time to upgrade my GPU .
I only have 112 cores to render !
Itâ€™s not enough .
The wrong way to deal with privacy concerns · 2010 - 05 - 26 14:30 by Wladimir Palant
Generally , I am not the guy to pick on Google .
I think that they usually bring out very solid ( often brilliant ) solutions and do a good job on the privacy front ( meaning : far from perfect but significantly better than the competition ) .
All the more surprising was their release of the Google Analytics Opt- out Browser Add - on which does n’t quite live up to the expected quality .
I had a look at the Firefox version and here is what I saw :
It does n’t do anything whatsoever to prevent the Google Analytics script from being downloaded .
Even with it installed , this script is still downloaded from Google ’s servers which means that Google gets some data on you .
And it could theoretically still set cookies ( which it currently does n’t , Analytics generally works with first - party cookies only ) .
The extension sets a global variable and it is up to the script to check for its existence and obey ( not send additional data to Google ) .
While it currently does that and it is unlikely that this will change — this still requires users to trust Google thus defeating the entire purpose of such an add -on .
What weights more for me personally is the fact that a website can easily override the global variable .
So if a webmaster is really insistent on having each single user counted , he can still do it even if some users have this add - on installed .
I expect the versions for other browsers to work in a similar way , complete with placebo functionality .
I can sort of understand why they had to implement it this way — if properly blocking the Analytics script were a requirement they would n’t be able to implement a version for Chrome any longer .
And then there is the issue of websites that rely heavily on Analytics and break if that script is blocked — can only be solved by “ redirecting ” the request to a minimal local copy of the script without any functionality , again something that can only be done properly in Firefox .
Still , until Google can come up with something better I recommend people to use Adblock Plus with EasyPrivacy filter subscription , that ’s the easy and reliable solution ( check the update below ) .
Update : Sorry , that last part was n’t entirely correct — EasyPrivacy does n’t block Google Analytics script either , due to many websites being broken without it as mentioned above .
It only blocks the subsequent request to Google , effectively the same as Google ’s add - on ( minus the part where websites can influence that behavior ) .
If you want to have it blocked entirely you should add ||google - analytics.com^ to your filter list manually .

Not many of today 's Linux users remember the days when you could ( and sometimes had to ) compile your own kernel .
If you had a special device or special needs for the kernel there was no other way to get it to work .
Today most kernels work out of the box with most hardware .
But there are times when you could squeeze out a bit more performance or even lighten your kernel on the fly .
You can do that with the sysctl command .
This command allows you to turn on or off numerous kernel parameters on the fly or you can edit a specific file to tune those same parameters .
Either way you can modify all of the parameters listed in / proc /sys , so if you would like to see just how much you can modify , take a look at each of the subdirectories under the / proc / sys directory .
For example , you can change the number of the maximum file descriptors on your machine by tuning the kern .
maxfiles parameter .
NOTE : You will definitely want to exercise caution when toying with this command as it could , upon modifying any given parameter in the wrong way , cause data loss or worse .
Usage
The basic usage of the command is sysctl OPTIONS PARAMETER VARIABLE .
The variable for a parameter will be in the form of either boolean , string , or numbers .
You must run this command as either the root user or with the help of sudo .
One of the first things you might want to do is to issue the command sudo sysctl - a .
This command will display all of the tunable variables on your machine .
The list will look something like this :
kernel.sched_min_granularity_ns = 2000000
kernel.sched_latency_ns = 10000000
kernel.sched_wakeup_granularity_ns = 2000000
kernel.sched_shares_ratelimit = 500000
kernel.sched_shares_thresh = 4
kernel.sched_features = 15834235
kernel.sched_migration_cost = 500000
kernel.sched_nr_migrate = 32
kernel.sched_time_avg = 1000
kernel.timer_migration = 1
kernel.sched_rt_period_us = 1000000
kernel.sched_rt_runtime_us = 950000
kernel.sched_compat_yield = 0
kernel.panic = 0
kernel.core_uses_pid = 0
kernel.core_pattern = core
kernel.core_pipe_limit = 0
kernel.tainted = 0
kernel.latencytop = 0
kernel.real - root - dev = 0
kernel.print-fatal-signals = 0
In total , there are over 500 tunable parameters on an average Linux system .
That 's a lot to tune .
If you want to examine that list more closely issue the command sudo sysctl - a > tunable and then open that file up with your favorite editor .
Let 's do this with something instantly useful .
Say you want to re-enable < Ctrl > < Alt > < Del > that some distributions have disabled .
First let 's make sure your distribution has disabled this .
Do this with the command :
sudo sysctrl kernel.ctrl-alt-del
What you should see output is :
kernel.ctrl-alt-del = 0
The above output does in fact inform you that this function has been disabled .
Let 's enable it .
To do this you would issue the command :
sudo sysctl -w kernel.ctrl-alt-del=1
You should see the output :
kernel.ctrl-al - del = 1
Which tells you the command was successful .
You can , of course , reset this to the original value with the command :
sudo sysctl - w kernel.ctrl-alt-del=0
Of course this is only a simple example of what you can tune with the sysctl command .
Seeing as how there are over 500 tunable parameters , you could tune your kernel to meet some very specific needs .
Final thoughts
As with any tool that modifies a running kernel , make sure you exercise caution when using sysctl .
You might want to practice this command on a non-production machine before you attempt to make any changes on a production machine .
And start off simple .
Modify some parameters that wo n't render your machine unbootable , your hard disc not writable , your network not reachable , etc .

Even though our review copy came a little late , my own love of the franchise ( and some friendly reader e-mails ) meant that yesterday was a good time to temporarily clear the desk of waiting titles and play some Transformers : War for Cybertron .
And it was worth it : this is one of the few games that seems to truly understand the property it 's based on .
Transforming from robot to vehicle mode is a smooth , satisfying affair , and the game allows you to use either form at any time ... although of course some sections will heavily hint at one or the other .
The voice acting , with Peter Cullen once again giving life to Optimus Prime , is hit or miss .
Megatron sounds good , Starscream less so , and Soundwave is appropriately electronic .
While they speak in overwrought dialog , the characters are taken somewhat seriously , which is a good move .
The story takes place before the first cartoon , and watching the first interactions between Starscream and Megatron is a cool moment for fans .
This is a third - person shooter , and the fighting feels thick and powerful .
While the characters are to scale with their surroundings on Cybertron , they still act like huge machines waging war with each other .
Destroying an enemy with a melee attack feels like an act of violence , and although these are machines , you never lose the sense that you are killing individuals .
The game takes place across both Decepticon and Autobot missions , and you can jump between the two at any time .
The campaign can also be played in co-op mode , and the competitive online multiplayer features class - based gameplay across multiple modes for up to ten players .
Just in case that 's not enough , the Escalation game mode throws wave after wave of enemies at you and can also be played with friends .
This is a well - rounded package of single - and multiplayer options and will keep you busy for a good amount of time .
The spirit and feeling of G1 Transformers is here , in full force .
Some of the boss battles are cheap , sure , but it almost feels like we had to dig to pick a nit .
It may read like we 're going from game to game raving about all them , but that 's just because we 're in the thick of great releases right now .
Add this one to the list .
A quick note on the PC version .
Yes , it 's less expensive , and it does look good with the resolution jacked all the way up .
Unfortunately , it 's hardlocked to 30 frames per second , there are no dedicated servers for online play , and the online community appears to be much smaller than what you find on the consoles .
If you 're fine with the campaign , this is an okay purchase , but if you want to test your mettle against other human players , the console version is the way to go , sadly .
There are also too few options for tweaking your graphics ; this is a lazy port .
The ideas behind Transformers are deeply silly : two factions in a warrior race of machines - that - can - turn - into - vehicles are waging a civil war on their homeworld .
The only way to tackle this type of nonsense is to do it head - on and not wink at the audience .
We grew up with these characters and this setting , and this game treats that love with enough respect that the game transcends its toy beginnings .
In many ways a by - the - numbers third - person shooter , the setting , characters , and use of vehicle modes are more than enough to make this feel worth the $ 60 asking price .

Kampala , Uganda ( CNN ) --
A fugitive Rwandan clergyman wanted for his role in the 1994 genocide has been arrested in Uganda , a police spokesman told CNN Friday .
A 2001 indictment from the U.N. - backed International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda alleges that Jean - Bosco Uwinkindi , now 59 , led a group that sought out and killed Tutsis in the genocide .
Some 800,000 Rwandans were slaughtered in 100 days , many of them brutally bludgeoned or sliced open with machetes .
The indictment says that about 2,000 bodies were found near Uwinkindi's church after he fled the country in July 1994 .
Ugandan police spokeswoman Judith Nabakooba said Uwinkindi is being extradited to Arusha , Tanzania , where the tribunal is located .
Uwinkindi , a Pentecostal pastor with a $ 5 million reward on his head , was among 11 top genocide suspects at large and was picked up by Ugandan police in the town of Mbarara , Nabakooba said .
He had crossed the border into Uganda from neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo , where other genocide suspects are thought to be in hiding .
Uganda 's independent Daily Monitor newspaper reported Friday that Uwinkindi entered the country using the alias Jean Inshitu and was attempting to buy land and settle under that assumed name .
Journalists Samson Ntale in Kampala , Uganda , and Ignatius Ssuuna in Kigali , Rwanda , contributed to this report .
Our friends across the Atlantic are fond of saying that Europeans work to live while Americans live to work .
According to the data , they are basically right .
Statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that while the average Italian , for example , enjoys 42 days of vacation per year , the average American has 16 .
A predictable corollary : Many Europeans also expect others to work so they can live .
The International Social Survey Programme asked Americans and Europeans ...
I knew when I decided to write about this topic I would probably offend a whole lot of people and have death threats made against me .
But in my endless drive to educate the unenlightened proletariat on the truth and madness of the restaurant / foodservice industry , I had to express myself on this subject .
Please bear in mind I literally have 34 years of blood , sweat , and tears invested in this business , with a myriad of observations , and in no way am I trying to demean anyone , I am just pointing out the truth after interviewing many people like myself in the trade , and drawing from my own humble experience .
It seems the term “ chef ” is given out like candy to anyone who can lift a knife and cut a vegetable .
Someone who graduates from culinary school with no previous experience is called a chef and enters the work force expecting a huge salary and an executive title without paying the dues .
I decided a long time ago I would rather be a good cook than a great chef .
I have worked and run the 4 - star hotels and resorts and I know how to make the fancy French cuisine that impresses the ostentatious crowd of gastronomic snobs .
But by choice , most of my career has been getting down and dirty making burgers , sandwiches and chicken wings for the everyday people who just want a good meal at a good price .
Fancy food is exciting , but no one eats like that all the time .
Now do n’t get me wrong , if you graduated culinary school and cook for your family and friends that is great , I am happy for you and wish you the best .
But if you are looking for a job as the executive chef or kitchen manager position on a line filled with people who have worked their way up from the bottom of the kitchen food chain ( bus boy or dish washer ) , you had better be prepared to work 60 or more hours a week , sweep and mop the floors , wash the pots and pans if needed , and scrub down the kitchen like the rest of them .
You ca n’t sit on your laurels and write the menu and spend all day at the organic produce market and then expect everyone else to sweat to make your recipe and menu ideas come to life .
You will never get the reverence you think you deserve .
I am sure you have great recipes and menu ideas , but I hope you are prepared to make them 40 times a day for 7 days in a row , 365 a year .
This is n’t a dinner party you are doing once , with 12 people showing up , and sitting at the table with their place cards and a glass of the flavor of the month .
And the dish needs to taste the same every time you make it , or when someone else is making it if you are n’t there .
For all of us who work and toil in the industry , we applaud the fact that you went to school , and we pray for your success .
My research has shown that a few things are not mentioned to the students .
There are long hours for low pay and you will have to work holidays .
You have to cover when someone calls in sick or hung - over ( believe me it happens all the time , especially after payday ) .
You will be the only cook on a busy night and you will have to do dishes or wait on customers .
You will have to put the deliveries away and you may get your chef coat dirty .
You might actually have to stock the kitchen yourself , do the prep work and cook all at once .
Food you think is perfect is going to get sent back to be prepared correctly ( gasp ! ) .
It is n’t an easy life , and that is why we take exception to those who walk into the kitchen with big ideas and no understanding .
I am not bitter or resentful because I never went to school .
I learned a long time ago to keep my mouth shut and listen to those who have been around the block .
School is great , but this is an industry where you never learn everything .
It is also an industry that will chew you up and spit you out if you let it .
You could spend a lifetime just learning the food of one culture .
So if you ever get the opportunity to run a brigade , make sure you tell them “ great job ” after every service , and buy them a round of drinks after you help them clean up .

Calling someone a " coconut " might sound harmless but it has landed one woman with a criminal conviction .
So what qualifies as a speech crime ?
Councillor Shirley Brown has been at the heart of Bristol 's multi-cultural community for 15 years , but in February 2009 she found herself at the centre of an unintended controversy .
While taking part in a debate in the city council she called a female Asian councillor , Jay Jethwa , a " coconut " .
The word is used to describe someone who is brown on the outside , but " white " on the inside .
In other words , someone who is said to have disregarded their cultural roots .
Brown used the word in a debate about the funding of black and ethnic groups in the city , and was upset that Ms Jethwa was advocating cuts .
The whole incident was filmed and can be viewed on YouTube ( see internet links , right ) .
Speaking before the trial , Brown explained why she used the word .
" I must admit , I was angry because I thought it was an absolute insult , because she is of Asian background .
I was thinking how could you cut funding that is going to impact so many people .
So the first thing that came to mind , instead of saying ' you idiot ' , I said ' you coconut ' . "
Although she apologised a few days after the comment , and on several occasions , the matter went to a local and then a national standards hearing .
' Coconut ' row councillor guilty Brown was reprimanded , briefly suspended from the council and then reinstated .
But months later the case escalated when she was charged under the Public Order Act with using " threatening , abusive or insulting words , with intent to cause a person harassment , alarm or distress " .
It 's a serious charge which comes with the threat of a criminal record .
But why , given Brown 's numerous apologies , was it necessary to turn this into a criminal prosecution ?
In a statement released before Brown 's trial , the Crown Prosecution Service defended its approach as being " in the public interest ... because it alleged an offence where the suspect demonstrated hostility towards the victim based on discrimination against the victim's ethnic origin " .
On Monday Brown was convicted , given a 12 - month conditional discharge and ordered to pay costs .
The judgement is an important development in what might be called " speech crime " .
But what can and can't people say ?
Thatcher gibe
The case re-opens the debate on political correctness and freedom of speech which last flared up so publicly when TV presenter Carol Thatcher used the word " golliwog " in the green room of the BBC One programme The One Show .
Oreo biscuits and bananas are used in the same way Ms Thatcher was dismissed from the show , but not prosecuted for the use of the word .
So while " coconut " can be a speech crime , is " golliwog " more acceptable in the eyes of the law ?
Although there are clear differences between the two incidents , Brown 's case seems to establish that anyone directing the word " coconut " at a black or Asian person is liable to be prosecuted , in spite of any subsequent apology .
Had the impulsive councillor said something along the lines of " you have disregarded your cultural roots " , she would almost certainly not have been prosecuted .
It was the use of the word " coconut " to convey that sense which resulted in her facing trial .
And coconut is not the only word used to signify that a person has disregarded their cultural roots .
Others include " Oreo " , the biscuit which is black on the outside and white on the middle , and " banana " which has been used in the Chinese community to signify " yellow on the outside , white on the inside " .
Heart of identity Such words are now hugely charged and it would be difficult for the Crown Prosecution Service to fail to prosecute in cases where they are used against an individual from the racial or cultural group concerned .
Carol
Thatcher was sacked by the BBC for saying " golliwog " Courts trying such cases however face considerable difficulties .
The words and the level of " threat , abuse or insult " which they convey is very subjective .
Some people regard the word " coconut " as highly derogatory .
It can be seen as going to the very heart of a person 's cultural identity and amount to an accusation of betrayal .
Bristol 's multi-cultural community were clearly hurt and concerned by the comment from an elected councillor .
To one prominent member of that community , at least , coconut has only one legitimate meaning .
" It 's not acceptable , unless you 're talking about a fruit on a palm tree , " says Amarjit Singh , who manages an Asian day centre in a suburb of the city .
" Otherwise it is a racist comment .
They should know better , they 're the policy makers .
They 're the ones that promote community cohesion . "
Others take the view that the word is only mildly abusive , whilst some do not find it threatening or abusive at all .
The way in which it is said , the context and reaction of the person at whom it is directed will all be important factors in considering a prosecution .
But in the age of speech crime , a prosecution for the use of the word can now never be discounted Below is a selection of your comments .
As an Asian who has been called a coconut many times , I am not sure if the term is racially offensive but it is hurtful to the recipient , however it is intended .
Watching the YouTube clip , Councillor Brown does seem angry at the cuts being discussed but she has time to compose herself before speaking , she takes the time to explain the context of words she is using so should understand that this is a considered personal insult , rather than a comment in anger on the policy in question .
She goes on to state that the funding cuts are deplorable etc etc but does n't explain why or what the funding would have been used for , and so bandying about insults ( racial or not ) in some kind of party political argument seems not very clever to me .
Whoops , did I just call someone stupid ?
I 'm sorry .
That should make it better ?
Sam , Derby
This debate and others like it reveal a truth about racism that many people prefer to ignore - being anti-racism does * not* mean the ignoring of race , historical context , or individual cultural heritage .
What it means is not viewing those things as making someone inferior .
It is perfectly acceptable for someone to view themselves as black , be proud of that , and think of it as part of your personal identity .
Same for Asian , and , yes , even white too , although historical context obviously makes that last one a little different .
It 's only racism when you think that your heritage makes you * better * than other people .
Harry , Colchester My African - American friend openly refers to herself as an Oreo .
No wonder people get confused - if she says it , it 's OK , if I say it , it 's racially abusive ?
Gemma , London I too often hear black and Asian friends refer to each other as coconuts and far worse , but because they are using the phrases it is seen to be acceptable .
However if I were to use them I would be guilty of racially motivated abuse .
This is a blatant double standard that is grossly unfair , I am tired of the assumption that because I am white I am automatically racist .
It is time for ALL ethnic groups to treat each other with respect .
Lynn , London
The term " coconut " is THE all encompassing racial slur .
Not only does it imply Black and Asian people should behave one way , it also implies white people behave another way .
Whether she is sorry or not , Ms Brown used this word in a derogatory way and as such clearly possesses an underlying " understanding " of the way people should behave based on their skin colour .
Stephen , Birmingham I understand that the terms " coconut " and " Oreo " could be considered insulting to someone who is black or Asian and , by implication , white .
That having been established , is there a list of legally acceptable fruits ( not to mention biscuits ) currently on the law books to which one can refer in order to adopt a safe armoury of inoffensive pejoratives ?
E.g. if I were to refer to someone as a " gooseberry " , a " lemon " or a " limey " , would I be liable for criminal prosecution and might I also run the risk of having my career and livelihood destroyed ?
When the law strays onto the territory of , what is in effect , the name - calling mentality of the school playground and believes it understands the rules of engagement , the law is a de facto ' Equus Asinus ' .
Paul , Guildford , Surrey
It is very easy to use the wrong choice of words in a conversation .
After apologising , that should be the end of the matter .
Only persistent behaviour should be seen as racism .
Edwina Lee , High Wycombe , UK I used to work for a predominantly black and ethnic minority company and because I was one of the only white employees I enjoyed the nickname of " The Honkey " with absolutely no bad feeling at all - it defined me in the organisation .
Mostyn , London
It all depends on where you are .
In South Africa people call each other " coconut " all the time .
It 's seen as a mildly insulting , sometimes slightly endearing term , but certainly nobody would ever be taken to court for it or ever get upset about the word .
And in a world of stark ethnic difference , the term " coconut " can be a mildly amusing pointer as to the cultural bias of the person named .
Jay , Cape Town , South Africa
Where I live it means hard - headed .
Plain and simple .
Stuart , Belize City , Belize A coconut , apart from being brown outside and white inside , is also hard outside and soft ( pure / unblemished ) inside .
Many a great man ( no gender bias intended ) in India are referred to be like a coconut - strict , disciplined , tough on the outside and soft , caring , forgiving on the inside .
In this case , an angry mind misjudged the reaction of the audience to a particular word , but the intent clearly was to avoid funding cuts rather than to insult someone .
Sunil , London
This is a horrible racist word , because it implies that the way you behave towards other people is determined by the colour of your skin .
As a white person I find it offensive as it implies there is something inferior about being white .
It was certainly unacceptable and racist to use this word .
In my opinion it should have lead to disciplinary action , but I 'm not sure about prosecution .
Susannah , Gloucestershire , UK Why is what constitutes a speech crime important ?
Why are n't we asking " Why are there speech crimes ? " .
Their very existence is ridiculous , meeting words with violence ( the state , punishments ) .
It is not a crime and if it is inappropriate then people who say these things will be ostracised , and rightly so .
Euan McArthur , Ulverston
Never mind dancing around with the euphemism disregarding your cultural heritage , " coconut " is plain , old - fashioned racism .
Any one who uses the term is revealing their bias that black people should behave a certain way and always be ready to help other black people simply because they are not white .
People are just people , enough with the racism already .
Mark , Guildford Ms Singh must be rather thin - skinned if she feels an insult like this requires the involvement of the courts .
Yes , it 's racist - mildly so - hurt feelings , let 's move on .
There is a massive industry of hurt feelings out there which is quite different from real racism , real sexism and real homophobia .
Ms Brown was angry : nobody got hurt .
Cut her some slack .
Dave J , Norfolk
Surely the most important aspect of this incident is that the offending word was used in anger ( at the admission of Ms Brown ) and because its use in this context also has racial connotations , the criminal offence is complete .
I would , however , suggest that it is specifically this active mental aspect to the use of the word here in a derogatory way that makes Ms Browns behaviour wrong and rightly unlawful but I have long wondered if the automatic branding of someone who uses this or any other potentially ' racist ' term in an entirely accidental ( some might say ' ignorant ' ) way is equally right .

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) is urging a federal judge to dismiss Facebook 's claims that criminal law is violated when its users opt for an add - on service that helps them aggregate their information from a variety of social networking sites .
Power Ventures makes a web - based tool that users can set up to log into their multiple social networking accounts and aggregate messages , friend lists , and other data so they can see all the information in one place .
In a lawsuit against Power Ventures , Facebook claims that Power 's tool violates criminal law because Facebook 's terms of service ban users from accessing their information through " automatic means . "
By using Power 's tool , Facebook argues that its users are accessing Facebook " without permission " under the California penal code .
EFF argues in an amicus brief filed Monday that users have the right to choose how they access their data , and turning any violation of terms of use into a criminal law violation would leave millions of Facebook users unwittingly vulnerable to prosecution .
" California 's computer crime law is aimed at penalizing computer trespassers , " said EFF Civil Liberties Director Jennifer Granick .
" Users who choose to give their usernames and passwords to aggregators like Power Ventures are not trespassing .
Under Facebook 's theory , millions of Californians who disregard or do n't read terms of service on the websites they visit could face criminal liability .
Also , any Internet company could use this argument as a hammer to prevent its users from easily leaving the service as well as to shut down innovators and competitors . "
Even the simple use of the automatic login feature of most browsers would constitute a violation under Facebook 's theory , since those services are " automatic means " for logging in .
But the risk for users is even broader .
If any violation of terms of use is criminal , users who shave a few years off their age in their profile , claim to be single when they are married , or change jobs or addresses without updating Facebook right away would also have violated the criminal law .
" The information you put into social networking sites is yours , and you should be able to access it , export it , and aggregate it as you please , " said EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn .
" If Facebook 's legal argument is upheld , it will hobble companies that enable consumer choice , as well a create a massive expansion in the scope of California criminal law . "

The BP oil spill is still dominating headlines , 50 days after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded .
But how much oil leaks into the Gulf on any other day of the year ?
Satellite images and photographs from the region indicate that there may be two other offshore drilling units leaking oil into the ocean .
John Amos , head of the West Virginia - based nonprofit SkyTruth , was looking at satellite images of the oil from the Deepwater Horizon site when he noticed what appeared to be another small slick of oil about 11 miles off the coast of Louisiana and about 40 miles from the major spill .
Amos ’ group uses the images to assess environmental problems ; he was among the first independent experts to point out that the spill estimates from BP and the government were far too low , which has now been confirmed .
Amos reported a “ small but persistent leak or oily discharge ” at a second site in the Gulf , one that appeared to be coming from platform 23051 in the Gulf of Mexico .
It can be seen on multiple satellite images of the region .
Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) records indicate that the platform belongs to Taylor Energy Company .
Amos contacted J. Henry Fair , a New York - based photographer who specializes in artistic renderings of the human impact on the environment .
Fair was in the Gulf last weekend taking aerial photos of the spill with the group Southwings , and at Amos ’ suggestion sought out platform 23051 .
Fair found a rig with an oily sheen extending out into the water and snapped a series of photos .
But upon closer inspection , it was a different rig — the Ocean Saratoga rig owned by Diamond Offshore .
In some of Fair ’s photos , a platform is visible in the background , possibly the one he was originally searching for , 23051 .
Amos could n’t give an estimate on how much oil might be coming out of either site , though he noted that it is a “ very small ” amount .
That would mean there are potentially two other operations in the Gulf leaking oil .
So just how common are such leaks ?
The sad reality is , we really do n’t know .
Right now , oil companies are required by law to report any spills to the National Response Center , Coast Guard or Environmental Protection Agency if there is a “ visible sheen . ”
Oil companies report spilling roughly 1.3 million gallons of oil into US waterways in an average year .
But that figure is largely reliant on self - reporting ; the government trusts that operators are following the law and reporting all of the spills , Amos says .
Coast Guard 1st Class Petty Officer Zach Zubricki told Mother Jones that they do not know of any other spills in the Gulf at this point in time .
“ I ’m only aware of one leak , ” said Zubricki .
He noted that it ’s possible the sheen is related to the major spill from the Deepwater Horizon , since “ you get oil everywhere ” with a leak of that size .
( I ’ve also put in calls to the companies that own these two units and will update as I hear back from them . )
Amos believes that these other visible sheens are independent of the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
SkyTruth is using images from NASA and the Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing ( CSTARS ) at the University of Miami , which draws the images from several international satellite data providers .
“ We ’re not routinely using satellites to monitor regions where offshore drilling is occurring , ” says Amos .
“ If we were , what would we learn ?
Would we learn that small spills like this are uncommon , or would we learn that there ’s a day to day , background nature to spills ? ”
“ I do n’t want to speculate on frequency or regularity , ” says Amos .
“ Maybe this is a rare occurrence and this was incredibly fortuitous that we happened to stumble across it .
I do n’t know .
I do know we have the tools to answer these questions , but we ’re not using them . ”
UPDATE : This NOAA document from April 30 on the Deepwater Horizon spill notes that the map also shows “ oil from an additional ( unrelated )
source near platform Ocean Saratoga . ”
The Press - Register was able to confirm with the National Response Center that a spill had been reported , though the center did not give a date when it began .
UPDATE 2 : Taylor Energy , owner of the Ocean Saratoga , put out a statement Tuesday afternoon confirming that the rig has been performing an “ ongoing well intervention program ” to repair damage to the well that occurred in 2004 when Hurricane Ike destroyed a production platform there .
The company states that the “ associated surface sheen was minimal and never made landfall , ” and that the “ initial average observed sheen volume of nine gallons per day has been substantially reduced . ”
The company did n’t say what it has been reduced to at this point , or if the well has been leaking non -stop since ’ 04 .
I ’ve sent in follow - up questions and will update as more information is available .
Two longtime eBay shareholders are demanding the e-commerce giant open up its records regarding a 2007 altercation between an employee and Meg Whitman , the company 's then - chief executive and current candidate for governor , in an action organized by a major labor union opposed to her candidacy .
The New York Times first reported on the incident in June , saying that as eBay communications employee Young Mi Kim tried to prepare Whitman for a media interview , the executive became angry and " forcefully pushed her . "
Kim threatened a lawsuit , but ultimately received a legal settlement totaling about $ 200,000 , the newspaper reported .
After a hiatus of about four months , Kim returned to work for eBay .
A lawyer for the California Nurses Association issued a letter to eBay 's board of directors on Monday demanding " the right to inspect and copy certain books and records of the corporation . "
It was sent on behalf of shareholders Michael Preston , a spokesman for the union , and his husband , Alameda schoolteacher Michael Meyers .
" From an outsider 's perspective , it seems they were making decisions based more on protecting management than my retirement nest egg , " said Preston , adding that the couple has owned 92 shares of eBay since July 2001 .
" It goes to questions of Meg Whitman 's temperament and goes to issues of the management of eBay . "
He said shareholders of the San Jose company have the right to know whether there were similar cases that could generate additional legal liabilities .
The nurses union , inflamed by the Republican candidate 's proposal to eliminate state jobs as one means of closing the state 's budget shortfall , has been making political hay of the confrontation since it came to light .
The group , which is backing Whitman 's Democratic rival Jerry Brown , quickly organized an ad campaign called " Nurses Wo n't Be Pushed Around . "
" If we 're electing somebody that has a history and pattern of abusive behavior , one might even call it violent , then I think the citizens of California have a right to know that information , " said Deborah Burger , a nurses union leader , explaining why it is backing the demand to inspect the records .
The letter to eBay 's board asserted a right to review the relevant materials under the California Corporation Code .
The statute says such records " shall be open to inspection upon the written demand on the corporation of any shareholder ... for a purpose reasonably related to such holder 's interests . "
The couple is seeking access to all documents related to the confrontation , copies of the settlement agreement , confirmation of the actual payment , and any information about similar incidents and payouts .
Preston said that additional union members who own eBay shares , including nurses , teachers and firefighters , will likely issue similar demands .
Neither eBay nor Whitman 's campaign immediately responded to inquires from The Chronicle .
The Whitman campaign initially described the incident with Kim as " a professional disagreement " in a statement to the New York Times .
The candidate later acknowledged to the Los Angeles Times that she had " physically escorted " Kim from an eBay conference room .
-- The nurses union plans a protest outside Meg Whitman 's home .

The Army is looking to spend as much as $ 100 million to expand its Special Operations headquarters in northern Afghanistan .
All around Afghanistan , from Kandahar Airfield to the Bagram jail , the U.S. military is on a building spree , spending hundreds of millions of dollars on wartime encampments .
By one count , America and its allies now have 700 bases in Afghanistan .
But most of the construction – and most of the extra troops " surging " into the country – are going to the violent south and the dangerous east .
Until recently , northern Afghanistan was considered quiet .
Regional hub Mazar - e - Sharif was the first major city in Afghanistan to be taken from the Taliban .
But , especially in nearby Kunduz province , violence is bubbling up once again .
The Army expects its expanded Special Operations HQ in Mazar - e - Sharif to occupy 70,000 square meters .
It 'll include a " communications building , Tactical Operations Center , training facility , medical aid station , Vehicle Maintenance Facility ... dining facility , laundry facility , and a kennel to support working dogs , " according to a request for proposals .
" Supporting facilities include roads , power production system and electrical distribution , water well , non-potable water production , water storage , water distribution , sanitary sewer collection system , communication manhole / duct system , curbs , walkways , drainage and parking .
Additionally , the project will include site preparation and compound security measures to include guard towers . "
Construction is supposed to take a year .
At which point , the U.S. is allegedly supposed to begin drawing down its forces in Afghanistan .
Allegedly .

So there are a number of Android - based tablets on the horizon .
These are presumably envisioned as intermediate devices to fill a niche between the smartphone and laptop , similar to the iPad .
I 'm not starting a thread to debate whether this niche exists , or the design of any specific device , but rather on how well Android and its apps can adapt to being used across multiple devices by the same user .
For me , when I try to envision a tablet in my life , I find it difficult to think of things that it could do but my phone ( a Nexus One ) can't .
I think the point is a tablet does n't really do new things , but it does them slightly better because of a larger screen .
The thing is , I will likely want to switch back and forth between my phone and tablet depending on my real - world context , and I will generally want the state of those applications to stay in sync .
Take reading an ebook , for example .
I will still want to read on my phone sometimes , when I just have a minute to spare and do n't have the tablet with me , but when I sit down to a more lengthy reading session , I want the tablet to remember where I am in the book .
This should be automatic .
Similarly , any games I play should have my progress saved , and my bookmarks / history / etc should be synced too .
The simple fact is , the additional value of a tablet seems so small , that if I have to put up another non-synced device in my life , it wo n't even be worth bothering .
I 'll just keep using the smaller screen of my phone .
Now , of course there are already things that DO sync .
Email , calendar , contacts , etc .
But those are distinct things with custom implementations specific to that type of data .
Certainly every app developer could add a web service that syncs their app data , but why make everyone do that individually .
Does anyone know of any plans to create a generalized Android app sync solution ?
( let me know if there 's something out there and I missed it )
This seems like something google would want to build at the OS level , but I have n't heard of anything like it .
Thoughts ?
I hesitate to call this a “ comic strip ” since it ’s about 70 % words ( maybe “ illustrated essay ” would be more accurate ) but whatever it is , it ’s inked .
This strip will appear in the Fall issue of Signal to Noise magazine , which is where my previous very wordy one - page music strip about Winston - Salem ’s “ 5 ” Royales also appeared .
Like the Royales strip , this one will be in full color , but I ’m not going to post that until the magazine ’s been out on the stands for a while so folks can have a chance to pick up the real live issue .
This strip is also notable in that it includes the single worst caricature of William H. Macy ever committed to paper .
What can I say –I ’m up against a deadline here .
( And since it says “ William H. Macy ” right above the panel , I guess I can get by with it … )

Last we heard from Mirko Kovac of the Switzerland - based EPFL Laboratory of Intelligent Systems , he was setting a robot high - jump record with his grasshopper - inspired bot .
Now he 's back with what might be an even more impressive robot -- a 4.6 gram glider that can fly headfirst into any surface , perch itself , and then detach on command .
The idea there being that the gliders could be outfitted with sensors and deployed en masse in difficult to reach areas -- Kovac gives the example of a swarm equipped with heat - sensors that could attach themselves to trees and monitor for forest fires .
What 's more , he says that the same perching mechanism could also be applied to other robots -- possibly even a hybrid of the glider and his grasshopper bot that could hop and fly around before finding a spot to perch itself .
Head on past the break to see Kovac explain it himself on video .
I decided to do a black and white comic so I could get it up faster and thought “ Why not really make a black and white comic rather than just not coloring a comic ” – so I broke out my pens .
I ’m not sure it translates to the screen as well as brushwork .

John Isner and Nicolas Mahut tore up the record books as their epic first - round contest at Wimbledon became the longest in tennis history .
The match was locked at 59 - 59 in the final set after 10 hours of play when it was suspended because of bad light .
The decision meant that , incredibly , the contest would go into a third day , having been called off at two sets all on Tuesday for the same reason .
It will resume on Court 18 on Thursday after two other singles matches .
The final set , which began shortly after 1400 BST on Wednesday and was still going seven hours later when the sun went down , is already longer than any match ever played .
Isner , with 98 , and Mahut ( 95 ) have also both smashed the previous record for the most aces , the 78 set by Ivo Karlovic in a Davis Cup tie in 2009 .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The previous longest match was at the French Open in 2004 , when Fabrice Santoro beat Arnaud Clement after six hours and 35 minutes .
The longest at Wimbledon was the 1989 second round match between Greg Holmes and Terry Witsken in 1989 , which took five hours 28 minutes , although arguably the most famous endurance battle was between Pancho Gonzales and Charlie Pasarell in 1969 , which took five hours 12 minutes and finished 22 - 24 1 - 6 16 - 14 6 - 3 11 - 9 to Gonzales .
There was no indication of the drama that was about to unfold when Isner and Mahut resumed on Tuesday afternoon locked at two sets all .
But fans quickly crammed into court 18 - capacity 782 - as word spread about the historic contest and every possible vantage point outside was taken .
Mahut , from France , had his first break points of the entire set at 50 - 50 , but Isner , 25 , dug deep into his reserves to save both .
The 6ft 9in American had match points himself at 10 - 9 , two at 33 - 32 and another at 59 - 58 , all of which Mahut managed to fend off .
Towards the end , the umpire 's voice was going , rallies had become collectors ' items and the scoreboard was broken because it could not cope with the alien numbers .
Just after 2110 BST , Mahut complained that he was having difficulty seeing the ball and the decision was taken to suspend play .
TOM FORDYCE'S BLOG Throughout it all , Isner looked moments away from collapse .
That he stayed on his feet seemed to defy medical science
Initially the crowd , desperate to see the match through to its conclusion , booed and chanted " We want more ! " but as the players left they were given a huge standing ovation - a fitting tribute to two gladiators .
Isner was out on his feet .
Unsurprisingly , his doubles match with Sam Querrey , scheduled to take place on Court 10 , had been cancelled .
While Isner was almost delirious , Mahut , 28 and ranked 148 in the world , looked remarkably fresh , perhaps boosted by the knowledge he had won a match with Britain 's Alex Bogdanovic in qualifying 24 - 22 in the final set .
Before they headed off for a well - earned rest , the players were grabbed by the BBC's Phil Jones for a final word on an astonishing day .
Mahut said : " We 're fighting like we have never done before .
We 'll come back tomorrow and see who is going to win this match .
Everyone wants to see the end . "
Isner added : " He 's serving fantastic , I 'm serving fantastic .
Nothing like this will ever happen again . "
The eventual winner will play Thiemo De Bakker of the Netherlands in the next round , who was involved in another marathon battle with Santiago Giraldo , before coming through 16 - 14 in the final set - although that match lasted a mere four hours and six minutes .
I do n't know if I was crying or laughing
Roger Federer
In a week of records , Novak Djokovic 's first - round match against Olivier Rochus was the latest - ever finish at Wimbledon , while Taylor Dent 's 148 mph serve against Djokovic in round two was the fastest recorded at the All England club .
After his match against Dent had finished , Djokovic was asked about the Isner - Mahut contest and said all the players were watching it in the locker rooms .
He added : " I 'm amazed they could both hold their serve that comfortably all day .
It 's unbelievable .
Maybe they should have agreed to play a tie - break at 50 - all ! "
Six - time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer , whose earlier second round win over Ilija Bozoljac was eclipsed by events on court 18 , added : " I love this !
I do n't know if I was crying or laughing .
It was too much . "
And British number one Andy Murray also had his say on the match , via his Twitter page , commenting : " This is why tennis is one of the toughest sports in the world , this will never ever be matched again . "

How did he get that number !
I may have taken a few liberties .
The kind that gets me emails warning that while I normally enjoy your comics , I hope you know that you have this completely wrong and now I have no respect for you .
Well .
I shan't fight you over Bell and Watson having a direct line to Gray 's newly developed telephone but there it is nonetheless .
This actually began as a comic about the Wright Brothers and the race for getting the first airplanes off the ground , but in the roundabout way that is my usual method ( hardly an effective one ) , the subject changed completely .
Or not completely .
Bell , as we know , was in the airplane races as well as the telephone one and probably a bunch of others like the can opener race and the whatever hot inventors at the time were up to .
What a time too !
I mean , the ipad is great and everything but you imagine being around when someone is inventing telephones and flying ?
Anyway .
Poor old Gray .
The whole affair is a little shady and still confusing but there is no doubt both men were pretty sharp .
When I was little we used to have to take school trips to the Alexander Graham Bell museum in Baddeck where far in the distance , you could see his giant mansion .
Apparently , the telephone business is a pretty good gig .
Also .
The answer to having things that are incorrect in my comics is , by the way , this : of course they are .
The San Francisco Police Department is investigating an incident caught on video that shows an officer apparently forcing a handcuffed woman face first into the pavement .
In the video , shot by a bystander and posted on YouTube before being removed , the belligerent woman - who police said was drunk and pushing a baby in a stroller - shouts obscenities at two Taraval Station officers attempting to arrest her Sunday afternoon .
The woman can be seen resisting both officers ' efforts to place her in the police car .
The baby , left in the stroller on the sidewalk , can be heard crying .
The officers almost manage to get the woman into the unit , but she pushes against the car and yells , " It 's my baby in the street ! "
While one officer goes to the other side of the patrol car , the other is left to deal with the woman alone .
The video shows him bracing her neck with his hand as she pushes back to avoid getting into the car .
Then , the officer appears to move to the side and grunt as he appears to push the woman face first into the pavement on the street between two parked cars .
In the police report , the officer gave a version of what occurred and acknowledged that he used force against the woman , authorities say .
The officers stopped the woman because they believed she was the suspect in an assault they were responding to , police said .
Although not shown on the video , an ambulance soon arrived and took the woman to San Francisco General Hospital .
She bit one of the paramedics on the way , according to police accounts .
" We want to make sure we have a full understanding of what occurred , and we obviously are going to take whatever action that is appropriate , " Chief George Gascón said .
The unidentified six - year veteran Taraval Station officer was ordered to surrender his badge and weapon on Monday , pending the outcome of an internal investigation into the incident , authorities said Tuesday .
Assistant Police Chief Jeff Godown said one issue in the investigation is that the woman was handcuffed - and under police authority - at the time of the incident .
" The bottom line , we will take a look at it and see what happened , " Godown said .
" We 're reviewing the videotape and the use of force report to determine whether the use of force was necessary . "
Godown said the officer has been reassigned to non-field duty pending the outcome of the probe .

Griffey retires from baseball with a lifetime batting average of .284 Seattle Mariners legend Ken Griffey Junior has announced his retirement from baseball at the age of 40 .
The outfielder hit 630 home runs in his 22 - year Major League career , leaving him fifth on the all - time list .
He was regarded as one of the world 's best players in the 1990s before injuries took their toll , although he never played in a World Series .
" This has been on my mind recently , but it 's not an easy decision to come by , " Griffey said in a statement .
" While I feel I am still able to make a contribution on the field and nobody has asked me to retire , I told the Mariners when I met with them prior to the 2009 season and was invited back that I will never allow myself to become a distraction .
606 : DEBATE A modern day legend .
I was lucky enough to be at Yankee Stadium last July to see him hit HR # 621 off Andy Pettitte
Parkman77
" I feel that without enough occasional starts to be sharper coming off the bench , my continued presence as a player would be an unfair distraction to my team - mates . "
He made his Major League debut for Seattle in 1989 , playing alongside his father Ken Griffey Senior in 1990 and 1991 .
After more than a decade in Seattle , where he was hugely popular with the fans , he joined his hometown Cincinnati Reds in 2000 , and after a brief spell with Chicago White Sox in 2008 , returned to the Mariners in 2009 .
A fan wipes away a tear at a video tribute to Griffey at Tuesday 's game
He announced his retirement just before Tuesday 's home game against the Minnesota Twins , which Seattle won 2 - 1 in 10 innings .
" Ken is both the finest ballplayer I have ever known , one of the finest people I have ever known and the heart and soul of this franchise , " added Mariners president Chuck Armstrong , who also credited Griffey with helping the team remain in Seattle and get a new stadium in 1999 .
" Without his contributions there is little doubt that Safeco Field would not exist and , almost certainly , baseball would have left the North West . "
Griffey was named in 13 All - Star teams during his career , while his defensive excellence earned him 10 Gold Gloves .
He was voted as the American League 's most valuable player in 1997 and chosen for MLB 's team of the century in 1999 .
However , he had struggled for much of this season and had denied claims that he fell asleep in the clubhouse during a game .
Giffey hit more than 40 home runs in seven seasons between 1993 and 2000 , but unlike many of his power - hitting contemporaries from the " steroid era " , was never tainted by accusations of performance - enhancing drugs .

In the prologue to his recent memoir , Hitch - 22 , Christopher Hitchens confessed to " customary reservations " about the whole project perhaps being " too soon " , but then said that such concerns were swiftly dissipated by the " blunt realisation " that " the project could become , at any moment , ruled out of the question as having been undertaken ' too late ' " .
These words acquired a new resonance when Hitchens announced on 30 June that he was to undergo treatment for oesophageal cancer .
In a short statement published on the website of Vanity Fair , where he has been a columnist since 1992 , he wrote : " I have been advised by my physician that I must undergo a course of chemotherapy on my oesophagus .
This advice seems persuasive to me . "
Hitchens 's announcement ended speculation over the abrupt cancellation of his book tour for " personal reasons " .
The decision to postpone all commitments indefinitely was an unusual move for a writer who , despite his prodigious appetite for booze and fags and his prolific output - regular columns for Vanity Fair , Slate and the Atlantic , 11 books and four collections of essays - prides himself on never missing an engagement .
I recently met Hitchens at a central London hotel to discuss his life and work .
It was late afternoon and he was drinking red wine .
Because of the publication of his memoir , his tone was largely retrospective , but he also discussed his future plans - a new book on the Ten Commandments and a campaign to have the Pope arrested for the concealment of child abuse .
He did not sound like someone preparing to ease himself into retirement .
“ One of the great questions of philosophy , " he said of his new book project , " is : do we innately have morality , or do we get it from celestial dictation ?
A study of the Ten Commandments is a very good way of getting into and resolving that issue . "
Of his hostility to and pursuit of Joseph Ratzinger , he remarked indignantly : " It 's outrageous that people like myself , Richard Dawkins and Geoffrey Robertson are taking this on .
What do we have law officers for ?
What do we have police departments for ?
But we will do it if they wo n't . "
Christopher Hitchens was born in Portsmouth in 1949 , into what he has described as a " family of Tories who had nothing to be Tory about " .
His father , Eric , a lifelong naval officer known affectionately as " the Commander " , met his mother , Yvonne , during the Second World War .
Asked what first attracted him to the left , Hitchens cited not an early encounter with Das Kapital , but rather the contradictions and ironies he witnessed at home and at school .
( Hitchens was privately educated after his mother told his father : " If there is going to be an upper class in this country , then Christopher is going to be in it . " )
“ The lesson of my upbringing was that the conservative values of both my family and my school were a bit of a joke because the people who espoused them were also being ripped off by the Conservatives , " he told me .
" The boys I was at school with did n't know they were lucky ; they just took it for granted .
This had a very radicalising effect on me . "
Hitchens 's mother , a gregarious and affectionate woman , was ultimately bored by his austere father and eloped with Timothy Bryan , a defrocked priest who had become a devotee of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi .
In 1973 , at the age of 24 , Hitchens suffered what he describes as a " lacerating , howling moment in my life " , after learning that his mother had been found dead in an Athens hotel room in what was initially treated as a murder , but turned out to have been a suicide pact between Yvonne and her lover .
By this time , having graduated from Oxford in 1970 , Hitchens had become a staff writer at the New Statesman ( " all I 'd ever wanted to be " ) ; he filed a long piece on the military coup that provided a backdrop to his lonely trip to Athens to reclaim her body .
A divided self
Anthony Howard , New Statesman editor from 1972 - 78 , recruited Hitchens as part of a celebrated generation that included James Fenton , Martin Amis and Julian Barnes .
He remembers him as a talented writer - " Hitch could produce a front - page leader , which would take me a couple of hours , in half an hour " - if not a great one .
" To me , James Fenton was a much more interesting figure .
Fenton was a genuine poet ; he had much more body to him than Hitch . "
The young Hitch was a big drinker , even then .
" He always came in at 10.45 am , holding , with shaking hands , this cardboard cup of tomato soup to nurse his hangover . "
Howard says he did not anticipate Hitchens 's political trajectory but adds : " I was always puzzled about the contrast between his lifestyle and his political views .
He was always much more comfortable with people on the right . "
Hitchens makes much of this divided self in his memoir .
There was Chris , hawking Socialist Worker on street corners and getting duffed up on picket lines ; and there was Christopher , who would slip into a dinner jacket and enjoy the high life at All Souls College .
One senses that , like Oscar Wilde , who contended that the problem with socialism " is that it takes up too many spare evenings " , Hitchens was never comfortable in the world of the subcommittee and the composite motion .
I asked him what he would have done had he not become a writer and , in what sounded like an attempt at self - mythologisation , he said : " [ I would have ] been someone else , because [ writing ] is all I ever wanted to do .
It 's what I am , rather than what I do . "
However , he conceded that he regretted not entering politics .
“ I did want to run for parliament .
Tavistock Labour Party could have had me if it wanted .
I could never quite imagine myself winning , but I 'm very sad I never fought a campaign . "
By the end of the 1970s , he had tired of Britain ( " Weimar without the sex " is his verdict on the Callaghan era ) and longed for the bigger stage of the United States .
His decision to cross the Atlantic in 1981 was a masterstroke , providing him with a range of outlets - the Nation , Harper 's and the New York Review of Books - for the literary - political essays at which he excels .
Moving first to New York and then to Washington , DC , he became known as an aggressive left - winger , stridently attacking targets such as Ronald Reagan , Henry Kissinger and Jerry Falwell 's Moral Majority .
Hitchens 's polemical assaults on Reagan's " sado - monetarism " , which once led Conrad Black to threaten to buy up every title he wrote for , remain among his finest .
In a culture where consensus and bipartisanship were viewed as unqualified goods , Hitchens stood out as a contrarian ( a term that he perhaps unsurprisingly rejects ) prepared to challenge the orthodoxies of both left and right .
Following George Orwell 's maxim that " saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent " , Hitchens outraged the Catholic right in 1995 with a scathing attack on Mother Teresa over her religious fundamentalism and her support for the dictatorial Duvalier family in Haiti .
This book , The Missionary Position : Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice , was what made Johann Hari , columnist on the Independent and former New Statesman staffer , want to become a journalist .
" I read that when I was 14 after I 'd seen the documentary on Channel 4 , and I just thought it was the most amazing book , " he said .
" Just taking something that seemed to be taken for granted - that this woman was a saintly , benign humanitarian - and exposing it as a complete lie . "
It was after an attack on another revered figure , Bill Clinton , that Hitchens reached the conclusion that personality matters more than policy .
" Clinton could change his mind on any issue , but could n't change the fact that he was a scumbag , " he says now .
Today , his criticisms of political figures are entirely post - ideological .
I asked him for his opinion of David Cameron , hoping for a robust critique , but he replied : " He seems content - free to me .
Never had a job , except in PR , and it shows .
People ask , ' What do you think of him ? ' and my answer is : ' He does n't make me think . ' "
The younger Hitchens might have had something to say about Cameron 's sinister European alliance or his austerity economics .
Similarly , Sarah Palin is impugned not for her hard - right politics , but for her opportunism .
" I think she 's a completely straightforward cynic and opportunist and I think she 's cashing out , " he said .
" She 's made a fortune and she 'll make another .
But she 's not actually going to do the hard work of trying to lead or build a movement . "
From the other direction , he praises Barack Obama not for his landmark health - care reform , but for his " clean " presidency and his books .
" I voted for Obama positively because I thought the revelation of his character in his books was admirable . "
Hitchens 's fervent support for the " war on terror " and the invasion of Iraq alienated many comrades , but then his relationship with the left has long been an ambivalent one .
He supported the Falklands war , for instance , on the grounds that Argentina 's fascist junta had to be deposed .
It was over US intervention in Bosnia , not Iraq , that he first parted ways with allies such as Noam Chomsky and Edward Said .
On abortion , he outraged American liberals by arguing for the moral and scientific validity of the term " unborn child " .
Marxist , but no socialist
Hitchens stopped describing himself as a socialist in 2002 , but insists that he remains a Marxist and a believer in the materialist conception of history .
This distinction may not be as implausible as it appears .
As the political fallout from the financial crisis demonstrated , while Marxism retains immense analytical appeal , it is of little prescriptive value .
In Hitchens 's boisterous advocacy of the disastrous Iraq war , there is more than an echo of the Marxist belief in the necessity of violence for progress - that nothing should stand in the way of the ­locomotive of history .
To the charge that he has embraced neoconservatism , he said : " I 'm not a conservative of any kind .
A faction willing to take the risks of making war on the ossified status quo in the Middle East can be described as many things , but not as conservative . "
And as if auditioning for a role as a latter - day David Hume , he said that his only allegiance was " to scepticism and to doubt " , having rejected the view that there is any " universal solution " .
“ I had plans for the next decade of my life , " Hitchens recently remarked to a friend , as if he feared the next decade would not happen , at least for him .
" I think , perhaps , I should cancel them . "
Asked why he quit smoking two years ago ( he relapsed while writing the final chapters of Hitch - 22 ) , Hitchens said : " Fear .
I had smoked enough in my life .
The rational part of my brain kicked in and said : ' You must do something . ' "
Around this time , his second wife , the American Carol Blue , whom he married in 1991 , told the Washington Post : " He wants to live - live to see his political enemies defeated . "
Hitchens , who is fond of quipping that we are " born into a losing struggle " , will need all his powers of wit and fortitude as he fights cancer .
“ The one unforgivable sin , " Yvonne Hitchens used to say , " is to be boring . "
Whatever else one may conclude , life would certainly be a lot more boring without her son .

George Eaton writes for the New Statesman blog The Staggers .
Atrazine is receiving lots of attention for turning male frogs into girls , but that 's not all the common herbicide can do .
It also weakens amphibian immune systems , leaving the fragile creatures vulnerable to disease .
Though less obvious than gender bending , immunosuppression could also play a part in the worldwide decline of amphibians , which have porous skin and easily absorb chemicals from rain , groundwater and even water vapor .
" Numerous studies have documented the effects of environmental pollutants on the amphibian immune system .
Nearly all of these studies suggest that amphibians are particularly sensitive , " wrote Tyrone Hayes , a University of California , Berkeley biologist , in a paper published in the March 15 Journal of Experimental Biology .
" In particular , the widespread herbicide atrazine impairs immune function and increases disease rates . "
Hayes is also an author of a March 1 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study on the developmental changes wrought in male frogs by groundwater atrazine concentrations regularly found in the United States , where approximately 80 million pounds of the herbicide are used every year .
The frogs had low levels of sperm and testosterone ; some even produced estrogen , developed female reproductive organs and were ultimately impregnated by their former gender mates .
The findings are disturbing , but atrazine 's effects do n't end there .
As described in the JEB paper , a large body of scientific literature describes how atrazine drives down white cell counts and turns off immune system - regulating genes .
Atrazine also suppresses immune function in snails , which often carry amphibian - infesting parasites , and feeds the algae on which snails live .
It 's a perfect storm of infection : atrazine makes amphibians more vulnerable to disease , and carriers of disease more common .
The best - known amphibian killer , the chytrid fungus , has killed 95 percent of all frogs in Colombia and Panama , and driven 30 species in the Atelopus genus to extinction — and it was only identified in 1993 .
However , according to Hayes , chytrid is only the most apparent amphibian affliction .
Others may go unnoticed because they do n't kill the fragile creatures , but damage their health just enough to prevent populations from sustaining themselves .
About 70 percent of amphibian populations around the world are now in decline .
Atrazine , which is scheduled for review by the Environmental Protection Agency after being declared safe by the Bush - era EPA , is n't the only potential chemical culprit .
Many common pesticides and herbicides have also been linked to amphibian immune malfunction .
But as bad as other chemicals may be , Hayes considers atrazine — which can travel up to 600 miles in groundwater — the worst .
" It 's so common , so mobile and persistent , and so active at low levels , " he said .
" But there may be chemicals out there just as bad , only we do n't have data on them . "

To sum up : Pantsless , mouthy pregnant ladies fighting .
One mouthy pregnant lady getting jumped by two people , then getting knocked out by dude smoking a joint .
Old lady then attacks mouthy pregnant lady .
Police are ... somewhat present ?
Fin. ( NSFW ? ) [ BarStoolSportsJr. ]
Alright , I 'm back in on this because I 've just watched this for the third time already and I 'm trying to understand who - insulted - whom and educate myself in the ways of streetwalker justice or comprehend whatever right is being wronged here .
It appears Pantsless Pink Tights Pregnant Lady and Blue Dress Pregnant ( ? )
Lady initiated the attack first on the Other Pantsless Lady for doing something that was untoward .
Pantsless Pink Tights Pregnant Lady then continues to goad Other Pantsless Lady who now has found comfort in minivan of her friends , but does not appreciate still being provoked after fact .
Then , One Surly Gentleman
In Gray Shirt accompanying Other Pantsless Lady and White Heavy Metalishchick begins to intervene and tells Pantsless Pink Tights Pregnant Lady that she should stop talking or he will have to become physical because that 's the way things are settled in Burger King parking lots in Oakland , regardless if she 's pregnant or not .
Alas , Pantsless Pink Tights Pregnant Lady goes into Burger King to accumulate weaponry in the form of a plastic baby seat .
She then spits at the minivan ( an assault ! ) which infuriates White Heavy Metalishchick who goes all berserko gorilla on Pantless Pink Tights Pregnant Lady .
Other Pantsless
Lady then begins kidney - punch assault as White Heavy Metalishchick continues berserko gorilla attack .
Then Surly Gentleman
In Gray Shirt comes in , separates the women , and begins to land thunderous blows to Pantsless Pink Tights Pregnant Lady .
( The documentarian of this film interjects that the Pantsless Pink Tights Pregnant Lady should have known this was coming because she was in a Burger King parking lot in Oakland saying not - so - nice things about Oakland , which apparently results in a triple - team beatdown .
Duly noted . )
But Pantsless Pink Tights Pregnant Lady , full of moxie and pride , continues to bait the minivan even though her face has now sprouted baked potato - sized lumps and a bloody lip .
She hurls plastic baby seat at minivan as it drives off .
This catches the attention of an Old Lady Dressed Like A Phantom who explains to the Pantsless Pink Tights Pregnant Lady that her mother should become physical with her because she is impolite or something .
As we know , Pantless Pink Tights Pregnant Lady does not take kindly to these insults so she gives it right back to Old Lady Dressed Like A Phantom .
Bad move , as we come to find out that Old Lady Dressed Like A Phantom is still spry and also has a short fuse , despite her accelerated age .
Plus she 's wielding a water bottle which , in Oakland , doubles as a bludgeoning device .
Old Lady Dressed Like A Phantom storms into Burger King after Pantsless Pink Tights Pregnant Lady . Blue Dress Pregnant ( ?)
Lady has seen enough , though , and does not intervene .
This fight dies down quickly because the documentarian is now drawn back outside because a motorcycle cop was just almost run over by a car .
Said documentarian reacts to this incident like a tornado chaser spotting an F5 over an empty field in North Dakota .
He stops filming , but I assume America continued to eat itself in East Oakland that sultry afternoon .
Also , reader Sean S. alerts educates us on some of the background of this incident :
The " verdict " they kept talking about was in a trial for a transit cop who shot and killed an unarmed suspect in the back ( he thought he was pulling his tazer , not his gun ) .
They were expecting riots when the verdict came out ( and they eventually got them ) which is why there were no cops around .
They were all downtown in riot gear .

Indonesian Muslims have been praying in the wrong direction for months , facing Somalia when they should have been facing Saudi Arabia , the country 's highest religious authority says .
A cleric from the Indonesian Ulema Council admitted it had made a mistake in March when calculating which way Muslims should turn to pray .
New instructions had now been issued and people had only to shift their position for the correct alignment , he said .
According to Islamic tradition , the prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca and it is said to be the place where Allah 's message was first revealed to him .
Each day Muslims around the world turn to Mecca to pray and , at least once in their lives if they can afford it , travel there to perform the Haj , or pilgrimage .
Ma'ruf Amin , from the Ulema Council , said a ' ' thorough study with some cosmography and astronomy experts '' revealed that Indonesian Muslims had been facing southern Somalia and Kenya instead of Mecca , which is more than 1600 kilometres further north .
The error did not mean their prayers would be ignored , he said .
'' God understands that humans make mistakes .
Allah always hears their prayers . ''
A Christchurch man has claimed he was sacked from a coaching job at a Christchurch Christian school because he is gay .
The 28 - year - old man told The Star newspaper he was employed at Middleton Grange School to coach one of the girls ' netball teams in February .
However , he was later told by the principal that the school 's Board of Trustees has decided his homosexuality was a problem and he could not continue in the position .
The newspaper reports today that the decision was made based on Christian beliefs that homosexuality is a sin .
It is understood the school has been ordered to apologise to the 28 - year - old and pay him compensation .
He now has a coaching job at another school .
ONE of Australia 's richest divorcees has been ordered to pay her waiter husband $ 4000 a week in spousal maintenance so he can keep up the wealthy lifestyle to which she got him accustomed .
The wife , who cannot be named , is a beneficiary of a trust with $ 600 million in assets .
According to court documents , her income is $ 58,529 a week and , while she was married , she had treated her husband to many luxuries .
Now they are separated , she wanted to pay him $ 18 a week to supplement the $ 380 a week he earns waiting tables between two and six nights a week in a Sydney restaurant .
Family Court judge John Cohen said that was unfair , because the husband had " lived the life of a very wealthy gentleman " until the marriage broke up in 2008 .
" To expect him to work as a waiter in a suburban restaurant or club , as he was when he met his wife , and as he is now doing , is quite unreasonable , " Justice Cohen said .
" He has been a gentleman of leisure for many years . . . the marriage is the direct reason the husband has not maintained or developed employment skills , is not used to work and is used to a life of leisure , luxury and privilege . "
The court heard the couple , known as Read and Chang , met in 1985 and initially lived modestly .
The husband " worked full - time at a club when they started living together " and at one point held two waiting jobs , one during the day and one at night .
In 1989 , the wife began receiving income from a trust .
The amounts were initially modest - some $ 60,000 in the first year , for example - but the trust is now valued at $ 600m .
There are seven beneficiaries .
The husband told the court his wife insisted he give up work when she had their second child " because they could afford to live on the trust she was receiving " .
Justice Cohen said a " good measure " of the manner in which the couple lived was the statement from the black American Express credit card for the year July 2006 to June 2007 .
Total charges were $ 500,527 or a touch over $ 9000 a week .
The court heard the couple " always owned expensive cars , they travelled overseas , they spent $ 1200 on one dinner at a restaurant in Tokyo and $ 1000 at another in Paris , the whole family travelled business class by air " .
The couple moved overseas in 2007 so the children could go to exclusive schools .
They spent $ 19,230 on a television set and $ 4500 on an espresso machine for the new house , but the marriage ended soon after , upon which the husband returned to Australia and resumed work as a casual waiter .
The husband told the court he would need $ 8543 a week to " maintain the lifestyle he has become accustomed to " .
The wife will have to pay the $ 4000 a week until a final split of assets is agreed , at a later date .

Giant planets with wonky orbits mostly circle blistering - hot stars , two new studies find .
This pattern could explain why some " hot Jupiters " – planets from a third to 12 times the mass of Jupiter that sit scorchingly close to their stars – orbit the way their star spins , while others tilt so far that they orbit backward .
" It 's a possible resolution of what would otherwise be a weird fluke , " said astronomer Joshua Winn of MIT , a co-author of one of the new studies .
Originally , astronomers thought planets formed from a swirling disk of gas and dust that revolved around a central star like a record .
When the disk 's material cooled and congealed , the resulting planets all marched in line with the star 's equator .
Hot Jupiters were supposed to have formed around where Jupiter sits in our solar system , then spiraled calmly inward by exchanging gravitational energy with the disk , a process called migration .
The first batch of extrasolar planets discovered fit this picture , reassuring astronomers that their model was right .
But in 2008 , astronomers started finding giant planets whose orbits lay at jaunty angles with respect to their stars .
A recent study declared that so many hot Jupiters have cock - eyed orbits – about half of the 28 whose angles have been directly measured – that scientists should throw out the disk - migration theory altogether .
Instead , most hot Jupiters probably got where they are through a violent encounter with a sibling planet .
Whether a single process could have formed both regular and wrong - way hot Jupiters – and why the first batch of planets looks so different from the second – remained a puzzle .
In a paper posted on arXiv.org and submitted to Astrophysical Journal Letters , astronomers propose an answer to both questions : Wonky hot Jupiters orbit hot stars .
Winn and his colleagues took 19 of the planets whose angles have been measured , and plotted their angles against the temperature of their star .
Only two of 11 planets orbiting cool stars were misaligned , while six out of eight planets orbiting stars with temperatures hotter than 6,250 Kelvin ( 10,790 degrees Fahrenheit ) had tilted orbits .
The team pointed out that the first hot Jupiters were found by observing how the star moved in response to the planet 's gravitational tug .
This method , called Doppler spectroscopy , has an easier time finding planets around relatively cool stars .
The second group was found in transit surveys , where the planet announces its presence by passing in front of the star and blocking some of the star 's light .
This method works better with hotter , brighter stars , because the contrast is greater .
" That 's why the first bunch of stars we looked at showed well - aligned orbits , and the second batch showed misaligned orbits : because the second batch were mainly hot stars , " Winn said .
A second paper accepted to the Astrophysical Journal came to the same conclusion by a different route .
Kevin Schlaufman , a graduate student at the University of California , Santa Cruz , noted that current techniques measure only the angle between the star and the planet 's orbit , but the angle between the star and the Earth is also needed to draw a complete picture in three - dimensional space .
One way to estimate this angle is to check how fast the star seems to spin .
Astronomers can tell how fast a star should spin based on its age and its mass .
If the star apparently spins too slowly , that 's a clue that it 's not facing the Earth edge - on .
Planets that cross in front of their stars must have edge - on orbits from the Earth 's point of view , or we would n't see them .
So if a star spins too slowly but has a transiting planet , that means the planet is at a wonky angle .
Schlaufman did a statistical study of 75 exoplanet systems , and found that 10 of them should have tilted orbits .
Several of the planets his computations picked out were already known to have funny orbits .
And all of them circled large , hot stars .
" I find that encouraging , and a signal that we 're onto something good , " Winn said .
" We have these two pretty much totally independent ways of checking , and they give the same result . "
Winn suggested that the transition temperature could explain why only hot stars have tilted planets .
Stars that burn cool have thick outer layers called convective zones that respond strongly to the gravitational pull of the planet .
The friction from the planet and the star yanking each other around robs energy from the planet 's orbit .
The orbit slowly becomes circular and settles into alignment with the star 's equator , a position that takes less energy to maintain .
Stars hotter than 6,250 Kelvin have thin or even nonexistent convective zones , Winn said , so their hot Jupiters stay wherever their violent histories parked them .
" It struck us as interesting that this transition from well - aligned planets to misaligned planets happens to be at about the same temperature as convective zones , " Winn said .
The theory still has some kinks to work out , like keeping the planet from getting swallowed up by the star .
Astronomer Andrew Collier - Cameron of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland , who was not involved in the new study , calls for more observations .
" It 's early days yet , and we 're still working with a grand total of only about 28 planets , " Cameron said .
" Until we go do the legwork and measure more of them , there 's still plenty of wriggle room for theorists . "
Cameron also noted that , though " rampaging hot Jupiters " could knock any other planets out of their systems , most of the galaxy 's Earth - like planets are probably safe .
Hot Jupiters are " rare beasts , " he said .
" By and large , although they may mess up their own systems , they do n't really harm the chances of us finding terrestrial type planets . "

“ We still have a great deal of work to do to repair the economy and get the American people back to work , ” Mr. Obama said on Friday .
Yet the steps he highlighted to show the government ’s concern  some public works projects  are part of the two - year stimulus package he won a month after taking office , rather than new initiatives .
Over the last few weeks , Democrats in the Senate have failed to muster enough votes to pass a new package of measures to address the economic weakness , reflecting what some of them see as the political perils of further deficit spending .
Within the White House , all of the Obama advisers , along with many outside economists , agree that both things are needed  additional stimulus this year and , before long , a clear sign that the government will soon take actions on taxes and entitlement spending , phased in over time , to reduce a debt that mounted during the recession to the highest levels since World War II .
The advisers ’ debate is over the timing and scale of any stimulus or deficit reduction .
Those pressing for more stimulus measures include Christina Romer , the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers ; Jared Bernstein , economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ; and the Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner , who took that message internationally to the Group of 20 summit meeting of developed nations last weekend in Canada .
Lawrence H. Summers , who as director of the National Economic Council tries to broker what he calls the “ brakes - versus - accelerator ” debates , nonetheless makes the economic arguments for an additional stimulus , officials say .
More focused on deficits  or at least on positioning Mr. Obama to show his concern  are his chief strategist , David Axelrod , other political advisers and Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , according to Democrats .
Their lone supporter among the top economic aides is Peter R. Orszag , the budget director , who will leave the administration this month .
Mr. Axelrod , in an interview , said he often argues for emphasizing deficit reduction in part because “ it ’s my job to report what the public mood is . ”
He added , “ I ’ve made the point that as a matter of policy and a matter of politics that we need to focus on this , and the president certainly agrees with that . ”

The elusive founder of WikiLeaks , who is at the centre of a potential US national security sensation , has surfaced from almost a month in hiding to tell the Guardian he does not fear for his safety but is on permanent alert .
Julian Assange , a renowned Australian hacker who founded the electronic whistleblowers ' platform WikiLeaks , vanished when a young US intelligence analyst in Baghdad was arrested .
The analyst , Bradley Manning , had bragged he had sent 260,000 incendiary US state department cables on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to WikiLeaks .
The prospect of the cache of classified intelligence on the US conduct of the two wars being put online is a nightmare for Washington .
The sensitivity of the information has generated media reports that Assange is the target of a US manhunt .
" [ US ] public statements have all been reasonable .
But some statements made in private are a bit more questionable , " Assange told the Guardian in Brussels .
" Politically it would be a great error for them to act .
I feel perfectly safe … but I have been advised by my lawyers not to travel to the US during this period . "
Assange appeared in public in Brussels for the first time in almost a month to speak at a seminar on freedom of information at the European parliament .
He said : " We need support and protection .
We have that .
More is always helpful .
But we believe that the situation is stable and under control .
There 's no need to be worried .
There 's a need always to be on the alert . "
Manning is being held incommunicado by the US military in Kuwait after " confessing " to a Californian hacker on a chatline , declaring he wanted " people to see the truth " .
He said he had collected 260,000 top secret US cables in Baghdad and sent them to WikiLeaks , whose server operates out of Sweden .
Adrian Lamo , the California hacker he spoke to , handed the transcripts of the exchanges to the FBI .
Manning was promptly arrested in Baghdad at the end of last month and transferred to a US military detention unit in Kuwait .
He has been held for more than three weeks without charge .
Assange said WikiLeaks had hired three US criminal lawyers to defend Manning but that they had been granted no access to him .
Manning has instead been assigned US military counsel .
While WikiLeaks declined to confirm receipt of the material from Manning , it has already released a film of a US Apache helicopter attack on civilians in Baghdad .
It has also posted a confidential state department cable on negotiations in Reykjavik over Iceland 's financial collapse and is preparing to disclose much more material , including film of a US attack that left scores of civilians dead in Afghanistan .
The material is believed to derive from Manning , although WikiLeaks does not reveal its sources and its operations are designed to mask the source of the files it receives .
Prominent US whistleblowers and lawyers have advised Assange to stay out of the US and to be ultra-careful about his travel and public appearances .
" Pentagon investigators are trying to determine the whereabouts of [ Assange ] for fear that he may be about to publish a huge cache of classified state department cables that , if made public , could do serious damage to national security , " US web paper the Daily Beast reported 10 days ago .
" We 'd like to know where he is – we'd like his co-operation in this , " a US official was quoted as saying .
Daniel Ellsberg , who leaked the Pentagon Papers – a top secret study about the Vietnam war – in 1973 , spoke to the Daily Beast .
He said : " I would think that [ Assange ] is in some danger .
Granted , I would think that his notoriety now would provide him some degree of protection . "
Assange said : " Some fear for my life .
I 'm not one of them .
We have to avoid some countries , avoid travel , until we know where the political arrow is pointing . "
He added that WikiLeaks had been trying , " unsuccessfully so far " , to contact Manning in Kuwait .
" Clearly , a young man is detained in very difficult circumstances with the allegation he is the whistleblower .
We must do our best to obtain freedom for him . "
Regarding his own predicament , Assange said the US state department had signalled it was not seeking any WikiLeaks people because the Pentagon 's criminal investigations command had assumed the lead role in the case .
Apart from preparing much more material for release , WikiLeaks is planning to publicise a secret US military video of one of its deadliest air strikes in Afghanistan in which scores of children are believed to have been killed in May last year .
The Afghan government said about 140 civilians were killed in Garani , including 92 children .
The US military initially said that up to 95 died , of whom about 65 were insurgents .
US officials have since wavered on that claim .
A subsequent investigation admitted mistakes were made .
In April WikiLeaks released the Baghdad video , prompting considerable criticism of the Pentagon .
The film was edited and produced in Iceland where Assange spends a lot of his time and which last week prepared the most radical and liberal freedom of information legislation anywhere in the world .
Birgitta Jonsdottir , an Iceland MP and anti-war activist who led the drive for the new laws , co-produced the WikiLeaks version of the Baghdad video .
" I worked on it 18 hours a day through the Easter holidays , " she said .
Jonsdottir , a close associate of Assange , said the WikiLeaks founder " went into hiding when the story of Manning 's arrest was published " .
There probably is n’t a single music fan in the world who is n’t aware that Prince is totally bananas .
That said , he ’s really raised the bar for himself in a new interview with the The Mirror — the UK tabloid in which , for some reason , he ’s chosen to release his next album 20 Ten on Saturday .
For free .
The piece of the profile that ’s making headlines around the world is the snippet in which the Purple One explains that he ’s entirely unplugged from the Internet because it ’s “ completely over . ”
But those who only focus on that sound bite are missing out on a few thousand words of weird .
And , of course , it ’s all entertainingly complicated by the paper ’s obvious interest in hyping the album to sell its own newspaper .
Check out our favorite excerpts , from Prince ’s “ evangelical TV documentary ” to an impromptu Soul Train dance party , after the jump .
1. Prince fires his interviewer .
We ’re two minutes into Beatles classic ‘ Come Together ’ and I ’m getting into my stride when I become aware that Prince is staring across at me and wincing .
“ Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! ” he shouts , slamming his hand down on his purple grand piano .
“ Have you ever seen The Apprentice on TV ?
Cos You ’re fired ! ”
2. The Internet is so 2009 .
[ Prince ] says : “ The internet ’s completely over .
I do n’t see why I should give my new music to iTunes or anyone else .
They wo n’t pay me an advance for it and then they get angry when they ca n’t get it .
“ The internet ’s like MTV .
At one time MTV was hip and suddenly it became outdated .
Anyway , all these computers and digital gadgets are no good .
“ They just fill your head with numbers and that ca n’t be good for you . ”
3. Prince wants listeners to be surprised … by his track titles .
“ This one ’s called ‘ Compassion , ' ” says Prince .
But as I try to scribble it down he looks aghast , grabs my wrist and pleads : “ Please , please .
It ’s a surprise , do n’t spoil it for people . ”
4. 2010 is the year when Corporate America causes the apocalypse .
So why did you decide to call the album 20TEN ?
I ask .
“ I just think it ’s a year that really matters , ” he says .
These are very trying times . ”
To emphasise the point he chivvies me into another room , switches on the TV and shows me clips from an evangelical TV documentary blaming corporate America for a range of woes from Hurricane Katrina to asthmatic children .
5 . Do n’t ask about Prince ’s childhood .
Prince talks about his beliefs with missionary zeal , but ask him anything remotely personal and he ’s brusque .
Question him on his childhood and he says : “ I do n’t talk about the past . ”
6 . Do n’t ask about Michael Jackson .
And on late friend / foe Michael Jackson , he simply replies : “ Next question . ”
7 . Prince always keeps background singers on hand .
Time for another surprise .
“ Come , ” he says , and like an excitable Willy Wonka , he leads me down corridors lined with glinting platinum discs to a lounge where his three talented backing singers , Shelby Johnson , Olivia Warfield and Elisa Fiorilla , are waiting by an ebony futuristic grand piano .
8 . Prince engages in alcohol - free , vegan , Jehovah ’s Witness debauchery .
But where are the guests ?
And where ’s the bar ?
Of course , I remember , he ’s a strict teetotal vegan — when one of those backing singers wanders in , offering me a glass of still water .
She is closely followed by the other two , carrying trays of sliced melon and raw vegetables , which they place on a long table beside a large Bible .
“ Help yourself , ” says one .
9. Prince ( abruptly ) remembers the ’70s .
Just when it could n’t get any more bizarre , Prince clambers behind video equipment under the stairs and starts screening 1970s clips from the US TV show Soul Train of his music heroes such as Marvin Gaye and Barry White .
He urges his guests — all five of us — to dance and the spirited backing singers look like they ’re having the time of their lives .
10 .
Prince divulges the secret to his eternal youth .
He adds earnestly : “ Playing electric guitar your whole life does something to you .
I ’m convinced all that electricity racing through my body made me keep my hair . ”

Foxit Reader has long been the most visible Windows alternative to Adobe Reader , but in the latest update this popular freeware falters .
How far it 's stumbled depends on how annoyed you get at installation shenanigans .
Granted , there are some useful new features added , but where the jump from version 2 to version 3 cut bloat while adding in a few features , version 4 adds some new features while also throwing some unpleasant curve balls your way .
( Credit : Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt / CNET )
The setup process has grown more cumbersome , without a doubt .
It automatically will check you into the Foxit license agreement , and users are also opted - in to the Foxit Search Bar which changes your default search provider to Ask and makes Ask.com your home page .
On their own , these would be annoying enough , but users are also opted - in to the Foxit add - on for Firefox , and into creating desktop , quick launch , and Start menu icons that link to eBay .
Obviously , that 's a business model plan for Foxit , but the connection between Foxit and eBay is even more tenuous than Foxit and Ask.com .
Worst of all , in our tests it commandeered the default PDF reader setting even though we unchecked that box .
I dislike criticizing a company 's business model , but forcing users to opt - out instead of opt - in combined with a surprisingly large number of preselected options , and it's hard not to conclude that the cumbersome installation unfairly burdens the program 's otherwise reasonable features .
The interface is practically indistinguishable from the previous version .
The toolbar still contains a lengthy row of icons .
It 's not a bad design , but it does look very Windows XP and might be overwhelming to some users .
Nine months after the official launch of sales - ripping Windows 7 is too long to be ignoring the new paradigm .
Thankfully , the toolbar is fully customizable , with a deep set of options .
You can start tweaking the configurations by right - clicking on it .

There are some useful new features that should serve to remind users why alternatives to Adobe Reader are so valuable .
In addition to the tabbed PDF reading , measuring tools , and auto - scrolling , it appears that Foxit has removed its demand that users install its toolbar before getting access to editing features , such as highlighting , commenting , hyperlink creation .
There 's a new text view feature that automatically lets you view a PDF as text - only , and watermark - free printing has been extended to users of the free edition .
Foxit does lack some notable options , such as PDF creation and drag - and - drop , and the persistent pestering to add features is annoying , even though some of the features that you can add to Foxit are free .
For example , Foxit promotes an online collaborative system called OnDemandCM on the program 's landing page when you open Foxit without loading a PDF .
Once you install the add - on you 'll be asked to register at the Foxit site , but using the service itself is n't free .
Over a half - day of use , Foxit 's performance varied .
Mostly it would open PDFs and maneuver within them easily ; occasionally it would be sluggish and momentarily unresponsive .
Foxit still remains lighter on your system resources than Adobe Reader , but given the improving performances of online and in - browser editing tools and the strong debut of the free Nitro PDF Reader , it 's hard to recommend Foxit enthusiastically .

Five health care facilities have signed an agreement with the New York Attorney General 's Office to settle charges that they polluted the state 's watersheds by dumping pharmaceutical products down sinks and toilets .
In 2008 , and Associated Press investigation revealed that the drinking water consumed by more than one - sixth of the U.S. population is contaminated with trace ( but potentially biologically active ) amounts of over - the - counter and prescription drugs .
While some of these chemicals enter sewage systems after being excreted by people taking the drugs , many of them were traced back to a common practice in hospitals and other health - care facilities : disposing of unused pharmaceuticals by flushing them down sinks or toilets .
After state tests of New York watersheds revealed widespread pharmaceutical contamination , the Attorney General 's Office launched an investigation .
Eventually , five facilities -- Putnam Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Holmes in Putnam County , and O'Connor Hospital , Countryside Care Center , Margaretville Memorial Hospital and Mountainside Residential Care Center in Delaware County -- were charged with numerous federal and state violations , including failure to properly track , label , store and dispose of drugs .
The hospitals and nursing homes were found to have improperly dumped antibiotics , antidepressants , hormones , painkillers and other pharmaceutical products directly into the state water supply .
The watersheds contaminated supply water to New York City 's eight million residents , as well as another one million people in several counties to the north .
Each facility will pay a fine of between $ 3,500 and $ 12,500 .
Although state law does not prohibit the dumping of all pharmaceuticals down the drain -- only some -- the facilities have agreed to end the practice completely .
Ten other health care facilities in the state are also being investigated for watershed pollution through drug dumping .
Attorney General Andrew Cuomo called the practice " an emerging threat .
" The Environmental Protection Agency has classified pharmaceutical products as " contaminants of growing concern .

Dubai : Simon Boaler does n't drive to work everyday .
Nor does he take a cab .
Instead he hops on his Trikke , a three - wheel bike - looking machine , and rides it to the nearest Metro station , making his way to work .
A gasoline - free and carbon emissions - free ride , the new ecologically sound means of transportation is slowly rolling into the UAE market .
Since its introduction in September 2009 , more than 340 Trikkes have been sold in the UAE .
" The ball just started rolling , " Boaler , Managing Director of Sustainable Technologies — Division of Bond Group , told Gulf News .
Developed by a Brazilian aeronautical engineer who wanted to combine his two favourite sports , skiing and cycling , the Trikke was originally a human powered product , Boaler said .
Later , an electrical version of it was introduced .
Today it is powered by a 250 - watt motor and a 36 - hour full recyclable battery .
" If you use the product every single day and recharge the battery every single day you can recycle that battery — recharging it over 1,500 times , " he said .
The motor Trikke currently sells for Dh8,900 .
It has two speed settings : one that can go up to 20 km/h and another that can go up to 30 km/h .
Boaler said the Trikke is for people of all ages .
" You do n't have to balance yourself because you always have the three points of contact on the ground and whether you 're wearing an abaya or a kandoura , anybody can ride it . "
That is because the Trikke is driven standing up as opposed to a bike .
Weighing only 18 kg , the Trikke is foldable , enabling riders to carry it around when necessary .
" You can carry it .
You can keep it in your office or put it in your car .
You can even wheel it onto the train , " he said .
Gated communities are some of the targeted consumers for the Trikke .
" In these clusters , you have families , so you do n't necessarily want a lot of vehicles .
The more cars you take off the road , the better , " he said .
" So if you forget to grab the milk , you do n't have to start your car again , you can just hop on your Trikke . "
" What we quickly discovered was that this can work well for businesses as well .
Since then we have supplied warehouses , police units , airports and the RTA parking . "
Sustainable Technologies is now developing a golf version of the Trikke to be used on golf courses .
" It will have fatter tyres , two motors in the rear wheels instead of one motor in the front wheel and it will be able to carry a lot more weight , " he said .
Boaler said that apart from being ecologically sound , it is the best way to make friends .
" Wherever I ride it , people wave me down .
I 've made lots of friends riding it . "
JOHANNESBURG , South Africa — South Africa dazzled the world with its new 2010 World Cup stadiums .
The sports bowls built around the country have been almost universally praised for their modernity , their beauty , and their ambitious scale .
In all , the country built or renovated 10 new stadiums in preparation for the games at a cost of more than $ 2 billion .
But some are asking whether that money was spent wisely in a country where so many live without basic services such as flush toilets and trash removal .
Furthermore , they want to know where the money will come from to sustain the enormous structures once the soccer stars , fans , and perhaps most significantly , FIFA , leave South Africa after the final match on July 11 .
“ I do n’t know how they ’re going to be maintained , ” said Horatio Motjuwadi , editor of The Sowetan , who called the stadiums white elephants that South Africans are now stuck with for a long time to come .
“ You need a mathematician to figure out how they are going to move forward and pay for them after the World Cup . ”
Nowhere is this as true as in Polokwane , a rural city of just over 500,000 , three hours to the north of Johannesburg .
A satellite towns with a racially polarized and economically disparate population , Polokwane is perhaps most famous for being the place where former President Thabo Mbeki was ousted as leader of the African National Congress party in 2008 , which led to him stepping down as president .
For the first time in its history , Polokwane now has an iconic landmark , the state - of - the - art Peter Mokaba Stadium , which holds over 40,000 people .
The design of the enormous concrete structure resembles South Africa 's baobab tree , with circular ambulatory ramps simulating tree trunks and overhead steel “ canopies . ”
It was named after a deceased politician from the National Conress Party who fought against apartheid but was also well known for using the slogan " Kill the boer , kill the farmer . "
For a stadium in a majority white city , it 's an odd legacy to honor .
In spite of its grand scale and inspired architecture , Mokaba Stadium hosted just four games during the entire World Cup , all during the first round .
Now it ’s unknown how it will pay for itself .
Reports in the South African media estimate that its annual maintenance costs will be around $ 2 million .
Polokwane has no local football team and even if visiting teams come to play , it is unlike to draw enough fans to fill the 40,000 brand new seats .
Of the 212 football games played by South Africa ’s Premiere Football League in the 2009 - 2010 season , only four drew more than 40,000 fans , according to Sports Industry Magazine .
News this week that Port Elizabeth ’s bankrupt football club was sold to investors from outside the city has raised concerns that Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium might also sit unused .
" I have no doubt that without a full - time professional team in the province , the stadium will become a white elephant , " said Lungsi Mooi , general manager of the club , to the Associated Press .
In Cape Town , Green Point Stadium is covered in a sheath of woven fiberglass so that it glows at night like a floating bowl .
But its location on six city blocks in a prime real estate area has also created controversy .
In 2006 , the city ’s government published a study that found the stadium 's location offered the least amount of economic gain to Cape Town ’s resident .
In fact , repairs to several older stadiums in the surrounding area could have led to savings that could have paid for 250,000 new homes for the city ’s poor , according to researchers .
But FIFA wanted a stadium that would sit between South Africa ’s iconic Table Mountain and Robben Island , according to reports , causing the football federation ’s president , Sepp Blatter , to come under fire .
" I really think that we 're going into Green Point because Sepp Blatter says : ' I like Green Point , ' not because it is the best thing for South Africans , " Cape Town 's then - mayor , Helen Zille , said in 2006 .
Like the other stadiums around the country , the financial viability of Green Point Stadium in the future has not been outlined in detail .
President Jacob Zuma has said the stadiums will be used for the country ’s rugby and cricket leagues and argues they should be seen as an investment in the country ’s future .
Zuma has already suggested that South Africa will bid to host the 2020 Olympics .
“ We are also looking into getting foreign soccer stars , especially during the European League season , to come play here , ” Zuma told reporters last week .
" There are a number of plans in place to make the stadiums profitable after the last whistle blows . ”
Previous World Cup hosts such as Germany , France , and the United States have been able to use their stadiums for a wide range of sporting events after the soccer games ended .
Japan and South Korea , the co-hosts of the 2002 games , however , had more difficulty .
The two countries built 18 state - of - the - art stadiums from the ground up ( two already existing stadiums were renovated ) .
In South Korea some of the venues , like the 40,000 - seat Jeju World Cup Stadium in Seogwipo — a small island province in South Korea — are reportedly filling a mere 10 to 20 percent of their seats during the country ’s professional football matches .
Previous Olympic hosts have also struggled with white elephants .
The Bird ’s Nest stadium where the 2008 Summer Olympics kicked - off in Beijing has been used only once since the opening ceremony .
Despite their doubts , some South Africans are still choosing to focus on the physical glory of the new stadiums before national buyer ’s remorse can set in .
“ I think everyone knows that the money we spent on stadiums was crazy , ” said Anton Harber , a prominent South African journalist and professor at the University of Witwatersrand .
“ But it did teach us that we can build big , beautiful things . "

[ social_buttons ]
Solar energy giant First Solar closed a major deal to acquire NextLight Renewable Power , LLC for $ 297 million this week .
This acquisition gives First Solar access to a 1,100 MW solar project pipeline in the southwestern US and gives it control of other NextLight projects with already signed power purchase agreements totalling 570MW .
First Solar is becoming a giant in this field .
It is the largest solar developer in the US and now has “ power purchase agreements for 2.2GW of utility - scale solar projects in North America , ” Business Green reports .
NextLight ’s project developers and staff will now join the First Solar team and will start work later in the year on a 290MW Agua Caliente Solar Project in Yuma County , Arizona that NextLight planned .
First Solar has acquired several companies in the last few years and First Solar chief executive Rob Gillette says that they are looking to dominate the fast - expanding market for utility - scale solar projects in the US .
“ Success in today ’s competitive solar market requires a complete solution for our customers ’ renewable energy needs , ” Gillette says .
“ First Solar is uniquely positioned to deliver utility - scale solar power plants , including project development , module manufacturing , engineering , procurement and construction , project finance expertise and operations and maintenance . ”

Obama Best Democratic President Since LBJ ?
How do President Obama 's accomplishments stack up from a liberal standpoint ?
James Joyner · · 15 comments
Kevin Drum assesses President Obama ’s record in light of yesterday ’s passage of financial regulatory reform :
Here ’s the good news : this record of progressive accomplishment officially makes Obama the most successful domestic Democratic president of the last 40 years .
And here ’s the bad news : this shoddy collection of centrist , watered down , corporatist sellout legislation was all it took to make Obama the most successful domestic Democratic president of the last 40 years .
Take your pick .
In any case , I think this probably marks the end of Obama ’s major legislative agenda .
I do n’t give Congress much chance of passing a climate bill , and after the midterms the Democratic majority will either be gone or significantly reduced , making large - scale legislation just about impossible .
I tend to agrees .
The only significant domestic initiative I could see passing at this stage is some sort of regulatory correction in light of the BP oil spill disaster , and even that ’s likely to be relatively modest .
But , yes , Obama has moved the dial much more than Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter , the only other Democratic presidents since Richard Nixon took office in 1969 .
The former was a very effective president for the middle four years or so of his administration and the latter something of a failure , but neither were liberal firebrands and , more importantly , neither of them had the sort of crises to leverage that Obama has .
For comparison , though , go back to the Democrat before Nixon : Lyndon Johnson was much more successful at moving the country in a progressive direction , what with the Great Society programs , the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .
That simply blows away health insurance reform , financial regulatory reform , and the stimulus boondoggle .
LBJ ’s reforms were not only more significant but more cost effective .
What is identity ?
Or rather can we define our identity pursuant to our sexual inclinations ?
In this rivetting essay award winning journalist Mikey Rox asks some provocative questions - what is it to be gay , is it the gaiety , the parading about town , the costumes , the dancing to Abba or at the end of the day the act of sex itself ?
Furthermore how does this identity paradigm parallel to straight culture ?
And has gay culture gone over the top ?
We trust that you will be provoked one way or another .
– Scallywag the Editor .
Over the years , I ’ve learned that there are distinct differences between straight and gay .
For instance , the terms “ trick , ” “ bear ” and “ bottom ” have entirely different definitions for us than our hetero counterparts .
Pride is not a feeling but rather a festival .
Bars can no longer be generalized as recreational establishments ; there are straight bars and there are gay bars .
The same goes for marriage – these days , it ’s either traditional or nontraditional .
Everything we do is different , in fact .
And if you ’re uninformed , well , we ’ve got that covered , too .
Simply pick up a big , queer dictionary – $ 19.95 at Barnes and Noble – and you ’re all set .
Lucky for us , we ’re willing to manipulate our lives to placate gay culture .
But that ’s not without a substantial time investment .
You did n’t actually think we ’re intuitively tuned into this “ alternative lifestyle , ” did you ?
Thus , we study .
We study hard , too .
Because it ’s these definitions – decided upon sometime in the 1970s in the back of a big rig on Avenue A , I ’m convinced – that we think define us as individuals .
But there ’s a downside to all that blind ambition .
In our quest to find our place in the world – and consumed by trying to please everyone else – we ’ve neglected the most important part of being gay : Ourselves .
Still , we wonder why mainstream society has a hard time figuring us out .
Perhaps it ’s because we ’re so wrapped up in drag races , lube wrestling competitions and gay bingo that many of us have lost our identities – the essence of what makes us unique .
We ’ve become so involved with pillaging pieces of others ’ personas , that , many times , we lose sight of who we are inside .
But I could be wrong .
Maybe we know exactly who we are .
If that ’s the case , though , I think we ’re in one hell of a heap of trouble .
Outward appearances aside – it ’s our presentations of self that creates the way in which we ’re viewed by the world at large .
And the world at large ai n’t smilin ’ down on us .
All things considered , there must be more to this separation between cultures than how we speak , walk or dress .
The majority of the voting American public ca n’t be holding a grudge against us for aspects so petty .
So I searched for reasons why there are such perverse feelings towards homosexuality .
And just when I thought I ’d exhausted my leads , I stumbled upon the answer .
He was performing fellatio on a second - floor patio – surrounded by an audience – at a leather bar in Baltimore .
A design may have impact .
It may have style .
But having these is n’t enough .
To work well , a design has to have elements that play off each other ’s strengths .
Fortunately , every piece of content has inherent guidelines .
Layout , or the arrangement of content on a web page , is critical to a design ’s success .
Among other things , layout prioritizes content to lead people from one element to the next .
If done right , people will be so interested in the content that they wo n’t notice anything else .
Read on for more details and tips for creating layouts that work in your designs .
With the example below , most people will notice either the photo or the headline first , then the text and finally the links .
They may not notice that the headline , text and model ’s face are set one third and two thirds into the page respectively ( honoring the rule of thirds ) , or that the headline and links are written in colors sampled from the model ’s lips , or that the curve of her shoulder leads the eye toward the calls to action .
Text , photo and headline make up a composition .
If one falls out of place , the whole piece fails .
Arrangement Based on Mutual Respect
Where do we put things ?
Let them tell us .
The quirks of graphics , photos and chunks of text become apparent when they meet on a page .
Some work together better than others , and some work only when placed a certain way .
For example , our layout technically works in two ways :
Figure 1 shows the layout used in our example above .
Gray blocks represent the headline , photo and text .
Figure 2 shows how the same principles would apply to its inversion : one large element balanced by two smaller elements .
This particular photo looks better on the right , though .
Our model is looking to the left .
In figure 1 , she ’s looking at the text .
In figure 2 , she ’s looking away from the text .
That might have worked if she was looking at the camera , but because she ’s looking away , it loses some impact .
Not much , but enough to matter .
The model alternately shows interest in the text and , when inverted , ignores it .
The arrangement of elements establishes either a positive or negative attitude .
Alignment Based on Landmarks
Sometimes the thing that makes elements work a certain way also provides clues about space and alignment .
We noted how the model ’s eyes point to the left , but the photo and text contain other visual cues .
Implied lines between landmarks in the typography and the image abound in this composition :
The model ’s eye and lips and the edge of her nose meet the edge of the right - hand column of text .
The left - hand column of text meets the left edge of the headline .
It almost reaches the edge of the model ’s hair but falls short to stay consistent with the right - hand column .
The model ’s face ( particularly the eyes and mouth ) defines the vertical space of the headline .
The bottom of the photo marks the bottom third of the composition ( in the rule of thirds ) .
The model ’s eyes are one third from the top of the composition .
The center of the model ’s face and the right edge of the headline meet at the one - third and two - thirds points of the composition ’s width .
Some landmarks have more power than others .
Designers and photographers could debate , for example , whether the model ’s eyes are more influential than her silhouette .
But a layout based on any landmarks is better than a layout that ignores them .
Using Features to Create Harmony
Non-designers who try their hand at layouts sometimes arrange elements based on how they fit onto the page .
Space should be respected , but it does n’t always lead to the best design .
Figure 5 aligns elements to the page ’s space and bases everything on the boundaries of the canvas .
Figure 6 , though , bases its layout on focal points in the photo .
The result is a more streamlined appearance .
Figure 5 is inefficient because viewers bounce around between focal points : to the headline , down to the face , up to the text .
The simplest line is straight .
Hence , figure 6 guides the viewer ’s gaze easily from left to right , from one element to the next .
The crux of the second layout is a narrow band running along the headline - face - text alignment .
In these images , readers are drawn to the model ’s face , the headline and the text — usually in that order .
That ’s three different areas to look at .
Aligning them gives the layout focus .
The Right Answer
All three layouts below use the same headline , photo and text elements :
The first layout has the most “ breathing room . ”
The second respects the text .
The third layout uses negative space to achieve balance .
All three use landmarks but in different ways .
Is one the best ?
Hunting for an answer may blind us to the obvious : that multiple solutions can be equally valid when the elements work together .
Visual landmarks are opportunities , not rules .
Take another look at the first design .
The more the elements conform to implied lines , the more a non-conforming element will stand out .
Here , the designer breaks the word “ Landmarks ” from the other text ’s vertical alignment , thus emphasizing the keyword .
There ’s no doubt about what the page is promoting .
Success is n’t measured by how strictly elements conform to principles of design but by how well the page communicates its message .

Goldman Sachs to Pay Record $ 550 Million to Settle SEC Charges Related to Subprime Mortgage CDO Firm Acknowledges CDO Marketing Materials Were Incomplete and Should Have Revealed Paulson 's Role FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010 - 123 High - Res Photo
“ This settlement is a stark lesson to Wall Street firms that no product is too complex , and no investor too sophisticated , to avoid a heavy price if a firm violates the fundamental principles of honest treatment and fair dealing . ”

SEC Enforcement Video of News Conference Text of News Conference Remarks Washington , D.C. , July 15 , 2010 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Goldman , Sachs & Co. will pay $ 550 million and reform its business practices to settle SEC charges that Goldman misled investors in a subprime mortgage product just as the U.S. housing market was starting to collapse .
In agreeing to the SEC 's largest - ever penalty paid by a Wall Street firm , Goldman also acknowledged that its marketing materials for the subprime product contained incomplete information .
Additional Materials Goldman Consent
Proposed Judgment
Litigation Release No. 21592
In its April 16 complaint , the SEC alleged that Goldman misstated and omitted key facts regarding a synthetic collateralized debt obligation ( CDO ) it marketed that hinged on the performance of subprime residential mortgage - backed securities .
Goldman failed to disclose to investors vital information about the CDO , known as ABACUS 2007 - AC1 , particularly the role that hedge fund Paulson & Co. Inc. played in the portfolio selection process and the fact that Paulson had taken a short position against the CDO .
In settlement papers submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York , Goldman made the following acknowledgement : Goldman acknowledges that the marketing materials for the ABACUS 2007 - AC1 transaction contained incomplete information .
In particular , it was a mistake for the Goldman marketing materials to state that the reference portfolio was " selected by " ACA Management LLC without disclosing the role of Paulson & Co. Inc. in the portfolio selection process and that Paulson 's economic interests were adverse to CDO investors .
Goldman regrets that the marketing materials did not contain that disclosure .
" Half a billion dollars is the largest penalty ever assessed against a financial services firm in the history of the SEC , " said Robert Khuzami , Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement .
" This settlement is a stark lesson to Wall Street firms that no product is too complex , and no investor too sophisticated , to avoid a heavy price if a firm violates the fundamental principles of honest treatment and fair dealing . "
Lorin L. Reisner , Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement , added , " The unmistakable message of this lawsuit and today 's settlement is that half - truths and deception cannot be tolerated and that the integrity of the securities markets depends on all market participants acting with uncompromising adherence to the requirements of truthfulness and honesty . "
Goldman agreed to settle the SEC 's charges without admitting or denying the allegations by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that provides for a permanent injunction from violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 .
Of the $ 550 million to be paid by Goldman in the settlement , $ 250 million would be returned to harmed investors through a Fair Fund distribution and $ 300 million would be paid to the U.S. Treasury .
The landmark settlement also requires remedial action by Goldman in its review and approval of offerings of certain mortgage securities .
This includes the role and responsibilities of internal legal counsel , compliance personnel , and outside counsel in the review of written marketing materials for such offerings .
The settlement also requires additional education and training of Goldman employees in this area of the firm 's business .
In the settlement , Goldman acknowledged that it is presently conducting a comprehensive , firm - wide review of its business standards , which the SEC has taken into account in connection with the settlement of this matter .
The settlement is subject to approval by the Honorable Barbara S. Jones , United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York .
Today 's settlement , if approved by Judge Jones , resolves the SEC 's enforcement action against Goldman related to the ABACUS 2007 - AC1 CDO .
It does not settle any other past , current or future SEC investigations against the firm .
Meanwhile , the SEC 's litigation continues against Fabrice Tourre , a vice president at Goldman .
The SEC investigation that led to the filing and settlement of this enforcement action was conducted by the Enforcement Division 's Structured and New Products Unit , led by Kenneth Lench and Reid Muoio , and including Jason Anthony , N. Creola Kelly , Melissa Lamb , and Jeffrey Leasure .
Additionally , together with Deputy Director Reisner , Richard Simpson , David Gottesman , and Jeffrey Tao have been handling the litigation .

From The New York Times LENS feature Behind the Scenes : Still Wounded
Mr. Huey , 33 , is a photographer for Smithsonian , National Geographic Adventure and National Geographic Traveler .
He also freelances for The New Yorker and Geo .
In 2007 , he photographed in Afghanistan for The Times .
Overwhelmed by the poverty — and at the same time by scenes of people trying to maintain the Lakota way of life — Mr. Huey abandoned the rest of his nationwide project to focus on Pine Ridge .
Five years later , he ’s still photographing on the reservation , which includes the Wounded Knee massacre site .
" It was emotionally devastating , " Mr. Huey said .
" I ‘d call my wife late at night crying . "
The poverty he found on the reservation stopped him cold .
Aaron Huey arrived on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota at the start of a self - assigned photographic road trip to document poverty in America .
Regarding the video below :
Challenging us with stunning images , Aaron Huey relates the fight for survival on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation .
Aaron began photographing on Pine Ridge Reservation as part of a story on poverty in America , but it has captured his passion for five years .
A quintessential example of the failures of the reservation system , he and we cannot turn away from what we see at Pine Ridge .
PLEASE watch the video , it is powerful and tells the story of Pine Ridge so well .
Transcript :
" We tried to run , but they shot us like we were buffalo . "
- Louise Weasel Bear , Survivor of the Wounded Knee Massacre
My name is Aaron Huey , I am a photographer .
I am here today to show you my photographs of the Lakota .
I ’m sure most of you have heard of the Lakota , or at least of the larger group of seven tribes known as the Sioux .
The Lakota were one of the many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner of war camps now known as " reservations . "
The Pine Ridge Reservation , the subject of today ’s slideshow , is 75 miles south east of the Black Hills in South Dakota and is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp # 334 , it is where the Lakota now live .
If any of you have ever heard of AIM – the American Indian movement - or Leonard Peltier , or Russell Means , or the Wounded Knee takeover , you know that Pine Ridge is ground zero for native issues
I have been asked to talk about my relationship with the Lakota .
That is a very difficult thing for me because , if you have n’t noticed from my skin color , I 'm white .
And that will always be a huge barrier on a Native Reservation .
You will see a lot of people in my photographs today , I 've become very close with them , they have welcomed me like family .
They called me uncle and brother and they welcomed me back many times over in my five years of visits .
But on Pine Ridge I will always be what is called Wasi'chu .
Wasi 'chu is a Lakota word that means " Non Indian " but another version of this word means " Takes the best part of the meat . "
And that is what I want to focus on today , " The one who takes the best part of the meat . "
It means Greedy .
So take a look around this auditorium today .
We are at a private school in the American west .
Sitting in Red velvet chairs .
Pockets full of money .
It is obvious looking at our lives , that we did indeed take the best part of the meat .
So lets look today at a set of photographs of a group of people who lost so we could gain .
And know when you see these people ’s faces that these are not just images of the Lakota , they stand for all indigenous people .
On this piece of paper is the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family .
The following is a timeline of treaties made , treaties broken , and massacres disguised as battles .
I will begin in 1824
What is now known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the WAR DEPARTMENT , setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with Native Americans .
1851
The first Treaty of Fort Laramie was made , clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota land .
According to the treaty , those lands are a sovereign nation .
If the boundaries of this treaty had held , and there is a legal basis that it should , then this map is what the US would look like .
Ten years later The Homestead Act , signed by President Lincoln , unleashed a flood of white settlers upon Indian lands .
1863
An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota ends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men , >> the largest mass execution in US History .
The execution was ordered by president Lincoln 2 days after he signed the emancipation proclamation .
1866
The beginning of the transcontinental railroad .
A new era .
We appropriated lands for trail and trains to shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation .
The treaties were out the window
In response 3 tribes lead by the Lakota Chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the US Army many times over .
I repeat - the Lakota defeated the US Army .
1868
The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakota ownership of the Sacred Black Hills .
The govt also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states
We promised that the Powder River Country would henceforth be closed to all whites .
The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux .
In fact , this is the only war in American history in which the government negotiated peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy .
1869
The transcontinental railroad was completed ; it began carrying , among other things , large numbers of hunters , who began wholesale killing of buffalo .
Eliminating the source of food , clothing , and shelter for the Sioux .
1871
The Indian Appropriations
Act makes all Indians wards of the federal government .
In addition The military issued orders forbidding western Indians from leaving reservations .
All western Indians at that point in time , were now Prisoners of War .
Also in 1871 we end the time of treaty making .
The problem with treaties is that they allow the tribes to exist as sovereign nations , and we cant have independent nations inside our own .
We had plans .
1874
General George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory , specifically the Black Hills .
the news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers into the Lakota Nation .
Custer recommends that congress find a way to end the treaties with the Lakota
1875
The Lakota War began over the violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty .
1876
On June 25th , on its way to attack a Lakota village , Custer ’s 7th Cavalry was crushed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn .
1877
The Great Lakota Warrior and chief named Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson .
He was later killed while in custody .
1877 is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaty .
A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as " Sell or Starve " : no signature , no food for your tribe .
Only ten percent of the adult male population signed .
The Fort Laramie Treaty called for 3 /4 of the tribe to sign away land .
That clause was ignored .
1887
The Dawes Act. Communal ownership of reservation lands ends .
Reservations are cut up into 160 - acre sections AND distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of .
Tribes lost millions of acres .
The American dream of individual land ownership was A very cleaver way to divide the reservation until nothing was left .
The move destroyed the reservations , making it easy to further subdivide and sell with each passing generation .
Most of the " surplus " land , and many of the plots within Reservation boundaries , are now in the hands of white ranchers .
The fat of the land once again goes to Washichu .
1890
A date I believe to be the most important in this slideshow .
This is the year of the wounded knee massacre .
On Dec 29 , U.S. troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek and massacred Chief Big Foot and 300 prisoners of war , using a new rapid fire weapon that fired exploding shells called a Hotchkiss gun .
For this so - called " battle , " twenty Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor were given to the 7th Calvary .
To this day , this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle .
More medals of honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than in any battle in World War I , World War II , Korea , Vietnam , Iraq , or Afghanistan .
The Wounded Knee Massacre is considered the end of the Indian Wars .
Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or the Sioux , I see it as a grave for all indigenous people of North America .
The Lakota holy man Black Elk said ,
" I did not know then how much was ended .
When I look back now from this high hill of my old age , I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young .
And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud , and was buried in the blizzard .
A people ’s dream died there .
It was a beautiful dream . "
With this event A new era in Native American history began .
Everything can be measured by Before Wounded Knee and After , because it was in this moment , with fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns overlooking that camp , that the US government openly declared its position on Native rights .
They were tired of treaties .
They were tired of sacred hills and ghost dances and all other the other inconveniences of the Sioux .
So they brought out their cannons .
You want to be an Indian now , they said .
Finger on the trigger .
1900
The U.S. Indian population reached its low point : less than 250,000 , compared to an estimated 8 million in 1492 .
Fast forward to
1980
The longest running court case in U.S. history , the Sioux Nation v. the United States , was ruled upon by the U.S. Supreme Court .
The court determined that when the Sioux were resettled into reservations and 7 million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders , the terms of the second Fort Laramie Treaty had been violated .
The Court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken , and that the initial offering price plus interest must be paid to the Sioux Nation .
As payment for the Black Hills , the court awarded $ 106 million to the Sioux Nation .
The Sioux refused the money with the rallying cry " THE BLACK HILLS ARE NOT FOR SALE "
2010
Statistics about the native population today , more than a century after the massacre at Wounded Knee , reveal the legacy of colonization , forced migration , and treaty violations .
Unemployment on the Pine Ridge Reservation fluctuates between 85 - 90 % , the housing office is unable to afford to build new structures , and existing structures are falling apart .
Many are homeless , and those with homes are packed into rotting buildings with up to five families .
Thirty - nine percent of the homes on the Pine Ridge Reservation have no electricity .
At least 60 % of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold .
More than 80 % of the population lives below the federal poverty line .
The tuberculosis rate on the Pine Ridge Reservation is approximately eight times higher than the U.S. national average .
The infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about 3 times higher than the U.S. national average .
Cervical cancer is five times higher than the U.S. national average .
The school drop out rate is over 70 % .
Teacher turnover is eight times that of the U.S. national average .
Frequently , grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents , due alcoholism , domestic violence , and general apathy , cannot raise them .
50 percent of the population over 40 suffers from diabetes
The life expectancy for men is , between 46 and 48 years old , roughly the same as Afghanistan and Somalia .
THE LAST CHAPTER IN ANY SUCCESSFUL GENOCIDE IS THE ONE IN WHICH THE OPPRESSOR REMOVES HIS HANDS AND SAYS " OH NO , LOOK WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO THEMSELVES , THEY ARE KILLING THEMSELVES " WHILE WE WATCH THEM DIE .
THIS IS HOW WE CAME TO OWN THESE UNITED STATES .
THIS IS THE LEGACY OF MANIFEST DESTINY .
PRISONERS ARE STILL BORN INTO PRISONER OF WAR CAMPS , EVEN IF THE GUARDS ARE LONG GONE .
THESE ARE THE BONES LEFT BEHIND AFTER THE BEST MEAT HAS BEEN TAKEN .
A long time ago a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me .
By WASI ’CHU eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the Hills .
Those events lead to a domino effect that has yet to end .
As removed as we , the dominant society , may feel from the responsibility of a massacre in 1890 , or a series of broken treaties 150 years ago , I still have to ask you the question - how should we feel about the statistics of today ?
What is the connection between these images of suffering and the history I just read to you ?
How much of this history do you need to own ?
Is any of this your responsibility today ?
I have been told " there must be something we can do . "
There must be a call to action .
For so long I have been content to stand on the sidelines as a witness , JUST TAKING PHOTOS , because the " solutions " seemed to be buried too far in the past , needing nothing short of a time machine to access them .
The suffering of Indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to " fix . "
It is not something everyone can get behind in the way they can get behind helping Haiti or ending AIDS or fighting a famine .
The " fix " may be much more painful for the dominant society than say a $ 50 donation , or a church trip to paint some graffiti covered houses , or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they do n’t want anymore .
So where does that leave us ?
Shrugging our shoulders in the dark ?
The United States continues , on a daily basis to violate the terms of the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota .
The call to action I offer today , My TED wish , is this :
Honor the treaties .
GIVE BACK THE BLACK HILLS
Its not your business what they do with them .
Is n't it amazing how ignorant the American People are when it comes to the Constitution ?
The Esteemed Readers of this blog realiz ...
A massive extinction like the one that claimed the dinosaurs has hit the Earth like clockwork every 27 million years , a new fossil analysis confirms .
But the study claims to rule out one controversial explanation : a dark stellar companion called Nemesis that sends a regular rain of deadly comets toward Earth .
" The main astronomical ideas you can come up with that could cause something like this just do n't work , " said physicist Adrian Melott of the University of Kansas , a co-author of the new study .
Nemesis was first suggested in 1984 as a way to explain an alarmingly regular series of extinctions in the marine fossil record , which was discovered by paleontologists David Raup and Jack Sepkoski .
In light of the suggestion in 1980 that the dinosaurs were killed by a catastrophic impact , an invisible cosmic sniper lobbing comets at the inner solar system seemed like a plausible culprit .
Two independent groups of astronomers suggested that a dim brown dwarf or red dwarf star lying between one and two light - years from the sun could throw a shower of ice and rock from the Oort Cloud every 26 million or 27 million years to wreak havoc on Earth .
Because the orbit of this " death star " would be tweaked by interactions with other stars and the Milky Way , the time between one impact and the next should vary by 15 to 30 percent .
But now , Melott and co-author Richard Bambach of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington , D.C. , say that 's not actually what happens .
The extinctions come almost exactly every 27 million years , they say , to a confidence interval of 99 percent .
" It 's really too good , it 's too sharp and fixed , " Melott said .
" It 's like a clock . "
Melott and Bambach compared two huge data sets going back 500 million years , twice as far as the 1984 study looked .
One dataset , the Sepkoski database , is a continuation of the original study .
The other , the Paleobiology Database , was compiled between 2000 and 2008 .
Both sets include many fossils that have been found and cataloged since 1984 .
The researchers searched mathematically for patterns that were common to both datasets , and found that both showed an excess of organisms disappearing every 27 million years , too regularly to be caused by a shiftable star .
" It was a slam dunk on finding exactly what you would expect to find if they [ Raup and Sepkoski ] were right , which surprised me , " Melott said .
" We have strong confirmation of this periodicity , it 's exactly the same one that those guys found in ' 84 , and we have no clue what 's causing it . "
Other astronomers think Nemesis is still out there , however .
Richard A. Muller of the University of California at Berkeley , one of the authors of the 1984 paper proposing the dark star and the author of a popular book called Nemesis : The Death Star , thinks Melott is " coming to too strong a conclusion . "
" I would agree with most of what he says , but I think he is overestimating the accuracy of the geologic timescale , " he said .
The geological record gives only an approximate sense of when major extinctions happened .
" You get them in the right order , but it 's really difficult to get an actual date , " he said .
In light of that uncertainty , " I would say the Nemesis hypothesis is still alive . "
There is a way to check .
Several ongoing astronomical survey telescopes , including NASA 's Wide - Field Infrared Survey Explorer , the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Pan - STARRS survey , are scanning the sky with enough sensitivity to find Nemesis if it exists .
If they do n't find the dark star , then it probably is n't there .
" That 's the ultimate test , " Muller said .

Varios estudios aseguran que la homosexualidad " no se pega " ni afecta la salud emocional de los chicos ; los hijos de estas parejas confirman que están orgullosos de sus papás o mamás
[ email protected ]
Edmar tiene 20 años , estudia ingeniería en sistemas computacionales y tiene claro que es heterosexual ; Ana Grabriel , de 14 , ha rechazado propuestas de noviazgo con compañeras de la secundaria porque le atraen los chicos ; Gala , de cinco , desarrolla con plenitud sus capacidades cognoscitivas y Anxélica , de ocho , es una de las alumnas con mejores calificaciones en su escuela .
Todos son hijos de familias diversas de la comunidad de Lesbianas , Gays , Bisexuales y Transgéneros ( LGBT ) , donde a decir de especialistas , antes que desarrollar trastornos de personalidad como pudiera pasar con cualquier otro niño inmerso en una familia con padres heterosexuales , han aprendido a relacionarse con base en el amor , el respeto , el derecho , la tolerancia y la diversidad .
“ No sólo hay familias de papá , mamá , hijos , hay con dos mamás , con una sola y también con dos papás ” , es la respuesta que Gala cuando tenía tres años y medio a una niña en el parque , cuando ésta le dijo que era imposible que tuviera dos mamás : Ema Villanueva y Janice Alva , una de las cuatro familias alternativas entrevistadas por KIOSCO que hoy , más allá de la legislación , son una realidad .
El cálculo no es exacto .
Siempre que se pretende dar una aproximación del número de hijos de parejas homoparentales , se cita la investigación para el grado de Maestría en la UAM de Sara Espinosa , titulada “ Familias de elección : hogares conformados por madres lesbianas del año 2005 ” , donde considera que no sería exagerado hablar de un millón de hijos de homosexuales .
El análisis refiere que unos 10 millones de mexicanos son gays , lesbianas o bisexuales y que de éstos , al menos 10 % tienen hijos .
Los estudios científicos
El debate en torno a las implicaciones que los niños pudieran tener por ser criados por padres homosexuales se avivó luego de que la líder del PAN en el DF , Mariana Gómez del Campo , asegurara que con la reciente legislación aprobada , que permitirá el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo y la adopción de niños por estas parejas , se expone a los menores a padecer trastornos de personalidad y discriminación .
Un meta - análisis científico publicado por la Asociación Psicológica Americana ( APA ) titulado “ Lesbian and Gay Parenting ” , en el que se analizan más de 100 artículos de investigación al respecto realizados en Europa y EU , muestra que tanto los hijos e hijas biológicas como adoptados por homosexuales , no tienen problemas psicológicos o sociales que puedan atribuirse a la orientación sexual de sus padres y madres .
“ No hay diferencias significativas ni en la moral , ni en las costumbres con los hijos e hijas de padres heterosexuales .
Se confirmó una vez más que la homosexualidad no se pega ” , dice el sexólogo David Barrios , director de Caleidoscopía , quien cita parte de las conclusiones de la investigación de la APA : “ Ni un solo estudio ha encontrado que los hijos de hombres y mujeres homosexuales tengan alguna desventaja si se les compara con hijos de parejas heterosexuales .
La evidencia indica que el ambiente proporcionado en los hogares homosexuales es igual de eficaz que el de parejas heterosexuales al apoyar y permitir el desarrollo psicosocial de los menores ” .
En el ámbito científico también existen voces que aseguran que esos niños , al estar en una sociedad predominantemente heterosexual , podrían sufrir discriminación y una crisis de identidad .
La neuropsicóloga Guillermina González y el antropólogo José Eduardo Tappan coinciden en que para enfrentar esta realidad , los niños tendrán que estar acompañados por psicólogos .
Una vida normal
El día a día supera a los planteamientos conservadores .
Edmar se anima a hablar sin recato de los valores y educación que ha recibido por parte de su madre , Imelda Camargo , quien hace seis meses se separó de su pareja , Hyssel , tras cinco años .
“ Yo supe que mi mamá era lesbiana a mis 10 años , nunca he ido a terapias para atender la falta de una figura paterna .
Sé de tolerancia y diversidad , estoy abierto a posibilidades .
También siento que los hijos de homosexuales podemos definir con mayor libertad y claridad nuestras preferencias sexuales a comparación de los hetero , pues ya conocemos desde dentro esta elección ” , dice Edmar .
Imelda es parte del movimiento LGBT y de esa generación de lesbianas que buscaron una relación heterosexual para embarazarse y tener familia .
A sus 30 años , cuando se lo había propuesto , tuvo a Edmar , quien , dice , extraña a Hyssel .
A Gala ya le tocó nacer en una época donde la opción de ser madre por inseminación artificial era posible .
Sus mamás Ema ( por biología ) y Janice ( por convicción ) investigaron lo que representaba educar a un bebe en este entorno .
“ Somos madres de tiempo completo , damos prioridad a nuestra hija y cuando se puede nos dedicamos al trabajo ” , dice Ema .
“ Los hijos en las parejas homosexuales son muy deseados , por lo que la relación con ellos se basa en el amor y no en una imposición social ” , dice Janice .
Las mamás de Gala reconocen que tienen cierta preocupación por el entorno de discriminación en el ámbito escolar .
Pronto tendrán que enfrentar este entorno como siempre lo hacen : sin esconder su situación .
Ema y Janice , quienes fundaron el Círculo de Familias Diversas , aseguran que la niña está respaldada psicológicamente para enfrentar un mundo donde todavía su familia es minoría .
“ Gala ha explicado varias veces a gente en la calle la diversidad de familias que hay .
Es una niña sana , plena , segura .
Nunca le ha faltado la figura masculina porque convive con sus tíos , primos y amigos .
No le ense ñamos la existencia de roles específicos para las mujeres y los hombres ” , explica Ema .
En entorno trans
En tanto , Anxélica le ayuda a su padre que es travesti llamada Anxélica Risco , a elegir la ropa de mujer que usará .
“ Papá te ves guapísimo ” , ha llegado a expresar Anxélica a su progenitor cuando esta caracterizado de mujer .
La niña entiende que a su papá le gusta vestirse de mujer y defiende sus gustos ante sus compañeras de escuela .
“ Una vez mi papá fue a recogerme a la escuela y sólo llevaba las uñas pintadas de negro .
Alguien me preguntó que por qué lo hacía y sólo le regresé una pregunta : ¿tiene algo de malo que haga eso ? ” .
Anxélica ( padre ) , fundador de Inteligencia Transgenérica y del grupo de Rock Neurotika , forma con su pareja Shantall y sus hijos Anxélica y Jassón una familia trans , en la que intenta inculcar el valor de la libertad .
Dice abiertamente delante de su hija : “ Ellos decidirán su preferencia sexual , si deciden ser bisexuales se divertirán 50 % más ” .
Opiniones encontradas Verónica Rodríguez Correa es madre lesbiana de Ana Gabriel y Germán .
La niña respeta la decisión de su madre y dice que puede hacer de su vida lo que desee y reconoce que lo que más le gusta de ella es la libertad que le da de actuar .
Hace unos meses , su pareja Miriam , con quien vivía desde 2005 , se fue de la casa .
Ella tenía dos hijos , que junto con los de Verónica formaban una familia .
Ana Gabriel , al igual que su madre , duda que dos hombres homosexuales puedan educar de la misma forma que las madres lesbianas .
“ Puede haber casos hasta de pederastia ” , dice Verónica .
“ Las diferencias que pudieran existir entre las madres lesbianas o padres gays tienen que ver más con los roles genéricos que en nuestra cultura se consideran propios de la masculinidad ” , dice .
“ La existencia de figuras significativas de ambos géneros alrededor de estas familias brinda a los pequeños ejemplos prácticos de los modelajes sociales comunes en nuestra cultura .
Ello refuta la falsa idea de que en la pareja homosexual no existe el referente de identificación acerca de los dos géneros que caracterizan a toda cultura ” .
La homofobia Mientras , la discriminación , que es la que causa el daño a los menores , avanza a la par de la lucha por derechos como el de la adopción .
Hoy la comunidad LGBT identifica que la homofobia ha adoptado características modernas “ simbólicas y sutiles ” , no es agresiva , pero tiene un mismo fin .
“ Se define como homofobia aversiva la que suaviza los signos de discriminación hacia homosexuales , tolera ciertos derechos sociales no reconocidos anteriormente , pero no acepta la igualdad y normalización de la vida de las personas LGTB .
Señala que la mayoría de los heterosexuales apoyan la protección de los derechos de gays y lesbianas pero manifiestan mayor oposición a su capacidad como padres , aspecto que denominamos homoparentofobia ” .
La homoparentofobia , definida por los especialistas de origen español María Dolores Frías Navarro , Juan Pascual Llobell y Héctor Monterde Bort , implica el miedo a que un niño sea educado por pareja del mismo sexo , al resaltar la aparición de problemas psicológicos , sociales y de género .
David Barrios asegura que la variable psicológica más importante en la crianza y vida familiar de hijos e hijas , no es la orientación sexual de quienes fungen como padres ( biológicos o adoptivos ) , sino el amor , dedicación y responsabilidad con los que son atendidos y cuidados .
“ Hay personas heterosexuales que son pésimos padres o madres ” , dice .
Para Paulina Millán , del Instituto Mexicano de Sexología ( Imesex ) y la socióloga Amparo Ruiz del Castillo , la solución no está en el impedimento de adoptar o tener hijos , sino en terminar con la discriminación .
“ Ya hay parejas de hombres y mujeres que crían niños , con la ley lo único que sucederá es regularizar este tipo de uniones y otorgar protección jurídica a esas familias ” , dice .
El debate sigue y Gala no entiende por qué hay gente que se opone a que sea feliz con sus mamás .

TRENTON — New Jersey is getting closer to going into the medical marijuana business .
A key state senator says he now supports the idea of having the state 's supply of medical marijuana initially grown by Rutgers University .
Democrat Nicholas Scutari says he is now working with the administration of Gov. Chris Christie to modify a law to put the novel system in place .
In January , lawmakers approved making New Jersey the 14th state to allow medical marijuana .
But the program has not been implemented .
Scutari initially had reservations about the administration 's plan to have Rutgers grow the medicinal pot and the state 's teaching hospitals distribute it to qualified patients .

The NAACP adopted a resolution Tuesday condemning " racist elements " in the Tea Party movement and calling on the movement 's leaders to repudiate bigotry , despite claims from Tea Partiers that the measure is just a political ploy .
The nation 's leading civil rights group took up the language at its annual convention in Kansas City , Mo .
The resolution initially said the NAACP would " repudiate the racism of the Tea Parties " and stand against the movement 's attempt to " push our country back to the pre-civil rights era , " though the wording was amended to downplay criticism of all Tea Partiers while asking them to repudiate bigots in their own ranks .
" We take no issue with the Tea Party movement .
We believe in freedom of assembly and people raising their voices in a democracy , " the NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said in a written statement announcing the unanimous vote .
" What we take issue with is the Tea Party 's continued tolerance for bigotry and bigoted statements .
" The time has come for them to accept the responsibility that comes with influence and make clear there is no place for racism and anti-Semitism , homophobia and other forms of bigotry in their movement . "
NAACP leaders have referenced an incident in March when Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers on Capitol Hill ahead of a health care vote .
But Tea Party members have challenged claims that their activists accosted black lawmakers in March and no visual evidence has been produced depicting a racist attack .
Dallas Tea Party founder Phillip Dennis said " there was no proof " of racist behavior at the event and that the movement welcomes minority members .
" We do n't care about the pigment of one 's skin , " he said .
Dennis accused the NAACP of playing the " race card " and called the organization " irrelevant . "
The nearby St. Louis Tea Party had an all - hands - on - deck response to the NAACP 's plan .
The group has drafted a resolution of its own condemning the civil rights group for reducing itself to a " bigoted " and " partisan attack dog organization . "
Debate was mostly closed to the public , but the final version " calls on the tea party and all people of good will to repudiate the racist element and activities within the tea party , " said Hilary Shelton , director of the NAACP 's Washington bureau .
The final wording wo n't be released until the NAACP 's national board of directors approves the resolution during its meeting in October .
But the original called for the NAACP to " educate its membership and the community that this movement is not just about higher taxes and limited government . "
It said something could evolve " and become more dangerous for that small percentage of people that really think our country has been taken away from them . "
In a matter of hours , the St. Louis group fired off to the NAACP the statement demanding the organization withdraw its " bigoted , false and inflammatory " resolution .
The missive accused the NAACP of resorting to political tactics and urged the IRS to reconsider whether it can continue to qualify for tax - exempt status .
Tea Party organizers routinely defend themselves against charges of racism , disavowing racially charged signs that appear in their protest crowds and provide fodder for Tea Party critics .
The NAACP resolution , first reported by the Kansas City Star , was expected to make reference to the March incident on Capitol Hill .
St. Louis Tea Party organizer Bill Hennessy wrote on the group 's website Tuesday that the Tea Party stands for smaller government and fiscal responsibility , and accused the NAACP of abandoning black America .
" When you look at the crime and poverty and family breakdown of the African - American community ... you see a half - century of failure by the NAACP , " he wrote .
" None of those persistent problems was caused by the Tea Party movement , yet the principles of the Tea Party are exactly what 's needed to wind down the multigenerational destruction in the African - American community .
" The NAACP was once a vital weapon in the war against segregation and oppression .
All that 's left is a bigoted and malicious shell that does far more harm than good for people who need a break , " he wrote .
Fellow St. Louis Tea Party organizer Dana Loesch accused the NAACP of morphing into a political organization .
" They no longer prioritize civil rights , " she told Fox News .

We will celebrate properly when the National Identity Register data is securely destroyed .
However , there are several things of interest to Spy Blog readers , which this Conservative / Liberal democrat coalition government has not yet done as they should have .
By convention , since 1966 , each Prime Minister has re-affirmed the Wilson Doctrine , regarding the supposed ban on telephone and other interception of communications of Members of Parliament , especially with their constituents .
Sometimes they have hinted at slight changes in policy , in their short , bland , detail avoiding statements , which need heavy analysis by Downing Street kremlinologists .
Prime Minister David Cameron has not yet made any such statement .
If he does not want to appear just like his hated predecessor , then he will announce next week , a wider application of the Wilson Doctrine , as we wrote back in 2008 :
The Wilson Doctrine should not be abolished , it should be clarified and extended
The Wilson Doctrine should be extended to cover not just Members of the House of Commons , and the Peers of the House of Lords , but also to the other equally democratically elected Parliaments and Assemblies , to the Scottish Parliament , the Northern Ireland Assembly , the Welsh Assembly , to the UK Members of the European Parliament , and probably to all foreign Members of the European Parliament as well .
In principle , the Constituency Communications of elected Local Authority Councillors should also be protected by the Wilson Doctrine .
The Wilson Doctrine is not about rights and privileges of elected politicians , it is about protecting the privacy of their communications with their constituents , who may very well be complaining or whistleblowing about the very Government departments and agencies and other tentacles of the State , who try to snoop on such communications .
Back in 1966 , when the then Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced his policy , there were no direct dial international phone calls , let alone fax machines , mobile phones or internet email or WiFi communications etc .
See " Wilson Doctrine " - Prime Minister Harold Wilson answers Oral Questions in the House of Commons 17th November 1966 - transcript
The Wilson Doctrine should be extended to cover not just the interception of communications i..e. listening to phone calls or reading emails etc. , but to the collection or analysis of Communications Traffic Data - who called or emailed who , when and where from etc .
It should also apply to all of the postal mail , public internet connections , private computer networks , email accounts , computers , fax machines and mobile phones etc. used by the elected representative or his office staff , provided that these are used for communications to and from the elected representatives constituents .
Given the scandal over the electronic bugging of an MP and his constituent in prison , who has not been charged with any crime in the UK , the Wilson Doctrine should also be made to cover face to face meetings with constituents .
It should ban directed and intrusive surveillance of such face to face meetings and it should also ban the use of Confidential Human Intelligence Source informers to infiltrate an MP or other elected representatives offices .
Obviously where there are actual national security or serious crime investigations in progress , the Wilson Doctrine allows these to proceed , but this should be strictly limited and should require a formal warrant , not any kind of self authorisation by the investigating agency .
There must be no repeat of the appalling mess which the former Speaker of the House of Commons created over the police raid without a warrant of MPs offices .
The Wilson Doctrine should be made to apply not just to the three main UK intelligence agencies GCHQ , MI5 and SIS / MI6 , but to any Police or Military units with the legal or technical capability e.g.
Military Special Forces units , Association of Chief Police Officers units like NETCU and to any " quid pro quo " arrangements with Foreign Governments or agencies and also to any private sector companies or other non--governmental organisations as well .
If you cannot trust that your written or electronic communications or face to face meetings with your MP etc. is not being snooped on by state bureaucrats or private sector snoopers , then there is no elected democracy in the UK any more .
If the Government really means to restore public trust in the tainted institution of Parliament , then they should re-affirm and extend the Wilson Doctrine , something which will not even cost them any public money to do .
It is a measure of how inept the hated Labour party is in Opposition , that they have not bothered to table any Parliamentary Questions about the Wilson Doctrine , not even simply in order to put the current Government under political pressure , like a proper Opposition should .
Is it because the few Labour MPs who cared about democratic accountability of the powerful organs of the state , have retired or have not been re-elected , leaving behind only the creepy control freaks and apparatchiks ?
The Liberal Democrat and Conservative MPs who used to care about these issues are now on the Government side , but they should not let that stop them from raising Questions fundamental issues of liberty and democracy either .

VUK JEREMIC , Serbia 's foreign minister , looked ashen .
He knew what was coming .
Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia did not violate general international law , said Hisashi Owada , the president of the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) in The Hague , in a non-binding advisory opinion .
Ten judges voted in favour of this ruling , with four against .
Serbia 's strategy of attempting to outmanoeuvre its former secessionist province through the international court lay in ruins .
In Pristina , Kosovo 's capital , cars began hooting in celebration .
Cheers erupted from bars and cafes , where people had gathered to watch the judge deliver the court 's opinion .
Shkelzen Maliqi , a well - known intellectual and commentator , summed up what most Kosovars were thinking : " Perfect .
Who would have expected such a clear answer ? "
In Belgrade there seemed no room for doubt either .
" It was a classic knockout , " said Braca Grubacic , an analyst .
" I do n't know how the government can get out of this . "
To date 69 countries have recognised Kosovo 's independence , including the US and 22 of the 27 EU member states .
But Russia , China , Brazil , India and many other important countries have refused to follow suit .
Whether a flood of new recognitions will follow today 's ruling remains to be seen , but would not be surprising .
It is , however , unlikely that China , with its eyes on Taiwan and Tibet , Russia , with its problems in Chechnya , and other countries in the world with secessionist movements will recognise Kosovo any time soon .
Of Kosovo's 2 m people , 90 % are ethnic Albanians who would rather fight than see a return of Serbian rule .
In 1998 a guerrilla movement , the Kosovo Liberation Army , took up arms to fight the Serbs .
In 1999 NATO launched a 78 - day bombing campaign which saw the expulsion of Serbian forces from all of Kosovo and Serbian rule from all but Serb areas .
From then until February 2008 Kosovo came under UN administration .
Serbia contends that Kosovo , as a Serbian province rather than a republic of the former Yugoslavia , did not have the right to self - determination .
On the eve of the court 's ruling Mr Jeremic , the architect of the strategy of taking the question to the ICJ , said that if the court came out in favour of Kosovo , " no border in the world in the world would ever be secure " .
The court had been widely expected to give an ambiguous answer .
The fact that the opinion is heavily in Kosovo 's favour leaves open the question of what Serbia will do now .
It had planned to go to the General Assembly of the UN to demand new talks .
Now that plan appears in jeopardy , if not doomed .
The EU , however , has been planning talks between Kosovo and Serbia on technical matters .
Serbia 's government will be rocked by this result .
The Serbian Orthodox Church has called for bells to be rung out this afternoon and a protest rally has been called by Serbs in the divided northern Kosovo city of Mitrovica .
In the last few weeks there have been three violent incidents there , resulting in one death .
Mitrovica 's Serbs have been preparing an armed response in case jubilant Albanians try to cross the river Ibar , which divides the city .
In the wake of the opinion helicopters from the NATO - led peacekeeping force in Kosovo have been circling above the city .
In the Serbian Orthodox monastery of Visoki Decani in western Kosovo , Father Sava warns that he fears for the church 's security .
In the last few weeks he says Albanian teenagers have thrown stones at the monastery and hurled insults at the monks in a way reminiscent of the run-up to anti-Serbian riots in 2004 .
" We are in serious danger because we are seen as a symbol of Serbia , even though we are not acting politically , " he says .
The monastery lies in the heartland of support for Ramush Haradinaj , Kosovo 's former prime minister and leader of the main opposition party .
Mr Haradinaj was acquitted of war crimes by the UN's war crimes tribunal in 2008 , but yesterday was rearrested because the appeals chamber found his trial to have been marred by witness intimidation .
The arrest leaves the way clear for Hashim Thaci , the prime minister , to move at a time of his own convenience towards elections , which he is likely to win now that the opposition has been effectively decapitated .
Serbia 's president , Boris Tadic , is due to address the nation .
Mr Jeremic has declared that the struggle will continue .
Kosovo 's president , Fatmir Sejdiu , jubilantly declared : " God bless Kosovo ! "
But after the party Kosovo will remain one of the poorest parts of Europe , a country that does not control all of its territory and one that is riddled with corruption .
Until now , Kosovo 's leaders have been able to blame Serbian intransigence for their failure to implement reforms and improve living standards .
That excuse will now lose some of its potency , especially if more countries recognise the state .
Serbia too faces problems .
Its EU accession process has slowed of late .
As Mr Grubacic points out , Mr Tadic had promised Serbs both the EU and Kosovo .
Now neither looks likely .
Yet while Serbia 's EU bid may be stymied for now , it is certainly not dead .
Dreams of Kosovo are another story .
Gallagher Is a Paranoid , Right - Wing , Watermelon - Smashing Maniac The Decline and Fall of a Comedy Legend
Keat Teoh
" You have your hat backward , " Gallagher sneers at a twentysomething man in the front row .
" Are you a homosexual ?
Because it seems you have a problem figuring out the front from the back . "
Big laugh .
" I see people every day I can't figger out what sex they are , " he continues .
Even bigger laugh .
The old man—1980s fixture , incessant smasher of fruit , and " comedy legend , " according to the marquee outside — is onstage in front of a sold - out Admiral Theatre in Bremerton , Washington .
An hour earlier , my friend and I had disembarked the packed rush - hour ferry in downtown Bremerton and wandered uphill through oddly deserted streets ( our hundreds of fellow passengers seemed to have vaporized when they reached land ) until we found the Admiral .
Gallagher stood on the sidewalk .
He was small and old — his back bent a bit , his trademark dark curls faded to a dank grayish - ­blond .
He scuttled around the corner and through a side door .
It 's cocktail seating inside the Admiral — small tables of four — and we are placed at # B32 with a largish lady in pink and her mustachioed gentleman friend .
" Oh , you 're sitting with my daughter ! " the elderly usher crows .
" This is my daughter ! "
We are n't sure how to respond , so we say , " Cool ! "
Things are immediately awkward .
They would only get worse .
My memories of watching Gallagher during my 1980s childhood ( Comedy Central was my third parent ) were pretty much apolitical — silly props , innocuous puns , and , of course , all the smashing , smashing , smashing .
Tonight , we 're expecting much of the same , only older , sadder .
We are smug and a little bored .
" Gallagher 's gotta be , like , 90 now , right ? " I joke .
" Because he was , you know ... " " Bald ? " my friend offers .
" In the ' 70s ? " " Right . "
The stage is swathed in thousands of yards of black plastic sheeting .
Spray - painted on the back wall is a banner ( created , if the internet is any indication , by Gallagher himself before each show ) that says : " G- [watermelon ] - L-L-[ space ] -[ watermelon ] -R-R-R . "
It is ... sad .
We were right about that much .
Then Gallagher gets going .
And fuck .
Bremerton is a military town and a conservative one :
It 's more than just a slide into obscurity that delivered Gallagher to the Admiral rather than , say , the Moore in Seattle .
You see , Gallagher is — how best to put this ?— a paranoid , delusional , right - wing religious maniac .
I HAD NO IDEA .
" Hey , President Obama , " he spits out the name like a mouthful of burning hair .
" You ain't black .
I do n't care what you say — you 're a latte .
You 're half whole - milk .
It could be goat milk — you could be a terrorist ! "
I am too busy losing my mind to catch the next joke , which is about Ted Kennedy 's brain cancer .
Aaaaand we 're off .
Gallagher is upset about a lot of things .
Young people with their sagging pants ( in faintly coded racist terms , he explains that this is why the jails are overcrowded — because " their " baggy pants make it too hard for " them " to run from the cops ) .
Tattoos : " That ink goes through to your soul — if you read your Bible , your body is a sacred temple , YOU DIPSHIT . "
People naming their girl - children Sam and Toni instead of acceptable names like Evelyn and Betty : " Just give her some little lesbian tendencies ! "
Guantánamo Bay : " We were n't even allowed to torture all the way .
We had to half - torture — that 's nothin ' compared to what Saddam and his two sons OOFAY and GOOFAY did . "
Lesbians : " There 's two types — the ugly ones and the pretty ones . "
( Um , like all people ? )
Obama again : " If Obama was really black , he'd act like a black guy and get a white wife . "
Michael Vick : " Poor Michael Vick . "
Women 's lib : " These women told you they wanna be equal — they DON'T . "
Trans people : " People like Cher 's daughter — figure that out .
She wants a penis , but she has a big belly .
If you can't see your dick , you do n't get one . "
The Rice Krispies elves : " All three of those guys are gay .
Look at 'em ! "
The Mexicans : " Look around — see any Mexicans ?
Nope .
They 'll be here later for the cleanup . "
The French : " They ruin our language with their faggy words . "
Above all , everything is gay , gay , gay to Gallagher .
He leans into it with the borderline - ­nonsensical , icked - out , ignorant glee of a boy — or the protest - too - much vigor of a GOP senator .
Gallagher delivers your Bible verse for the day : " Without God , we are nothing but dust .
What is butt dust ?
Is that what you get if your homosexual is n't properly lubricated ? "
He relates a story about spilling mouthwash onto his crotch during a show : " Lucky for me , there was no homosexuals in the area — ' cause my balls was minty fresh . "
At other points during the show , Gallagher says , " Men and women ca n't live in the same house " and " There 's no way men and women can have a relationship . "
He says he can't remember why he used to feel pleasure in looking at a woman .
And , " There 's only one kind of homosexual guy , and that 's the pretty ones — why do homosexual men have to be so good - looking ? "
Gallagher .
Listen .
Is there something you want to share with us ?
Gallagher commands the stage with the weary , sure hand of a touring comic closing out his third decade on the road .
He knows what he 's doing , and even I 'm not a big enough dick to dispute the " comedy legend " designation on the sign outside .
The people of Bremerton eat it up , and despite the discomfort of sitting in a room full of rabid , frothing conservative dickwads ( especially when the " comedy " veers creepily close to white - power rhetoric : " We 're descended from an Anglo - Saxon Viking tradition ! " ) , it 's a relief to have them there .
Gallagher needs them , and I need to not witness the complete mental breakdown of Gallagher .
" This is why I 'm not on TV , " he keeps repeating .
" I am powerful .
They can tell .
I 'm an American and I 'm gonna speak my mind . "
He tells the truth , the truth , the truth , the truth , and everyone else is afraid .
The TV talk - show hosts are afraid , the network executives are afraid , the American people are afraid .
It 's our fault that he's not a superstar — not his — and he needs us to know it .
We owe him .
" Dave Letterman ai n't comin ' here .
Robin Williams ai n't comin ' out here .
You gotta say , you know , Gallagher came here , and he did two hours . "
In a section entitled " Additional Facts , " the program describes , with heartbreaking false bravado , a 2008 interview that Gallagher seems to regard as his big comeback : " The Howard Stern Show .
The interview lasted at least 1 hour and the callbacks were amazing .
It was a chance for everyone to see and hear Gallagher in a new light . "
I could n't track down an audio file of the Stern interview , but the show 's website maintains detailed recaps of each episode :
Howard welcomed watermelon smashing comedian Gallagher to the studio and was surprised that he was wearing a suit ...
Gallagher then railed against the late night hosts ; Jay Leno is impersonal , Conan is n't funny , and Letterman used his watermelon - ­dropping bit .
Gallagher said , " I 'm an authority on comedy .
I was a comedian in another life , " and listed some of his lesser - known credits , like random parody songs ...
Gallagher then continued to list his crazy ideas ; fart ring tones , a face - paint - focused environmental presentation for Al Gore , and something about photons and electrons .
Ugh .
Devastating .
It sounds just like the Gallagher show I watched — less a triumphant comeback and more the perversely fascinating but ultimately insignificant ramblings of a desperate has - been .
At last , after two hours of his tedious , hacky , right - wing manifesto , Gallagher gets to the part his ( willing ) hostages have been waiting for .
It 's time to smash some shit .
There are the watermelons , there is some cottage cheese ( " It 's got the curds that blow up , just like on the news ! " ) , there is sauerkraut and syrup and honey .
Then Gallagher gets a tin pie plate .
He opens a giant can of fruit cocktail and pours it in .
He opens a can of some Asian vegetable — water chestnuts , maybe — and pours that in , too .
" This is the China people and queers !!! " he screams and takes his sledgehammer to the thing with a fury that is no fun at all .
Wet chunks of China people and queers fly everywhere .
The hateful , bitter old man laughs .
I cannot believe Bill Hicks is dead and this motherfucker is still touring .
On our way out the door , my friend says to me , " Hey — do you want to go beat up some queers ?
I heard they 're really faggy . "
We laugh .
But it is n't really funny .

The madness in AZ provides ample warning , but is anyone paying attention ?...
Ernest A. Canning Byon 7/22/2010 , 3:05 pm PT
Guest editorial by Ernest A. Canning
The radical - right agenda , hidden from so many of the uninformed , working class useful idiots ( aka post - 2008 " Tea Party " followers ) was aptly described by Chalmers Johnson on the cover of Naomi Klein 's The Shock Doctrine as " a conspiracy to privatize war and disaster and grab public property for the rich few ...[ as part of ] our headlong flight back to feudalism ... "
In Meg Whitman , Wall Street , ' Billionaire Sociopaths ' and the Media ' Substance Deficit ' , we cited a Pew Research Center study on how the campaign by America 's political elites to ravage the middle class has , for " wide layers of the population , " destroyed " faith in the US government to secure their most basic social needs . "
As we observed at the time :
What has become painfully obvious is that many within these " wide layers of the population " simply do not realize that the source of the middle class demise lies not in government per se but in the carefully thought out , decades - long effort of the hard - right to " starve the beast " by massive tax cuts for those who already have too much in order to , in the words of Grover Norquist , reduce government to the point it could be " drown in a bathtub " and in order to privatize the commons so that the privileged few can be enriched beyond the wildest imagination of ordinary citizens .
An American Political Science Association study , cited by Bill Moyers in Moyers on America ( 2004 ) referred to a " radical political elite who have ... inequality as its mission and has organized ' a fanatical drive to dismantle the political institutions , the legal and statutory cannons , and the intellectual and cultural framework that have shaped public responsibility from social harms arising from the excesses of private powers . ' "
Into this mix comes " Tea Party in Sonora " : Ken Silverstein of Harper ’s Says Arizona is Laboratory for Radical GOP Policies , a powerful , must - see segment of Democracy Now ( video below ) which exposes the bleak future , indeed the madness , in store for all of us if we permit the radical right to assert the same control at the national level that they have already secured in Arizona .
An eerily prescient 1944 New York Times op - ed written by Franklin D. Roosevelt 's then - Vice President may have best described the ultimate goal of the hard - right agenda of those who now drive the so - called " Tea Party " in 2010 ...
Fascism
In viewing the video and in analyzing the propaganda utilized by the billionaire - funded hard - right to divert the attention of the 21st Century " know nothing " from the global class war to wedge issues , like immigration , consider the words of former Vice President Henry Wallace , which appeared in his April 9 , 1944 New York Times op - ed :
The American fascist would prefer not to use violence .
His method is to poison the channels of information .
With a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money and more power .
They claim to be superpatriots , but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution .
They demand free enterprise but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest .
Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that , using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously , they may keep the common man in eternal subjugation .
The endpoint of their deceit is the tyranny of a corporate controlled economy .
Feudalism
While there may never be a return to de jure feudalism entailing bonds of fealty between master and serf , as we discussed in ' Savage Capitalism : World Divided Into Rich and Poor As At No Time in Our History ' , covering Maude Barlowe 's powerful recent address directed towards the elite leaders of the G - 20 nations , hard - right policies have already produced a dangerous level of inequality that is producing a de facto master / servant society .
As she noted :
The richest 2 % own more than half the household wealth in the world .
The richest 10 % hold 85 % of total global assets and the bottom half of humanity owns less than 1 % of the wealth in the world .
The three richest men in the world have more money than the poorest 48 countries .
Thanks to corporate control of the media and the politicians their wealth promotes , economic disparity produces a vast gap in political power which , in turn , produces policies designed to further exacerbate inequality .
The logical outcome of privatization , never ending tax cuts for the wealthy and round - after - round of cuts to public services is not just the realization of Grover Norquist 's infamous call for government to be reduced to the point that it could be " drown in a bathtub , " but the elimination of government as a source of " public " services or as a vehicle in which individuals and the environment can be shielded from the arbitrary excesses of corporate wealth and power .
In the case of Arizona , Silverstein reports
The state is just completely bankrupt .
It has huge deficits , which they ’re addressing by cutting social spending in an extraordinary way ... they ’re doing away with all - day kindergarten , and they ’re kicking kids off of healthcare programs , taking very , very dramatic steps in order to control the budget deficit .
Keep " starving the beast " while squandering the National Treasury on corporate welfare , the military - industrial complex and wars for imperial conquest and eventually there will be no money whatsoever left for public education , health care , environmental protection or public safety .
The resort to temporary solutions described by Silverstein , such as the securitization of Arizona 's state lottery money , which will ultimately lead to the same type of massive unsustainable debt to Wall Street that we described in Meg Whitman , Wall Street , ' Billionaire Sociopaths ' and the Media ' Substance Deficit ' ; the selling off of public buildings , including Arizona 's capitol , only to pay greater sums in rent , offer no real long term solution .
The end point has to be the elimination of res publica producing a harsh " winner - take - all " society in which all semblance of community and common interest has been thoroughly eroded .
Instead of a source of public good and democratic accountability , government will become but an empty shell that , as revealed by the Arizona " Tea Party " experiment , spends its time in what George Orwell described in 1984 as the " three minutes of hate " --- exemplified , for example , in immigrant bashing legislation which riles the useful idiots , diverting them from the true source of their demise .
Economic Collapse
Through comparative examination of the U.S. with Empires past in Wealth and Democracy , Kevin Phillips presents an astute thesis that the end - stage of Empire is marked by outsourcing of manufacturing which is supplanted by finance .
In Freefall , Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz observed that " while the top has been doing very well over the last three decades , incomes of most Americans have stagnated or fallen .
The consequences were papered over ; those at the bottom --- or even the middle --- were told to continue to consume as if their incomes were rising ; they were encouraged to live beyond their means , by borrowing .... "
The 2008 Wall Street implosion underscored that , long - term , this neoliberal system is simply unsustainable .

A 6th form student from Stoke Newington School , was stopped from taking pictures at an Armed Forces Day parade in Romford , on Saturday .
Jules Mattsson who describes himself on his twitter page , as a photojournalist , libertarian socialist and Avid Reader , went into detail on his blog , saying : “ I was told by the police I was breaching the terrorism act , public order act , various misc copyright and child protection laws and otherwise being an “ Agitator ” .
“ The incident started when I took an image ( not a very good one it seems ) of a Police Cadet unit forming up to take part in an Armed Forces Day parade .
I was quickly and aggressively stopped by one of their adult officers asking me who I worked for .
I responded that I was a freelance and upon being told I needed parental permission to photograph them , I explained this was a public event in a public place and that I did n’t for editorial use .
“ She then demanded my details and when I declined , I was quickly pulled aside by police officers . ”
This is when Mattsson began recording the incident , but was soon prevented by an officer who demanded his details , which he declined to give .
He was told he was considered a threat , under the terrorism act , for photographing a police officer and had his camera snatched from around his neck , detained , frog marched away before he claims , he was pushed down some stairs and told they , [ police ] were concerned for his safety .
Eventually an arrest was prevented , by the intervention of an NUJ LPB welfare officer and was released , but not until after the parade he was attempting to cover was over .
Jules Mattsson maintains he is still in pain and spent several hours in hospital on Sunday , as a result of the incident , suffering ‘ severe and debilitating ’ back pain from being pushed down the steps by the police .
Jules Mattsson ’s run in with the police , came 24 hours after Journalists , Marc Vallee and Jason Parkinson were awarded compensation by the Met police in an out of court settlement , after they were verbally assaulted and prevented from covering a demonstration .
A statement regarding Jules Mattssons incident , has since been released by the Met police :
It is clearly not the intention of the MPS to prevent people from taking photographs , although , as the public would expect , officers will remain vigilant , particularly in crowded public places .
Any allegations or complaints about police treatment of photographers are taken very seriously by the MPS .
Anyone who is unhappy with the actions of individual police officers can make a formal complaint , which will be thoroughly investigated .
Although at this time we have not received a complaint about this incident and no allegations of crime have been made , we will investigate the circumstances .
Our officers do receive guidance around the issue of photography through briefings and internal communications and we continue to drive this work forward .

More families are homeless and on the streets
Needy and homeless people eat a free Easter meal provided by the Los Angeles Mission in downtown Los Angeles on April 2 .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Great Recession drove more families into homeless shelters in 2009 , a new federal report has found .
Some 170,000 families needed shelter last year , up from 159,000 in 2008 , according to an annual survey from the Department of Housing and Urban Development .
There were 535,000 people in those families .
Over the course of the past year , the number of people in homeless shelters dipped slightly to 1.56 million , from 1.6 million a year earlier .
This translates into one of every 200 Americans .
On a single night in January 2009 , there were just over 643,000 homeless people nationwide .
But , there are fewer people actually on the streets .
More than 60 % of people were in emergency shelters or transitional housing programs , while 37 % were on the street or in other places not meant for human habitation .
In 2008 , some 42 % were living on the streets .
" As a nation , we appear to be doing a better job sheltering those who might otherwise be living on our streets , but clearly homelessness is impacting a greater share of families with children , " said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan .
The economic downturn has most likely spurred the surge in homeless families , which numbered only 131,000 in 2007 .
Homelessness rises with job loss , said Mercedes Marquez , an assistant HUD secretary .
It 's likely that many more homeless families are staying with friends or relatives and may wind up in shelters in the near future .
Some 29.4 % of adults in families who entered shelters in 2009 said they had been staying with relatives , up from 24.2 % in 2007 .
One reason for the overall drop in homelessness is the increased federal effort to help those chronically on the street .
Nearly 111,000 long - term homeless were on the streets on a single night in January 2009 , down more than 10 % from a year earlier and nearly 30 % from 2006 .
Marquez attributes the decline to the construction of additional permanent supporting housing : Some 42,000 beds were added between 2006 and 2009 .
Families need more help
Families also stayed longer in shelters in 2009 , with the median number of nights rising to 36 , up from 30 a year earlier .
Most of these families are headed by women under the age of 31 , and more than half of children in shelters are under the age of 6 .
But more families with two adults and more headed only by a father also fell into homelessness , indicative of the recession 's toll , Marquez said .
By contrast , homeless individuals are overwhelmingly male and over age 30 .
More than 10 % are veterans and more than 40 % have a disability .
Homelessness is heavily concentrated in large coastal states , with California , New York , and Florida accounting for 39 % of the single - night count in January 2009 .
Nevada had the highest concentration of homeless people , with 0.85 % of its population without permanent shelter .
The state , which is also at the heart of the housing bust , is followed by Oregon , Hawaii , California and Washington .
Meanwhile , Kansas , South Dakota , and West Virginia had the nation 's lowest concentrations of homeless .
Housing officials hope that a $ 1.5 billion homelessness prevention program , funded by stimulus money , will assist families who need help .
Also , next week the administration plans to unveil a new effort to combat homelessness .
The wreck of HMS Investigator lies on the bottom of Mercy Bay .
( Parks Canada )
HMS Investigator , abandoned in the Arctic 155 years ago during a search for Sir John Franklin 's expedition , has been found .
Parks Canada archeologists looking for the ship found it 15 minutes after they started a sonar scan of Banks Island 's Mercy Bay in the Northwest Territories , said Marc - André Bernier , chief of Parks Canada 's underwater archeology service .
HMS Investigator , left , is trapped in ice with HMS Enterprise in a painting by Lt. W.H. Brown of the Royal Navy .
The ship was eventually abandoned and its crew rescued by a Royal Navy sledge team .
( ( National Maritime Museum ) )
" When the team arrived [ on July 22 ] , the whole bay was covered in ice , " Bernier said .
" On July 25 , the team had an opening in the ice . …
It happened to be where the ship had been abandoned . "
They started a sonar scan of the area identified by British navy accounts as the spot where the ship had been left .
They used a torpedo - shaped scanner , towed behind a Zodiac inflatable boat , which sends out sound waves and produces images of the floor of the bay .
" After 15 minutes , they basically had an image of the wreck , " Bernier said .
" It 's in good condition , " he said .
" Very good condition , actually — surprising condition . "
The ship is upright in about 11 metres of water , its bottom buried in sediment if it 's still there , and the upper deck under about eight metres of water .
" Apparently , you can see some of it from the surface when the water is clear , " Bernier said .
While the masts are gone and the bulwarks — the sides of the ship that extend above the deck — are mostly gone , likely damaged by ice , there is potential to find smaller artifacts , Bernier said .
" This is very cold water .
That helps preservation as well , " he said .
One of the masts appears to be on the deck of the ship , he added .
If the masts had still been in place , they would have stuck out of the water .
The archeology crew has no plans to raise the ship .
They will do a thorough sonar scan of the area , then send a remotely operated vehicle , similar to the ROVs used to take pictures of the BP oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico , to take pictures .
They will analyze the condition of the ship , the environmental impacts that could cause further damage , and the potential to find further artifacts — though they will remove nothing at this point .
Before departing to go to another ship , the crew of HMS Investigator buried their cargo on Banks Island .
Remains of the barrels indicate the cache 's location .
( ( Courtesy of Western News ) )
" The work really starts now for the archeologists , " Bernier said .
The ship had n't been found earlier because of the difficulty involved in getting access to the area and surveying the bottom of the bay , which is usually covered with ice , Bernier said .
The ship was stuck in the ice for more than two years before it was abandoned , he noted .
The Investigator , captained by Robert McClure , was sent in 1850 to search for Franklin 's crew and their two ships , the Erebus and Terror .
After more than two years trapped in the ice at Mercy Bay , crew members were rescued by a Royal Navy sledge team , who took them to another ship .
In the end , McClure and the Investigator succeeded where Franklin failed — they are credited with finding the Northwest Passage .
" This is the ship that confirmed and nailed the existence of that passage , " Bernier said .
Before leaving the ship , the crew buried much of their cargo on Banks Island .
The location of their cache was known and is also being investigated by an archeological crew on land .
The land crew has found three sites of interest , including the gravesites of three crewmembers who died of scurvy in April 1853 .
" They 're about 60 metres from the cache site , " Bernier said .
" They seem to be in an undisturbed condition . "
A magnetometer has indicated there is metal in the graves , but they will be left undisturbed , he said .
The British government has been informed of the find and will be consulted about what will happen at the gravesite .
The other two sites hold the remains of the cache and pieces of a small boat , Bernier said .
Investigator had ' major impact ' on Inuit
In addition to the British navy accounts that led the archeologists to the Investigator , Inuit oral tradition tells stories of the ship .
" This is alive in the Inuvialuit memory today , " Bernier said .
The Investigator site " had a major impact " on the Inuit because it was a source of copper and iron , he said .
In fact , the pieces of the small boat found on shore should have metal nails in it , but they have all been removed .
" It was a resource site for the Inuit , " Bernier said .
Franklin's party disappeared while searching for the Northwest Passage in 1848 , following their captain 's death partway through the expedition .
Their ships have n't been found , despite numerous searches .
Parks Canada is planning another search for the Erebus and Terror in August .
The site is of interest not only because of its importance to marine history and the Inuit , Bernier added , but because it illuminates a fascinating piece of human history .
There were 60 men in the group who were stuck at the site for more than two years , he said .
" It 's also a survival camp . "
After fending off most challenges to its independence and winning new powers to oversee big financial firms , the Federal Reserve has emerged from a bruising debate on the overhaul of U.S. financial rules as perhaps the pre-eminent regulator in the sector .
But that could only bring it added blame if things go wrong again .

In Brazil , an estimated three million people have taken part in Sao Paulo 's annual gay pride parade .
Crowds danced through the main avenue of Brazil 's biggest city .
Many of those taking part paraded in carnival - style costumes .
Lesbians , bisexuals and transexuals also took part in what was Sao Paulo 's 14th gay pride event .
The march was financed by Sao Paulo 's state government and the oil company Petrobras .
The march had a political theme , with campaigners urging Brazilians to " vote against homophobia " in October 's presidential election .
Gay rights campaigners say that although Brazil is generally open in its attitude to homosexuality , homophobia is widespread .
We 've all experienced the strong heartbeat that accompanies emotions such as fear and rage .
But can the body 's natural response to these emotions be used to combat heart failure ?
Results of a study published online in the journal Circulation Research present a strong case .
In the study , scientists from the University of Rochester Medical Center found that two experimental drugs have the potential to restore pumping strength to failing hearts in part by harnessing the fight - or - flight response that makes hearts beat stronger .
At the center of this finding is the hormone adrenalin , which normally maintains the heart 's pumping strength and makes the heart beat with greater force during crisis .
The newly identified drugs ensure that adrenalin's ability to drive heartbeat strength is maintained , and not thwarted , as it typically is in heart failure patients .
The two therapies , when tested in human - like mouse models of heart failure , were found to slow , and in some cases halt , the progression of the disease .
" Considering the limited efficacy of current drug therapies for heart failure , this discovery is both exciting and promising , " said Burns C. Blaxall , Ph.D. , associate professor within the Aab Cardiovascular Research Institute at the Medical Center , and senior author of the study .
" We are now taking a closer look at how these compounds compare to standard heart failure therapies , such as beta blockers , to further determine their efficacy in treating the disease . "
When the heart stops pumping as effectively as it should , the body responds by sending more adrenalin to give the heart a pick - me - up .
While increased adrenalin initially restores the heart 's vitality , over time heart muscle cells become less and less responsive to high levels of adrenalin , triggering the body to pump even more of the hormone to the heart .
Elevated adrenalin is a hallmark of heart failure , and a recent study linked anxiety -- which increases adrenalin -- in teens and young adults to a higher risk of heart disease or heart attack later in life .
Blaxall 's lab is part of a nationwide effort that has linked adrenalin's ability to propel heartbeat strength to a key protein , the beta adrenergic receptor .
When adrenalin combines with this receptor it orders heart muscle cells to contract with greater speed and force .
The problem in heart failure patients is that these receptors are chronically desensitized -- they no longer respond to adrenalin , so the heart grows weak and does not pump as forcefully as it should .

" While adrenalin desensitization has been studied extensively , this is the first report of compounds that effectively target this specific process to reduce heart failure , " said Blaxall .
The desensitization is caused in large part by elevated levels of a particular enzyme ( G - protein - coupled receptor kinase 2 or GRK2 ) when it interacts with G - proteins .
This research was conducted in collaboration with Alan Smrcka , Ph.D. , professor in the Department of Pharmacology & Physiology at the Medical Center whose laboratory discovered compounds that could block GRK2 regulation by G proteins .
Smrcka 's research team conducted extensive screening and testing to identify these experimental compounds .
Two such compounds , M119 and Gallein , were identified and put to the test .
" In this study we took an entirely new pharmacological approach by altering signaling pathways after the beta adrenergic receptor rather than altering the receptor itself .
In this way the actions of adrenalin are modified rather than blocked as with other therapies , such as beta blockers , " said Smrcka .
" This novel approach is applicable in heart failure and may be useful in other conditions as well . "
Blaxall 's team found that Gallein not only slowed , but halted heart failure progression when delivered to mice with pre-existing heart failure .
Similarly , M119 reduced two characteristics of the disease -- strain - related thickening of muscle tissue ( hypertrophy ) and scar tissue formation ( fibrosis ) .
Both compounds partially normalized the force of heart muscle contraction by making sure the beta adrenergic receptors became and remained responsive to adrenalin .
This was done by both decreasing overall levels of GRK2 in the heart and by limiting its effectiveness .
M119 and Gallein have been used in a similar way in the past to target the receptor desensitization process that occurs in other conditions , such as chronic pain .
For example , Smrcka and his collaborator Jean Bidlack , Ph.D. , professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the Medical Center , have shown M119 can reverse the desensitization of opiate receptors , which in turn increases the efficacy of painkillers such as morphine .
M119 and Gallein are not known drugs ; they are compounds that act as dyes , or stains , and were previously not known to have any therapeutic activity .
This research addresses a health problem that affects nearly 6 million Americans .
The result of underlying problems like coronary artery disease , high blood pressure or heart attack damage , heart failure is the gradual loss of the heart 's ability to pump with enough force to meet the body 's need for blood .
Half of patients will not live five years past the day they are diagnosed .
The best treatment for a severe heart failure patient is a transplant , but with just over 2,000 transplants done each year and more than 3,000 people on the waiting list at any given time , research like this is needed to find new options for patients .
The current research was funded by the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) and the Institute for General Medicine at the National Institutes of Health and the University of Rochester Medical Center .
Blaxall 's lab recently received additional funding from the NHLBI to compare the newly identified compounds to current standard therapies for heart failure in human - like mouse models .
Blaxall , Smrcka and their team are seeking partnerships to further develop these compounds .
In addition to Blaxall and Smrcka , the following individuals from the University of Rochester Medical Center contributed to this research : Liam Casey , Ph.D. , post - doctoral associate and co-first author of the study ; Andrew Pistner , medical student and co-first author ; post - doctoral associates Stephen Belmonte , Ph.D. , and Alessandra Matavel , Ph.D. ; Dmitriy Migdalovich , medical student ; Olga Stolpnik and Frances Nwakanma , graduate students ; Gabriel Vorobiof , M.D. , cardiology fellow ; Olga Dunaevsky , technician ; and Coeli Lopes , Ph.D. , assistant professor in the Aab Cardiovascular Research Institute .

I made this copier recently , based on a digital camera and a stand .
I dig it .
I also made a few modifications , one of which I show in this instructable .
The digital camera I use runs on 2,000 AA batteries , though it uses only 2 at the time .
But it eats through these things .
It laughed at rechargeables .
It cleared 8 batteries in its first day of service .
I ’ve read that sadly , that ’s not abnormal .
It ’s a good camera , but the cost of batteries was going to render this project prohibitively expensive to operate .
There is no DC input adapter to use an AC power source with it , and my search for how to add one left me frustrated — the few walkthroughs I could find were good , but would require MASSIVE modification to the camera given its size .
So , I had this idea , put it together quickly , and it worked .
The goal is simply to run the wire ends from an AC adapter to the contact points in the camera .
Almost no modification to the camera [ just enough to let the wires through ] , very inexpensive , and quick to make , simple , and effective .
I did n’t find any instructable or even blog written about this concept .
I independently discovered and engineered the solution I will show you .
There are likely better ways .
Please tell me of your improvements in the comments .
If this is your idea , let me know so I can credit you .
*** Obviously this will likely void your warranty .
It is intended for devices WITHOUT an AC adapter socket .
If your device has one , by all means use that .
I really enjoyed New Scientist ’s Special Report : Living in Denial .
What a fascinating phenomenon , and a fascinating batch of articles exploring it .
The denial of science is a growing problem .
It ’s not restricted to a particular ideology – while denying the harmful effects of smoking or the existence of climate change is typically a position of the far right , vaccine denial and H1N1 conspiracy theories are largely restricted to the left .
It occurs even among the well - educated , or among youth who are still immersed in up - to - date curricula .
For example , this year at the university , a student group put up signs saying “ Do n’t get the swine flu shot – it contains mercury ! ”
The chemistry students got mad , and said that labelling thimerosal as toxic mercury was comparable to saying “ Do n’t eat table salt , it contains chlorine gas ! ”
As Michael Shermer ’s article explains , the defining mark of science denial is a refusal to change one ’s mind based on evidence .
This is easy to identify for something like Holocaust denial , where evidence is abundant in the public sphere .
It gets a little harder for more technical issues like climate change or vaccines .
Scientific opinion is overwhelmingly on one “ side ” , but the average person does not know or understand the evidence to support this consensus .
An article about the thermodynamics of the stratosphere wo n’t sell a lot of papers .
Most people unconsciously follow the credibility spectrum and trust what their doctor or NASA scientists say .
However , some do n’t realize that scientific credibility is not the same as an appeal to authority , and so express contrarian opinions .
Vaccines cause autism .
Global warming is nonexistent / natural / inconsequential .
The way that the Twin Towers fell proves that it was orchestrated by the US government .
There are two groups of contrarians : the skeptics , and the deniers .
The skeptics are the ones who will change their minds based on evidence – they just have n’t encountered that evidence yet .
My favourite example of this is from the Friends episode when Phoebe declares she does n’t believe in evolution .
When Ross starts talking to her about fossils , she says , “ Oh . I did n’t know there was actually evidence . ”
It ’s amazing how many insights you can get out of a supposedly “ fluffy ” sitcom .
I could write an entire essay analyzing that clip …..
I have met dozens of very reasonable people who doubt climate change because they do n’t know about the evidence for it .
People my age throw around the phrase “ it ’s a natural cycle ” a lot , until I explain that the climate does n’t act like a pendulum .
It does n’t have to compensate for past periods of warming or cooling – it simply responds to forcings .
If the forcing is cyclical , then the climate will be cyclical , but some forcings are a different shape altogether .
Similarly , I know a teacher who previously thought that natural causation of the current warming was a legitimate scientific theory , due to a presentation from a teacher ’s conference …. until I did a bit of probing and discovered that this presentation was given by Tim Ball .
These people are very reasonable .
They are willing to change their minds based on evidence .
They ’ve just been unlucky enough to be misinformed by our flawed system of science journalism .
Then there are the deniers .
They call themselves skeptics , but they will not change their minds , no matter what evidence you give them .
They either move the goalposts , change the subject , or continue to repeat the same claim even after you have rebutted it patiently multiple times .
Go check out some YouTube comments to see what I ’m talking about .
Often their ideology or worldview is extreme in some way .
For many members of the far right , any problem that would be solved by the government ( think cap - and - trade or smoking legislation ) will be rejected out of hand .
On the far left , anything that would benefit corporations ( usually vaccines or traditional medicine ) will face a similar reaction .
As Michael Specter says , “ We hate Big Pharma .
We run away from Big Pharma …. and leap right into the arms of Big Placebo . ”
This phenomenon suggests that science communication is not the answer – for deniers .
I learned long ago that trying to change the minds of deniers is a complete waste of time .
However , I still feel that science communication and the rebuttal of common misconceptions is absolutely vital .
The true skeptics need access to the evidence they are lacking , so that they will be more informed , and our population will move farther towards solving the many science - related problems we face .
These skeptics deserve our time , our efforts , and our respect .
They are the target audience of my blog , even if my most active commenters and supporters are a different group altogether .
The reason that any of us here do all this work in communication , I believe , is for the true skeptics .
Michael Fitzpatrick argues that we should n’t use the label “ deniers ” at all .
I would n’t want to alienate the true skeptics by coming across as someone who insults others .
However , I think that calling deniers “ skeptics ” is unfair to the skeptics .
They are two completely different groups that we must distinguish between .
Skepticism is a worthy quality in science , and giving the complimentary title of “ skeptic ” to someone who does n’t deserve it is unfair to those who do .
We need to cater to the people who are willing to learn and who do n’t want to waste our time .
Science communication should n’t have to be like No Child Left Behind .
Michael Shermer ’s second article , similarly , says that we should participate in debates with deniers and give them a chance to be heard .
The truth will prevail , he argues , even if the deniers refuse to give in .
I would agree with this position if it were a matter of opinion or policy , which is wholly democratic .
Yet science is completely different .
Science is n’t about free speech and giving equal time for all views .
It is about giving time to those who have the most accurate analyses and robust conclusions .
In science , you shut up and listen until your ideas are strongly supported by evidence .
Then you publish .
When papers skeptical of climate change get published ( all three per year ! ) , such debates are worthy .
The authors passed the test of peer - review , and even if their papers are obviously sub-par and are soon to be retracted , they deserve some debate and discussion .
Let ’s debate contrarian science when it is actually science – when it is actually published .
By paying close attention to and publicly debating with the authors of blog science , however , we are further confusing the public ’s already skewed image of science .
“ It does n’t matter whether or not you publish , ” we seem to be telling them , “ it ’s all about free speech . ”
The scientific process has rules , and if deniers can’t pass the necessary , but not sufficient , condition of peer - review , their work does n’t deserve to be treated as scientific research , and we should n’t give them our attention .
Let ’s ignore the people who are n’t worth our time , because we have limited time , and there are people out there who deserve every minute of it .
Richard Lee sank $ 1.4 million of his Oaksterdam business empire 's money into putting a marijuana legalization measure on November 's ballot , but it was n't until this week that he rolled out his secret weapon :
His 80 - year - old , conservative Republican , Texan mom .
Ann Lee arrived in the Bay Area early this week and will remain until Tuesday .
At midweek , she was fielding media calls between a video shoot at the Tax Cannabis 2010 campaign headquarters in Oakland and an event at a drug and alcohol recovery center in Concord .
" Whatever I can do to help , " she said .
" I really do n't have words to tell you about how excited I am to be doing this . "
The Louisiana native said she caught the political bug with her father 's mayoral campaign while she was in high school ; she later went to the University of Texas in 1946 and met her future husband there , settled in Houston to raise a family and then got back into politics with Barry Goldwater 's 1964 presidential campaign .
She was a member of the Harris County Republican Party 's executive committee for more than 30 years ; she 's still a precinct chair .
" I think this is the most exciting , the most meaningful culmination of all my years of political activity , " she said Wednesday .
" The drug war is so bad , it 's the most racist thing we 've done since Jim Crow . "
That " separate but equal " racial segregation was something she did n't fully understand when growing up , she said , but she came to realize how immoral it was .
Now the nation 's drug laws have " made felons out of more young blacks that should not be called felons , " she said , and she sees her son 's ballot measure as a means of " knocking a hole in that horrible drug war " as well as the overall hypocrisy of legalized alcohol but criminalized cannabis .
The Tax Cannabis 2010 measure would let people at least 21 have , grow or transport marijuana for personal use , and would let cities and counties decide whether to regulate and tax commercial production and sale , most likely creating a system of " wet " and " dry " counties as in states with similar alcohol laws .
It also would boost the criminal penalty for giving marijuana to a minor , prohibit consumption in public or while minors are present , and maintain existing laws against driving under the influence .
A coalition including the California Police Chiefs Association , the California District Attorneys Association , Mothers Against Drunk Driving , the California Bus Association and anti-drug groups opposes the measure as a threat to public safety through intoxicated driving , and as misleading because it wo n't solve the state 's budget crisis .
But Lee , citing Abraham Lincoln 's 1840 statement on alcohol , said prohibition " makes a crime out of things that are not crimes . "
She believes she can help the campaign because she 's not the stereotypical face of drug- legalization advocacy , given her " conservative Republican heritage of more than 40 years or so . "
" There are too many conservative Republicans who have not seen it this way , and I hope to open the eyes of those people , help them think about this issue , " she said .
" It 's not the bugaboo to Republicans that some people feel it is . "
She hopes that she and her husband of 59 years —
" I think my husband is just as passionate about this as I am , I 'm just more apt to show it " — will return to California in August for more campaigning , and she hopes to return in October as well .
Polls show the measure has an uphill battle , but Lee said she 's proud of her son's integrity and " damn the torpedoes , full speed ahead " mentality on pursuing it even when some advocates say the time is not yet right .
" I said to him a little while ago , ' It sure is fun being your mom . ' "
An international team of scientists have developed a promising new technique which could turn pulsars -- superb natural cosmic clocks -- into even more accurate time - keepers .
This important advance , led by scientists at The University of Manchester and appearing June 24 in the journal Science Express , could improve the search for gravitational waves and help studies into the origins of the universe .
The direct discovery of gravitational waves , which pass over cosmic clocks and cause them to change , could allow scientists to study violent events such as the merging of super - massive black holes and help understand the universe shortly after its formation in the Big Bang .
The scientists made their breakthrough using decades - long observations from the 76-m Lovell radio telescope at The University of Manchester 's Jodrell Bank Observatory to track the radio signals of extreme stars known as pulsars .
Pulsars are spinning collapsed stars which have been studied in great detail since their discovery in 1967 .
The extremely stable rotation of these cosmic fly - wheels has previously led to the discovery of the first planets orbiting other stars and provided stringent tests for theories of gravity that shape the Universe .
However , this rotational stability is not perfect and , until now , slight irregularities in their spin have significantly reduced their usefulness as precision tools .

The team , led by the University of Manchester 's Professor Andrew Lyne , has used observations from the Lovell telescope to explain these variations and to demonstrate a method by which they may be corrected .
Professor Lyne explains : " Mankind 's best clocks all need corrections , perhaps for the effects of changing temperature , atmospheric pressure , humidity or local magnetic field .
Here , we have found a potential means of correcting an astrophysical clock . "
The rate at which all pulsars spin is known to be decreasing very slowly .
What the team has found is that the deviations arise because there are actually two spin - down rates and not one , and that the pulsar switches between them , abruptly and rather unpredictably .
These changes are associated with a change in the shape of the pulse , or tick , emitted by the pulsar .
Because of this , precision measurements of the pulse shape at any particular time indicate exactly what the slowdown rate is and allow the calculation of a " correction . "
This significantly improves their properties as clocks .
The results give a completely new insight into the extreme conditions near neutron stars and also offer the potential for improving already very precise experiments in gravitation .

It is hoped that this new understanding of pulsar spin - down will improve the chances that the fastest spinning pulsars will be used to make the first direct detection of ripples , known as gravitational waves , in the fabric of space - time .
The University of Manchester team worked closely on the project with Dr George Hobbs of the Australia Telescope National Facility , Professor Michael Kramer of the Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy and Professor Ingrid Stairs of the University of British Columbia .
The research was funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council .
Their Director of Science , Professor John Womersley , said : " Astronomy is unlike most other sciences , as we cannot go out and measure directly the properties of stars and galaxies .
" They have to be calculated based on our understanding of how the Universe works -- which means that something as significant as being able to use pulsars as cosmic clocks , a new standard for time measurement , will have far - reaching consequences for advancing science and our understanding of the Universe . "
Many observatories around the world are attempting to use pulsars in order to detect the gravitational waves that are expected to be created by super - massive binary black holes in the Universe .
With the new technique , the scientists may be able to reveal the gravitational wave signals that are currently hidden because of the irregularities in the pulsar rotation .
Head of the Pulsar Group at The University of Manchester Dr Ben Stappers said : " These exciting results were only possible because of the quality and duration of the unique Lovell Telescope pulsar timing database . "
Have you ever been burned by somebody because they told you an outright lie ?
It can happen in your personal or business life - you ’re on cloud nine when your girlfriend says she loves you , only to find out later she ’s been cheating on you for months ; a client says their business is solvent , but they end up bankrupt , and you lose a ton of money on an account .
Would n’t it be great to avoid these situations by being able to tell right then and there if someone is lying to you ?
Well , based on research by behavioral scientists and the work and experience of FBI agents and police officers , a system has been developed to help people become human lie detectors .
Below we provide a short introduction to the art of sniffing out a whopper .
Ready to get started ?
Read on .
Caveat : Detecting lies is extremely difficult .
It ’s more of an art than a science .
People can fool polygraph tests , so they can definitely fool you .
There is no single behavior that indicates deception 100 % of the time .
Rather , detecting lies requires observing multiple behaviors and analyzing them using the surrounding context .
Also , just because a person shows some of the signs we list below , it does n’t necessarily mean they ’re lying , just that they might be lying .
Catalog a Subject ’s Pacifiers
The key to detecting deception is to recognize when people are uncomfortable .
Generally , people who are being honest feel comfortable , while people who are lying feel stressed .
When we ’re nervous or uncomfortable , we all unconsciously manifest our distress with the use of pacifiers .
Like the name suggests , we use these gestures and body movements to help soothe and comfort ourselves in uncomfortable situations .
Below is a short list of pacifiers many people display :
Face touching
Rubbing the back of the neck
Lip pursing
Hair stroking
Playing with jewelry
Covering the neck dimple ( usually seen with women )
Eye blocking - closing eyes tightly or even covering eyes with hands
Rubbing palms on legs
Hand wringing
Every person has a different set of pacifying behaviors .
Your goal at the beginning of a conversation is to know what pacifiers your potential liar uses .
Once you know a person ’s pacifiers , you can use that info to gauge their comfort and discomfort around certain topics .
Establish a Behavioral Baseline
Maybe somebody rubs the back of their neck all the time , not just when they ’re lying .
So in order to gauge someone ’s level of comfort or discomfort , you need to establish a baseline for their behaviors .
That way you ’ll know when they deviate from it .
Figuring out a person ’s pacifiers is easy if you ’re around them all time , but what if you ’ve just met someone ?
How can you figure out the pacifiers of a potential employee in the short time you ’re interviewing them ?
Well , most people display a bit of nervousness when they first meet new people , so you might see pacifying signs at the beginning of your encounter .
Make note of them , so you can use them to read the person later in the conversation .
Again , just because a person shows signs of discomfort around a topic , does n’t mean they ’re necessarily lying .
It just means you need to investigate that subject a bit more to find out the reason for the discomfort .
Get the Person Relaxed
After you ’ve figured out the person ’s pacifying gestures , get your subject relaxed and comfortable with you .
Make small talk .
A person will express their comfort with their body language .
They ’ll lean in closer to you , they ’ll open up their suit coat , they wo n’t have folded arms , and their feet might be bouncing underneath the table .
After you have the person relaxed , you can start asking the important questions .
As you discuss certain topics , look for the pacifiers you identified earlier to reemerge .
If they do , it could mean the person is lying to you .
Ask Specific , Non-suspicious Questions
Most people think that knowing the signs of deception is the only skill you need to sniff out a liar .
Knowing the signs is necessary , but not sufficient ; knowing what questions to ask and how to ask them is another vital skill to uncovering a fibber .
First , ensure that when you ask questions , you so do in a cool , detached , and non-judgmental way .
If you go at a person NYPD Blue style , you ’re bound to taint the subject ; even an innocent person will act nervous if they ’re accused of lying or feel pushed into a corner .
So be nonchalant about the whole thing .
You might even be surprised what comes out of a person ’s mouth when they think you ’re not suspicious of them .
What questions you should ask mostly depends on the context of the subject , but generally , the more specific your questions , the better .
Vague questions will get you vague , unhelpful responses .
Look for Other Signs of Deception
In addition to pacifying behaviors , look for these other signs that you ’re dealing with a liar :
Synchrony .
When deciphering truth from lie , watching for synchrony is key .
Synchrony is the proper alignment of what is said verbally and nonverbally , between events and emotions , and between the circumstances of the moment and what is being said .
For example , you normally expect a parent whose child is missing to be hysterical , begging for the police to get out there and find their baby .
If a parent seems detached and aloof , something ’s probably up .
Synchrony should also be present in the way a person moves their head .
If a person ’s head begins to shake either in the affirmative or in the negative as he speaks , and the movement occurs simultaneously with what he says , then you can typically rely on the veracity of the statement .
However , if he does the head shake after he makes the statement , the statement is most likely false .
You might even notice a person verbally saying “ yes , ” but shaking their head “ no . ”
If what they say from their mouth does n’t match with what their body says , you have a liar on your hands .
Little or no movement .
Ever notice how animals will freeze when a predator is near ?
This instinctual behavior actually serves a survival benefit ; it ’s hard for predators to see something if it ’s not moving .
Well , humans do the same thing during moments of distress .
When people lie , they tend to keep their body very still .
The imminent danger in this case is getting caught lying .
So our lizard brain will tell our body not to move , because maybe , just maybe , if we stay still , the other person wo n’t see that we ’re lying .
Got a friend who ’s pulling a possum ?
Dude might be lying .
Lack of emphasis .
When we speak , we naturally give emphasis both verbally and non-verbally to what we say .
Hand gestures , inflections , and head movements accentuate our words .
However , most of this happens unconsciously .
When our limbic brain backs up what we ’re saying , we ’ll unconsciously use body language to emphasize it .
When our unconscious brain does n’t back up what we ’re saying , those emphasizing gestures will not be present .
An innocent person accused of murder will probably pound their fist and yell , “ I did n’t do it ! ”
You probably wo n’t see that with a person who actually committed the crime ( despite the show you see the guilty put on on Law & Order ) .
Are their palms up ?
One interesting hand gesture that individuals who lie tend to use is the rogatory position , or speaking with their palms faced up .
People tend to do this when they want you to believe what they ’re saying .
It ’s like supplicating in prayer .
People who tell the truth do n’t need to ask to be believed , so they wo n’t take on the rogatory position , and their palms will be facing down .
Check eye direction .
When people concentrate on something visual , they tend to look upwards .
If they look up and to their right , it means they ’re concentrating on something visual that they ’re remembering from their past .
If they look up and to their left , it means they ’re focusing on something they ’ve created in their minds .
So if the person you ’re talking with looks up and to the left as they recollect what happened , they may be making up the story right there on the spot .
Although you ’d think they ’d turn and look down and behind , since that ’s where they ’re pulling things out of .
Note : Remember that eye directions are based on the subject ’s right and left .
So when you ’re watching them , when they look right it will look like they ’re looking to your left , and when they look left , it will appear from your perspective that they ’re looking right .
Practice , Practice , Practice
Reading non-verbal behavior is a skill that will take a long time to truly master .
Start paying more attention to the subtleties in your daily conversation , and eventually you ’ll become a walking , talking lie detector .

A grainy video from a cell phone camera that allegedly captures groans of pain emanating from a Mexican immigrant who was Tasered and beaten by U.S. border patrol agents and later died last week has surfaced on a Mexican web site .
The site Frontera .info or Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ BorderÃ¢â‚
¬Â posted the video on YouTube along with an article that accuses border patrol agents of torturing 42 year - old Anastasio HernÃ ƒÂ¡ndez Rojas ; a 20 - year resident of the United States who died after he encountered the agents at the San Ysidro crossing that separates San Diego and Tijuana last week .

Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Help me , help me please , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  the web site says Rojas pleads on the video .
The site posted the cell phone footage taken by San Diego resident Humberto Navarrete Mendoza yesterday .
Mendoza told the site several dozen people witnessed RojasÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ encounter with agents .
He told the site Rojas was not resisting while border patrol agents Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ shockedÃ¢â‚
¬
Â him and beat him .
“ I see that he was defenseless , ” Mendoza told the site .
Mendoza said he and a friend were headed to Tijuana when they heard RojasÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ cries of pain , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â prompting Mendoza to record the scene .
“ What I saw , something on my conscience told me it was wrong , ” he told the site .

The site reports that a woman can be heard telling the agents to leave Rojas , a father of five , alone .
Ã‚Â
But according to the site the beating continued until Rojas passed out .
“ He ’s not resisting , ” a voice can be heard saying .
Mendoza only recently came forward with the video , the site said , after he learned of RojasÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ death in the news .

Rojas , a 20 - year resident of Ã‚Â Encino California was attempting to return to the U.S. after he was arrested and deported on May 25 , the result of a traffic stop in San Diego .
Authorities were attempting to deport him again on May 28 when the incident took place .
Rojas died of cardiac arrest but the San Diego County Coroner found Rojas had sustained major brain damage from the beating and ruled the death a homicide with methamphetamine found in his system and hypertension as contributing factors .

San Diego police Captain Jim Collis told the Associated Press Rojas had wrestled with two border patrol agents after his handcuffs were removed .
The investigation has been turned over to the Federal prosecutors at the Justice Department this week for possible prosecution .

Menthol cigarettes now account for more than one - quarter of all cigarettes sold in the U.S.
In fact , menthols -- often described as " cooling , " " soothing , " and " smooth " -- make up a growing share of the shrinking cigarette market .
Between 2004 and 2008 , the percentage of adult smokers who smoked them increased from 30 percent to 34 percent .
Experts say that menthol cigarettes ' minty flavor makes them more appealing to young people , more addictive , and harder to quit than regular cigarettes .
Menthol is the " ultimate candy flavoring , " says Phillip Gardiner , a researcher at the University of California 's Tobacco - Related Disease Research Program , in Oakland .
The Food and Drug Administration has n't yet decided on whether it agrees .
When the FDA was given the authority to regulate tobacco products in 2009 , the agency banned cigarettes with flavors such as chocolate and fruit , because candy - like cigarettes are more attractive to kids .
But menthol escaped the cut .
Since then , tobacco and public health experts have said that menthols should be banned , too -- or at least regulated more strictly .
The FDA 's new tobacco advisory committee is currently sifting through the evidence .
Short of an outright ban on menthol cigarettes , the FDA may decide to regulate their marketing and even the menthol content .
The FDA committee has scheduled a second meeting on the matter in mid-July , although the committee 's final recommendation is n't due until March 2011 .
But are menthols really worse than non-menthol cigarettes ?
The committee 's task wo n't be an easy one .
The opinions that physicians , public health experts , and tobacco executives have regarding menthol cigarettes seem to be stronger than the research supporting them .
Menthol ads target black community
Tobacco company representatives have maintained that menthol cigarettes are no more or less addictive and harmful than other brands on the market -- although they are quick to acknowledge that all cigarettes are addictive and potentially deadly .
" The clear , science - based judgment must be that menthol cigarettes are not more harmful than non-menthol cigarettes , " William True , Ph.D. , the senior vice president of research at the Lorillard Tobacco Company , told the FDA committee in March .
" A menthol cigarette is , well , just another cigarette , and should be treated no different . "
( Lorillard is the maker of Newport cigarettes , the most popular menthol brand in the U.S. )
The debate over whether menthols are more addictive and harmful than regular cigarettes is complicated by cultural and racial factors .
Since the 1960s and 1970s , tobacco companies have largely marketed menthols to younger people and blacks , who now smoke the cigarettes at higher rates than other groups .
Roughly 70 percent of blacks smoke menthols , compared with just over 20 percent of whites and 26 percent of Hispanics , according to the latest government data .
Health.com : 70 years of menthol cigarette ads
" Menthol cigarettes are marketed to the most vulnerable sectors of our society , particularly starting in the 1960s , " Gardiner says .
" It 's essentially predatory marketing . "
As a result , the health effects of menthols can be difficult to untangle from broader factors that influence smoking .
Although blacks tend to smoke less than whites , they " get lung cancer more often and die more often than non-African Americans , " says William Hicks , M.D. , professor of clinical medicine at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center , in Columbus , co-author of a recent report on lung cancer in African Americans for the American Lung Association .
Research suggests that blacks and other minorities have a harder time quitting menthol cigarettes than white smokers .
One study , published in 2009 in the journal Preventive Medicine , found that among nearly 8,000 current and former menthol smokers , blacks and Hispanics were 45 percent less likely to quit smoking than white smokers .
It 's unclear what accounts for this disparity .
It may be due to unidentified cultural and economic factors , or even physiological factors .
A nicotine byproduct known as cotinine " stays in the body twice as long in African Americans , and this may be a marker of greater addictiveness , " says Gardiner .
The research has some weaknesses , however .
As True pointed out at the FDA committee meeting , it is very difficult to separate out the effects of menthol from other cultural and racial factors that may influence smoking habits and dependence .
What is menthol anyway ?
Menthol is a type of alcohol found in oils extracted from mint plants ( such as peppermint ) .
Although some tobacco products are flavored with natural menthol , most menthol cigarettes -- and cough drops and candies -- use a synthetic version .
About 90 percent of all cigarettes contain trace amounts of menthol , but only mentholated varieties contain enough of the flavor for it to be noticeable .

Tobacco companies have touted the " cooling " and " soothing " properties of menthol cigarettes since the 1920s -- and that 's true , in a sense .
Menthol is a mild anesthetic that excites cold receptors in the mouth , throat and airways , causing a slight numbing sensation that can make tobacco smoke seem less harsh .
( This may be why menthol is added to regular cigarettes . )
" Mentholated products of all types , whether taken orally or inhaled , are better tolerated , " says Hicks .
" There 's less irritation and , over the short term , some soothing effect . "
Researchers have long suspected that the cooling sensation might make menthols more harmful by masking the harshness of tobacco and allowing smokers to inhale more deeply ( or more often ) , but they have n't yet been able to prove it .
Some studies show that menthol smokers actually inhale less smoke or take fewer puffs compared to people who smoke regular cigarettes .
Experts have also argued that the menthol sensation may contribute to nicotine addiction by making the cigarettes more palatable to young people .
And there is some evidence that menthols are a " starter " cigarette .
National surveys have shown that teenagers are more likely to smoke menthols if they 've been smoking for less than a year , and the percentage of white and Hispanic kids who smoke menthols is higher in middle school than in high school .

These figures suggest that inexperienced smokers are more likely to smoke menthols , but they do n't necessarily show that smoking menthols ( rather than regular cigarettes ) is more likely to lead to addiction .
Menthols may be harder to kick
Still , one of the main arguments made by people who support a menthols ban has been that the flavoring seems to make the cigarettes more addictive and harder to quit .
" Some studies have shown that menthol smokers have had less successful rates of quitting smoking than non-menthol smokers , feel less confident in their ability to quit , and have more relapses and quit attempts than non-menthol smokers , " says Olivia Wackowski , MPH , a tobacco specialist at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey School of Public Health , in New Brunswick .
In a 2009 report to the FDA , Gardiner and a co-author indicated that this could be because menthol may increase nicotine absorption and has stimulating effects on the central nervous system .
" When you reach for menthol cigarettes , not only are you getting nicotine , which activates certain sensory properties in the brain , but also menthol , which activates certain sensory activities , " Gardiner explains .
" That 's why it 's harder to quit .
There 's an interaction between menthol and nicotine .
It 's received more readily in the brain . "
Whether menthol actually enhances the addictiveness of cigarettes remains open to debate , however .
Several studies have found that quitting is very difficult regardless of what kind of cigarette a person smokes , and researchers have n't been able to confirm that menthols have a different effect on the nervous system than non-menthol cigarettes .
However , some research has found that people who smoke menthols are more dependent on nicotine .
Studies have shown that , compared to people who smoke regular cigarettes , menthol smokers light up nearly twice as quickly after waking up in the morning and are also more likely to wake up at night to smoke .
( Both are common measures of nicotine dependence . )
Still , the evidence is n't strong enough to prove definitively that menthols are more addictive than regular cigarettes , says Wackowski .

Which type of smoker are you ?
" We can't say that menthol is more addictive , " Gardiner agrees .
" The problem is that cigarettes kill you anyway , so trying to prove that one substance is doing more harm than another has proved to be not fruitful . "
Is time running out for menthols ?
Danny McGoldrick , vice president for research for the Campaign for Tobacco - Free Kids , an antismoking advocacy group based in Washington , D.C. , feels that addictiveness should be only one of the measures used by the FDA in deciding whether to ban or regulate menthols .
" The FDA should look at menthol based on a broad public health standard , taking into account not only addictiveness but also increased toxicity , harm , or disease risk , " he says .
" The FDA needs to look at all the evidence .
We could learn a lot by requiring industry to turn over all their documents and also take into account how menthol is marketed and targeted . "

Red Bull 's motorsport advisor Helmut Marko insists that both its Formula 1 team 's drivers are treated exactly the same - even though he has publicly blamed Mark Webber for trying to defend his position during his Turkish Grand Prix crash .
Webber and team - mate Sebastian Vettel collided in their fight for the lead at Istanbul - throwing away the team 's chances of taking the win , and handing victory to main title rivals McLaren .
But although it has emerged that race leader Webber 's position was compromised by having to turn his engine down to save fuel , while Vettel was allowed to attack him at full power , Marko is adamant both men are given a fair and equal chance .
" We are handling our team and both drivers in the same way , " insisted Marko .
" Vettel was under such pressure and if such a situation comes up - you have to look after the team .
We still could have been 1 - 2 . "
Marko says Vettel was allowed to attack Webber because there was no option to back him off - as Lewis Hamilton was right behind the Red Bull Racing drivers .
" It was n't a situation where we were racing each other , " said Marko .
" We were under enormous pressure from the McLarens - they were much faster on the straights so we had to gain our advantage in the corners .
" He had to attack otherwise he would have got overtaken by Hamilton - it would have been completely different if the McLarens were 10 - seconds behind , but that was n't the case . "
Asked for his views on the accident , Marko reckons that Vettel was in the right to turn across the track , even with Webber there , since the German had got his nose ahead .
" He [ Vettel ] was already ahead , at least two metres ahead , and there was a corner to the left side coming , so he had to go for the line , " he said .
" He can not brake on the dirt because for sure he knows what happens .
" But it was unnecessary the whole situation .
We will talk with everybody quite clearly to make it not happen again . "
Marko said that he had spoken to Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz and he explained the Austrian was ' not amused ' by the events of Turkey .
The butcher who has been given the go - ahead to sell horse meat for human consumption says there has been a small black market in it in Australia for years .
Perth butcher Vince Garreffa began selling horse meat at his store on Tuesday and is vowing to continue , despite receiving death threats from animal liberationists .
But he told ABC News Online that Europeans have been dining on horse meat for centuries and it is an open secret that migrants in Perth go to extreme lengths to get their hands on it .
" If you and I did n't eat Australian lamb for 10 or 20 years and someone showed up with an illegally slaughtered carcass in the boot of their car , I know I 'd be the first one to put up my hand to buy a leg , " he said .
" You miss it so much ; it 's a taste of home .
And to Europeans , horse is a taste of home .
The French go nuts for it and I 've found they 've gone to the trouble of buying it not only illegally when someone has offered it , but also offered it from pet shops who sell horse for our pets .
" It 's very small but it exists .
" At the end of the day it 's not an organised black market , the term black market infers a lot of different connotations .
The truth is , just like somebody might turn around in Australia and grab an illegal feed of marron and offer it to their friends , somebody along the line eventually has slaughtered some horse .
" Back in the 70s I knew of a favourite pet shop people could trust to say ' I want some horse meat but I want to eat it , I do n't want to give it to my pets , so could you make sure it 's fresh ? '
He was famous for handing it over . "
Mr Garreffa says Australia has the sixth largest export market for horse meat in the world , slaughtering from 50,000 to 70,000 horses a year for human consumption in countries in Europe and Asia .
He understands that people have an attachment to horses because they have become a companion animal in Australia , but is concerned that buying it illegally could be dangerous , and compares it to the days when people bought kangaroo meat under the counter .
" Because pet meat does n't have the protocols by the health department , the meat that 's slaughtered for pet meat could very well be diseased horses , or horses that are full of steroids and other drugs , " he said .
" There 's just no way in the world that anybody should be taking a risk of eating that type of meat and I think [ WA 's Food and Agriculture Minister ] has had great courage in allowing a very small , controlled supply .
" I 've never heard of anyone dying of kangaroo poisoning but horse from unreliable sources is a much more dangerous affair because of the amount of drugs involved in the horse industry . "
Mr Garreffa acknowledges that horse meat is not for everybody and that a lot of people will never consider it as suitable for the plate .
" [ It tastes like ] beef with a slight sweetness in the back palate .
It 's a little bit richer , very lean and it has twice the amount of iron than any other red meat , the scientists tell us , " he said .
" But not everybody will get over the headspace of thinking about eating one of man 's best friends . "
He does not believe horse meat should be treated any differently from beef or lamb , but it is clear that not everybody agrees .
Mr Garreffa has received death threats about his decision , both over the phone and via email .
" At first it was a shock .
It 's words of a nature that whatever was being done to the horses was going to be done to me , " he said .
" But the more I think about it over the last couple of days , I realise the amount of passionate people who really do care about animal welfare , and maybe it might not be as dangerous at it sounds . "
Despite the death threats , Mr Garreffa says demand for horse meat has been " steady " since Tuesday .
" Just like we do n't put pigs heads in the window because they offend people - yet we sell plenty of them in a year - people just come in quietly and ask for one , " he said .
" We 've now got to a stage because of the furore , people are just sneaking in , quietly whispering that they 'd like some horse meat and we sell it to them quietly .
So we 've become the horse whisperers . "

A mobile phone company which sent a letter to a customer addressed to Mr Pedo File has apologised to her .
O2 sent the letter to the home of mother - of - two Zowie Sharples , from Bolton in Greater Manchester .
Ms Sharples had taken advantage of a special offer by sending a request to O2 for new sim cards for her phone .
When they arrived in a blue O2 - branded envelope they were addressed to " Mr Pedo File " .
She took the letter to the O2 shop in Bolton town centre but said staff there were unable to help .
' Reviewing systems '
A spokeswoman for the company said : " We 've looked into Ms Sharples ' complaint and can see that an order for a free sim was placed through an advert on msn.co.uk .
" It appears this order was placed using the offending name and e-mail address along with Ms Sharples ' home address .
" We will be investigating in more detail how the order could have been place in this name .
" Thousands of O2 sim cards are ordered by new and existing O2 customers every month and , while we do have procedures in place to ensure profanity is blocked , the way the name was spelt meant this was not picked up by our system .
" We apologise for the upset this has caused and we will be reviewing our systems to prevent this happening again . "

Targeting Israeli banks will help bring an end to the occupation .
( Oren Ziv/ActiveStills )
FW
If international civil society is serious about urgently ending Israel ’s violations of Palestinian rights , including ending the occupation , then suspension of SWIFT transactions to and from Israeli banks offers an instrument to help bring about a peaceful resolution of an intractable conflict .
With computerization , international banking technology has advanced dramatically in the subsequent 20 years since the South African anti-apartheid campaign .
Although access to New York banks remains essential for foreign exchange transactions because of the role of the dollar , interbank transfer instructions are conducted through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ( SWIFT ) , which is based in Belgium .
So , instead of New York — as in the period when sanctions were applied on South Africa — Belgium is now the pressure point .
SWIFT links 8,740 financial institutions in 209 countries .
Without access to SWIFT and its interbank payment network , countries are unable either to pay for imports or to receive payment for exports .
In short , no payment — no trade .
Should it come to a point where trade sanctions are imposed on Israel , it may be able to evade them .
Instead of chasing trade sanctions - busters and plugging loopholes , it is both faster and much more effective to suspend the payment system .
The Israeli government may consider itself to be militarily and diplomatically invincible , given support from the United States , and other governments , but Israel ’s economy is exceptionally dependent upon international trade .
It is thus very vulnerable to financial retaliation .
South Africa ’s apartheid government had also believed itself to be immune from foreign pressure .
Without SWIFT , Israel ’s access to the international banking system would be crippled .
Banking is the lifeblood of any economy .
Without payment for imports or exports , the Israeli economy would quickly collapse .
The matter has gained additional urgency with the bill now before the Knesset , Israel ’s parliament , to penalize any person who promotes the imposition of boycotts against Israel .
Another important political factor is that SWIFT is not only outside American jurisdiction , it is also beyond the reach of Israeli military retaliation .
Israel has long experience in sanctions - busting since the 1948 Arab boycotts .
Apartheid South Africa was also well experienced in sanctions - busting — breaking oil embargoes was almost a “ national sport . ”
Trade sanctions are invariably full of loopholes .
Profiteering opportunities abound , as illustrated by Iraq , Cuba and numerous countries against which for many years the United States unsuccessfully has applied trade sanctions .
Iran conducts its trade through Dubai , which happily profits from the political impasse .
Suspension of bank payments plugs such loopholes , and also alters the balance of power so that meaningful negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians become even possible .
This is because banking sanctions impact quickly upon financial elites who have the clout to pressure governments to concede political change .
Trade sanctions , by contrast , impact hardest on the poor or lower - paid workers , who have virtually no political influence .
SWIFT will , however , only take action against Israeli banks if ordered to do so by a Belgian court , and then only in very exceptional circumstances .
Such very exceptional circumstances are now well - documented by the UN - commissioned Goldstone report into Israel ’s winter 2008 - 09 invasion and massacre in Gaza and by the attack on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla on 31 May 2010 .
There is also a huge body of literature from Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and other organizations detailing Israeli war crimes and violations of humanitarian law .
The Israeli government , like that of apartheid South Africa , has become a menace to the international community .
Corruption and abuses of human rights are invariably interconnected .
Israel ’s long military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip , for example , has corrupted almost every aspect of Israeli society , most especially its economy .
The Organization For Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) reported in December 2009 that the Israeli government lacks commitment in tackling international corruption and money laundering .
The international financial system is exceedingly sensitive about allegations of money laundering , but also to any associations with human rights abuses .
Organized crime and money laundering are major international security threats , as illustrated by the United States subpoena after the 11 September 2001 attacks of SWIFT data to track terrorist financing .
The website Who Profits ? ( www.whoprofits.org) lists hundreds of international and Israeli companies that illegally profiteer from the occupation .
Their operations range from construction of the “ apartheid wall ” and settlements to agricultural produce grown on confiscated Palestinian land .
As examples , Caterpillar , Volvo and Hyundai supply bulldozing equipment to demolish Palestinian homes .
British supermarkets sell fresh produce grown in the West Bank , but illegally labelled as Israeli .
Ahava markets Dead Sea mud and cosmetics .
The notorious Lev Leviev claims in Dubai that Leviev diamonds are of African origin , and are cut and polished in the United States rather than Israel .
They are sourced from Angola , Namibia and also allegedly Zimbabwe , and can rightly be described as “ blood diamonds . ”
Israeli diamond exports in 2008 were worth $ 19.4 billion , and accounted for almost 35 percent of Israeli exports .
Industrial grade diamonds are essential to Israel ’s armaments industry , and its provision of surveillance equipment to the world ’s most unsavory dictatorships .
Such profiteering depends on foreign exchange and access to the international payments system .
Hence interbank transfers are essential , and SWIFT — willingly or unwillingly — has become complicit , as were the New York banks with apartheid South Africa .
Accordingly , a credible civil society organization amongst the Palestinian diaspora should lead the SWIFT sanctions campaign against Israeli banks .
And , per the South African experience , it should be led by civil society rather than rely on governments .
Each bank has an eight letter SWIFT code that identifies both the bank and its country of domicile .
“ IL ” are the fifth and sixth letters in SWIFT codes that identify Israel .
The four major Israeli banks and their SWIFT codes are Israel Discount Bank ( IDBILIT ) , Bank Hapoalim ( POALILIT ) , Bank Leumi ( LUMIILIT ) and Bank of Israel ( ISRAILIJ ) .
Such a suspension would not affect domestic banking transactions within Israel and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip — or international transfers to Palestinian banks that have separate “ PS ” identities .
The campaign can be reversed as soon as the objectives have been achieved , and without long - term economic damage .
What is required is an urgent application in a Belgian court ordering SWIFT to reprogram its computers to suspend all transactions to and from Israeli banks until the Israeli government agrees to end the occupation of the West Bank including East Jerusalem , and that it will dismantle the “ apartheid wall ; ” the Israeli government recognizes the fundamental rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality ; and Israel recognizes , respects and promotes the rights of Palestinian refugees .
The writer is a retired banker , who advised the South African Council of Churches on the banking sanctions campaign against apartheid South Africa .
He spent October 2009 to January 2010 in East Jerusalem monitoring checkpoints , house demolitions and evictions , and liaising with Israeli peace groups .
He lives in Cape Town .
Sometimes you 're browsing around Facebook and discover the page of a random friend you had n't thought about for years .
That just happened to us , except instead of a friend it was our horrible ex-president .
George W. Bush is on Facebook !
George W. Bush currently has 36,358 fans , somehow .
His first wall post reads :
Since leaving office , President Bush has remained active .
He has visited 20 states and 8 countries ; given over 65 speeches ; launched the George W. Bush Presidential Center ; participated in 4 policy conferences through The Bush Institute ; finished the first draft of his memoir , " Decision Points " ; and partnered with President Clinton to establish the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund ...
The Washington Post says that the third - person voice suggests " the page is being maintained by someone other than the president . "
Whoever it is must have spent the entire afternoon today untagging dozens of pictures of Bush motorboating Yale coeds and chugging beer out of flower vases .

On Friday , Day 80 of the oil spill , much of the Gulf of Mexico still looked bruised and battered , just as it did the week before , and the month before that .
So for a different perspective , CNN went scuba diving .
A new CNN correspondent , Amber Lyon , and a new CNN contributor , Philippe Cousteau , wore hazardous - materials suits as they swam in the contaminated waters and tried to convey the grimy oil residue they were seeing .
The murky live shots from underneath the sea made more than a few viewers chuckle , but they were memorable , and sometimes that ’s the point .
Every long - running news story mints new television stars , even if it is sometimes awkward to acknowledge that personal success can be born of a tragic event .
Perhaps it ’s a show business twist on not letting a crisis “ go to waste . ”
Last month , Mr. Cousteau was named an ( unpaid ) contributor to CNN. com ’s blog about the oil spill , and he has been appearing regularly on the cable channel ’s news programming as well .
A grandson of the explorer Jacques Cousteau , he runs a nonprofit conservation group , and CNN gives him a bigger megaphone .
Also last month , NBC and its cable channel MSNBC hired Jeff Corwin , perhaps best known as an Animal Planet host , to beef up its environmental coverage of the oil spill .
His title is “ wildlife and science expert . ”
Some other correspondents are also well on their way to becoming household names because of their time — now measured in months — spent along the gulf .
Matt Gutman , a radio reporter for ABC News , is suddenly a high - profile reporter on television too , having filed nearly two dozen reports for ABC ’s flagship “ World News ” since mid-May , according to The Tyndall Report , which tracks the content of evening newscasts .
“ He most definitely does not have a face for radio , as the saying goes , ” said Andrew Tyndall , who compiles the report .
Lizzie O’Leary of Bloomberg Television , Mark Strassmann and Kelly Cobiella of CBS , and Steve Harrigan and Kris Gutierrez of Fox News are also among the stand - outs in the spill coverage , according to network executives .
Mr. Strassmann , for instance , has filed about 38 reports for the “ CBS Evening News ” since the spill started , according to The Tyndall Report , almost as many as he filed in the previous 12 months combined .

Drunk Driving and Other Statistics Show That We Love To Hate Drunks !
Submitted by Jason Edwards | RSS Feed | Add Comment | Bookmark Me !
Why do people love to single out certain groups of people and make their lives hell ?
I am not sure , but I can say that drunks are sure easy to pick on .
( video below ) MADD used to have on their site a statistic of less than 7 % of all car accidents " involved " drunk drivers .
They have completely removed this statistic from the site because people quickly understood that this statistic really says that at least 93 % of all accidents are caused by ( not just involving ) SOBER DRIVERS !
If you want to pick on drunks , using a statistic that makes sober driving look bad is not the way to go .
The real question to me is " which drivers CAUSED the accidents ? "
These driving statistics involve two or more cars , and two or more drivers , so let 's clarify these numbers .
100 % is everyone and If only 7 % INVOLVED drunk drivers , that means that 93 % were CAUSED BY SOBER DRIVERS - Yikes !
Let 's also think about how many of the remaining 7 % , which probably INVOLVED sober drivers too .
This means that probably 100 % of the fatal accidents INVOLVED SOBER DRIVERS !
I do n't drink and drive , but I do n't like these odds ....
People tend to get pissed off at one person ( like a drunk ) , classify that person into a group of people ( drunks ) , and then share their hate for the entire group with others .
It 's not just the drunks .
I can imagine them saying , " I hate old drivers ! " or " I hate young drivers . "
People love to share their hate it seems ...
Actually , young people get in the most driving accidents , drunk or sober .
Maybe a bunch of angry people will get together and start a site about young drivers .
It 's ridiculous to me .
You have probably seen this behavior too , eh !
Even if there is malicious intent by a driver that has injured someone , anger against everyone in their same age group or ethnicity is unjustified .
Imagine someone thinking one of these things - " He was old , she was young , he was distracted , she was drunk " - and then hating everyone in that group like " I hate all drunks " - this is simply prejudice in action .
Hey , Jesus loves drunks ... water to wine and such ...
Why can't we ?
Also , do n't think you know the facts until you actually review the NHTSA accident statistics yourself .
They reveal something completely different than is currently being reported by most websites .
Here are the real statistics for 2008 .
http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811161.PDF
See the chart on Page 3 for the age break down .
You can also clearly see that the real numbers for drunk drivers involved in fatal car accidents is 22 % .
MADD.org references this exact same information and states that 31.6 percent of the total traffic fatalities in 2008 died in drunk driving crashes .
I know these mothers are mad , but give these poor drunks a break - MADD is blaming drunks for 11 % of the deaths caused by sober drivers .
Also , if a sober driver " causes " an accident that " involves " a drunk driver , the drunk driver is the one that gets punished .
What about the sober driver that kills someone ?
Its ugly to me that our system let 's most of the people that cause accidents go becuase they are sober , so they can cause yet another accident .
And , it severely punishes drunk drivers that are n't even in an accident or driving badly .
How many sober drivers do you personally know that you think should n't have a drivers licence ?
I do n't know if you study any history , but this angry " punish the drunk " attitude is what brought on prohibition from 1920 to 1933 - the sale , manufacture , and transportation of alcohol for consumption were banned nationally as mandated in the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution .
The KKK was for it ( CLICK HERE for the WikiPedia article and poster from the Guardians of Liberty ) .
Maybe if they would have lightened up with a few beers , they would n't have earned such a bad rap today .
See the video below - imagine these drunks as KKK guys - they can't even see , so they can't have any issue with color !
Our History Of Persecuting Drunks !
Another interesting fact is that most of the Women 's Christian Temperance Union that brought us prohibition were using products that had cocaine as the featured ingredient .
Cocaine was legal at the time and although they felt that cocaine was good , they decided to punish the drinkers !
Those poor drunks !
Sure we do n't want them behind the wheel , but maybe money would be better spent on getting them safely home instead of punishing them .
Did you know that using a cell phone while driving , whether it ’s hand - held or hands - free , delays a driver 's reactions as much as having a blood alcohol concentration at the legal limit of .08 percent .
I found some more 2008 stats on Distraction .
GOV that show 16 % of all car fatalities involved driver distraction like tuning the radio or talking on a cell phone .
I guess MADD could work for this too - Mothers Against Distracted Drivers .
Hey , the stats are fairly close and the acronym works .
Why are they just picking on those poor drunks when there are so many more distracted and sober drivers out there killing people ?
I guess drunks are easier to pick on .
Its sad when I see such an accepted prejudice against the drunks .
In 2004 , the governor of VA created a 5 day mandatory jail sentence for first time drunk driving offenders , and then he opened the liquor stores on Sundays .
I had to think about it for a while - it seemed like he was exploiting the drunks at first , but then it kind of made sense .
I guess he was thinking they could drink at home instead of being forced to drive out , get drunk and then drive home on Sundays .
Northern VA made international news that year when the police were found going into bars , talking drunks into coming outside , and then arresting them for being drunk in public .
Do we hate drunks or what ?
I am just venting on my disgust at all this prejudice , but let 's end this with a video that shows the real reason we pick on drunks - this video is worth a million words !
Sakine Mohammadi Ashtiani , a 40 - year - old Iranian citizen , is facing death by stoning for allegedly having sex with two men who murdered her husband .
In a last minute effort to save their mother , her two children issued a letter to world citizens requesting they press Tehran authorities to retract the sentence .
Click here to read children 's letter
Ashtiani , a resident of Tabriz in Iran 's northwest , has been imprisoned for five years .
She was initially sentenced to 99 floggings for extra-marital sex .
Her sentenced was later changed to death by stoning in accordance with Sharia laws stipulating that punishment for adultery is death by either hanging or stoning .
In their letter , which was distributed via the internet , Fasride and Sajjad Mohamamadi Ashtiani expressed their hope that waves of protest around the world , particularly by Iranian expatriates would lead authorities to retract the brutal punishment .
" Help to prevent this nightmare from becoming reality .
Save our mother .
We are unable to explain the anguish of every moment , every second of our lives .
Words are unable to articulate our fear , " the letter stated .
It was distributed in nine languages , including Hebrew .
' No progress made '
The mother 's lawyer , Attorney Mohammad Mostafaei , said that the sentence is scheduled to be implemented soon and noted he recently met with his client and spoke to her about the punishment .
" She is naturally in poor spirits .
Whoever faces a death sentence goes crazy in a situation such as this . "
The lawyer expressed hope that international pressure and appeals for a pardon would help rescue Ashtiani .
" Unfortunately , no progress has been thus made .
I hope the letters sent to the judicial authority would help and she will receive a pardon , " he said .
Iran 's penal law stipulates that women sentenced to stoning are buried up to their chest and then pelted with small stones until they die .
The law forbids the use of stones which may cause instant death .
I have had a few people email me recently asking about great free ways for creating graphics for websites , so I ’m going to tell you about the best free graphics tool , which a friend of mine recently put me onto .
The tool is called Pixlr , and it is an online tool that requires no installation at all and is not that difficult to use either .
I think it ’s a great way to crop images , and create website header graphics and all sorts of other things that are needed when you are building an online business .
Now I ’m no graphic design whiz by any stretch of the imagination , but I have used a number of free graphics tool over the years when working on my sites , and this one seems to be the easier to use .
Below is a screen shot for you :
( Click here for Pixlr )
It pretty much has most of the functions of expensive graphics programs like Photoshop , and for what most internet marketers need this little thing is perfect .
I like to have graphics in my posts on this affiliate marketing blog as much as possible to bring it alive , and I also use advertising banners in my affiliates websites too .
However sometimes I find that merchants do n’t have banners to use , for whatever reason , so this is where creating graphics for websites can come in handy , and using a free tool like Pixlr .
That ’s all from me , just wanted to pass on another great free tool that I am getting use out of .
Enjoy !

Forget the clone stamp , paint bucket and pattern presets .
When it comes to creating patterns , the ability to duplicate a layer is one of Photoshop ’s greatest features .
Semitransparent shapes can be very useful when creating repeated geometric “ textures ” of color and form .
They ’re easy to create , fun to play with and best of all , they can be uniquely yours .
In searching for interesting patterns , designers sometimes pass over basic shapes in favor of more complex geometrics .
But simpler is often better .
The trick is to pay attention more to how shapes interact than to how a shape looks on its own .
The concepts are simple :
As translucent shapes overlap , they create new shapes .
Complex patterns emerge from apparently simple origins ; and just like in a poem ( a haiku , for example ) , there ’s room for variation within the prescribed form .
Unfortunately , it ’s easier to make a mess than a purposeful design .
The trick is to identify which subtle changes might have consequences later .
One Origin , Many Destinations
When creating patterns that use opacity or blend modes , starting simple is best .
The pattern above was created with one circle in one layer .
Here ’s the process :
Set a circle ( colored # 4184de in this diagram ) to 50 % opacity .
Hold down the Option ( Mac ) or Alt ( Windows ) key while using Photoshop ’s Move tool .
The layer will be copied as the cursor drags .
Their combined opacity will darken in the places where they overlap .
Option + drag ( Mac ) or Alt + drag ( Windows ) both circles down and to the left — far enough to leave a white gap between each of the copies .
When repeated , a pattern appears .
Patterns emerge from the way shapes overlap as well as from the shapes themselves .
Clarity comes from simplicity : a pattern that begins simply looks better in the end .
The circle in our last example can be used to create many patterns , including these :
Each of these patterns was created with the same size of blue circles .
Incredible variations in texture are possible with the simplest of changes ; position , opacity and blend mode were the only changes made in the examples above .
But “ simple ” does n’t always mean “ easy . ”
Blend Modes
For pattern - making , 5 of Photoshop ’s 25 blend modes stand out : normal , soft light , hard light , overlay and difference .
When people think of complicated layer blends , “ normal ” rarely springs to mind , but its straightforward nature makes it the easiest to work with .
“ Normal ” mode is the default setting , and it mainly has to do with the opacity settings of the layers .
The colors of shapes and backgrounds blend according to their strengths .
Normal could also be called the “ blending ” blend for its tendency to find average colors between the subject ( a circle in the example above ) and the items below it .
Hard light multiplies shadows and screens highlights .
Layers set to “ Hard Light , ” as in the diagram above , tend to tint everything underneath , which amplifies their original hue and saturation .
If the layer contains dark colors , the layers below tend to get darker , and vice versa .
Soft light screens highlights and multiplies shadows without changing the blend color ’s luminosity .
It works best when the underlying colors are neutral or have low saturation .
Layers set to “ Soft Light ” have little impact against black and white , as shown above , but work well over pale blue and gray .
Overlay strengthens colors below a layer and changes hues to match its own .
Layers set to “ Overlay ” ( example above ) are brighter than when in “ Soft Light ” mode but still do n’t affect rich black and pure white .
Difference is the least predictable blend mode .
Layers in this mode generally invert tones in the layers below : lights become darks and darks become lights .
Hues , however , become their opposite on the 360° color wheel : reds become cyans , greens become magentas and blues become yellows .
The effect will vary depending on the colors and shades below whichever layer is set to “ Difference ” mode .
Above , a layer set to “ Difference ” mode over a white background completely inverts its colors .
The same layer over a 50 % gray background changes its hues 90° and muddies its tones .
Over black , the “ Difference ” layer appears to have stayed the same .
Here ’s how they work .
Pattern - Making , Step By Step
As a simple example , we ’ll create a pattern based on circles .
Regardless of shape , there are four steps : create a shape on a layer , give it a certain opacity and blend mode , experiment with a few copies , and mass - produce the pattern .
Step 1
Create a vector object with the Ellipse tool .
Set the layer ’s blend mode to “ Hard Light . ”
Although any size and color will do , this example uses a 134×134 - pixel circle , colored # 575 fdf .
An image size of 600×600 pixels is a good place to start .
Step 2
Duplicate the layer with Command + J ( Mac ) or Control + J ( Windows ) or Layer → Duplicate Layer .
Drag the copied layer to the right , to half of the circle ’s width .
Alternatively , hold down the Option key ( Mac ) or Alt key ( Windows ) while using the Move tool .
This will duplicate the layer as you drag .
Make at least two copies .
In this example , each new layer touches the center of the previous layer .
As a result , the other layers will barely touch one another .
Step 3
Select the first two layers and drag down the width of one - half circle .
This is the same principle as step two , but down instead of to the right .
When all layers share the same color , opacity and blend mode , you can create a repeating pattern simply by duplicating the layers in any order — or any direction .
Step 4
Repeat as desired .
Initial Decisions Affect the Outcome
The beginning is critical when creating patterns , because duplicating layers amplifies mistakes .
The more copied layers there are , the more tedious fixing problems will be .
For example , let ’s say you decide to change every layer ’s opacity from 50 % to 30 % .
That ’s one change per layer — and you can expect dozens , if not hundreds , of layers in a reasonably sized pattern .
And what a change a few percent can make !
Each pattern above uses the same blend mode ( “ Difference ” ) , same shape , same color and same placement , but different opacity .
If you do n’t want to create an action , then you ’ll have to change the blend modes and opacities one layer at a time .
Photoshop has a few shortcuts to expedite the changes :
When the Move tool or any selection tool is active , the numbers 0 to 9 changes a layer ’s opacity .
Type 1 for 10 % opacity , 4 for 40 % opacity , etc .
Typing 0 sets the layer ’s opacity to 100 % .
This shortcut for both Mac and Windows works on just one layer at a time .
When the Move tool or any selection tool is active , you can quickly change a layer ’s blend mode with these key combinations :
Mac Windows Blend mode Option +
Shift + N Alt +
Shift + N Normal Option +
Shift + H Alt +
Shift + H Hard Light Option +
Shift + S Alt +
Shift + S Soft Light Option +
Shift + O Alt +
Shift + O Overlay Option +
Shift + E Alt +
Shift + E Difference
Duplicate any single layer with Command + J ( Mac ) or Control + J ( Windows ) .
Possibilities
“ Keep it simple ” is n’t just a refrain : it ’s a requirement .
These examples were all created with the same shape , one or two colors and blend mode changes .
Yet the variations seem unlimited :

A Kemptville woman can't believe the federal government wo n't allow white people to apply for an administrative assistant job with Citizenship and Immigration Canada .
Sara Landriault found the job posting while she was doing a job hunt online .
Although she felt she was qualified for the job , she was blocked from submitting her resume because she was not an aboriginal or visible minority .
" This one was pretty close to my criteria , so I thought I would just try it out , " Landriault told CTV Ottawa on Wednesday .
The application required Landriault to indicate if she was white , aboriginal or a visible minority .
When she indicated that she was white , she could not proceed any further .
" It stopped dead .
‘ You do not meet the criteria , ' and it gave me a list of what the criteria was if you were non-white Latino , if you were non-white this , or if you were visible minority or aboriginal you could apply . "
Government response
Citizenship and Immigration Canada did not respond to CTV Ottawa 's request for an interview .
However , CTV did speak to the Public Service Commission of Canada , which overseas more than 20,000 federal government hires .
The agency says job postings exclusively for aboriginals or visible minorities make up about one per cent of all jobs available .
" We want to target some competitions where we specifically attract these equity groups , " said Paula Green of the Public Service Commission of Canada .
She added there are plenty of other opportunities for candidates like Landriault .
Strong language
Still , a University of Ottawa law professor says the language in the job posting Landriault found is stronger than she 's seen in the past .
" If the public service and federal government paid more attention to the requirement of this act before , maybe now they would n't be in the position to put a bit of pressure , " said Lucie Lamarche .
Regardless , Landriault says she 'd rather give up the perks of a government job than work for an employer that does n't see her rights as equal .

Kaypro 2
See below for specifications and information on this system .
Specifications and information
Key Dates : Announced 1981 ?
Original Price : $ 1595 in 1982 CPU : Zilog Z - 80A Memory : 64K RAM Operating System : CP / M Display : 80 characters by 24 lines , text only Input / Output : Dual internal 5 1/4 " 191 K floppy disk drives ; serial port ; detachable keyboard ; built - in 9 " green monochrome monitor Bus : None Other Items in Collection : Documentation ; CP / M system disks Items Needed : Bundled software
The Kaypro 2 was a more rugged , metal cased alternative to ( clone of ) the Osborne 1 , and had a larger monitor to boot .
For those looking for more storage , the Kaypro 4 offered the same machine with 394K floppy disk drives .
A version with an internal hard disk was the Kaypro 10 .
Here 's an early 1982 magazine ad announcing the Kaypro II :
Return to Computer Index
In the Haskell community , there are several topics of discussion that keep coming up over and over again in terms of dealing with the hierarchies in our code .
Some of these topics are :
Fixing the Functor ⇒ Applicative ⇒ Monad class hierarchy ( however you want to structure it ) ;
⇒ ⇒ class hierarchy ( however you want to structure it ) ;
The best way to define and use monad transformers ;
Making Functor more relevant ; taken to the extreme by the “ Caleskell ” definitions used by lambdabot on IRC , where it seems almost everything can be expressed in terms of fmap .
Now , I think this kind of discussion is an indication of good health in the Haskell community where we are doing our best to determine what the optimal solution to these problems are ( rather than just giving up or being dictated to by a single individual ) .
However , something I ’ve come to realise recently is that in my understanding these discussions are mainly oriented at what the best way to abstract how we write code rather than how we use the data structures that make up the code .
Hence , the topic of this blog post .
My Goal
What I want to discuss here is the concept of how we can best define class hierarchies that let us easily interchange our data structures .
The purpose of this is that currently , if I write some code using a list as my underlying data structure and then decide that a Sequence would be a better fit because I do a lot of appends , I have to re-write every single bit of my code that knows about that particular data structure .
However , I would much prefer to just have to change a few top - level type signatures and maybe some list - specific items in my code and then the magic of type classes would take care of the rest .
Avoiding Duplication
The main focus of when such a hierarchy would be useful is when writing libraries : duplication is avoided by having to write a list - specific , a Sequence - specific and a Set - specific version of a function ( e.g. to test if the data structure in question has at least two of the provided values ) .
More than that : often times we are constrained in terms of how we use libraries by what data - type the library author preferred at the time of writing .
A library function may require and then return a list , whereas we ’re using Sets everywhere else .
If there is no pressing reason to use a list rather than a Set , then why should it ?
Is such a hierarchy already available ?
There are some previous attempts at something like this , including ( but not limited to ) :
Functor +
Foldable +
Traversable ; this approach can’t deal with structures such as Sets as they require an extra restriction on the parametric type .
Edison can cope with Set , etc. and has a nice hierarchy between the individual sub-classes ( if anything it has too many sub-classes ) , but is used by very few packages and has what I consider to be a few warts , such as explicitly re-exporting the data types in question in new modules , and some methods ( such as strict ) that really belong elsewhere .
, etc. and has a nice hierarchy between the individual sub-classes ( if anything it has too many sub-classes ) , but is used by very few packages and has what I consider to be a few warts , such as explicitly re-exporting the data types in question in new modules , and some methods ( such as ) that really belong elsewhere .
collections seemed to have been another attempt at this , but never seemed to have built on any version of GHC since 6.8 .
When you only want to consider structures with a linear structure , ListLike is available .
However , it seems to be possibly over - busy .
Even more specialised than ListLike is IsString , the point of which is to be able to use string literals in Haskell code to define Bytestrings , etc .
The closest viable class / library to my ideal listed above would be a cross between Edison and ListLike ; the former has an actual class hierarchy ( to avoid duplication , etc. ; ) whereas the latter seems to be used more in actual practice .
My point here about a class hierarchy is this : in most aspects , any sequence ( or “ ListLike ” data structure ) can be considered a really inefficient generic collection / set : you still want to have a function to test for membership , you want to be able to add values , to know how many there are , etc .
As such , definitions should be as high up in the hierarchy as possible to let functions that use them be as generic as possible in terms of their type signatures .
The Joker in the deck
There is one conflicting issue in any such hierarchy : mapping .
Ideally , we would n’t want to require that instances of these types have kind * -> * ( so that we can for instance [ pun not intended ] make Bytestring an instance of these classes with a “ value type ” of Word8 ) .
However , as soon as we do that we can no longer specify a map function nicely .
ListLike gets around this by defining a map function that does n’t constrain the data structure type .
This means that it ’s possible to write map succ with a type of ByteString -> [ Word8 ] .
Whilst this might be handy at times , it also provides possible type - matching problems if your overall definition when using them does n’t force them to be the same ( e.g. : print $ map ( * 2 ) [ 1,2,3,4 ] ) , and that in essence this definition of map does a complete fold over the data structure , whereas there may be more efficient versions if we can somehow specify at the type level that it must be constrained to the same data structure .
However , the problem is that technically [ Int ] and [ Char ] are two completely separate data types ; as such , any map between them will require going from one type to another ( since we ’re not assuming kind * -> * here ) .
It is possible to get around this , but it ’s pretty ugly :
{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses , FunctionalDependencies , FlexibleInstances #-} class Collection c a | c -> a where cons :: a -> c -> c class ( Collection ( c a ) a ) => MappableCollection c a where cmap :: ( MappableCollection c b ) => ( a -> b ) -> c a -> c b instance Collection [ a ] a where cons = ( :) instance MappableCollection [ ] a where cmap = map
In essence , the whole point of the MappableCollection class is to force the Collection instance back into having to kind * -> * .
It might be better just having Collection use ListLike ’s rigidMap and then leave “ normal ” mapping up to Functor or RFunctor ( which works better with the whole “ class hierarchy ” concept ) .
It ’s just a shame that there ’s no way of having mapping work regardless of the kind of the data type .
So , what are you going to do about this ?
I ’m going to make a stab at yet - another - collection - class - hierarchy this weekend at AusHac .
I ’m not sure how far we ’ll get , but I ’ll see .
Graph Hierarchies
My interest in data structure hierarchies came out my frustration at the lack of a common reference point for graph data types .
Developing a base hierarchy is going to be my main focus at AusHac ( the collections classes are aimed at being used within this graph library ) .
My current plans look something like this ( note that this does n’t include extra packages providing specific instances , such as “ vector - graph ” or something ) :
That is , the actual “ graph ” library will also cater for other graph - like data structures , such as Cabal ’s Package Index type .
FGL ( both the old and the “ new ” version , whatever it ’ll be called ) will then extend these classes to provide the notion of inductive graphs ; anything that is n’t directly related to the notion of inductive graphs will be shifted down to this notion of “ generic graphs ” .
In terms of terminology , to ease the transition I ’m probably going to stick to current FGL - nomenclature for the most part ( unless there ’s something horribly wrong / bad about it ) .
So we ’re still going to talk about Nodes rather than Vertices , etc .
Old FGL
As I intimated in the extended announcement for fgl - 5.4.2.3 , apart from bug - fixes we ’re not going to work on the current 5.4 branch .
The 5.5 branch will be developed so as to use the generic graph classes once I ’ve got them sorted out , and then that will probably be the end of it .
New FGL
Now , this has become a rather hot topic : should a rewrite of FGL still be called FGL ?
I ’ve covered this earlier , but I have now created a survey to try and find out what the community thinks it should be called ( I did want an “ other ” option in the first drop - down menu , but Google Docs would n’t let me 😦 ) .
Updated Firefox users are howling that a widely - used browser add - on designed to protect them from unwanted cookie tracking has been automatically updated with what they see as overly intrusive " bloatware " .
On June 14 , after it was acquired by a software outfit known as Abine , a new version of the TACO behavioral - ad–blocking add - on was pushed out via Mozilla 's auto - update process — which means it has received Mozilla 's approval — and an army of users are complaining of a kind of privacy add - on bait - and - switch .
" Despicably evil move guys .
Using the trusted update path to stealthily ' update ' to a bloatware shareware suite is just evil .
Now I have to completely blow away this profile and reinstall all my TRUSTED extensions , " says one reviewer .
" See how easy it is to lose trust .
* snapofthefingers * gone . "
Speaking with The Reg , Abine has defended the upgrade , saying that Mozilla asks users for their approval before downloading the new add - on and that although the add - on installs a host of new tools , any unrelated to TACO 's original cookie management mission are turned off by default .
" That 's why we think of it as a legitimate upgrade , " co-founder and CEO Eugene Kuznetsov tells The Reg .
" You need [ Abine 's additional cookie management tools ] to maintain the level of privacy TACO gave to a year ago .
Behavioral ad networks are always adding new tools and you need new tools to stop them . "
A Mozilla spokeswoman said : " TACO changed owners , and the new owners changed the add - on radically .
It still provides the same core functionality , but the user interface is very different and there are a large number of extra features and privacy tools .
The add - on update was approved by Mozilla .
It is safe for users and follows our policies set forth in our Add - on Review Process . "
You can peruse the process here .
Abined TACO
In March of last year , after Google rolled out its interest - based advertising behavioral ad targeting operation , privacy researcher Christopher Soghoian offered up a Firefox plug - in that opted you out of not only Google 's behavioral ad system , but countless others across the web .
He called it the Targeted Advertising Cookie Opt - Out project — TACO , for short .
Google was offering its own opt - out plug - in , but this was limited to the company 's own tracking .
So Soghoian modified the code — Google had released it under an Apache 2.0 license — to handle other networks as well .
At the time , TACO blocked behavioral ad cookies from twenty - seven separate networks , and this has since grown to over 100 .
It was a sliver of an add - on — about 8 K .
But this week , it expanded to a whopping 3MB .
Soghoian recently sold TACO to Abine , a software outfit based in Boston , and on Monday , Abine rolled out a new version of TACO that 's bundled with a host of additional software tools designed to protect your privacy .
It also adds a pair of buttons to your browser chrome , and it includes a pop-up interface that appears every time you visit a new site .
Several of the Abine tools installed with the new add - on are turned off by default , and you can turn off the pop -up interface .
But dozens of users , including Reg readers and posters on the add - on 's Mozilla page , are howling that they 've been duped .
" What ethics of a company that take this insidious approach to push their product to the numerous Firefox users out there ? " says one Reg reader .
" A nearly 3 Mb slow - as - treacle monster is n't quite the same thing as 8 K of write - locked cookies . "
This reader has now erased the add - on from his machine , accusing Mozilla of un-Jobsian behavior .
" There 's a lesson to be learned here .
Two in fact .
The first is , I bet the App Store would n't have let this fly < smirk > and ... be careful who you trust . "
But Abine is backing the beefed - up add - on , saying that although TACO 3.0 does install several other Abine tools , only tools related to cookie management are turned on by default .
TACO 3.0 , for instance , automatically blocks Flash cookies and various JavaScript web bugs as well as permanently setting generic , non-personally identifiable opt - out cookies for more than 100 behavioral ad networks .
It also includes myriad other tools — including a log-ins and passwords manager , a web identities manager , a safe email and phone client , a payments app for securely storing credits cards — but Abine 's Kuznetsov defends the inclusion of these apps because they 're not activated .
TACO 3.0 is tagged as a beta .
But Kuznetsov says the beta tag only applies to the tools that are turned off by default .
That said , there is a bit of a glitch in the suite 's main UI .
Kuznetsov had told us that with this UI , we could turn off the suite 's pop-interface — which appear every time you visit a new site , describing what ad networks and cookies are in use .
But on the version of the add - on we tested , this is n't the case .
You can , however , turn off the pop -up interface from a " Hide this window ? " link that appears on the pop -up itself .
" There are glitches in the software , " Kuznetsov says .
" And we apologize for that . "
He says that much of the add - on's 3MB is taken up by encryption tools , and that the company is " working to " reduce its size .
During anecdotal testing at The Reg , the add - on does seem to slow Firefox considerably .
Abined TACO pop-up
Kuznetsov says that he's aware of the complaints over the new TACO and that he 's reached out to several users to address their concerns .
On Mozilla 's add - on site , the new plug - in has received more than 60 reviews and almost all involved vehement complaints .
" TACO is BADWARE ! " says another reviewer .
" I can't think of any reason why someone should give TACO a try and am recommending that it be avoided completely .
Prior version was ok ; update is a deliberately malicious social engineering attack to a current version that is : Garbage .
Garbage .
GARBAGE ! "
Some have accused the new add - on of being " spyware " .
But Kuznetsov says that it collects no user information , and Christopher Soghoian tells
The Reg that when he sold the add - on to Abine , he received written assurances that it would not do so .
But Soghoian understands the other complaints .
" People are pretty pissed about this , and they have a right to be . "
Amidst the howls , one user has forked the TACO project again , offering an Abine - free version known as Beef TACO .
" That shows the power of open source , " Soghoian says .
" If you do n't like something , you can change it . " ®
Update :
This story has been updated with comment from Mozilla .
Turkey 's prime minister rounded passionately on Israel today , demanding that the Netanyahu government be punished for the attack on the Gaza flotilla , and accusing it of massacre , lies , and destroying all prospects of peace in the Middle East .
" Israel cannot clean the blood off its hands through any excuse , " said Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
" It is no longer possible to cover up or ignore Israel 's lawlessness .
This bloody massacre by Israel on ships that were taking humanitarian aid to Gaza deserves every kind of curse . "
The trenchant warnings , in remarks to the Turkish parliament and cabinet in Ankara after Erdogan rushed home from a truncated Latin America tour , suggested the " special " relationship between Israel and the rising Muslim power straddling the Middle East and Europe is dead .
Turkish analysts viewed the flotilla attack as a tipping point in the balance of power in the Middle East , with Israel finally forfeiting its " strategic " links with an emerging regional power .
Relations between Turkey and Israel , close for decades , have been under strain since early last year when the Israeli onslaught on Gaza left 1,400 people dead .
Erdogan felt personally betrayed by the Israeli invasion .
The flotilla attack looks like the final straw , ending a period of almost 20 years when Turkey played a crucial role as Israel 's Muslim ally , discreetly seeking to mediate between Israel and its Arab foes , and acting as an American proxy in places where Washington hesitated to go .
" Today is a turning point , " said the prime minister to repeated applause in Ankara .
" They once again showed their ability to perpetrate slaughters … We warn Israel not to test Turkey 's patience . "
Israel had to " absolutely be punished by all means , " he said .
Erdogan tapped the strong emotions erupting in Turkey where support for the Palestinians is total , but where the elite has also traditionally maintained good relations with Israel .
The Israeli attack was on a Turkish boat .
Most of the dead were Turks .
The flotilla was organised by a large Islamist charity based in a region of Istanbul which is militantly Muslim .
The charity is said to be close to Erdogan 's governing AK party .
" Any establishment in Turkey , including the army , will not be able to explain any kind of co-operation with Israel to the public .
This interception killed the possibility of working together on any subject , " Ihsan Dagi , an analyst at the Middle East Technical University , told the Zaman daily newspaper .
Beneath the wave of popular revulsion and anger at the Israeli attack , the government is pursuing a highly dynamic foreign policy enhancing its growing clout across the region .
" Blood has been spilt .
This is eye - popping , " said Hugh Pope , Turkey and Middle East analyst at the International Crisis Group in Istanbul .
" We 're moving into a new era . "
The chill in relations with Israel started in January last year with the assault on Gaza .
A few days before the invasion , Ehud Olmert , then Israeli prime minister , was sitting in Ankara at Erdogan 's residence .
The Turkish leader felt stabbed in the back .
In Davos in Switzerland , Erdogan stormed out of a debate with Israel 's president .
Shimon Peres , saying : " They know well how to kill . "
Last year Ankara cancelled major military exercises with Israel .
Things deteriorated further this year when Israel 's deputy foreign minister , Danny Ayalon , humiliated the Turkish ambassador by deliberately placing him in a low seat and upbraiding him about a soap opera on Turkish TV in front of cameras .
Ayalon told the cameramen it was important that people saw the ambassador lower " while we 're up high " .
Some prominent Turks saw the flotilla attack as deliberately targeted at Ankara .
" A message was to be delivered to Turkey when armed force was applied although there was no need for it .
The message here was to make sure that Turkey is taught a lesson , " wrote Mehmet Ali Birand , a prominent commentator .
" This incident will ignite our tense relationship .
There is no way of fixing it .
From now on we wo n't be able to speak of a Turkish - Israeli alliance .
Yes Turkey will be hurt , but Israel even more .
The bill for losing an ally like Turkey will be very heavy . "
Ankara recently set down a marker as a key regional player by surprising the Americans with the announcement of a nuclear fuel processing deal with Iran and Brazil , extending its influence on one of the Middle East 's biggest crises – the Iranian nuclear issue .
" Erdogan is making a big play to become the leader of the Islamic street .
The Egyptians are not happy .
We need to watch this dynamic very closely , " said a senior European diplomat .
A New South Wales policeman has appealed for his job back after being fired for attaching a bottle - opener to his penis piercing during a Christmas party .
Sergeant Andrew Lawrance opened a beverage with the attachment in front of fellow policemen and their wives at Tommy 's Chinese Restaurant in Yamba , The Sydney Morning Herald reports .
Lawrance admitted that his actions were " inappropriate " and said : " I kicked myself [ later ] because something that was meant to be fun turned out to be a lot more serious than that . "
He revealed that he had performed his " party trick " four times since 2002 , but always in " closed company " .
He claimed that the complainant in the most recent case was someone not at the event who was " not fond " of him .
Lawrance 's lawyer Patricia Lowson asked the commission to order a review of the case , arguing that the dismissal was " harsh " and maybe also " unreasonable " .
Commissioner Andrew Scipione said that he has lost confidence in Lawrance and wants him removed from the force .
Lawrance now works part - time in a bottle shop .
The case continues .

The British Medical Association in its annual meeting has said that gay cure therapies are harmful .
Over two - thirds of doctors in the meeting supported the rejection of gay treatments .
The doctors have said that the Royal College of Psychiatrists and other mental health standard setting bodies should ban such treatments .
The Association has also said that all the health departments should examine the cases of conversion therapy , which are funded by the NHS .
A research , which was published last year , revealed that a sixth of registered British therapist and psychiatrists have tried to treat the homosexuality patients .
" Sexuality is such a fundamental part of who a person is that attempts to change it just result in significant confusion , depression and even suicide ” , said Tom Dolphin .
Tom proposed this motion .
On the other hand , Gareth Payne , a Cardiff Consultant Neurophysiologist has said that it cannot be proved that this conversion therapy is harmful for the people .
He said that for a doctor , it is important to respect the requests of his patients .
This motion was stated , earlier this year , when gay journalist , Patrick Strudwick brought in light a list of therapists , who were exercising this treatment .
Hen Wallow Falls
Trail Features : Waterfalls
Trail Location : Cosby Roundtrip Length : 4.4 Miles Total Elevation Gain : 900 Feet Avg. Elev Gain / Mile : 409 Feet Highest Elevation : 2923 Feet Trail Difficulty Rating : 6.20 ( moderate ) Parking Lot Latitude 35.75719 Parking Lot Longitude - 83.20872
Directions to Trailhead :
The hike to Hen Wallow Falls in the Great Smoky Mountains begins from the Gabes Mountain Trailhead in Cosby .
To reach the trailhead from the junction of 441 and 321 in Gatlinburg ( Light 3 ) , turn to travel eastbound on 321/73 , and drive 18.2 miles until the road dead - ends into Hwy 32 .
Turn right here towards Cosby , and drive 1.2 miles to the park entrance .
Turn right into the park and drive another 2 miles to the Gabes Mountain Trailhead .
The trailhead is on the right side of the road , but the large parking area , located in the Cosby Picnic Area , is across the street .
Hen Wallow Falls is located off the Gabes Mountain Trail .
Trail Description :
Almost from the start the trail begins to make a steady climb up the northern flank of Snake Den Mountain .
While ascending the Gabes Mountain Trail , which was once known as the Messer Trail , the roots and rocks will testify just how rough this route can be in some places .
Although rugged , the trail passes through a beautiful lush - green forest of rhododendron and ferns , with eastern hemlocks and yellow poplars providing a nice overhead canopy .
After walking a short distance Rock Creek will appear on your right .
Soon after you 'll pass the side trail that leads to the Cosby Campground , almost four - tenths of a mile from the trailhead .
Shortly thereafter the trail crosses over Rock Creek .
At roughly seven - tenths of a mile you 'll pass a social trail that leads off to your right .
Continue going straight here .
Roughly 1 mile from the trailhead hikers will reach Messer Gap .
There 's another faint side trail on your right here , that supposedly leads to an old grave site .
To continue on towards the falls , hikers should proceed straight ahead .
Just past this junction look towards your left and you 'll see the remnants of an old rock wall from an old homestead .
At 2.1 miles hikers will reach the short ( and somewhat steep ) side trail that leads down to the base of the 90 - foot Hen Wallow Falls .
Although Hen Wallow Creek is only two feet wide at the top of the falls , it fans out to almost 20 feet at the base .
We were fortunate to have visited the falls after quite a bit of rain .
During the drier seasons water flowing over the rock cliff can be fairly low .
If you 're looking to go home with some great photographs of the falls you might be better off avoiding this hike during mid-day , as the sun will be directly in your eyes , as well as your viewfinder .
Be sure to check out the small cave in the ridge just off to the right side of the falls .
Border Ranges National Park in New South Wales , Australia – pulling its weight ?
( Image : Altrendo Travel / Getty )
To best protect threatened plants , inefficient national parks should be sold off and the proceeds used to buy more cost - effective ones .
So says Richard Fuller at the University of Queensland in St Lucia , Australia , who reckons that replacing 1 per cent of Australia ’s protected areas could significantly increase the number of vegetation types – such as grasses and woodlands – being protected .
Worldwide , there are 100,000 regions dedicated to biodiversity maintenance , covering 12 per cent of countries ’ land and territorial waters .

“ Historically , a lot of these areas were designated because we could n’t use them for economic or agriculture purposes , not for their biodiversity value , ” says Fuller .
“ Consequently , many species and habitats remain inadequately protected . ”
In some of the world ’s protected areas , for example , up to 83 per cent of threatened plants are found outside protected areas .
Fuller says environmentalists who try only to increase the number of protected sites are effectively “ adding to an inefficient system ” .
Instead , he says , governments should sell off expensive land of low conservation value and buy new sites instead .
Cutting up Australia
Fuller ’s team has developed a mathematical model to test their theory in Australia .
The group divided the country ’s landmass into around 65,000 sections before assigning each a “ conservation value ” based on the rarity of the vegetation type within it : higher values were given to areas where more native vegetation has been lost since 1750 , when Europeans began widespread clearance .
They then divided each section ’s conservation value by its financial value , enabling them to rank currently protected areas in terms of cost - effectiveness .
In the model , the least cost - effective areas were sold off and the funds used to buy more cost - effective sites .
For a vegetation type to be considered as “ protected ” in the team ’s model , 15 per cent of the land area it covered in 1750 must lie in protected areas .
Currently , only 18 out of 60 Australian vegetation types are protected by this measure .
Replacing just 1 per cent of the least cost - effective areas boosted the number to 54 .
“ We get an enormous increase in efficiency without spending more money , ” says Fuller .
Starting debate
“ It ’s a logical approach with obvious benefits for protected biodiversity , ” says Jon Nevill , an environmental consultant in Hampton , Victoria , Australia .
“ But I have no confidence that governments could effectively manage such a difficult programme . ”
Martin Taylor , a protected areas policy manager at environmental campaign group WWF - Australia , is less complimentary .
He says the idea of “ trading off protected areas to buy theoretically better ones ” is “ quite horrifying ” .
Sacrificing a protected area based solely on vegetation types without consideration of native animals or local geography is troublesome , he says .
“ No area can be written off so lightly as these authors do . ”
Fuller defends his approach , saying the study is just a demonstration .
“ If this idea was to be put into practice you would need to consider these other values . ”
“ All we wanted to do was show how significantly and quickly the gains could be made , ” says Fuller .
“ We wanted to start a debate about how best to protect our environment . ”

According to web analytics company StatCounter , Microsoft 's Internet Explorer 6 is now truly a relic of the past with less than 5 % of market share in the U.S. and Europe .
For years , IE6 caused headaches for developers and prompted many users to switch to alternative browsers .
It was full of security holes and it broke nearly every web standard in the book .
Since it was the default browser on many Windows machines , it was also the dominant browser in the early aughts , reaching 90 % market share in 2002 and 2003 .
Unfortunately , it outstayed its welcome by a good five years , keeping a solid chunk of the market even after Internet Explorer 7 and 8 were released .
Now , based on an analysis of 15 billion page views in May 2010 , StatCounter 's numbers indicate that IE6 usage in the U.S. has fallen to 4.7 % from 11.5 % in the last 12 months , meaning that IE6 is finally becoming a footnote in the history of the Internet .
As far as other web browsers go , IE8 holds 30.49 % market share in the U.S. , followed by Firefox 3.6 with 19.85 % and IE7 with 16.64 % market share .
I began a series of interviews with Mordechai Vanunu in 2005 and have met with him on all 7 of my trips to Jerusalem .
Why Israel Persists to Persecute Mordechai Vanunu :
Begins on 24 April 2004 , which was three days after Mordechai Vanunu was released from 18 years in a windowless tomb sized cell jail for providing the photographic proof and telling the truth about Israel ’s clandestine seven story underground WMD Program in the Negev , as Uri Avnery wrote :
“ Everybody understands that he has no more secrets .
What can a technician know after 18 years in jail , during which technology has advanced with giant steps ?
“ But gradually it becomes clear what the security establishment is really afraid of .
Vanunu is in a position to expose the close partnership with the United States in the development of Israel ’s nuclear armaments .
“ This worries Washington so much , that the man responsible in the State Department for ‘ arms control ’ , Under - Secretary John Bolton , has come to Israel in person for the occasion .
Vanunu , it appears , can cause severe damage to the mighty super - power .
“ The Americans , it seems , are very worried .
The Israeli security services have to dance to their tune .
The world must be prevented by all available means from hearing , from the lips of a credible witness , that the Americans are full partners in Israel ’s nuclear arms program , while pretending to be the world ’s sheriff for the prevention of nuclear proliferation . ”

A brief history since then :
On April 30 , 2007 , the Jerusalem Magistrate ’s Court , convicted Vanunu on 14 [ out of 21 ] counts of violating a court order prohibiting him from speaking to foreign journalists in 2004 .
Vanunu was also convicted for traveling the four miles from Jerusalem to Bethlehem when he hoped to attend Christmas Eve mass at the Church of the Nativity , his first Christmas after being released from 18 years in jail [ most of it in solitary ] on April 21 , 2004 .
On July 2 , 2007 , Israel sentenced Vanunu to six more months in jail for speaking to foreign media in 2004 .
On September 23 , 2008 , the Jerusalem District Court reduced Vanunu ’s six - month jail sentence for speaking with foreign media in 2004 , to three months , “ In light of his ailing health and the absence of claims that his actions put the country ’s security in jeopardy . ”
After appealing that sentence , the Israeli Supreme Court returned Vanunu to jail on May 23 , 2010 , after they refused his counter - offer to do three - months of community service in Arab east Jerusalem , the only community he has known since 21 April 2004 .
The Court insisted Vanunu must serve in west Jerusalem , which is 99 % Jewish - populated , but Vanunu feared attack there by angry Israelis , most of whom consider him a traitor .
On 18 June 2010 , Malcolm Smart , Director of Amnesty International ’s Middle East Programme stated :
“ Mordechai Vanunu should not be in prison at all , let alone be held in solitary confinement in a unit intended for violent criminals .
He suffered immensely when he was held in solitary confinement for 11 years after his imprisonment in 1986 and to return him to such conditions now is nothing less than cruel , inhuman or degrading .
Mordechai Vanunu is a prisoner of conscience .
The prison authorities might claim that he has been put in isolation to protect him from the risk of attack by other inmates , but if the Israeli government is really concerned for his safety it should release him without delay .
His re-imprisonment is both harsh and unjustified .
The restrictions on Mordechai Vanunu arbitrarily limit his rights to freedom of movement , expression and association and are therefore in breach of international law .
They should be lifted and he should be allowed to start his life again as a free man . ”
The restrictions that have subjected Vanunu to 24/7 surveillance [ his movements , phone calls and emails ] for the last six years come from the Emergency Defense Regulations , which were implemented by Britain against Palestinians and Jews after World War II .
Attorney Yaccov Shapiro , who later became Israel ’s Minister Of Justice , described the Emergency Defense Regulations as “ unparalleled in any civilized country : there were no such laws in Nazi Germany . ”
Israel also kidnapped Vanunu in 1986 , but Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states : “ No one shall he subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention ” , including abduction of a person by agents of one state to another state .
Vanunu was charged with and convicted of treason and espionage .
Section 99 of the Israeli Penal Code , treason is defined as “ an act calculated to assist ( an enemy ) in time of war …delivering information with the intention that it fall into the hands of the enemy . ”
Section 113 defines aggravated espionage as “ deliver ( ing ) any secret information without being authorized to do so and with intent to impair the security of the state ” and a sub-clause provides for a penalty of seven years for the unauthorized collection , preparation , recording or holding of secret information ; if this is done with intent to impair the security of the state and then , the penalty is increased to 15 years .
During my interviews with Vanunu , he informed me that , “ All the secrets I had were published in 1989 in an important book , by Frank Barnaby , The Invisible Bomb : Nuclear Arms Race in the Middle East . ”
Frank Barnaby , the Nuclear Physicist , who was hired by the London Sunday Times to interrogate Vanunu , testified at his closed door trial , “ I very vigorously cross- examined Vanunu , relentlessly asking the same questions in a number of different ways and at different times …
I found Vanunu very straightforward about his motives for violating Israel ’s secrecy laws he explained to me that he believed that both the Israeli and the world public had the right to know about the information he passed on .
He seemed to me to be acting ideologically . ”
But , Vanunu was rendered defenseless during that closed door trial when the court ruled that his motivations were not ideological and they refused to allow Vanunu ’s own statements regarding his intentions to even be considered in his defense .
On November 24th , 2006 Vanunu wrote :
“ My lawyer succeeded to reveal a few very important facts : This General of the Army also was not allowed to see all the secrets that he is required to protect by these restrictions that they claim I know them .
So , he gave orders of restrictions without knowing what he is protecting or that he is also following orders blindly , and Mossad Sheen Bet using its authority for just punishing me .
He testified that it is not a crime for me to talk with foreigners in general anywhere .
He testified that I can speak freely to any Israeli citizens about anything ; it is not his concern what I am saying to them .
These Israelis can give this information to any foreigners .
It was difficult for the Judge to understand why this dichotomy exits between foreigners and Israelis .
It means that it is not about secrecy but about something else . ”
The “ Something Else ”
In 2004 , Yossi Melman wrote for Haaretz :
“ This is the secret that has n’t yet been told in the affair : the story of the security fiasco that made it possible for Vanunu to do what he did , and the story of the subsequent attempts at cover - up , whitewashing and protection of senior figures in the defense establishment , who were bent on divesting themselves of responsibility for the failure .
“ The 18 - year prison term to which Vanunu was sentenced is almost exactly the same period as that in which Yehiel Horev has served as chief of internal security in the defense establishment [ who has been ] involved in the affair as deputy chief of security at the Defense Ministry , and also after Vanunu ’s abduction and arrest , as a member of an investigative commission . ”
Melman described Horev as devoted to duty and bland , petty and acutely suspiciousness , but also a man of personal integrity with a desire to expose corruption and failures coupled with a penchant for vengefulness .
“ The affairs of the secrets that leaked from the two places considered Horev ’s holiest sites – the Biological Institute , which produced a senior spy in the person of Prof.
Marcus Klingberg , and the Dimona nuclear plant , about which secret information was revealed through Mordechai Vanunu – were formative events in the development of his world view .
Shortly after taking office as chief of security at the Defense Ministry , Horev began to take punitive measures to hobble Vanunu .
He is responsible for the harsh conditions in which Vanunu was held , which included years in solitary confinement , and the sharp limitations on the number of visitors he could have …[ and has fought ] a rearguard battle to prevent Vanunu from leaving Israel and to place him under supervision and restrictions that will be tantamount to house arrest .
Horev has always been considered the strictest of all the security chiefs in Israel , especially in regard to the protection of institutions such as the Dimona facility and the Biological Institute .
He is apprehensive that if Vanunu goes abroad , he will continue to be a nuisance by stimulating the public debate over Israel ’s nuclear policy and the nuclear weapons he says Israel possesses …all the hyperactivity being displayed by Horev and those who support his approach is intended only to divert attention from what has not yet been revealed : the security blunders and their cover-ups . ”
In 2003 , BBC documentary Peter Hounam stated , “ Vanunu told the world that Israel had developed between one hundred and two hundred atomic bombs [ in 1986 ! ] and had gone on to develop neutron bombs and thermonuclear weapons .
Enough to destroy the entire Middle East and nobody has done anything about it since . ”
In 2005 , Vanunu told me :
“ President Kennedy tried to stop Israel from building atomic weapons .
Kennedy insisted on an open internal inspection .
“ When Johnson became president , he made an agreement with Israel that two senators would come every year to inspect .
Before the senators would visit , the Israelis would build a wall to block the underground elevators and stairways .
> From 1963 to ’ 69 , the senators came , but they never knew about the wall that hid the rest of the Dimona from them .
“ Nixon stopped the inspections and agreed to ignore the situation .
As a result , Israel increased production .
In 1986 , there were over two hundred bombs .
Today , they may have enough plutonium for ten bombs a year . ”
On March 26 , 2006 , Vanunu told me :
“ Many journalists come here to the American Colony , from CNN and NY Times .
They all want to cover my story , but their EDITORS say no…CNN wants to interview me ; but they say they ca n’t do it because they do n’t want problems with the Israeli censor .
BBC is doing the same thing .
“ Sixty Minutes from the United States from the beginning they wanted to do a program , but because of the censor situation they decide not to do it .
Also big media from Germany , France , Italy , Japan .
None of them wants problems with the Israelis . ”
I began the taping of “ 30 Minutes with Vanunu ” with this question : “ If the British Mandate has expired why not the British Mandate ’s Emergency Defense Regulations ? ”
Vaunu replied ,
“ The reason given is security but it is because Israel is not a democracy unless you are a Jew .
This administration tells me I am not allowed to speak to foreigners , the Media , and the world .
But I do because that is how I prove my true humanity to the world .
My freedom of speech trial began January 25 , 2006 for speaking to the media , the same day as the Palestinian elections . ”
The day before Vanunu returned to jail he emailed me :

THE VANUNU SAGA 2005 - 2010 !
Slate has a fascinating story about gulabis — gangs of women in rural India who wear pink saris seeking justice for abused wives .
40 - year old Sampat Pal Devi started the movement with a few friends in 2006 .
They began by visiting a few husbands who refused to stop beating their wives , intimidating them into changing their minds by brandishing bamboo sticks .
The movement now has more than 200,000 members ;
Pal travels from village to village on a bicycle to keep the momentum going .
Pal has a long list of criminal charges against her , including unlawful assembly , rioting , attacking a government employee , and obstructing an officer in the discharge of duty , and she even had to go into hiding .
Her feistiness has secured notable victories for the community , however .
In 2008 , the group ambushed the local electricity office , which was withholding electricity until members received bribes or sexual favors in return for flicking the switch back on .
The stick - wielding gulabi stormed the company grounds and proceeded to rough up the staff inside the building .
An hour later , the power was back on in the village .
As the article points out , women who suffered from human rights abuses like honor killings , infanticide , and child marriages would take their own lives to escape their fate .
But recent progress in the political arena — like an affirmative action bill passed in March that would reserve 33 % of parliamentary seats for woman — has made women realize that they can find power in numbers and fight back .
The silver lining here is that while Indian democracy is too weak to deliver on the gender equality that is inscribed in its constitution , it is strong enough not to crush movements like the pink gang .
This is also thanks to the free media , which has boomed since the '90s and which glorifies the work of the gulabis .

One of the founders of the Smart brand has died .
Nicolas Hayek , the chairman and founder of Swatch Group , passed away in Switzerland at 82 , the Wall Street Journal reports .
Hayek led the company that reinvented the Swiss watch ( conflated into " Swatch " ) with an inexpensive , stylish range of plastic timepieces .
But Hayek also was pivotal in the Smart fortwo's long gestation .
The whole notion for a small , plastic - bodied city car with interchangeable panels was said to be his idea , and his initial sketches for the vehicle in the 1980s described a two - seater with hybrid power .
Hayek first linked up with Volkswagen in the early 1990s on the project , but dissolved that partnership when Ferdinand Piech became head of the Volkswagen Group in 1993 .
Hayek turned to Daimler - Benz AG , which signed up as Swatch 's new partner -- and took on some of the design , engineering and construction of the Smart in a new factory in Hambach , France .
The Smart city car would be shown in concept form in 1994 , but it would not hit the streets until 1998 -- and would n't make its way to the U.S. market until 2008 .
By then Hayek 's part of the company had long been subsumed by Daimler - Benz , which had become DaimlerChrysler and then finally , Daimler AG .
The Smart project -- which entered production without Hayek 's hybrid powertrain -- has never turned a profit .
This year , Smart adopted a new electric drivetrain for what TheCarConnection 's Bengt Halvorson says is the most satisfying version of the urban commuter car .
Hayek was born in Lebanon in 1928 , and was one of the biggest shareholders in Swatch until his passing , though he ceded the CEO title in 2000 .

Republican candidate Meg Whitman , facing a protest of 1,000 nurses outside her home on Thursday , has boosted her efforts to counter the California Nurses Association with plans to form a nurses advisory committee to help her reach nurses in her campaign for governor .
Union members say Whitman 's unusual focus on nurses suggests she wants to separate 86,000 rank - and - file members of the union from its leadership .
Such a tactic was disastrous for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who abandoned his call to increase patient - nurse ratios in 2005 after nurses protested statewide .
" We 've seen Schwarzenegger do this before , bring out anti-union nurses and run anti-union websites , " said Deann McEwen , an intensive care nurse at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center and a member of the union 's board of directors .
" It 's offensive , because it suggests nurses are n't intelligent enough to ... think critically on issues . "
Malinda Markowitz , a registered nurse who is co-president of the union , said 1,000 nurses are expected to gather at noon Thursday outside Whitman 's home in Atherton , before attending a forum at nearby Cañada College in Redwood City .
" Our members are coming to deliver a message to her : RNs and CNA will not be pushed around or bullied like one of her subordinates or subjects , " Markowitz said .
Whitman spokeswoman Sarah Pompei countered that " the radical leadership of the ( union ) has decided to spend untold thousands of dollars from members ' dues on a stunt . "
" While Meg believes it is important for all California nurses to know her true positions on the issues , she 'll focus on having a meaningful conversation without the partisan politics , " Pompei said .
The former eBay CEO 's campaign , which created a website designed for nurses , also charged that " top leaders of the Democrat - controlled California Nurses Association union are continuing to mischaracterize her vision for California and her position on key health care issues . "
The heated battle between Whitman and the nurses intensified after the union endorsed Democrat Jerry Brown for governor .
The union has lambasted Whitman 's campaign at protests , dubbing the wealthy candidate " Queen Meg . "
Rose Ann DeMoro , the nurses union executive director , has said Whitman 's goals of laying off 40,000 state workers and cutting $ 15 billion from the state budget are signs that she wants to cut pensions and health care and roll back benefits won by nurses .
Whitman 's campaign countered by asking for the union 's mailing lists to detail her positions .
When that was refused , the candidate 's team used another mailing list to send mailers blasting DeMoro and the union 's political activity as wasteful and inappropriate in the governor 's race .

The Order of Mates celebrated beside Sydney Harbour the other day .
This is a venerable masonry in Australian political life that unites the Labor Party with the rich elite known as the big end of town .
They shake hands , not hug , though the Silver Bodgie now hugs .
In his prime , the Silver Bodgie , aka Bob Hawke , or Hawkie , wore suits that shone , wide - bottomed trousers and shirts with the buttons undone .
A bodgie was a 1950s Australian Teddy Boy and Hawke 's thick grey - black coiffure added inches to his abbreviated stature .
Hawke also talked out of the corner of his mouth in an accent that was said to be " ocker " , or working class , although he was of the middle class and Oxford - educated .
When he was president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions , his popularity rested on his reputation as a hard - drinking larrikin , an Australian sobriquet once prized almost as much as an imperial honour .
For Hawke , it was the disguise of one whose heart belonged to the big end of town , who cooled the struggles of working Australians during the rise to power of the new property sharks , mineral barons and tax avoiders .
Indeed , as Labor prime minister in the 1980s , Hawke and his treasurer Paul Keating eliminated the most equitable spread of personal income on earth : a model for the Blairites .
And the Great Mate across the Pacific loved Hawkie .
Victor Marchetti , the CIA strategist who helped draft the treaty that gave America control over its most important spy base in the southern hemisphere , told me : " When Hawke came along . . . he immediately sent signals that he knew how the game was played and who was buttering his bread .
He became very co-operative , and even obsequious . "
After the coup , capitulation
The party overlooking Sydney Harbour on 12 July was to launch a book by Hawke 's wife , Blanche d'Alpuget , whose effusions about the Silver Bodgie include his single - handed rescue of Nelson Mandela from apartheid 's clutches .
A highlight of the occasion was the arrival of the new prime minister , Julia Gillard , who proclaimed Hawke her " role model " and the " gold standard " for running Australia .
This may help explain the extraordinary and brutal rise of Gillard .
In 48 hours in June , she and Mates in the party 's caucus got rid of the elected prime minister , Kevin Rudd .
Her weapons were Rudd 's slide in the opinion polls and the power and prize of Australia 's vast trove of minerals .
To pay off the national debt , Rudd had decreed a modest special tax on the profits of giants such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto .
The response was a vicious advertising campaign against the government and a threat to shut down mines .
Within days of her coup , Gillard , who was Rudd 's deputy , had reduced the new tax and the companies ' campaign was called off .
It was a repeat of Hawke 's capitulation to the mining companies in the 1980s when they threatened to bring down a state Labor government in Western Australia .
Like her predecessors , Gill­ard is complicit in a land - grab of the one region of Australia , the Northern Territory , where Aboriginal Australians have land and mineral rights .
The deceit is spectacular and historical .
The government claims it is " protecting " black Australian children from " abuse " and " neglect " within their own communities .
Official statistics show that the incidence of child abuse is no different from that of white Australia and the true cause of Aboriginal suffering is a systemic colonial racism that denies housing , water , roads , adequate health care and schools to indigenous people , and which harasses and imprisons them at a greater rate than in South Africa under apartheid .
Since her coup , Gillard has reaffirmed this racism at the heart of policymaking .
Australia takes fewer refugees than almost any other country , yet Gillard is using their " threat " to outdo the hysterics of an especially primitive opposition .
Gillard 's " hard line " on refugees has been welcomed by the openly racist former MP Pauline Hanson as " sweep[ing ] political correctness from the debate " .
Hanson 's One Nation is the equivalent of the British National Party .
Gillard , an immigrant from Wales , demanded that refugees heading for Australia be " processed " ( dumped ) in East Timor , an impoverished country whose genocidal occupation by Indonesia was backed by Australian governments .
Now liberated , the East Timorese have read their huge , underpopulated neighbour a moral lesson by saying no .
High risers
Many of the refugees come from Afghanistan , which Australia invaded at Washington 's insistence .
" Our national security is at stake in Afghanistan , " said Gillard on 5 July , linking a faraway tribal war and resistance to foreign invaders with three terrorist attacks in Indonesia in which Australians were killed .
There is not a shred of evidence to support her statement .
Australia 's security is unique ; since 1915 , an estimated 22 people have died as a result of politically motivated violence .
The new prime minister 's partner is a former hair products salesman named Tim Mathieson .
This would be of no interest , had he not been given the job of " Australia 's men's health ambassador " by one of Gillard 's colleagues , the health minister , even though he had no experience in health care .
Mathieson is now a " rising star " in real estate , thanks to one Albert Dadon , whose company is seeking planning permission for a contentious high - rise in Melbourne .
Dadon is a Mate .
As head of the Australia Israel Cultural Exchange , he arranges admiring tours of Israel for politicians and journalists .
Gillard went on such a junket last year in the wake of Israel 's massacre of 1,400 people in Gaza , mostly women and children .
She who would be the first female prime minister of Australia drooled her uncritical support for their killers .
Here 's an app that pays for 12 iPads the very first time you use it .
Buy one iPad for every single chair in your meeting room … like the projector and the table , it 's part of the room .
I recently sat through a 17 hour meeting with 40 people in it ( there were actually 40 people , but it only felt like 17 hours . ) .
That 's a huge waste of attention and resources .
Here 's what the app does ( I hope someone will build it ) : ( I know some of these features require a lot of work , and some might require preparation before the meeting .
Great !
Perhaps then the only meetings we have will be meetings worth having , meetings with an intent to produce an outcome ) .
I can dream …
1 . There 's an agenda , distributed by the host , visible to everyone , with time of start and stop , and it updates as the meeting progresses .
2 . There 's a timer , keeping things moving because it sits next to the agenda .
3 . The host or presenter can push an image or spreadsheet to each device whenever she chooses .
4 . There 's an internal back channel that the host can turn on , permitting people in the room to chat privately with each other .
( And the whole thing works on internal wifi , so no internet surfing to distract ! )
5 . There 's a big red ' bored ' button that each attendee can push anonymously .
The presenter can see how many red lights are lighting up at any give time .
6 . There 's a bigger green ' GO ! ' button that each attendee can push anonymously .
It lets the host or presenter see areas where more depth is wanted .
7 . There 's a queue for asking questions , so they just do n't go to the loudest , bravest or most powerful .
8 . There 's a voting mechanism .
9 . There 's a whiteboard so anyone can draw an idea and push it to the group .
10 .
There 's a written record of all activity created , so at the end , everyone who attended can get an email digest of what just occurred .
Hey , it could even include who participated the most , who asked questions that others thought were useful , who got the most ' boring ' button presses while speaking …
11 . There 's even a way the host can see who is n't using it actively .
Can you imagine how an hour flies by when everyone has one of these in a meeting ?
How focused and exhausting it would all be ?
$ 500 each , you 'll sell 50,000 …
PS no one built the first one yet .
Sigh .

" [ W]e find that members of the U.S. Senate outperformed the market by almost 100 basis points [ One basis point is equivalent to 1/100th of a one percent .
100 basis points are equivalent to one percent . ] per month ...
When we equally weight the returns of each Senator , the buy portfolio earns a compound annual rate of 28.6 % on an equal - weighted basis and 31.1 % on a trade - weighted basis compared to 21.3 % for the market ...
Cumulative abnormal returns for the portfolio of stocks bought by Senators are near zero for the calendar year prior to the date of purchase .
After acquisition , the cumulative abnormal return rises over 25 % within one calendar year after the purchase date .
The cumulative abnormal returns for the portfolio of stocks sold by the Senators are near zero for the calendar year after the date of sale .
However , these same stocks saw a cumulative abnormal positive return of 25 % during the year immediately preceding the event date .
These results suggest that Senators knew the appropriate times to both buy and sell their common stocks ...
After being sold by Senators , stocks underperform the market by 12 basis points per month on a trade - weighted basis .... Combining the buy transactions with the sell transactions in a hedged portfolio we find that Senators outperform the market by 97 basis points ( nearly 1 % ) per month on a trade - weighted basis ...
We find no reliable differences between the returns earned by Democrats and Republicans but seniority appears to be important .
Senators with the least seniority ( in their first Senatorial term ) earn statistically higher returns than those Senators with the longest seniority ( over 16 years in the Senate ) . "

Artists , musicians and green activists plan to step up protests against BP 's sponsorship of Britain 's most prestigious galleries and museums in the wake of the Gulf oil catastrophe .
A group calling itself Good Crude Britannia , made up of artists , poets , writers and filmmakers , will picket Tate Britain 's summer party next Monday which is billed by the gallery as celebrating 20 years of BP 's sponsorship .
Many of Europe 's leading artists , donors and cultural supporters are expected to be greeted at the glittering annual event by Lord Browne of Madingley , chair of the Tate and former head of BP .
The planned demonstration follows protests this week by a group of artists calling themselves the Greenwash Guerrillas who distributed leaflets outside the National portrait gallery at a BP - sponsored arts event .
On Tuesday , Greenpeace campaigners followed up with an " alternative exhibition " at a private viewing at the gallery .
The oil company has refused to divulge how much money it gives the arts in Britain but it is thought , along with Shell , to be one of the most generous .
It is a major sponsor of the British Museum , the Tate galleries , the Royal Opera House and the National Portrait Gallery .
In addition it sponsors the Almeida theatre , the National Maritime Museum , as well as the Science and Natural History Museums .
" Organisations like the National Portrait Gallery help shape public attitudes towards the big issues of the day and if the Gallery is serious about climate change then the sponsorship deal with BP has got to end , " said Robin Oakley , Greenpeace 's campaigns director .
In a separate development , musicians including Lady Gaga , Korn , Disturbed , Godsmack , Creed and the Backstreet Boys said they planned to boycott BP on their national tours this year .
" It is absurd that the Tate should be sponsored by a company that is as irresponsible and polluting as BP , " said Matthew Herbert , an electronic artist and composer who will headline the jazz stage at Glastonbury this weekend .
Jane Trowell of Platform said : " The financial support provided by BP creates a perception of it being a cuddly corporate entity , and aims to distract us from the devastating environmental and social impacts of its global operations .
Public outrage over the Deepwater Horizon spill is creating a moment for change .
We hope that , as happened with the tobacco industry , it will soon come to be seen as socially unacceptable for cultural institutions to accept funding from Big Oil . "
The oil industry has been a target for artists and activists for many years .
Shell was widely boycotted in the 1990s for its involvement in the Nigerian government 's decision to hang the writer Ken Saro - Wiwa .
Last month a group called Liberate Tate entered the gallery 's main turbine hall and released dozens of black balloons attached to dead fish in protest against the Gulf oil spill .
Gallery staff had to shoot the balloons down with air rifles .
In a statement , the Tate said it had an ethics committee which regularly reviewed its sponsorship deals .
" BP is one of the most important sponsors of the arts in the UK supporting Tate as well as several other leading cultural institutions .
Tate works with a wide range of corporate organisations and generates the majority of its funding from earned income and private sources .
The board and ethics committee regularly review compliance with the policy , " it said .
WASHINGTON ( PAI ) – The Steelworkers union and the American Wind Energy Association have signed an agreement on working together to develop the wind power industry , emphasizing the need for alternative energy devices – windmills and wind turbines generating electricity – produced by U.S. workers in U.S. factories .
Key parts of the pact include lobbying for a national standard ordering U.S. utilities to purchase a set percentage of their power from renewable sources – wind , solar , hydro , etc. – and for tax incentives to ensure the parts for the wind turbines and associated power plants and transmission lines are manufactured here , not overseas .
“ We expect this framework will help advance the promise of green jobs being key to our future .
The nation cannot continue to fall behind other countries on clean energy manufacturing , ” said Steelworkers President Leo Gerard .
“ If we do not act quickly on this opportunity through federal leadership and industry commitment , we will have done a disservice to our citizens , ” he said .
“ The agreement is designed to create a partnership for progress that does n’t accept second place , and instead , puts the U.S. at the leading edge ” in clean energy , he added .
“ We ’re really excited .
This will allow us to diversify our electrical power to a renewable power portfolio , ” Gerard told a telephone press conference .
The Steelworkers have led the way in the union movement in arguing for building factories to manufacture “ green ” products , such as wind generators and turbines , solar panels and hybrid car batteries .
Not only would doing so revitalize U.S. manufacturing , they contend , but it would also produce high - paying jobs .
They cite the example of Gamesa , a Spanish wind - turbine manufacturer that bought a former steel mill in the Pittsburgh area , converted it to making wind turbines and now employs several hundred Steelworkers doing so .
But wind power and other alternative energies have yet to get off the ground due to lack of investment .
That ’s because federal tax credits for such alternative energy investment expire every several years , making financial institutions reluctant to commit money .
The American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) adds that banks do n’t lend because many of the wind energy firms are “ too small , ” to quote the group ’s chairman .
Gerard also noted construction of some alternative energy plants , though not necessarily wind power plants , can take a decade .
“ We have a lot of challenges due to that lack of a long - term commitment .
We only have a short - term tax policy , ” he said .
So financing is lacking , he pointed out .
“ A stable and secure financial climate allowing AWEA members to plan for the future , while getting the capital to achieve those plans , is a necessary ingredient to expanded utilization of domestic supply chains , ” Gerard added .
“ Steelworkers , and all Americans , want to know that we will take every step necessary to create a plan for long - term economic growth . ”
Denise Bode , the CEO of the 2,300 - member wind energy group , said the pact with the USW ensures that this sector “ is the first major player in the energy industry to clearly show its commitment to utilizing domestically located sources of supply .
“ Job creation and long - term growth in this sector require a comprehensive public policy agenda , ” Bode added .
“ That agenda will require some federal resources , but most importantly , it will require the national commitment to clean and green energy essential to the future of the industry .
Our partnership will help achieve these goals . ”
The agreement drew immediate support from Sen. Sherrod Brown , D - Ohio .
He said wind energy plants already bring new jobs to his economically depressed state .
He also stressed the need to rebuild the nation ’s factory base .
“ Thirty years ago , 30 percent of our GDP was in manufacturing and 11 percent to 12 percent was in finance .
Today that ’s almost flipped — and we know where that ’s taken us , ” he said , referring to the current Great Recession caused by financial excesses and speculation .
“ So this is a big step the wind industry has taken , with our encouragement . ”
Brown did not say what the chances are of approving a long - term tax credit for alternative energy .
“ But there are 8,000 parts needed to produce a wind turbine , ” he said .
“ I have people – tool and die makers , machine shops , auto parts dealers – coming to me and saying ‘ I want to be part of the supply chain ' ” for wind power . ”

Reeking of decay and packed with bowls of human fingers , a partly burned baby , and gem - studded teeth — among other artifacts — a newfound Maya king 's tomb sounds like an overripe episode of Tales From the Crypt .
But the tightly sealed , 1,600 - year - old burial chamber , found under a jungle - covered Guatemalan pyramid , is as rich with archaeological gold as it is with oddities , say researchers who announced the discovery Friday .
" This thing was like Fort Knox , " said Brown University archaeologist Stephen Houston , who led the excavation in the ancient , overgrown Maya town of El Zotz .
Alternating layers of flat stones and mud preserved human bones , wood carvings , textiles , and other organic material to a surprising degree — offering a rare opportunity to advance Maya archaeology , experts say .
" Since [ the artifacts ] appear in a royal tomb , they may provide direct insights in the political economy of the divine kings that likely involved tribute and gifts , " Vanderbilt University anthropologist Markus Eberl , who was not involved in the project , said via email .
Excavation leader Houston added , " we 're looking at a glimpse of lost art forms . "
Fingers , Teeth , and a Taste of Things to Come
The researchers found grisly deposits even before they reached the Maya tomb .
Almost every layer of mud above the tomb contained blood - red pottery filled with human fingers and teeth wrapped in decayed organic material — perhaps leaves .
The fingers and teeth were " perhaps a kind of food or symbolic meal offering , " Houston speculated .
" Sacred breads in [ Mexico's ] Yucatán are wrapped in such materials today . "
In another bowl above the circa A.D. 350 to 400 tomb , the team found a partly burned baby .
The bowls closest to the burial chamber were arranged like the Maya cosmos — the four cardinal compass points plus the center of world .
Dancing King and Child Sacrifices
" The chill of the morgue " and " a faint odor of decay " tempered the euphoria of the find when the team finally entered the tomb itself on May 29 , Houston said .
Breaking though a side wall of the small tomb , excavators uncovered the remains of six children — a rarity among Maya burials .
Nearby was an obsidian blade covered in a red residue that " may be blood , " Houston said .
The arrangement suggests the children , some of them infants , may have been ritually sacrificed as the king was laid to rest .
( Read about Maya rituals of sacrifice and worship . )
Why the children would have been killed is a mystery , said team member Andrew Scherer , a Brown University anthropologist .
But the youth of the victims hints that their value as sacrifices may have lain in their being , to Maya eyes , on the verge of personhood , Scherer said .
Dig leader Houston added , " [ The fact ] that at least four appear not to have been able yet fully to speak or walk may put them at that threshold of human existence . "
The role of the king in his own burial may be slightly clearer .
The team found bell - like ornaments made of shells and " clappers " made of dog teeth , which were likely placed around the king 's waist and legs , Houston said .
The same accessories are seen on performers in a ritual dance depicted in Maya art , suggesting that the king may have been " cast " as a dancer in the ceremony leading to his interment — despite the arthritic joints that give away his apparently advanced age .
Turtle King Tomb a " Gold Mine "
His teeth embedded with jewels , the buried king , Houston suspects , was the founder of a dynasty at El Zotz , in what 's now the Petén region ( satellite map ) of Guatemala .
According to the partially deciphered hieroglyphics on the tomb walls , his name translates to perhaps Red Turtle or Great Turtle .
More information about him may be gleaned from further study of hieroglyphics from the tomb , Houston said .
A small state with no more than a few thousand people , El Zotz lay to the west of Tikal , once among the biggest and most powerful Maya centers ( interactive map of the Maya Empire ) .
The neighboring settlements , though , probably were n't best of friends .
El Zotz was likely " supported by the enemies of Tikal in a way to keep a check on Tikal 's territorial ambitions , " Houston said .
More details on the nature of that relationship — and on El Zotz and Maya life in general — may await decoding in the turtle king 's tomb .
The excavation team 's next steps include residue analysis as well as continued analysis , and reconstruction , of the tomb 's textiles and other artifacts .
" This , " Houston said , " could be a veritable gold mine of information . "
The synagogue in Worms became the target of an arson attack in mid-May .
The authorities still do n't know who was behind the attack .

Records Show Campus Spying on Student Activists
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@aclu.org
The ACLU of Washington today called upon the University of Washington administration to take action to ensure that campus police prevent further surveillance of the lawful political activities of its students , faculty and staff .
The ACLU said that incidents on campus point to the need for state legislation allowing political surveillance only when there is reasonable suspicion of criminal activity .
Public records obtained by the ACLU show that the University of Washington Police Department ( UWPD ) authorized an undercover officer to attend , participate in , and collect information about meetings of the University of Washington Student Worker Coalition ( SWC ) .
These documents follow on the heels of a previously disclosed surveillance episode and show that it was neither an isolated incident , nor was it the first time police improperly monitored the student group .
In addition , the documents show that UWPD violated internal policy regarding intelligence collection , which state that the " sole purpose " of information collection is " eliminating criminal activity , " and that " [ i] nformation collected is limited to suspected criminal conduct and activities that are crimes . "
By collecting non-criminal information about the SWC – including their political ideas , allies and statements – the UWPD went beyond the limitations set forth in their Operations Manual .
" We urge the University to issue a clear statement that government surveillance based on political ideology is not permissible , " said Kathleen Taylor , executive director of the ACLU of Washington in a letter to Vice Provost Eric Godfrey .
" Further , we call on the University of Washington to ensure its policy limiting intelligence collection is enforced and to provide training to all officers clearly stating that officers shall not collect information about political and religious views and activities without a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity . "
According to documents obtained via an ACLU of Washington records request , a UWPD officer attempted to infiltrate a Student Worker Coalition meeting at Suzzallo Café on April 1 , 2010 .
Noting that this was " not an open meeting , " the officer sat at a neighboring table and took notes .
In an April 2 , 2010 e-mail to a UWPD Lieutenant , the officer discussed the content of the SWC meeting , participants ' political beliefs , and their plans to work with various worker groups throughout the UW community .
The officer also described her intent to " locate the location of the next meeting to see if a plain clothes officer could fit in . "
Her superior and a deputy chief responded that the officer " did a great job " monitoring the SWC .
This e-mail sheds new light on a previously disclosed incident involving the same officer .
On April 8 , a woman named " Tani " who described herself as a UW alumna actively participated in an SWC meeting to plan for a May 3d campus demonstration .
The following week , several SWC members encountered the officer in police uniform and confronted her , whereupon she admitted to being the person posing as " Tani " who attended the SWC meeting .
Salmun Kazerounian and Sarah White , recent University of Washington Law School graduates and members of the Student Worker Coalition , spoke at the press conference .
" Spying on workers and student activists is an embarrassing waste of public resources that disrupts legitimate and important organizing activities , " said Kazerounian .
Members of the UW chapter of the National Lawyers Guild , Kazerounian and White helped form the SWC to address both worker and student concerns around budget cuts .
" The surveillance incidents on campus are further evidence of the need for state legislation to allow political surveillance only with reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct , " Taylor added .
Legislation to accomplish this was introduced in the 2010 legislature , and the ACLU again will press for its passage in 2011 .
In the recent settlement of a case brought by the ACLU of Washington and attorney Lawrence Hildes , three law enforcement agencies agreed to pay $ 418,000 including attorney 's fees for the wrongful arrest and covert surveillance of Evergreen State graduate Philip Chinn .
Despite obeying traffic laws and passing all sobriety tests , Chinn was arrested for driving under the influence on the way from Olympia to an anti-war demonstration in Aberdeen .
Documents obtained via public disclosure requests revealed that the arrest came as part of a multi-agency " action plan " to suppress political protest .
James Bovard at Antiwar.com points out one of the more egregiously sick - making of the many atrocious " arguments " employed by Barack Obama in his successful effort to block the efforts of Maher Arar to seek justice for his unjust rendition and proxy torture in the Great War of Global Terror .
Obama bade his legal henchmen -- his own personal John Yoos , as it were -- to tell the Supreme Court that it should kill the Canadian citizen 's case seeking compensation for his unlawful arrest by U.S. officials , who then rendered him not unto Caesar but to the untender mercies of Syria 's torture cells .
The Robed Ones agreed , dismissing , without comment , Arar 's appeal of a lower court ruling that quashed his case -- a decision that Scott Horton rightly likened last year to the Dred Scott case , which upheld the legality of slavery , even in states which prohibited it .
The Arar ruling upholds the " legality " of a new , universal form of slavery , i.e. , the United States government can deprive anyone in the world of their freedom , and dispose of their bodies as it sees fit : torture , " indefinite detention , " or even " targeted assassination . "
The fact that it is a man of partly African descent who is now outstripping the Southern slavers in this extension of servitude to the entire world is one of those poisonously bitter ironies with which history abounds .
But grim and depraved as Obama 's position is , it is not without its comic elements .
As Bovard notes , one of the " arguments " offered by the Obama / Yoo administration was that the case should be dismissed because it might call into question “ the motives and sincerity of the United States officials who concluded that petitioner could be removed to Syria . ”
We kid , as they say , you not .
So now cases of monstrous and criminal actions by agents of the United States government cannot be heard in court , because this might impugn the " sincerity " of the officials involved .
And after all , as we all know , it is the inner feelings of government officials that are all important in determining the legality -- and morality -- of their actions .
That is why the murder of more than a million Iraqis in an act of naked military aggression is not a war crime ; it is , at the very worst , just a " tragic blunder , " a misdirected excess of good intentions gone awry .
Because we meant well , did n't we ?
We always mean well .
Even those Southern slavers were " sincere " in their belief that keeping people of African descent in servitude was the " right " thing to do .
It 's too bad that Barack Obama was not around in those days to stick up for them and ensure that their " motives and sincerity " could not be questioned .
Heaven forefend that the delicate sensibilities of slavers , renditioners , torturers and assassins should ever be exposed to public scrutiny !
So Arar 's American case is now dead .
( The Canadians long ago ' fessed up -- and paid up -- for their role in his torment . )
But its implications live on .
As I noted in my first article on the Arar case , back in December 2003 :
... Arar 's case is not extraordinary .
In the past two years , the Bushist organs have " rendered " thousands of detainees , without charges , hearings or the need to produce any evidence whatsoever , into the hands of regimes which the U.S. government itself denounces for the widespread use of torture .
Apparatchiks of the organs make no secret of the practice -- or of their knowledge that the " rendered " will indeed be beaten , burned , drugged , raped , even killed .
" I do it with my eyes open , " one renderer told the Washington Post .
Detainees -- including lifelong American residents -- have been snatched from the homes , businesses , schools , from streets and airports , and sent to torture pits like Syria , Morocco , Egypt , Jordan -- even the stateless chaos of Somalia , where Ashcroft simply dumped more than 30 Somali - Americans last year , without charges , without evidence , without counsel , and with no visible means of support , as the London Times reports .
But this is not the scandal we were speaking of .
Of course , the American organs need n't rely exclusively on foreigners for torture anymore .
Under the enlightened leadership of Ashcroft , Bush , Donald Rumsfeld and other upstanding Christian statesmen , America has now established its own centers for what the organs call " operational flexibility . "
These include bases in Bagram , Afghanistan and Diego Garcia , the Indian Ocean island that was forcibly depopulated in the 1960s to make way for a U.S. military installation .
Here , the CIA runs secret interrogation units that are even more restricted than the American concentration camp on Guantanamo Bay .
Detainees -- again , held without charges or evidentiary requirements -- are " softened up " by beatings at the hands of military police and Special Forces troops before being subjected to " stress and duress " techniques : sleep deprivation ( officially condemned as a torture method by the U.S. government ) , physical and psychological disorientation , withholding of medical treatment , etc .
When beatings and " duress " do n't work , detainees are then " packaged " -- hooded , gagged , bound to stretchers with duct tape -- and " rendered " into less dainty hands elsewhere .
But this is not the scandal we were speaking of .
Not content with capture and torture , the organs have been given presidential authority to carry out raids and kill " suspected terrorists " ( including Americans ) on their own volition -- without oversight , without charges , without evidence -- anywhere in the world , including on American soil .
In addition to this general license to kill , Bush has claimed the power to designate anyone he pleases " an enemy combatant " and have them " rendered " into the hands of the organs or simply killed at his express order -- without charges , without evidence , with no judicial or legislative oversight whatsoever .
The life of every American citizen -- indeed , every person on earth -- is now at the disposal of his arbitrary whim .
Never in history has an individual claimed such universal power -- and had the force to back it up .
But this is not the scandal we were speaking of .
All of the above facts -- each of them manifest violations of international law and / or the U.S. Constitution -- have been cheerfully attested to , for years now , by the organs ' own apparatchiks , in the Post , the NY Times , Newsweek , the Guardian , the Economist and other high - profile , mainstream publications .
The stories appear -- then they disappear .
There is no reaction .
No outcry in Congress or the courts -- the supposed guardians of the people 's rights -- beyond a few wan calls for more formality in the concentration camp processing or judicial " warrants " for torture .
And among the great mass of " the people " itself , there is -- nothing .
Silence .
Inattention .
Acquiescence .
State terrorism -- lawless seizure , filthy torture , official murder -- is simply accepted , a part of " normal life , " as in Nazi Germany or Stalin 's empire , where " decent people " with " nothing to hide " approved and applauded the work of the " organs " in " defending national security . "
This is the scandal , this is the nation 's festering shame .
This acquiescence to state terror will breed -- and attract -- a thousand evils for every one it supposedly prevents .
And please note : none of this has changed .
None of it .
These crimeful , brutal abuses of power are becoming more thoroughly entrenched under the rule of the progressive Peace laureate now in the White House .
What Bush did with winks and nods , Obama is openly championing , expanding and codifying into law .
And these deeply sincere evils will keep reverberating , in ways that we can not even imagine , far into the lives of our children and grandchildren , and for generations beyond .
UPDATE : Scott Horton has much more on the latest ruling in the Arar case .

I was eating at an Ethiopian restaurant yesterday .
For those not familiar with that cuisine , the food is served on thin pancakes and one is supposed to eat one ’s dinner with the right hand .
For me it was a painful exercise in overcoming my conditionings .
The table went quiet : a measure of the concentration we all needed to not eat warm food with knife and fork .
We were suddenly fully there : eating .
In this post I ’m stepping away from the abstract philosophical to the practical every day .
One of the ways we complicate our lives is by lack of mindfulness , not being ‘ in the moment ’ .
Sometimes this is OK .
It is n’t really a problem to not be aware of your chair when you ’re online .
Now that you ’ve just read that , you probably ARE aware of your chair .
Perhaps you ’re sitting a bit straighter as well .
That ’s the start of mindfulness .
The exercises below are meant for those times when you are so fluttered you bump into doors and chairs , for instance .
Or when you just ca n’t get that quarrel with a colleague out of your head .
These are all exercises I ’ve tried , but I certainly do n’t pretend to do them daily or even in all cases successfully .
Just something to work with to get back to yourself .
Mind your feet while you ’re grocery shopping .
( my yoga teacher )
Mind your chair while you ’re typing .
When going through a door , think ‘ I am I ’ ( Fourth Way exercise )
When putting on your shoes , try and put on the one you usually put on second first .
( also Fourth Way , Ravi Ravindra )
Drink your tea without sugar if you ’re used to sugar in your tea .
If you ’re used to no sugar , just once put in sugar .
Works with coffee too obviously .
The point is , like the previous one , to become aware of patterns and how hard it is to break them ( Jiddu Krishnamurti ) .
The point is NOT to change the pattern .
A new pattern is just as much a pattern as the old one .
Just create a bit more flexibility .
When you have to wait for something ( grocery line , pc starting up etc. ) breath consciously .
Cleaning the house : be aware of every step of cleaning .
Keep a diary of your thoughts and feelings .
The goal is n’t to create literature , but to observe .
So do n’t mind repetition .
Notice … take a deep breath ; notice five things you can see .

I ’ve got a cool new Amazon S3 feature to tell you about , but I need to start with a definition !
Let ’s define durability ( with respect to an object stored in S3 ) as the probability that the object will remain intact and accessible after a period of one year .
100 % durability would mean that there ’s no possible way for the object to be lost , 90 % durability would mean that there ’s a 1 - in - 10 chance , and so forth .
We ’ve always said that Amazon S3 provides a “ highly durable ” storage infrastructure and that objects are stored redundantly across multiple facilities within an S3 region .
But we ’ve never provided a metric , or explained what level of failure it can withstand without losing any data .
Let ’s change that !
Using the definition that I stated above , the durability of an object stored in Amazon S3 is 99.999999999 % .
If you store 10,000 objects with us , on average we may lose one of them every 10 million years or so .
This storage is designed in such a way that we can sustain the concurrent loss of data in two separate storage facilities .
If you are using S3 for permanent storage , I ’m sure that you need and fully appreciate the need for this level of durability .
It is comforting to know that you can simply store your data in S3 without having to worry about backups , scaling , device failures , fires , theft , meteor strikes , earthquakes , or toddlers .
But wait , there ’s less !
Not every application actually needs this much durability .
In some cases , the object stored in S3 is simply a cloud - based copy of an object that actually lives somewhere else .
In other cases , the object can be regenerated or re-derived from other information .
Our research has shown that a number of interesting applications simply do n’t need eleven 9 ’s worth of durability .
To accommodate these applications we ’re introducing a new concept to S3 .
Each S3 object now has an associated storage class .
All of your existing objects have the STANDARD storage class , and are stored with eleven 9’s of durability .
If you do n’t need this level of durability , you can use the new REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage class instead .
You can set this on new objects when you store them in S3 , or you can copy an object to itself while specifying a different storage class .
The new REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage class activates a new feature known as Reduced Redundancy Storage , or RRS .
Objects stored using RRS have a durability of 99.99 % , or four 9’s .
If you store 10,000 objects with us , on average we may lose one of them every year .
RRS is designed to sustain the loss of data in a single facility .
RRS pricing starts at a base tier of $ 0.10 per Gigabyte per month , 33 % cheaper than the more durable storage .
If Amazon S3 detects that an object has been lost any subsequent requests for that object will return the HTTP 405 ( “ Method Not Allowed ” ) status code .
Your application can then handle this error in an appropriate fashion .
If the object lives elsewhere you would fetch it , put it back into S3 ( using the same key ) , and then retry the retrieval operation .
If the object was designed to be derived from other information , you would do the processing ( perhaps it is an image scaling or transcoding task ) , put the new image back into S3 ( again , using the same key ) , and retry the retrieval operation .
Update ( for HTTP protocol geeks only ) :
Id like to provide clarification regarding our choice of the HTTP 405 ( Method Not Allowed ) status code .
Although 410 ( Gone ) may seem more appropriate , the HTTP 1.1 spec says that this condition is expected to be permanent and that clients “ SHOULD delete references to the Request - URI ” .
In other words , the 410 status code indicates that the object has intentionally been removed and will not return .
That is not necessarily true when data is lost .
The object owner may wish to resolve the data loss by reuploading the object , in which case it would have been inappropriate for S3 to return a 410 status code .
We believe that 405 is most appropriate because other methods ( e.g. PUT , POST , and DELETE ) remain valid for the object even if the objects data has gone missing .
The objects name ( its URI ) remains valid , but the data for the object is gone .
The 422 and 424 status codes are specific to WebDav and dont apply here .
We expect to see management tools and toolkits add support for RRS in the very near future .
You can use either storage class with Amazon CloudFront , of course .
I anticipate many unanticipated uses for this cool new feature ; please feel free to leave me a comment with your ideas .
— Jeff ;
PS – check out Amazon CTO Werner Vogels ’ take on RRS .
His post goes in to a bit more detail on how S3 was designed so that it will never lose data —
“ Core to the design of S3 is that we go to great lengths to never , ever lose a single bit .
We use several techniques to ensure the durability of the data our customers trust us with … ”
If you were looking to take some easy shots at government waste and abuse , you 'd have a hard time topping California State Auditor Elaine M. Howle 's recent assessment of the Golden State 's 14 - year - old high - speed rail project .
The California High Speed Rail Authority , she writes in a 47 - page report issued at the end of April , " paid at least $ 4 million of invoices for which it had no evidence … that the contractors had performed the work invoiced " and " does not generally ensure that invoices reflect work performed by contractors . "
The Authority 's free - spending ways become even more clear in a spot - check by the auditor : " Of 22 regional contractor invoices we reviewed , the Authority paid 20 , totaling $ 6.9 million , without documenting that the Program Manager had performed a required review .
… It spent $ 46,000 on furniture for its Program Manager 's use based on an oral agreement . "
The Authority 's plans also " lacked detail " about ridership projections for the train , about where its funds will come from , about whether state , local , or federal agencies or private partners will be paying for the project , and about how the Authority would manage risk .
As if to drive the point home , Howle singles out the leg of the bullet train line that is generally considered the simplest , cheapest , and shortest .
" Creating a viable funding plan may be a challenge as matched funding for the least expensive corridor eligible for Recovery Act funds — Los Angeles to Anaheim — amounts to $ 4.5 billion , while projected costs total $ 5.5 billion , " Howle writes .
She adds that " the regional contractor working on the Los Angeles - to - Anaheim corridor completed 81 percent of planned hours but spent 230 percent of planned dollars . "
The auditor 's report is full of such grotesque details .
( Among other things , it appears the Authority has done no research on the project 's potential revenue , including such no -brainers as an analysis of ridership on existing high - speed trains . )
If you want the short version , just read the audit 's title : " High - Speed Rail Authority : It Risks Delays or an Incomplete System Because of Inadequate Planning , Weak Oversight , and Lax Contract Management . "
And that 's just the bullet train 's most recent pan .
Earlier in the year , the state 's legislative analyst 's office noted that the Authority 's plan contains no timeline and no specifics and that it " appears to violate the law " by using bond funds to subsidize its operations .
( The Authority now claims to have corrected this problem , and it recently hired a $ 375,000 - a- year CEO to help get the project on track . )
Since 1996 — twice as long as the Transcontinental Railroad took from approval to completion in the 1860s — the bullet train project has cost taxpayers more than $ 250 million , yet not one millimeter of track has been laid .
If all those taxpayers were in California , we could at least take comfort in knowing that only the guilty are being punished .
But the bullet train is the centerpiece in President Barack Obama 's national rail plan , and this spring California became the recipient of $ 2.25 billion in federal funding .
Together with $ 9 billion in bond funds that state voters approved in 2008 , that takes care of a little more than one - fourth of the project 's projected $ 43 billion cost .
( Comparisons with the Bay Bridge expansion and the Boston " Big Dig " suggest the final price tag will end up closer to $ 100 billion — and probably more , because the state 's dire fiscal situation and degraded credit status mean it will be paying higher interest rates in the future . )
The good news is that the federal funds are contingent on the project being underway by September 2012 , so they will probably end up not being disbursed .
The project is a high - decibel example of the magical thinking that takes hold when people talk about trains .
A few years ago , when the rail bonds were being debated , I participated in the quaint ritual of an editorial board meeting at the Los Angeles Times in which we debated how to " weigh in " on this critical issue .
While I , the team 's only mass transit rider , had the handicap of knowing what I was talking about , I was nonetheless pleased at the group 's readiness to acknowledge that the high - speed rail project offered only anemic ridership levels , endless subsidies , and a strong likelihood of never happening .
But in the end , of course , we ran with an editorial titled " Believe in the Bullet Train . "
The piece complained that " critics … base their arguments on the past , not the future . "
The bullet train also exemplifies the arrogance and Bourbon high - handedness with which grand plans get made .
Several times the California High Speed Rail Authority has been caught mapping out bullet train alignments and then failing to notify homeowners whose properties would be slated for seizure via eminent domain .
The current plan would have the 220 - mile - per - hour train running through well - populated residential areas .
It also pits the Authority against Union Pacific over track resources , meaning the bullet train would essentially replace freight — the one genre of rail transport that remains viable and important to the economy — with a passenger rail project that has no hope of ever becoming sustainable .
Finally , the bullet train is a case study in the immortality of a bad idea .
While the train itself may never become a reality , sheer political will makes the train project impossible to kill .
" The project has been fighting every year to stay alive , " says Elizabeth Alexis , co-founder of Californians Advocating Responsible Rail Design , a watchdog group that supports a rail project in principle but is critical of the Authority .
" So they did what they had to do to stay alive , because that 's better than being dead . "
After 14 years of no life signs , how can you tell the difference ?
Amtrak used to try and lure riders with the slogan " There 's Something About a Train That 's Magic . "
In reality , we know that magical trains exist only in cartoons .

In summer 2009 , my small church started a Green Team .
We felt a pioneering spirit as non-conforming liberals accepting responsibility for our modern environmental crisis .
We were , as corporations and other NGOs have similarly done , positioning ourselves as problem solvers , eager to take on our collective environmental mess .
But this venture , new to our congregation , was not new to the world stage or to the worldâ€™s faiths .
By setting up our team we embraced a long - standing tradition of Earth stewardship , a tradition found at some level in all world religions .
Our green team and those at similar congregations are not modern or revolutionary .
Indeed , they are the fulfillment of ancient mandates .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
All of the Earth 's religions speak of an ethical responsibility to care for the natural world .
In Buddhism , the tenets of reincarnation ( samsara ) and karma , and the acceptance of plants and animals into these modes of salvation lend value to all life , human or otherwise .
Man must not harm the plants and animals of the Earth as they , too , are on a karmic journey .
Often referred to as the worldâ€™s oldest surviving faith , Hinduism also places great emphasis on care of nature .
As Al Gore pointed out in his 1992 book , Earth in Balance , environmentalists regularly cite the ancient Hindu dictum : " The earth is our mother , and we are all her children . "
And , here in the US , we are well acquainted with the Native American tradition and interrelationship between Spirit and care of nature .
Indeed , when writing to President Franklin Pierce in 1855 , in response to an offer to purchase native land , Chief Seattle eloquently demonstrated the conviction of most Native groups by saying , in part , " The earth does not belong to man , man belongs to the earth . "
General thought has been that eastern and native cultures place emphasis on conservation and protection while monotheistic traditions have not .
The truth is not that black and white .

In the state capitalist world there are government - run enterprises like Gazprom , Petrobras , Saudi Aramco , Petronas , Petróleos de Venezuela , China National Petroleum Corporation and the National Iranian Oil Company .
These companies create wealth for the political cliques , and they , in turn , have the power of the state behind them .
With this advantage , state energy companies have been absolutely crushing the private - sector energy companies .
In America , we use the phrase Big Oil to describe Exxon Mobil , BP , Royal Dutch Shell and others .
But that just shows how parochial we are .
In fact , none of these private companies make it on a list of the world ’s top 13 energy companies .
A generation ago , the biggest multinationals produced well more than half of the world ’s oil and gas .
But now , according to Bremmer , they produce just 10 percent of the world ’s oil and gas and hold only about 3 percent of the world ’s reserves .
The rivalry between democratic capitalism and state capitalism is not like the rivalry between capitalism and communism .
It is an interdependent rivalry .
State capitalist enterprises invest heavily in democratic capitalist enterprises ( but they tend not to invest in each other ) .
Both sides rely on each other in interlocking trade networks .
Nonetheless , there is rivalry .
There is a rivalry over prestige .
What system works better to produce security and growth ?
What system should emerging and struggling democratic nations aim for ?
There is also rivalry over what rules should govern the world order .
Should countries like Russia be able to withhold gas from Western Europe to make a political point ?
Should governments be able to tilt the playing field to benefit well - connected national champions ?
Should authoritarian governments like Iran be allowed to nuclearize ?
We in the democratic world tend to assume state capitalism can’t prosper forever .
Innovative companies can’t thrive unless there ’s also a free exchange of ideas .
A high - tech economy requires more creative destruction than an authoritarian government can tolerate .
Cronyism will inevitably undermine efficiency .
That ’s all true .
But state capitalism may be the only viable system in low - trust societies , in places where decentralized power devolves into gangsterism .
Moreover , democratic regimes have shown their vulnerabilities of late : a tendency to make unaffordable promises to the elderly and other politically powerful groups ; a tendency toward polarization , which immobilizes governments even in the face of devastating problems .
We in the democratic world have no right to be sanguine .
State capitalism taps into deep nationalist passions and offers psychic security for people who detest the hurly - burly of modern capitalism .
So I hope that as they squabble , Obama and BP keep at least one eye on the larger picture .
We need healthy private energy companies .
We also need to gradually move away from oil and gas  the products that have financed the rise of aggressive state capitalism .
( CNN ) --
The NBA has fined the Cleveland Cavaliers owner $ 100,000 for remarks he made after LeBron James announced he was leaving the team .
NBA Commissioner David Stern said Monday that team owner Dan Gilbert 's words , " though understandable , were ill - advised and imprudent . "
In a letter posted on the team 's website Thursday , Gilbert called James ' decision to play for the Miami Heat a " cowardly betrayal " and a " shocking act of disloyalty . "
James , who joined the Cavaliers straight out of high school and played forward for the team for his entire career , announced his decision to leave the team during a much - ballyhooed ESPN special Thursday entitled " The Decision . "
In a press conference which was posted on the NBA 's website Monday , Stern said that James was " certainly entitled " to leave the team , but he would have advised the basketball star to handle his departure and announcement differently .
" I think that the advice that he received on this was poor .
But his performance was fine .
His honesty and his integrity I think shine through , but this decision was ill - conceived , badly produced and poorly executed , " Stern said .
Stern also criticized civil rights leader Jesse Jackson for comments he made saying Gilbert 's letter showed a " property - owner 's mentality . "
" Equally imprudent I believe are the remarks by my good friend Jesse Jackson , which purport to make this into a racial matter ... he really is mistaken , " Stern said .
Before deciding to join the Miami Heat , James , a reigning two - time NBA MVP , looked at several teams , including New York , Chicago and Cleveland .
He said it came down to one thing .
" The major factor was the best opportunity to win now and to win in the future . "
James said .
He led the Cavaliers to the NBA finals in 2007 , where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs , but never reached the finals again , despite Cleveland management bringing in supporting stars such as Shaquille O'Neal and Antawn Jamison .
I ’ve already gotten pretty salty with WebCeleb in a previous posting , but it turns out there are things out there that make them look like a musician ’s best friend .
On the Guardian ’s Music Blog , Helienne Lindvall offers a look at some services that allow musicians to buy a social media network .
Usocial charges $ 87 for 1,000 Twitter followers , $ 197 for 1,000 Facebook friends , and for $ 97 will give you 5,000 YouTube views .
God knows how they get those views ( interns ? ) .
It could be something along the lines of Subvert and Profit , which allows artists to purchase social media users at a base price , and also pays users to perform social media tasks such as liking a band on Facebook . *
We already have a series on this site called What Not to Do , and I know I do n’t write it , but I would like to make clear that buying social media fans definitely qualifies as WHAT NOT TO DO !!
According to Eileen O’Neill , the Vice President of Modiba , an international record label , music publishing and consulting company , having good social media stats is positive at a superficial level .
“ When I ’m scouting an artist , numbers do matter , ” O’Neill said .
“ I look for Fans on facebook , Friends on myspace , followers on Twitter : the higher the number the more likely it is that I ’ll press play and listen hard for what all those fans like about the artist . ”
But the numbers themselves are n’t enough for O’Neill , and she can tell the difference .
“ ‘ Bought ’ fans are non-interactive , ” she explained .
Purchased fans are not going to post comments on your band ’s wall .
Nor will they re-Tweet updates about your gigs .
This means that your social media network will not work effectively .
What ’s the purpose of being connected to these people if they are not interested in listening to your music or spreading the word about it ?
“ The discerning label , manager , etc , will know immediately from the quality of the material and the level of fan interactivity whether this act is for real , ” O’Neill continued .
“ For new artists just starting out , bumping a few numbers might be worth it to get themselves into the ring with popular artists .
But ultimately , a number on your website will not sell concert tickets and t- shirts , and most certainly gives the artist and his / her team a false sense of confidence . ”

I am writing to you about continuing speculation in the media over the circumstances in which the Scottish Executive decided last year to release Abdelbaset al - Megrahi from prison on compassionate grounds .
While only the Scottish Executive is able to provide the full details , I wanted to write to you to explain the facts as understood by the British Government .
First , the view of the new British Government is that Megrahi 's release was a mistake .
As the Prime Minster 's spokesman said today , " the Prime Minister at the time said that he believed the decision to release Megrahi was wrong , and that he understood the concerns that had been raised about it . "
The British Government deeply regrets the continuing anguish that his release on compassionate grounds has caused the families of Megrahi 's victims in the UK as well as in the US .
However under UK law , where Scottish justice issues are devolved to Scotland , it fell solely to the Scottish Executive to consider Megrahi 's case .
Under Scottish law , Megrahi was entitled to be considered for release on compassionate grounds .
Whilst we disagreed with the decision to release him , we have to respect the independence of the process .
As the Inquiry by the Justice Committee of the Scottish Parliament concluded in February , the Scottish Executive took this decision in good faith , on the basis of the medical evidence available to them at the time , and due process was followed .
I am troubled by the claims made in the press that Megrahi was released because of an oil deal involving BP , and that the medical evidence supporting his release was paid for by the Libyan government .
Both of these allegations are untrue .
The British Government worked with British business to promote legitimate commercial interests with Libya , as we do with many other countries .
But there was no link between those legitimate commercial activities and the Scottish Executive ’s decision to release Megrahi .
And as the Scottish Executive has stated , the prognosis issued by the doctor quoted recently in the press ( Karol Sikora ) did not feature in their consideration of Megrahi 's case .
He was released on compassionate grounds based on medical advice from other doctors that he had three months to live .
This is common practice in the Scottish legal system .
I fully understand the concerns expressed by your colleagues in the Senate over Megrahi 's case .
The families of a great many American and British victims continue to suffer as a result of this terrorist atrocity .
However , we have to accept that there is now no mechanism for requiring a person who has been released on compassionate grounds to be returned to prison if they have survived for longer than the prognosis at the time .
I hope that this letter helps to set the record straight and correct inaccuracies which are harmful to the UK .
I and my staff are available to discuss this in greater detail should you find this helpful .

But is Japan 's Hayabusa capsule carrying any precious asteroid dust ?
Japan 's Hayabusa is on its way home after its rendezvous with Itokawa .
Akihiro Ikeshita / Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency
Yesterday in the south central Australian village of Woomera , Japanese scientists , with US and Australian colleagues , celebrated news from their Hayabusa spacecraft — the first round - trip space mission to an asteroid .
Successful manoeuvres that day had put the spacecraft on course to parachute its recovery capsule into the nearby desert on 13 June .
Anticipation will continue to build until the capsule 's lid is opened , offering , they hope , the first peek at asteroid dust .
Scientists anticipate that such samples will provide greater knowledge of these ' little planets ' , shedding light on the beginnings of the Solar System , the origins of life on Earth ( see ' Asteroid ice hints at rocky start to life on Earth ' ) and the connection between asteroids and the tens of thousands of meteorites that have been found on Earth .
" It could establish a bridge for the first time , " says Michael Zolensky , a NASA scientist who will analyse some of the Hayabusa samples .
The original aim of Hayabusa was as a technical mission to test various engineering technologies , such as ion-thrust engines and autonomous navigation systems , needed for landing on an asteroid and returning to Earth .
The spacecraft , launched in May 2003 , landed on the 535 - metre- long Itokawa asteroid twice in November 2005 .
The mission is lucky to get this far , says Hajime Yano , a Hayabusa project scientist with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) .
After the spacecraft landed on Itokawa a second and final time , a massive fuel leak resulted in loss of communication for several months .
Hayabusa 's engines also experienced a range of problems , and its return was uncertain until 8 June , when its faltering thrusters completed the last necessary trajectory correction .
" It 's like a critical patient who can't walk well , " says Yano .
" Up until yesterday , anything could have happened . "
Mission accomplished
Although three years behind schedule , the mission has achieved its major goals , and has already yielded scientific data about Itokawa 's dimensions and composition , which will provide a benchmark for future asteroid studies .
The remaining mission goals are retrieving the sample - return capsule from the desert and analysing any samples within it .
The capsule is a disk - shaped aluminium container about 40 centimetres in diameter , and is scheduled to separate from the craft on 13 June before entering Earth 's atmosphere .
" From their perspective , it 's all gravy , " says Scott Sandford , another NASA scientist working on the project .
" Everything we 're getting now is a bonus , but to me it's the most interesting part . "
“ From their perspective , it 's all gravy . ”
The incoming capsule has a radio beacon to signal its location , and infrared - detection devices on helicopters will also be used to find it .
Even if these fail , monitoring stations will track the burning wreckage of Hayabusa through the atmosphere as a guide to the trajectory of the nearby capsule .
JAXA scientists will retrieve the capsule on 14 June , and by the end of the week , they hope to have it back in their laboratory in Sagamihara , just south of Tokyo .
There they will first take X - ray images to estimate the amount of dust picked up — if any .
High hopes
Zolensky says they were originally hoping to have " spoonfuls , several grams of sample " , made up of " chips like peanut - size grains " .
But sample collection did n't go as planned .
Pellets designed to hit Itokawa to dislodge loose fragments seem not to have fired .
" It 's very likely we wo n't be able to see anything with the naked eye , " says Makoto Yoshikawa , also a Hayabusa project scientist at JAXA .
ADVERTISEMENT
Still , the scientists have high hopes .
A hard impact on Hayabusa 's first landing attempt on the asteroid is likely to have kicked up dust , says Yoshikawa .
Hayabusa sat on the surface for 30 minutes after that .
Zolensky agrees : " Just the fact that it landed should cover it in dust .
The astronauts on the Moon got covered with dust just walking around .
The mission team might not get grams , but they 'll have something .
With today 's technologies , even microbe - sized particles should be enough . "
On the basis of the X - ray results , the researchers will decide when and how to open the lid and distribute the contents between analysis and storage .
Any dust that is found will be analysed over the next six months as scientists look at oxygen isotopes , helium content , water traces , and other clues that might provide insight into Itokawa 's history .
" We want to look at its elemental composition and structure , " says Yoshikawa .
" When this asteroid was born , what kind of matter was around ?
This will tell us about Earth and the Solar System . "
While some people are trying to make things bigger , let ’s now plunge into amazing miniature world and
bring an extremely sharp eyes to smaller and more intricate things .
With today ’s miniature art showcase we ’ll cover a range of amazing visual experiences with particular emphasis on a diminutive size .
Those miniatures we collected for you show just what a human patience and diligence can do .
So please , enjoy these magnificent tiny creations of the world ’s smallest art .

The freshly launched " International Traditional Knowledge Institute " ( ITKI ) is an ambitious effort to preserve , restore and promote the re-use of traditional skills and inventions from all over the world .
It includes an online encyclopaedia of low - tech know - how , though it will take many years before it is completed .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lewis Mumford wrote in 1970 :
" The great feat of medieval technics was that it was able to promote and absorb many important changes without losing the immense carryover of inventions and skills from earlier cultures .
In this lies one of its vital points of superiority over the modern mode of monotechnics , which boasts of effacing , as fast and as far as possible , the technical achievements of earlier periods . "
The Traditional Knowledge Institute writes in 2010 :
" Today , traditional knowledge is in danger and its disappearance would not only cause the loss of people 's capability to keep and pass on the artistic and natural heritage , but also of an extraordinary source of knowledge and cultural diversity from which appropriate innovative solutions can be derived today and in the future . "
The idea to set up a data bank of traditional knowledge was launched by Italian Pietro Laureano , architect , town planner , author and UNESCO consultant on arid areas , Islamic society and endangered ecosystems .
Laureano worked in the Sahara desert for eight years and coordinated pilot projects in Algeria , Jordan , Yemen and Ethiopia .
" We want to pick up the thread of tradition again " , he said in an interview with French newspaper Le Monde earlier this week .
" Cultural heritage is not only to be found in monuments and galleries .
It is also in the works and the landscapes of man . "
Traditional Knowledge Database
At the moment , the project exists entirely on paper , except for a physical site currently in ruins ( the Gualchiere di Remole , a medieval walled town in Italy which will house the headquarters of the organisation ) , and a prototype of the " Traditional Knowledge World Bank " - which looks very promising .
Take a look at the icon page , for example .
It reads like a " to - write list " for Low - tech Magazine , and in fact some of the topics are in the making .
However , it is a " to - write list " for the UNESCO as well , because the data bank is mainly an empty box .
Behind most of the icons there is only fragmentary information or no information at all .
Most data now available deals with water management in arid areas .
Dozens of experts will need many years to archive , study and publish traditional skills from all over the world , said Laureano in the interview .
The headquarters , which will be a showcase for traditional technologies , would be finished earlier , in 3 to 4 years .
Mission statement
From the summary of the project :
" The Traditional Knowledge Institute gathers and protects historical knowledge and promotes and certifies innovative practises based on the modern re-proposal of tradition as well .
Using traditional knowledge does not mean to reapply directly the techniques of the past , but rather to understand the logic of this model of knowlegde .
It is a dynamic system able to incorporate innovation subjected to the test of the long term and thus achieves local and environmental sustainability . "
The Institute is also an economic actor : " Companies that reintroduce traditional techniques in innovative ways or who look for appropriate solutions will be selected " .
The initiative is aimed at poor and developing countries , and that 's for now my only criticism : I think the first world needs exactly the same kind of thinking and technology .
The work is supported by UNESCO , the UNCCD , the Italian Ministry of Environment , and the Regional Government of Tuscany .
There is more information to be found at the Research Centre on Local and Traditional knowledge ( IPOGEA , created in 1993 ) and at The International Centre on Traditional Knowledge ( IKTNET , created in 2007 ) .
Both organisations will be responsible for the development of the database .
On IKTNET is another database prototype to be found , which looks and feels like a blog .

You 've slipped to second place for the first time in years .
The good news is that it's in Secunia 's ranking of the top ten companies with the most software vulnerabilities , which is now topped by Apple -- Microsoft remains in third place , followed by HP and Adobe .
According to Secunia , Apple 's vulnerabilities are mostly not in OS X , but in Safari , iTunes and other applications .
What 's important to note , however , is that Secunia 's definition of " vulnerability " does n't simply include dangerous , exploitable vulnerabilities , so the rankings do n't necessarily indicate which software is the most insecure from a user 's point of view .
One vulnerability that is potentially serious , however , is an issue with Safari's AutoFill feature recently discovered by Jeremiah Grossman of WhiteHat Security .
According to Grossman , a malicious website can exploit the feature to pull data from a user 's address book without their knowledge , which has been demonstrated to take " mere seconds " by a bit of proof of concept code ( you can try out yourself if you 're feeling trusting ) .
Grossman also says he 's informed Apple of the vulnerability but has n't received a response , and suggests that the only " fix " in the meantime is to turn off the AutoFill feature completely .
AllThingsD has a statement from Apple on the AutoFill issue -- a spokesperson says " we take security and privacy very seriously , " and that , " we 're aware of the issue and working on a fix . "
It takes longer to read books on a Kindle 2 or an iPad versus a printed book , Jakob Nielsen of product development consultancy Nielsen Norman Group discovered in a recent usability survey .
The study found that reading speeds declined by 6.2 % on the iPad and 10.7 % on the Kindle compared to print .
However , Nielsen conceded that the differences in reading speed between the two devices were not " statistically significant because of the data 's fairly high variability " — in other words , the study did not prove that the iPad allowed for faster reading than the Kindle .
A total of 24 participants ( 10 is about average for a usability survey ) were given short stories by Ernest Hemingway to read in print and on iPads , Kindles and desktop PCs .
Hemingway was chosen because his work utilizes simple language and is " pleasant and engaging to read . "
The narratives took an average of 17 minutes and 20 seconds from start to finish — enough time to get readers fully " immersed " in the stories , Nielsen explained .
After reading , participants filled out a brief comprehension questionnaire to make sure no one had skimmed through a story .
Users rated their satisfaction with each device ; the iPad , Kindle and printed book scored 5.8 , 5.7 and 5.6 , on a scale of 7 , respectively , while the PC received an average score of 3.6 — due , in part , because reading on a PC reminded readers of work .
Participants also complained about the weight of the iPad and the Kindle 's weak contrast .
As Nielsen notes , the satisfaction ratings on the survey are promising for the future of e-readers and tablet devices .
However , I can see universities and businesses taking less kindly to e-readers if further studies prove that they handicap reading speed .
What do you think of the results ?
Do you prefer to read on an e-reader , tablet or in print — and why ?

Comparative photos of Mount Everest ' confirm ice loss ' Published duration 16 July 2010
image caption Experts say comparing the 1921 photo ( left ) with the photo of 2010 proves that the ice mass is disappearing
Photos taken by a mountaineer on Everest from the same spot where similar pictures were taken in 1921 have revealed an " alarming " ice loss .
The Asia Society ( AS ) arranged for the pictures to be taken in exactly the same place where British climber George Mallory took photos in 1921 .
" The photographs reveal a startling truth : the ice of the Himalaya is disappearing , " an AS statement said .
" They reveal an alarming loss in ice mass over an 89 - year period . "
Shrunken and withered
The photos taken by Mallory from the north face of Everest reveal a powerful , white , S - shaped sweep of ice .
image caption Experts say that the evidence is incontrovertible
Images taken from the same spot in 2010 by mountaineer David Breashears show that the main Rongbuk Glacier is shrunken and withered .
" Returning to the exact same vantage points , Breashears has meticulously recreated their shots , pixel for pixel , " the AS statement said .
" The photographs illustrate the severity of the loss of ice mass among the glaciers surrounding Mount Everest . "
The AS says that the findings are " vitally important " because the Himalaya is home to the world 's largest sub - polar ice reserves .
" The melt waters of these high altitude glaciers supply crucial seasonal flows to the Ganges , Brahmaputra , Salween , Irrawaddy , Mekong , Yangtze and Yellow rivers , which hundreds of millions of people downstream depend on for their livelihoods , " the statement said .
" If the present rate of melting continues , many of these glaciers will be severely diminished by the middle of this century . "
Mr Breashears retraced the steps of the 1921 British Mount Everest Reconnaissance Expedition Team , using photos taken then by surveyor and photographer Maj Edward Wheeler and amateur photographer George Mallory , who later died attempting to reach the Everest summit in 1924 .
" The melt rate in this region of central and eastern Himalaya is extreme and is devastating , " Mr Breashears told an AS meeting in New York on Wednesday .
He has not only followed in the footsteps of Mallory but also those of Italian photographer Vittorio Sella , whose work spanned the 19th and 20th Centuries .
The result is a then - and - now series of photographs from Tibet , Nepal and near K2 in Pakistan - all of which show glaciers in retreat .
" If this is n't evidence of the glaciers in serious decline , I do n't know what is , " Mr Breashears told the AFP news agency .
It was supposed to have been a simple gesture of respect .
Rachael Green , 19 , who just graduated from high school , was among a group of young people who gathered at a West Oakland vigil Tuesday night for a schoolmate slain across town the day before .
Just after midnight , two gunmen approached the group of about 30 people in the parking lot of the Acorn housing complex on Eighth Street and , without warning , sprayed them with dozens of rounds .
Green died and five teenagers were wounded , two critically , making them the latest victims of a trend that has repeated itself with alarming regularity in Oakland : bloodshed at a memorial .
The two young men who fired the shots escaped .
Green , who received her diploma last week from Ralph J. Bunche High School in West Oakland , died at Highland Hospital just before 1 a.m .
The five people wounded ranged in age from 14 to 18 .
' A good girl '
The group had gathered for a candlelight vigil for 17 - year - old Damon Williams of Oakland , who was shot and killed Monday afternoon at a bus stop just steps from the police substation on 73rd Avenue in East Oakland .
Green was " a good girl - she had nothing to do with nothing .
She was n't doing anything wrong , " Acorn complex resident Ron Muhammad , 42 , said Wednesday .
" It 's a lot of senseless violence right now .
People do n't have nothing to do , a lot of frustration going back and forth . "
Oakland officers are routinely put on alert when there are funerals on their beat .
The shooting early Wednesday happened only minutes after a patrol officer checked the area , said Officer Jeff Thomason , a police spokesman .
Homicide Sgt. Jim Rullamas noted that shooters have targeted other memorials for homicide victims , most recently when gunfire erupted April 27 at an East Oakland church during a funeral for an 18 - year - old man slain at his birthday party .
" I do n't remember it happening like this in years past , and now it happens frequently .
It 's a shame , " Rullamas said .
" There 's no rules , " Muhammad said .
" If there was a rule in terms of the madness , I mean , there would n't be madness .
So you 've got the blind leading the blind - ain't got no guidance in terms of that .
That 's why we 're getting what we 're getting . "
Green was a " fun person who loved to hang out with her friends .
She loved to make people laugh , " said a friend , Andra Gadson , 19 .
" She was always known as the girl with the bright - colored hair .
She loved making people feel good .
That was Rachael . "
Gadson said it was " just sad " that people can't " mourn in a safe environment without stuff like this happening . "
' Nice , outgoing '
" She was a nice , outgoing person , " said Natalia Williams , 19 , as she pushed her young child in a stroller on Adeline Street .
" It 's real messed up .
I just do n't understand what 's going on out here . "
The latest burst of violence came two days after three men approached Williams while he was at the bus stop , and one of them shot him during an argument , police said .
Ricardo DePalm , 18 , was arrested a short time later at his home a few blocks away , after a police captain saw him running from the scene .
He is being held without bail at a downtown Oakland jail on suspicion of murder .
Suspect dropped out
Williams had just finished his junior year at the same school that Green attended , Ralph J. Bunche High , said Troy Flint , Oakland Unified School District spokesman .
DePalm completed his junior year at Leadership Preparatory High School in East Oakland in June 2009 but did not return for his senior year , Flint said .
" It 's just heartbreaking that these incidents continue to happen , particularly at a time of year when we 're supposed to be celebrating the progress of young people into better opportunities , " Flint said .
" It really underscores the need for the school district to work with all parts of the Oakland community to create a stronger culture that supports children . "
Estimates of the United states population at the middle of the 21st century vary , from the U.N. ’s 404 million to the U.S. Census Bureau ’s 422 to 458 million .
To develop a snapshot of the nation at 2050 , particularly its astonishing diversity and youthfulness , I use the nice round number of 400 million people , or roughly 100 million more than we have today .

How will populations change in the United States over the next 40 years ?
Interview by Terence MonmaneySpecial Thanks to Joel Kotkin Video : Q & A : Joel Kotkin
The United States is also expected to grow somewhat older .
The portion of the population that is currently at least 65 years old — 13 percent — is expected to reach about 20 percent by 2050 .
This “ graying of America ” has helped convince some commentators of the nation ’s declining eminence .
For example , an essay by international relations expert Parag Khanna envisions a “ shrunken America ” lucky to eke out a meager existence between a “ triumphant China ” and a “ retooled Europe . ”
Morris Berman , a cultural historian , says America “ is running on empty . ”
But even as the baby boomers age , the population of working and young people is also expected to keep rising , in contrast to most other advanced nations .
America ’s relatively high fertility rate — the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime — hit 2.1 in 2006 , with 4.3 million total births , the highest levels in 45 years , thanks largely to recent immigrants , who tend to have more children than residents whose families have been in the United States for several generations .
Moreover , the nation is on the verge of a baby boomlet , when the children of the original boomers have children of their own .
Between 2000 and 2050 , census data suggest , the U.S. 15 - to - 64 age group is expected to grow 42 percent .
In contrast , because of falling fertility rates , the number of young and working - age people is expected to decline elsewhere : by 10 percent in China , 25 percent in Europe , 30 percent in South Korea and more than 40 percent in Japan .
Within the next four decades most of the developed countries in Europe and East Asia will become veritable old - age homes : a third or more of their populations will be over 65 .
By then , the United States is likely to have more than 350 million people under 65 .
The prospect of an additional 100 million Americans by 2050 worries some environmentalists .
A few have joined traditionally conservative xenophobes and anti-immigration activists in calling for a national policy to slow population growth by severely limiting immigration .
The U.S. fertility rate — 50 percent higher than that of Russia , Germany and Japan and well above that of China , Italy , Singapore , South Korea and virtually all the rest of Europe — has also prompted criticism .
Colleen Heenan , a feminist author and environmental activist , says Americans who favor larger families are not taking responsibility for “ their detrimental contribution ” to population growth and “ resource shortages . ”
Similarly , Peter Kareiva , the chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy , compared different conservation measures and concluded that not having a child is the most effective way of reducing carbon emissions and becoming an “ eco hero . ”
Such critiques do n’t seem to take into account that a falling population and a dearth of young people may pose a greater threat to the nation ’s well - being than population growth .
A rapidly declining population could create a society that does n’t have the work force to support the elderly and , overall , is less concerned with the nation ’s long - term future .
The next surge in growth may be delayed if tough economic times continue , but over time the rise in births , producing a generation slightly larger than the boomers , will add to the work force , boost consumer spending and generate new entrepreneurial businesses .
And even with 100 million more people , the United States will be only one - sixth as crowded as Germany is today .
Immigration will continue to be a major force in U.S. life .
The United Nations estimates that two million people a year will move from poorer to developed nations over the next 40 years , and more than half of those will come to the United States , the world ’s preferred destination for educated , skilled migrants .
In 2000 , according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , an association of 30 democratic , free - market countries , the United States was home to 12.5 million skilled immigrants , equaling the combined total for Germany , France , the United Kingdom , Australia , Canada and Japan .
If recent trends continue , immigrants will play a leading role in our future economy .
Between 1990 and 2005 , immigrants started one out of four venture - backed public companies .
Large American firms are also increasingly led by people with roots in foreign countries , including 15 of the Fortune 100 CEOs in 2007 .
For all these reasons , the United States of 2050 will look different from that of today : whites will no longer be in the majority .
The U.S. minority population , currently 30 percent , is expected to exceed 50 percent before 2050 .
No other advanced , populous country will see such diversity .
In fact , most of America ’s net population growth will be among its minorities , as well as in a growing mixed - race population .
Latino and Asian populations are expected to nearly triple , and the children of immigrants will become more prominent .
Today in the United States , 25 percent of children under age 5 are Hispanic ; by 2050 , that percentage will be almost 40 percent .
Growth places the United States in a radically different position from that of Russia , Japan and Europe .
Russia ’s low birth and high mortality rates suggest its overall population will drop by 30 percent by 2050 , to less than a third of the United States ’ .
No wonder Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has spoken of “ the serious threat of turning into a decaying nation . ”
While China ’s population will continue to grow for a while , it may begin to experience decline as early as 2035 , first in work force and then in actual population , mostly because of the government ’s one - child mandate , instituted in 1979 and still in effect .
By 2050 , 31 percent of China ’s population will be older than 60 .
More than 41 percent of Japanese will be that old .
Political prognosticators say China and India pose the greatest challenges to American predominance .
But China , like Russia , lacks the basic environmental protections , reliable legal structures , favorable demographics and social resilience of the United States .
India , for its part , still has an overwhelmingly impoverished population and suffers from ethnic , religious and regional divisions .
The vast majority of the Indian population remains semiliterate and lives in poor rural villages .
The United States still produces far more engineers per capita than India or China .
Suburbia will continue to be a mainstay of American life .
Despite criticisms that suburbs are culturally barren and energy - inefficient , most U.S. metropolitan population growth has taken place in suburbia , confounding oft - repeated predictions of its decline .
Some aspects of suburban life — notably long - distance commuting and heavy reliance on fossil fuels — will have to change .
The new suburbia will be far more environmentally friendly — what I call “ greenurbia . ”
The Internet , wireless phones , video conferencing and other communication technologies will allow more people to work from home : at least one in four or five will do so full time or part time , up from roughly one in six or seven today .
Also , the greater use of trees for cooling , more sustainable architecture and less wasteful appliances will make the suburban home of the future far less of a danger to ecological health than in the past .
Houses may be smaller — lot sizes are already shrinking as a result of land prices — but they will remain , for the most part , single - family dwellings .
A new landscape may emerge , one that resembles the network of smaller towns characteristic of 19th - century America .
The nation ’s landmass is large enough — about 3 percent is currently urbanized — to accommodate this growth , while still husbanding critical farmland and open space .
In other advanced nations where housing has become both expensive and dense — Japan , Germany , South Korea and Singapore — birthrates have fallen , partly because of the high cost of living , particularly for homes large enough to comfortably raise children .
Preserving suburbs may therefore be critical for U.S. demographic vitality .
A 2009 study by the Brookings Institution found that between 1998 and 2006 , jobs shifted away from the center and to the periphery in 95 out of 98 leading metropolitan regions — from Dallas and Los Angeles to Chicago and Seattle .
Walter Siembab , a planning consultant , calls the process of creating sustainable work environments on the urban periphery “ smart sprawl . ”
Super - fuel - efficient cars of the future are likely to spur smart sprawl .
They may be a more reasonable way to meet environmental needs than shifting back to the mass - transit - based models of the industrial age ; just 5 percent of the U.S. population uses mass transit on a daily basis .
One of the urban legends of the 20th century — espoused by city planners and pundits ( and a staple of Hollywood ) — is that suburbanites are alienated , autonomous individuals , while city dwellers have a deep connection to their neighborhoods .
As the 2001 book Suburban Nation puts it , once suburbanites leave the “ refuge ” of their homes they are reduced to “ motorist[s ] competing for asphalt . ”
But suburban residents express a stronger sense of identity and civic involvement than city dwellers .
A recent study by Jan Brueckner , a University of California at Irvine economist , found that density does not , as is often assumed , increase social contact between neighbors or raise overall social involvement ; compared with residents of high - density urban cores , people in low - density suburbs were 7 percent more likely to talk to their neighbors and 24 percent more likely to belong to a local club .
Suburbs epitomize much of what constitutes the American dream for many people .
Minorities , once largely associated with cities , tend to live in the suburbs ; in 2008 they were a majority of residents in Texas , New Mexico , California and Hawaii .
Nationwide , about 25 percent of suburbanites are minorities ; by 2050 immigrants , their children and native - born minorities will become an even more dominant force in shaping suburbia .
The baby boom generation is poised for a large - scale “ back to the city ” movement , according to many news reports .
But Sandra Rosenbloom , a University of Arizona gerontology professor , says roughly three - quarters of retirees in the first bloc of boomers appear to be sticking close to the suburbs , where the vast majority reside .
“ Everybody in this business wants to talk about the odd person who moves downtown , ” Rosenbloom observes .
“ [ But ] most people retire in place .
When they move , they do n’t move downtown , they move to the fringes . ”
To be sure , there will be 15 million to 20 million new urban dwellers by 2050 .
Many will live in what Wharton business professor Joseph Gyourko calls “ superstar cities , ” such as San Francisco , Boston , Manhattan and western Los Angeles — places adapted to business and recreation for the elite and those who work for them .
By 2050 , Seattle , Portland and Austin could join their ranks .
But because these elite cities are becoming too expensive for the middle class , the focus of urban life will shift to cities that are more spread out and , by some standards , less attractive .
They ’re what I call “ cities of aspiration , ” such as Phoenix , Houston , Dallas , Atlanta and Charlotte .
They ’ll facilitate upward mobility , as New York and other great industrial cities once did , and begin to compete with the superstar cities for finance , culture and media industries , and the amenities that typically go along with them .
The Wall Street Journal noted that commercial success has already turned Houston , once considered a backwater , into “ an art mecca . ”
One of the least anticipated developments in the nation ’s 21st - century geography will be the resurgence of the region often dismissed by coastal dwellers as “ flyover country . ”
For the better part of the 20th century , rural and small - town communities declined in percentage of population and in economic importance .
In 1940 , 43 percent of Americans lived in rural areas ; today it ’s less than 20 percent .
But population and cost pressures are destined to resurrect the hinterlands .
The Internet has broken the traditional isolation of rural communities , and as mass communication improves , the migration of technology companies , business services and manufacturing firms to the heartland is likely to accelerate .
Small Midwestern cities such as Fargo , North Dakota , have experienced higher than average population and job growth over the past decade .
These communities , once depopulating , now boast complex economies based on energy , technology and agriculture .
( You can even find good restaurants , boutique hotels and coffeehouses in some towns . )
Gary Warren heads Hamilton Telecommunications , a call center and telecommunications - services firm that employs 250 people in Aurora , Nebraska .
“ There is no sense of dying here , ” Warren says .
“ Aurora is all about the future . ”
Concerns about energy sources and hydrocarbon emissions will also bolster America ’s interior .
The region will be pivotal to the century ’s most important environmental challenge : the shift to renewable fuels .
Recent estimates suggest the United States has the capacity to produce annually more than 1.3 billion dry tons of biomass , or fuels derived from plant materials — enough to displace 30 percent of the current national demand for petroleum fuels .
That amount could be produced with only modest changes in land use , agricultural and forest - management practices .
Not since the 19th century , when the heartland was a major source of America ’s economic , social and cultural supremacy , has the vast continental expanse been set to play so powerful a role in shaping the nation ’s future .
What the United States does with its demographic dividend — its relatively young working - age population — is critical .
Simply to keep pace with the growing U.S. population , the nation needs to add 125,000 jobs a month , the New America Foundation estimates .
Without robust economic growth but with an expanding population , the country will face a massive decline in living standards .
Entrepreneurs , small businesses and self - employed workers will become more common .
Between 1980 and 2000 the number of self - employed individuals expanded , to about 15 percent of the work force .
More workers will live in an economic environment like that of Hollywood or Silicon Valley , with constant job hopping and changes in alliances among companies .
For much of American history , race has been the greatest barrier to a common vision of community .
Race still remains all too synonymous with poverty : considerably higher poverty rates for blacks and Hispanics persist .
But the future will most likely see a dimming of economic distinctions based on ethnic origins .
Since 1960 , the proportion of African - American households at or below the poverty line ( $ 22,000 annually for a family of four in 2008 dollars ) has dropped from 55 to 25 percent , while the black middle class has grown from 15 to 39 percent .
From 1980 to 2008 , the proportion who are considered prosperous — households making more than $ 100,000 a year in 2008 dollars — grew by half , to 10.3 percent .
Roughly 50 percent more African - Americans live in suburbs now than in 1980 ; most of those households are middle class , and some are affluent .
The most pressing social problem facing mid-21st - century America will be fulfilling the historic promise of upward mobility .
In recent decades certain high - end occupation incomes grew rapidly , while wages for lower - income and middle - class workers stagnated .
Even after the 2008 economic downturn , largely brought on by Wall Street , it was primarily middle - class homeowners and jobholders who bore the brunt , sometimes losing their residences .
Most disturbingly , the rate of upward mobility has stagnated overall , as wages have largely failed to keep up with the cost of living .
It is no easier for poor and working - class people to move up the socio- economic ladder today than it was in the 1970s ; in some ways , it ’s more difficult .
The income of college - educated younger people , adjusted for inflation , has been in decline since 2000 .
To reverse these trends , I think Americans will need to attend to the nation ’s basic investments and industries , including manufacturing , energy and agriculture .
This runs counter to the fashionable assertion that the American future can be built around a handful of high - end creative jobs and will not require reviving the old industrial economy .
A more competitive and environmentally sustainable America will rely on technology .
Fortunately , no nation has been more prodigious in its ability to apply new methods and techniques to solve fundamental problems ; the term “ technology ” was invented in America in 1829 .
New energy finds , unconventional fuel sources and advanced technology are likely to ameliorate the long - prophesied energy catastrophe .
And technology can ease or even reverse the environmental costs of growth .
With a population of 300 million , the United States has cleaner air and water now than 40 years ago , when the population was 200 million .
The America of 2050 will most likely remain the one truly transcendent superpower in terms of society , technology and culture .
It will rely on what has been called America ’s “ civil religion ” — its ability to forge a unique common national culture amid great diversity of people and place .
We have no reason to lose faith in the possibilities of the future .

But rank - and - file members are wondering at what point the UAW ’s promotion of the car companies will mean the neglect of their own concerns .
The union received a seat on the boards of GM and Chrysler as part of the VEBA arrangement , and the person who holds that seat at GM was recently named a vice chairman at the company .
Gregg Shotwell , a retired GM worker and a co-founder of Soldiers of Solidarity , the largest of the UAW ’s many splinter groups , sent me this news in an e-mail with the header “ Can you say , ‘CONFLICT OF INTEREST !!!’ ”
Shotwell believes the problems with the union ’s ownership stakes are self - evident .
As he told me , “ What ’s best for VEBA , what ’s best for company stock , is n’t always best for the average worker . ”
When I spoke to UAW President Ron Gettelfinger inside the Cobo Center , he sounded as boosterish about the car companies as did the industry executives who were pitching their new models in the adjoining showrooms .
He had just finished addressing foreign press in a conference hall overlooking the Detroit River and the casinos on the opposite bank .
He urged me to see an “ inspiring ” infomercial that Ford had aired on ABC the night before , and he predicted great things from a Fiat - led Chrysler .
“ Sergio has a way of building off his strengths , ” he said of Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne .
Gettelfinger is retiring in June , after navigating the union through one of its most tumultuous periods .
At the auto show , he summed up his attitude with a simple mantra : “ If you ’re not an optimist , you ’re a pessimist . ”
Gary Chaison , a professor of industrial relations at Clark University , explained that the UAW is now unlikely to take any action that might harm American car manufacturers .
“ The UAW sees GM as its future .
You do n’t argue with your future , ” he explained .
The union did organize its own rally outside the auto show later that week .
Its target was not GM or Ford , but Toyota .
Ten workers from Toyota ’s only unionized U.S. auto plant , a factory in Fremont , California , that had long operated as a joint venture with GM , were flown to Detroit to help lobby against the facility ’s closure .
Despite this protest and others , Toyota shuttered the plant in April .
But last year , when GM abandoned the partnership , the UAW had remained silent , and it has done little to publicly oppose recent closings at dozens of Big Three factories .
Bob King is expected to be elected the union ’s new president .
He has already said that he intends to make the organization more transparent and improve its public image .
With membership down to about 355,000 , from a 1979 peak of 1.5 million , the UAW King inherits must also attempt to organize different sectors of the economy and form alliances with other unions .
Additionally , it must overcome the growing distrust within its own ranks .
As the UAW ’s lead negotiator with Ford , King tried to persuade workers this past fall to accept concessions similar to those made at Chrysler and GM .
Along with Gettelfinger , he argued that Ford was wallowing in debt and needed the concessions to remain competitive .
But at the same time , the company was touting its return to profitability .
The concessions were overwhelmingly voted down .
When King stumped for the contract changes at a Dearborn , Michigan , truck plant , workers shouted him off the stage .
This , of course , is why it 's so important to put a reliable liberal vote on the Supreme Court .
Left to its own devices , the Roberts court will continue to chip away at our civil liberties :
The Supreme Court backed off Tuesday from strict enforcement of its historic Miranda decision , ruling that a crime suspect 's words can be used against him if he fails to clearly tell police that he does not want to talk .
In the past , the court said the " burden rests on the government " to show that a crime suspect had " knowingly and intelligently waived " his rights .
Some police departments tell officers not to begin questioning until a suspect has waived his rights , usually by signing a waiver form ..
But in Tuesday 's 5 - 4 decision , the court shifted the balance in favor of the police , saying a suspect has a duty to speak up and say he does not want to talk .
Moreover , the police are " not required to obtain a waiver " of the suspect 's " right to remain silent before interrogating him , " Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote .
In her first strongly written dissent , Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the ruling " turns Miranda upside down " and " marks a substantial retreat from the protection against compelled self - incrimination . "
Some experts on police questioning said the court 's subtle shift would be felt in station houses across the country .
" This is the most important Miranda decision in a decade .
And it will have a substantial impact on police practices , " said Charles Weisselberg , a law professor at UC Berkeley .
" This decision approves of the practice of giving the warnings and then asking questions of the suspect , without asking first whether he wants to waive his rights . "
The solar energy market has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past two years , driven by a new abundance of polysilicon , the effects of the worldwide financial crisis , and the plunging price of solar modules .
As a result of these factors , the solar industry has shifted from supply - constrained to demand - driven , and a few strong companies have been able to improve their revenues and market share based on a low cost per watt combined with high module efficiency .
According to a new report from Pike Research , this market realignment will set the stage for a new era of solar growth over the next several years , and the cleantech market intelligence firm anticipates that by 2013 , in many markets , solar costs will reach the long - elusive goal of grid parity , the cost of electricity from traditional power sources .
Between 2010 and 2013 , Pike Research forecasts that solar demand will increase at a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 24 % .
“ Solar prices are plunging quickly , and lower pricing will fuel a surge in demand in 2010 and beyond , ” says senior analyst Dave Cavanaugh .
“ However , pricing trends and oversupply of solar modules will also place huge pressure on solar suppliers , especially Tier 2 and Tier 3 companies that are not well - equipped to weather the storm .
We expect a significant shakeout among solar suppliers in the next two years . ”
According to the report , 10 key factors , which are listed below , will determine success and survival for solar suppliers during this period of industry consolidation .
Low - cost polysilicon and wafers
Low - cost process materials
Low - cost processing
Module efficiency
Economies of scale
Market presence in key growth countries
Supply chain integration
Strong balance sheets and internal financing of growth
Module manufacturing in North America and low - cost European Union countries
Strong position in niche markets
Pike Research ’s report , “ Global Solar Energy Outlook ” includes a detailed analysis of key solar industry players and outlines the key differentiators that will cause some suppliers to thrive , and others to fall by the wayside .

Horny NBA fans are about to get a rude awakening -- those obnoxious World Cup horns are officially vuvuzela non grata at the big Game 7 tonight in Los Angeles .
TMZ spoke with a rep for the STAPLES Center in L.A. -- where the deciding game between L.A. Lakers and the Boston Celtics is scheduled to go down -- and we 're told the arena bans ALL noisemakers , " so if you bring a vuvuzela you would not be able to bring it in with you . "
Ironically , the ban does n't seem to include thundersticks -- every foul shot shooter 's nightmare -- which arena ushers hand out at halftime .
and not just for 1970s ads about gum or newport cigarettes
Think it 's hot this summer ?
Wait until you see Google 's simulation of a world with an average global temperature rise of 4C .
Using a map that was first launched by the former Labour administration in October 2009 , the coalition government has taken temperature data from the Met Office Hadley Centre and other climate research centres and imposed it on to a Google Earth layer .
It 's a timely arrival , with warnings this month that current international carbon pledges will lead to a rise of nearly 4C and the Muir Russell report censuring some climate scientists for not being more open with their data ( but exonerating them of manipulating the scientific evidence ) .
Unlike a similar tool using IPCC data that was launched by Google in the run-up to the Copenhagen climate conference last year , this map will be updated regularly with new data .
It also has a series of YouTube videos of experts across the globe , with Met Office staff talking about forest fires in sub-Saharan Africa and researchers at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research explaining sea level rises .
To go more in - depth you can follow links to government sites , such as this one on water availability in a warming world .
Playing with the layer is surprisingly addictive , mainly thanks to Google Earth 's draggable interface .
Unlike the static map of last year , it also has the bonus of showing more obviously how temperature rises will differ drastically around the world .
The poles glow a red ( a potential rise of around 10C ) while most of northern Europe escapes with light orange 2 - 3C rises .
Other hotspots , such as Alaska , the Amazon and central Asia , also stand out .
Neatly , you can turn different climate " impacts " on and off .
If you just want to see which regions will be worst affected by sea level rises - such as the UK and Netherlands as well as low - lying island states - you can .
One limitation is that you have to zoom out to continental level to see the layer : if you 're zoomed on your street , you can't see it .
Climate change minister Greg Barker launched the map today alongside the government 's chief scientist , Prof John Beddington .
Barker said : " This map reinforces our determination to act against dangerous man-made climate change .
We know the stakes are high and that 's why we want to help secure an ambitious global climate change deal . "
The layer , of course , is n't the only one with an environmental theme to land on Google Earth .
The UN 's environment programme has one showing deforestation , WWF has a layer highlighting its projects across the globe and Google even has its own climate change " tours " for Google Earth .
What other good green Earth layers have you stumbled across ?
And how do you rate the newest addition from the UK government ?
• The government 's map , ' The impact of a global temperature rise of 4 C ' , is here ( you 'll need a browser plug - in or the Google Earth app installed to view it )
This looks straight out of a plot from a mediocre CBS drama , but nope , it ’s absolutely true : earlier this week , male Asian porn star Herbert Wong ( Porn name : Tom Dong ) was killed in a “ samurai - style sword attack ” by a fellow porn-star Steven Hill ( Porn name : Steven Driver ) at a fetish porn studio in Southern California , as reported by the LA Weekly .
The killer — who is still at - large — was known to be friends with the victim , where they appeared on this DVD cover box together .
( No , we ’re not going to link to the uncensored image ; you guys read blogs , therefore you know how to use Google . )
As for a motive :
Hill had been sleeping on a couch at the porn warehouse , and had been updating the adult based website as well as acting in a few movies .
Police said Hill was asked to move out a few weeks earlier .
“ [ Hill ] was n’t performing up to standards and a few weeks ago he was told he would have to leave , ” said LAPD detective Joel Price .
“ They were n’t happy with his product and he had been given a date of [ June 2 ] to leave …
He knew today was the day he had to be gone . ”
On one hand : this is sad .
Someone lost their life over this .
Two other people are in the hospital .
And straight Asian male porn stars are like endangered Yangtze River dolphins : we do n’t really know how many of them there are , but we only know of three or four , one of them is now dead and we ’ve already blogged the last known occurrence .
On the flip side : Really , LAPD detective Joel Price ?
“ Happy with his product ? ” Liiiike … his webmaster skills ?
His acting abilities ?
His penis ?
Did you , like , start high - fiving the rest of your buddies in the office after releasing out the statement ?
Because this Asian - American blogger is trying to take his job of reblogging shit seriously , and all I can really think of is , “ He could n’t perform up to standards folks ; the key word here is UP !
HEY - YO ! ”
When the Indiana Atheist Bus Campaign and American Humanist Association wanted to spark a public conversation last spring about the origin of religion , they plastered Chicago 's buses with a provocative twist on Genesis : " In the beginning , man created God . "
When the Chicago Coalition of Reason wanted to proclaim that no one needs
God to be good , they posted a billboard a few months later above a LaSalle Street sandwich shop in Chicago 's Loop .
So when the Wisconsin - based Freedom From Religion Foundation took its controversial slogan touting the benefits of sleeping in on Sundays to honor the day of rest , they came to Chicago first , a city where they knew they would be welcome .
" There are more freethinkers in Chicago than we have in our membership , " said Annie Laurie Gaylor , co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation , which rolled out a series of ads on Chicago buses this month .
Freethinkers argue that beliefs should be based on rationality , not on religious tradition or dogma .
" We have to reach them , provide an alternative to religion and let them know we 're here .
Many of us reject the idea of blind faith , " Gaylor said .
Historically scorned and forced to live in silence for decades , atheists , agnostics and self - described freethinkers are basking in the glow of a renaissance , spreading their gospel of reason in lieu of religion with billboards , bus placards and celebrity endorsements .
Advocates have found particularly fertile ground in the diverse religious landscape of Chicago , where the American rationalist movement took root at the turn of the 20th century .
Their messages vary .
While some secularists want to promote an ethic of goodwill toward men and women and show like - minded people that they are n't alone , others want to dish out what they have been taking all these years .
" This is a reaction to the newly emergent political power of Christians , " said Phil Zuckerman , professor of sociology at Pitzer College in Claremont , Calif. , referring to the religious right movement of the past 30 years .
" I think secular people feel they need to respond if they want to shape their own world and society . "
The campaigns also signal a demographic shift , said Ariela Keysar , associate director for the Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture at Trinity College in Hartford , Conn .
" They have a growing audience , " she said .
" They have people who can not only pay attention but sympathize with that message . "
The most recent American Religious Identification Survey , conducted in 2008 , found that the " no religion " category was the only group to have grown in the continental United States since the previous poll in 1990 .
Nationally , the " nones , " as they have been dubbed , nearly doubled , from 8 percent to 15 percent .
In Illinois , the " none " population grew from 8 percent to 13 percent .
Experts say those numbers do n't account for the atheists and agnostics who still stay mum about religion .
In fact , nonbelievers have felt alienated for decades , said Hemant Mehta , coordinator of the Chicago Coalition of Reason , the group that sponsored a billboard last fall that asked passers - by : " Are you good without God ? Millions are . "
" Our goal was to say ' Hey , atheists out there already , we 're here .
If you agree with us , come check us out , ' " Mehta said .
" Meeting people who are like - minded can be really tough for atheists . "
Matt Lowry , 37 , a science teacher in Vernon Hills and the organizer of the North Suburban Chicago Freethinkers , said he never wore his beliefs , or lack thereof , on his sleeve .
But the more it came up in conversation , the more he realized how the collective silence has caused atheists and agnostics to be misunderstood .
" Just because you 're a nonbeliever does not mean you 're kicking little old ladies down the stairs or eating babies , " Lowry said .
" There 's this common misperception .
For too long , the nonbelieving community in this country has basically allowed religious fundamentalists to define them that way . "
Though nonbelievers generally eschew dogma , they do abide by a moral code much like the world 's major religions .
Zuckerman said the golden rule —
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you — is the " sum total of atheist morality . "
Nonbelievers also generally value independent thinking , freedom of thought , freedom of speech and equality , he said .
It 's hard to know if the confrontational way these groups present their message is healthy for the body politic , said the Rev. Paul Rutgers , co-executive director of the Council of Religious Leaders of Metropolitan Chicago .
" Quite obviously a significant portion of the religious community is going to be upset , " Rutgers said .
" We 'll probably do several things , including be angry and deeply offended .
Perhaps also some will give more serious thought to their own faith commitments .
The fact of the matter is we 're living in a culture that in many ways beyond this challenges our faith commitments .
So in that regard it 's a reminder that in many respects this is not a friendly environment . "

Perhaps you 've heard that smut peddler Teri Gross ' filthy interview show , Fresh Air has been pulled from Mississippi Public Broadcasting 's lineup .
What offended a listener 's southern sensibility Comedian Louis CK explaining why he always has sex with his shirt on .
We speculated that a segment on Hollywood 's lesbian recruitment film The Kids are Alright might have gotten Fresh Air banned from Mississippi .
But The Rachel Maddow Show 's blog reports that Gross ' July 7 interview with very funny comedian Louis CK sparked a listener complaint , triggering Mississippi Public Broadcasting 's ' zero - tolerance policy for inappropriate content . '
Here 's the exchange in question :
Louis CK : But if I 'm with a woman and she wants to be with me , she must like me .
I definitely have sex with my T - shirt on , always .
I have n't had sex without a shirt on , God , since I was about 23 . "
Terry Gross :
Is that true ?
Louis CK : Yeah , I just do n't think that 's fair .
I mean , you know , let her think she 's with somebody decent , you know ? ... I do have sex sometimes on the show , and there 's a rule that I have to be on my back .
Terry Gross :
Why , because your stomach flattens ?
Louis C.K. : Well , no , God , no .
I 'm not laying back in that bed thinking , " I look awesome right now . "
It 's because I think I should always be the victim of the sex .
I do n't think anyone wants to see me looming over her .
I think that 's an upsetting image .
And then also , the mother - dog stomach that I get when I 'm ... you get the point .
Of course , MPB had no choice but to ban Fresh Air because nobody has sex in Mississippi and there are certainly no unattractive or overweight people who live there .
Australian scientists have discovered never - seen - before prehistoric marine life in the depths of the ocean below the Great Barrier Reef , the University of Queensland said Wednesday .
Ancient “ six - gilled ” sharks , giant oil fish , swarms of crustaceans and many unidentified fish – all of which look worthy of a science - fiction film – were among the astounding marine life caught on camera some 1,400 meters ( 4,593 feet ) below sea level .
The team , led by Justin Marshall , also collected footage of the Nautilius , a relative of the octopus that still lives in a shell as they have done for millions of years .
Team members used special light - sensitive , custom - designed remote controlled cameras that sat on the ocean floor below the Osprey Reef .
“ As well as understanding life at the surface , we need to plunge off the walls of Osprey to describe the deep - sea life that lives down to 2,000 meters , beyond the reach of sunlight , ” Marshall said in a statement .
“ We simply do not know what life is down there , and our cameras can now record the behavior and life in Australia ’s largest biosphere , the deep - sea . ”
Marshall told Australia ’s Herald Sun newspaper that he is now working with taxonomists and experts from around the world to identify these creatures .
" If you go down that deep , you are going to find new species , " he told the paper .
Researcher Andy Dunstand said learning about these creatures ’ primitive eyes and brain could help neuroscientists better understand human vision .
Marshall also said the sea creatures might help researchers better understand brain disorders , which lead to conditions such as epilepsy , explaining that most knowledge on how nerve cells function and communicate was first pioneered through work on giant squid nerve cells .
Deep sea marine life – and the lack of understanding of it – as well as the challenges of working at such depths have been thrust into the national spotlight in recent weeks , as the United States debates the merits of drilling for oil in increasingly deeper waters following the oil disaster off the Gulf of Mexico .
" I think it 's reasonable to say we 've seen more of the moon than the deep sea , " Lisa Levin , a professor of biological oceanography at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , told CNN.com earlier this month .
The unfolding scientific mysteries of the deep are reason enough for some marine biologists to say that we should not be drilling for oil at such depths .
" We have a tendency to wreck things before we even discover them , " Levin said .

An unpleasant sight in any kitchen
Cockroaches " recommend " good food sources to each other by communicating in chemicals , according to scientists .
The much - maligned insects appear to make a collective decision about the best food source .
The study , carried out by a team from Queen Mary , University of London , helps explain why the creatures are often found feeding en masse in our kitchens late at night .
It was published in the journal Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology .
Dr Mathieu Lihoreau from Queen Mary 's School of Biological and Chemical Sciences led the research .
He pointed out that people tend to " kill cockroaches rather than study them " .
" I can understand that , " he told BBC News .
" But it means we do n't know very much about their behaviour . "
It was generally accepted that the insects foraged individually , " but that 's definitely not true , " said Dr Lihoreau .
" Anyone who has cockroaches in their home will tell you that 's wrong - you see them in groups . "
To test his suspicion that the creatures were in fact communicating with each other , he and his colleagues gave a group of cockroaches a food choice test .
" We released them into a small arena where there were two identical food sources , " he explained .
" If they did n't communicate , we would expect that they should just distribute on the two food sources equally . "
But the majority of the hungry cockroaches ( Blattella germanica ) fed solely on one piece of food until it was all gone .
By following individual insects , it also emerged that the more of cockroaches there were on one piece of food , the longer each one would stay to feed .

The hungry insects appear to make a collective decision about what to eat
" We do n't know how they communicate , but we know they 're using chemicals , " Dr Lihoreau explained .
" That will be the next step - to find the chemicals involved in the communication .
" These observations coupled with simulations of a mathematical model indicate that cockroaches communicate through close contact when they are already on the food source . "
He believes that the insects signal to each other using a " foraging pheromone " - possibly a chemical in their saliva or a hydrocarbon on their bodies .
" We think they encounter another cockroach , touch it and say 'ok , that 's another cockroach , its eating good food , I 'll stay ' , " he said .
Once identified , a man - made foraging pheromone could be used to improve pest control , making insecticide gels more effective or be used to create an insecticide - free trap .
We feel that someone has hurt us , but is the hurt we feel caused by the other person ?
Or are the actions of others merely the “ approximate cause ” of the suffering — in other words , the trigger , but not the actual cause of the suffering itself ?
Put that way , it might seem obvious .
Others can’t really make us suffer , at least theoretically !
But it sure can feel that someone else is “ making ” us suffer , right ?
Nonetheless , even the common wisdom is that for someone to hurt us , we have to let someone “ get inside our head . ”
Some of us can be hurt by a slight offense , intended or unintended .
And others of us have made ourselves so tough and armored that we may feel no one can make us feel bad , by God — or Buddha !
But whether we feel powerless against the harm of others , or think we are one tough cookie is in one sense irrelevant .
In either case , Buddhism says the underlying mental / emotional process is the same , and we need to understand the self - inflicted mental origins of our suffering .
This excerpt from an essay by Bhante Bodhidhamma on forgiveness explains how Buddhism analyzes what happens when we are hurt by others .
This particular passage focuses only on the “ how ” of creating our suffering .
For what we can do about when we feel hurt , you might want to look at some of these prior posts .
While a number of the posts focus on what we do when we have hurt others , there ’s plenty about what we can do about our own hurt feelings , when we are the hurt one :

I hope this short teaching below helps you skillfully look into your hurt feelings to discover your own participation in your suffering .
Reading and working with this has been a great help to me , that ’s for sure , and I bring this teaching to mind every time feel hurt by another !
So what happens when we are hurt by another ’s behavior ?
by Bhante Bodhidhamma
Let ’s take the first occasion of an insult .
The word arrives at the ear .
‘ You idiot ! ’
We perceive with the ear not just the sound of the word but also the tone of anger .
We perceive with the eye the signs of anger on the face and in the body language .
We can also sense at the ‘ heart ’ level the emotional feeling .
For instance , we can sense the tension in a room where there has just been an argument .
All this is the point of ‘ contact ’ .
After this the process is internal , dependent on our inner dispositions .
It is recognised .
Upon recognition , it is labelled as ‘ dislikeable ’ .
That is the point of ‘ feeling ’ .
This is determined by our past experience of insults and how we have reacted to them .
Some people will be slightly hurt , others incensed .
When this happens , the heart has reacted upon the hearing .
It feels hurt .
Immediately there rises the ‘ craving ’ to be rid of the hurt .
The normal reaction is to get rid of the person who hurts us and respond to the person in kind .
Or if the threat is too great , we swallow our pride and retire .
These reactions are possessed by the self .
This is called ‘ grasping ’ .
It is only at this point that we actually identify with the process .
Only now does the idea of ‘ me ’ arise .
Once the sense of ‘ I ’ has grasped the reaction of craving , this craving is empowered .
The reaction is willed .
A kamma , an action of thought , speech or body , is performed .
This is the moment of ‘ becoming ’ .
We become the reaction .
We start shouting .
All this , of course , happens in milliseconds .
So the sound of the word strikes the eardrum .
It is recognised .
A feeling of dislike arises .
A reaction of ‘ do n’t want ’ .
The concept of me grasps it .
‘ I ’ do n’t want .
The reaction is empowered .
‘ I ’ do something . ’
Everything from the reception of the word at the ear door and the feeling or touch door has been an internal process dependent on our own inner conditioning .
In this case , we have reinforced a conditioning of angry response , which causes mental turbulence .
This is the way we cause ourselves to suffer .
Even should we swallow the insult and not respond , it festers .
The tiny quip in the morning is inflated through fantasy throughout the day until the heart is so inflamed with its desire for revenge , we can not sleep !
In that virtual reality of the mind , we have punished the person a thousand fold , even to the point of murder !
And all this mental anguish is of our own making .

THE WINTER SOLSTICE DRAWS NEAR .
Now is the “ standstill of the sun . ”
Germinid meteor showers of early December claim the night sky , obscured only by the huge disc of the Wolf Moon .
This is the best season to see the bones of garden plants .
More than twenty years ago , at Green Gulch Farm we celebrated our first annual tree planting with Dr. E. F. Schumacher , author of Small Is Beautiful .
Dr. Schumacher encouraged us to plant trees and to get to know trees in every way .
He reminded us that the Buddha exhorted his disciples to plant , and see to the maintenance of , at least five trees in their lifetime .
In this way stable forests were planted throughout northeastern India , all along the pilgrimage routes of the Buddha .
Planting and maintaining a tree takes time .
It takes your whole life .
Good gardening depends on following your affection and on protecting what you love .
“ The tree says , a kernel is hidden in me , a spark , a thought , ” Herman Hesse writes inWandering .
This winter I sit under our ancient ginkgo tree , planted just outside the garden gate .
The translucent golden leaves , the “ fingernails of Buddha ” in Asia , fell off months ago , revealing the hulking skeleton of this prehistoric tree .
Ginkgo biloba , or the “ maidenhair tree , ” is more than 200 million years old , one of the oldest living species on earth .
For the last 150 million years the ginkgo has not altered its structural design one bit .
Here is a being that simply refuses to evolve .
And yet extracts from the ancient fan - shaped leaves and seed kernels of the ginkgo have been potent in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 5,000 years .
Our craggy ginkgo holds up the leaden winter sky .
This brontosaurus will never be tamed .
During the last ice age , ginkgos nearly became extinct .
They survived only in the mountain eyries of easternmost China .
There , more than 1,000 years ago , Buddhist monks protected these living fossils by planting ginkgos inside their monastery gates .
The prehistoric maidenhair tree owes its survival to a handful of cloud - and - water wanderers who were bound to plant and maintain trees for the sake of future generations .
Today , the Urasenke tea school of Japan has the ancient ginkgo leaf as its crest .
The fan - shaped leaf signifies felicitous and ever - expanding good fortune .
In seventeenth - century Japan , the third - generation tea master Sen Sotan planted a ginkgo tree outside his tea house , Konnichian .
Many years later , a fire raged through Kyoto , burning some of the oldest buildings in the Urasenke compound .
Konnichian was spared .
Legend has it that heat from the fire melted the snow on the topmost branches of the towering ginkgo and thus Konnichian was saved .
Every year in late November , tea ceremony students celebrate the birthday of Sen Sotan by enjoying sweets made from the pounded fruit of his legendary ginkgo .
Nowadays , this pungent fruit of the fertile female ginkgo is rarely seen ; sterile male trees now predominate .
But the ginkgo trees growing along Fifth Avenue in New York City are old trees .
There is nothing sterile about them .
They come from China .
More than any other tree in the world Ginkgo biloba tolerates and transforms air pollution .
In late summer the female ginkgos of Manhattan are heavy with their rancid - smelling fruit .
When the Japaneze Sen master Soen Nakagawa Roshi first came to prBuddha in the Market actice Zen in New York City , he fanned out across the five boroughs with an enlisted band of disciples and collected bags full of foul - smelling ginkgo nuts .
Then , all alone in the kitchen of the New York Zendo , wearing his tattered golden robes , Soen cracked open hundreds of ginkgo kernels and roasted them until they turned brilliant emerald green .
He hid these ginkgo nuts in the sleeves of his monk ’s robes and surprised dour Zen students by offering them bright green fruit from the age of the dinosaurs .
When Thoreau walked through the winter forests of New England , he followed his affections .
A town is saved , he reflected , not more by the righteous people in it than by the woods and swamps that surround it .
This winter , take the time to wrap up in a blanket and sit under a tree .
A kernel is hidden there , a spark , a thought , an echo from the bottom of time .

SAN FRANCISCO —
It was not a happy day for the Happy Meal .
In what it described as a blow against the fattening temptations of fast food , the board of supervisors in Santa Clara County , south of San Francisco , voted Tuesday to ban the promotional toys that often accompany child - size portions of cheeseburgers and chicken nuggets if those meals do n’t meet certain nutritional standards .
The criteria , which are based on federal standards and recommendations from the nonprofit Institute of Medicine , would apply to all fast - food restaurants giving away toys in meals in - tended for children .
Ken Yeager , the board president , said the new law would level “ the playing field by taking away the incentive to choose fatty , sugary foods over healthier options . ”
“ What we ’re trying to do is de-link the connection between unhealthy food and toys , ” said Mr. Yeager , who added that he believed children chose their meals based on the giveaway that came with it .
“ Why would a kid say ‘ I want a burger with fries ’ ?
It ’s the toys that they want . ”
The law , the first of its kind , will allow restaurants to give away toys as long as the meals do n’t contain excessive calories , sodium , sugar or fat .
“ This ordinance does not attack toys , ” Mr. Yeager said just before the board passed the law by a 3 - 2 vote .
“ Toys , in and of themselves , do not make children obese . ”
Romanian model Sanziana Buruiana has started a political party of “ beautiful people ” with the plan to improve the country ’s image .
Her plans include –
Heavily tax obese citizens at a rate of 10 Euros per kilo overweight
Punish people for making dumb blone jokes
Fine of 100 Euros for infidelity
Law stating – only models in bikinis are allowed to work as tourist guides
It does translate into the fact that – only rich people will be allowed to be overweight and cheat on their spouses !
Hot models in bikini as guides – maybe Romania might become the next travel destination for single men !

Next time a Porsche pulls next to you , it might not amaze you with the speed especially if it is made of Kitchen foil and has someone pedaling it inside .
Austrian designer Hannes Langeder has created the world ’s most eco-friendly supercar – Ferdinand GT3 RSX , made out of sticky tape , plastic pipes , and aluminum foil .
And due to the absence of an engine , the pedal powered car looks like a Porsche but is slower than a bicycle .
Some statistics about the car –
Took 1,000 hours to build
Cost $ 10,000
Weighs 99.6 kilograms
Build time – Two and half years
Maximum Speed – unknown
Looks like a Porsche but drives slower than a bicycle
The Ferdinand is currently on display at the Museum of Art Linz in Austria , but Hannes tested it on the track at Germany beforehand – attempted a lap on the German Nurburgring , the infamous race track with no speed limits .

The Obama administration will allow tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans to expire on schedule , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Thursday , setting up a clash with Republicans and a small but vocal group of Democrats who want to delay the looming tax increases .
Mr. Geithner said the White House would allow taxes on top earners to increase in 2011 as part of an effort to bring down the U.S. budget deficit .
He said the White House plans to extend expiring tax cuts for middle - and lower - income Americans , and expects to ...

It 's probably a good thing that not every artist feels the need to throw one more gallery of fetish artwork into the world when they re-imagine classic superheroes .
In fact , sometimes it can be refreshing to see someone opt for cuteness instead of sexiness and illustrate Wolverine , Hellboy , Superman and The Joker as if Jhonen Vasquez and Skottie Young were collaborating on cartoon design concepts .
Christopher Uminga creates art along these lines , and one look into his figures ' glowing eyes will make you want to take one of his subjects home and jam a Ring Pop into its mouth .
I remember seeing a few of these pieces at C2E2 , but the gallery at Uminga 's website showcases a wide variety of masked and bug - eyed attempts at melding adorable looks with macabre implications .
His Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Incredible Hulk may show signs of liver problems in their eyes , but gosh darn it if he does n't make Mr. Freeze look like a playground pal you could share recess and an Eskimo Pie with .
Peruse a few more of Uminga 's works after the jump and see for yourself who you 'd want to be BFF's with if you were 6 years old and in need of a super - buddy .

WINNIPEG —
At least one local hockey fan thinks it ’s criminal the Winnipeg Jets have n’t returned home .
A 33 - year - old resident of Lundar , Manitoba is facing numerous charges after allegedly making a series of 911 calls which included demanding RCMP officers somehow bring the National Hockey League back to the province .
" He began the conversation by saying he wanted the Jets back .
He was quite upset about it , " a justice source told the Free Press on Wednesday .
The incident occurred last year but was never reported publicly by police .
The Free Press uncovered details this week through court documents .
The potential return of the NHL has been a hot topic in recent years , with many believing it ’s a matter of when , not if , Winnipeg gets a team back .
And while the subject usually triggers passionate debate , this is believed to be the first time it has ever prompted police action .
The emergency dispatcher politely told the angry caller there was nothing she could do to help him and reminded him that he was tying up a valuable resource before hanging up .
But the man continued to phone back , claiming he had a lot on his mind .
" He had apparently been drinking and told police he had n’t slept in days .
He started talking about world conglomerates , things like that .
He was hallucinating , obviously , " said the source .
The final straw came when the man began insulting the 911 operator , eventually calling her a crude name .
She warned him that his number had been traced and police were being sent out to arrest him .
" If you ’re coming to get me , can you bring me some smokes , " was his reply .
Police arrested the man without incident and have charged him with public mischief , false messages , harassing phone calls and obstructing justice .
Lawyers are expected to request a psychiatric evaluation when the case returns to Lundar court on Thursday .
It ’s possible the charges could be dropped if doctors believe the man has mental health issues which impacted his actions .
The accused has been receiving medical treatment since his arrest and has been free on bail without incident .
He has no prior criminal record .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
An international team , including Oxford University scientists , has discovered six diverse new planets , from ' shrunken - Saturns ' to ' bloated hot Jupiters ' , as well a rare brown dwarf with 60 times the mass of Jupiter .
The CoRoT ( Convection , Rotation and Transits ) space telescope is operated by the French space agency CNES .
It discovers planets outside our solar system - exoplanets - when they ‘ transit ’ , that is pass in front of their stars .
Once CoRoT detects a transit , additional observations are made from the ground , using a number of telescopes all over the world .
Although astronomers cannot see the planets directly , they use the space - and ground - based data to measure the sizes , masses , and orbits of these new planets precisely .
This is why , among all known exoplanets , those with transits yield the most complete information about planet formation and evolution .
‘ Each of these planets is interesting in its own right , but what is really fascinating is how diverse they are . ’ said co-investigator Dr Suzanne Aigrain from Oxford University ’s Department of Physics .
‘ Planets are intrinsically complex objects , and we have much to learn about them yet . ’
‘ Every discovery of an extrasolar planetary system is a new piece in the puzzle of how these systems do form and evolve .
The more systems we uncover , the better we can hope to understand the processes at play , ’ said Magali Deleuil , researcher at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille ( LAM ) and head of the CoRoT exoplanet program .
The six new planets are :
CoRoT - 8b : the smallest in this batch :
At about 70 % of the size and mass of Saturn , CoRoT - 8b is moderately small among the previously known transiting exoplanets .
Its internal structure should be similar to that of ice giants , like Uranus and Neptune , in the Solar System .
It is the smallest planet discovered by the CoRoT team so far after CoRoT - 7b , the first transiting Super - Earth .
CoRoT - 10b : the eccentric giant :
The orbit of CoRoT - 10 b is so elongated that the planet passes both very close to and very far away from its star .
The amount of radiation it receives from the star varies tenfold in intensity , and scientists estimate that its surface temperature may increase from 250 to 600 °C , all in the space of 13 Earth - days ( the length of the year on CoRoT - 10 b ) .
CoRoT - 11b : the planet whose star does the twist : CoRoT - 11 , the host star of CoRoT - 11b , rotates around its axis in 40 hours .
For comparison , the Sun ’s rotation period is 26 days .
It is particularly difficult to confirm planets around rapidly rotating stars , so this detection is a significant achievement for the CoRoT team .
CoRoT - 12b , 13 b and 14b : a trio of giants :
These three planets all orbit close to their host star but have very different properties .
Although CoRoT - 13b is smaller than Jupiter , it is twice as dense .
This suggests the presence of a massive rocky core inside the planet .
With a radius 50 % large than Jupiter ’s ( or 16 times larger than the Earth ’s ) , CoRoT - 12 b belongs to the family of `bloated hot Jupiters ’ , whose anomalously large sizes are due to the intense stellar radiation they receive .
On the other hand , CoRoT - 14 b , which is even closer to its parent star , has a size similar to Jupiter ’s .
It is also massive , 7.5 times the mass of Jupiter , which may explain why it is less puffed up .
Such very massive and very hot planets are rare , CoRoT - 14b is only the second one discovered so far .
CoRoT - 15b : the brown dwarf : CoRoT - 15 b ’s mass is about 60 times that of Jupiter .
This makes it incredibly dense , about 40 times more so than Jupiter .
For that reason , it is classified as a brown dwarf , intermediate in nature between planets and stars .
Brown dwarfs are much rarer than planets , which makes this discovery all the more exciting .
Dr Suzanne Aigrain leads a team of UK researchers at the Universities of Oxford , Exeter and St Andrews who participate in the CoRoT exoplanet program .
Hunting brown dwarfs
OxSciBlog 's Pete Wilton asked CoRoT team member Suzanne Aigrain of Oxford University 's Department of Physics about ' brown dwarf deserts ' , the gap between giant planets and stars , and what would happen if our solar system had its very own brown dwarf ...
OxSciBlog :
What is a brown dwarf ?
Suzanne Aigrain : A brown dwarf [ BD ] is a celestial object intermediate in mass between a planet and a star .
It 's helpful to recall the definition of a star : a star is a ball of gas held together by its own gravity and which radiates light produced by thermonuclear reactions in its core , mainly burning Hydrogen to produce Helium .
A brown dwarf is an object very much like a star , but which is not massive enough to burn Hydrogen in its core .
As such , brown dwarfs are faint and radiate mainly in the infrared , slowly releasing the heat they accrued during their formation .
On the other hand , according to the International Astronomical Union 's definition , a planet is also held by its own gravity but it is a ) in orbit around a star or brown dwarf and b ) not massive enough to burn Deuterium ( Deuterium is an element which burns even more easily than Hydrogen ) .
Any object which has a mass below the Hydrogen limit but above the Deuterium limit is thus a brown dwarf .
This is the case for CoRoT - 15 b .
The definitions I have given above leave a rather fuzzy area for the case of object which are below the Deuterium burning mass limit but are not in orbit around a star or brown dwarfs - these are sometimes called sub - brown dwarfs or free - floating planets .
OSB : What is the significance of CoRoT finding a BD ?
Are they rare ?
SA : Brown dwarfs are not rare in themselves , on the contrary .
It is difficult to detect and study them , because they are faint compared to stars , so we do n't know as many of them as we know stars , but over the past 20 years , with the advent of better and better infrared detectors , we have been discovering many of them .
What is extremely rare , however , is to find one in a tight orbit around a star , as in the CoRoT - 15 system .
Until a few years ago , we knew of none at all , and this absence was called the ' brown dwarf desert ' .
Now we know of a handful , but CoRoT - 15 b has the shortest orbital period of any known brown dwarf .
The very existence of CoRoT - 15 b in its tight orbit is interesting ( see below ) , but the fact that it transits across the disk of its parent star makes it even more useful , because it enables us to measure its radius .
OSB : What can they tell us about how planets & stars evolve ?
SA : Systems like CoRoT - 15 are very important to understand star and planet formation as well as evolution .
The majority of brown dwarfs are thought to be the result of the same process which forms stars .
Stars form from giant clouds of gas and dust .
Regions in these clouds which are marginally more dense than their surroundings attract more material onto themselves , and these over - densities grow and grow until thermonuclear fusion ignites in the core , and a star is born .
If a clump never grows large enough for that to happen - because the material within its gravitational influence runs out - you get a BD .
So , from the formation point of view , there is nothing fundamentally different between a star and a brown dwarf , but whilst tight binary stars are quite common , tight binary systems involving a star and a brown dwarf are rare .
Why is CoRoT - 15 b different ?
Did it get kicked into its current orbit by a close encounter with another star ?
Could it have formed like a planet , which forms in the disk of material accreting onto a star , instead ?
There are very few BDs in close binaries , and even fewer which transit their parent star .
These are the only BDs whose radii we can measure , so they are very valuable .
If you make a plot of radius versus mass for stars and planets , stars all more or less fall on a single line , which basically is the line you expect for a self - gravitating ball of Hydrogen .
This line flattens out at low masses - from 0.1 solar masses to a Jupiter mass , the expected radius is about 1 Jupiter radius .
However , the measurements for exoplanets are scattered , with a range of radii observed for a given mass .
This is because the radius of a planet is affected not just by its mass , but also by its composition ( how much solid versus gaseous material it contains ) and by the amount of light it receives from its parent star .
CoRoT - 15 b fills an important gap in this diagram , between low - mass stars and planets .
It 's also extremely close to its star , so extremely hot , and hence a particularly strong test of just how much intense irradiation can affect the radius of an object of that mass .
OSB : How might our solar system be different if it contained a BD ?
SA : We know that having a binary companion does not prevent planet formation , since we know of stars which have both one or more planets and a binary companion .
If the Sun had a wide BD companion , the solar system would not necessarily be very different .
We would definitely know about it , however : BDs are faint compared to stars , but a BD that close to us would not be missed .
On the other hand , if the BD was very close - in like CoRoT - 15 b , things would be very different .
I 'll consider two possibilities :
If the BD formed in - situ , there would be no disk , or very little of it , around the Sun , for the planets of the solar system to form out of .
There might have been a disk around the binary ( we have seen such disks around other binaries ) and it's conceivable that this disk might form planets .
We currently know of no such circum - binary planets , but this is at least in part because it is harder to detect them .
But if the BD was captured ( or kicked into a close orbit from a wider one ) after the Sun had formed its planets , then that would most probably have a very dramatic impact , as the gravitational influence of the inbound BD would wreak havoc on the planets and most likely eject them from the solar system !
OSB : What do we hope further CoRoT finds could reveal about BDs ?
SA : CoRoT already found another transiting BD , CoRoT - 3 b .
It is less massive and less close in than CoRoT - 15 b , but the fact that CoRoT found two of these very rare systems shows that it is well - suited to detecting them .
Along with the NASA mission Kepler , which is also searching for transiting planets , CoRoT can hope to discover several more systems like these in the next few years .
They will tell us more about how these rare systems form , about what forms the difference between a massive planet and a BD , and about how BDs evolve when very close to their host star .

It was shocking for all the passengers and the airport authorities to find three boxes full of 45 human heads in a Southwest Airlines cargo last week at the Little Rock National Airport .
It was then known that the heads were for a medical laboratory in Fort Worth and were to be used for training neurosurgeons there .
After the heads were found by Southwest Airlines cargo worker , Whitney Eichinger , a Southwest Spokeswoman said that the incident is surprising .
It is known that usually body parts for medical purposes are transported by air , but in this case the boxes were not properly labeled on the Southwest flight and , therefore , the airline informed the local authorities and the Federal Aviation Administration .
Then , the aviation agency investigator concluded that JLS Consulting Group LLC did not violate any law related to the transportation of hazardous materials .
Pulaski County coroner 's office in Little Rock , on the other hand , questioned the legality of Company .
According to JLS website , the Company is into conducting medical education and research services .
Also , Arkansas secretary of state 's online database , said that the business license of the Company was cancelled last year .
Natasha Naragon , a Spokeswoman for the Secretary of State , said the license cancellation resulted from the incapability of the Company to pay its state franchise taxes and to surrender proper documents .
The federal government ’s national consultation on a digital economy strategy is now past the half - way mark having generated a somewhat tepid response so far .
My weekly technology law column ( Toronto Star version , homepage version ) argues the consultation document itself may bear some of the blame for lack of buzz since the government asks many of the right questions , but lacks a clear vision of the principles that would define a Canadian digital strategy .
One missed opportunity was to shine the spotlight on the principle of " openness " as a guiding principle .
In recent years , an open approach has found increasing favour for a broad range of technology policy issues and has been incorporated into many strategy documents .
For example , New Zealand identified " openness is a central principle of [ its ] Digital Strategy 2.0 . "
The consultation document includes a brief reference to open access for government - funded research , but it seemingly ignores the broader potential for a strategy with openness policies as a key foundational principle .
Where might an openness principle make sense ?
First , open government policies , including the use of the Internet to increase transparency and the adoption of open licences to government content to make it more readily usable and accessible .
Canadian municipalities such as Vancouver , Edmonton , Toronto , and Ottawa have provided leadership in this area in recent months and the federal government could use the digital strategy process to follow their example by committing to an open access approach to government data .
[ open government proposals at the consult site here and here and here ]
Second , open access to publicly - funded research could be mandated throughout the major federal granting agencies .
Many countries have implemented legislative mandates that require researchers who accept public grants to make their published research results freely available online within a reasonable time period .
Canada has emphasized research funding by committing millions to attracting some of the world ’s leading researchers , yet it has lagged on open access and the digital strategy provides an ideal opportunity to catch - up .
[ open access proposal at consult site here ]
Third , the strategy could enhance support for open source software , with a clear government mandate to level the playing field between proprietary and open source software .
Earlier this month , a Quebec court ruled that the provincial government violated the law when it purchased software from Microsoft without considering offers from other vendors .
The federal government has some policies on point , but more can be done to encourage open source software adoption for the benefit of taxpayers and technological development in Canada .
[ open source proposal at consult site here ]
Fourth , network open access requirements mandating certain openness standards in the use of the spectrum that is crucial for wireless telecommunications .
For consumers tired of the " walled garden " approach of some providers that use both contracts and technology to lock - in consumers , open spectrum policies would spur new innovation and heightened competition by facilitating greater consumer mobility and promote the introduction of new services not tied to a single wireless provider .
Fifth , open spectrum that reserves some of the spectrum scheduled for auction for unlicensed uses .
While there is great potential to use auction proceeds to fund some digital strategy initiatives such as rural broadband deployment , reserving some of that spectrum for open purposes – much like wifi – should be another piece of the puzzle .
[ open wireless spectrum at consult site here ]
Sixth , an open investment policy that tears down some of the barriers to foreign participation in the Canadian digital marketplace .
While reducing restrictions is viewed by some groups as a threat to Canadian cultural policy , there should be ways to craft rules that open the door to new foreign participants but maintain many longstanding cultural policies .
At 1,100 feet long , the A Whale is a super - skimmer for a super - spill .
Or at least that 's the sales pitch .
The 10 - story - tall A Whale , a former iron ore carrier converted over a 10 - day period in June to an oil - slurping behemoth by Taiwanese shipping mogul Nobu Su , dwarfs other ships at the Boothville , La. , docks as it readies for 48 hours of testing in the Gulf over the weekend .
If approved by BP and the joint incident command in New Orleans , the A Whale could provide a much - needed scaling up of oil - skimming capacity in the Gulf .
More than 500 medium to small oil skimmers – a five - fold increase since early June – are still largely losing the race to clean up oil escaping from the Macondo well ever since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 and causing what this week became the largest oil spill ever in the Gulf of Mexico .
IN PICTURES : The Gulf oil spill 's impact on nature
Moreover , Mr. Su and his A
Whale are likely to test EPA and Coast Guard red tape that , critics say , has stood in the way of ramping up oil - collection efforts across the Gulf .
" The big hidden story of the Gulf oil spill is lack of capacity , and the A Whale could be key to turning that around and forcing the issue " of excessive red tape , says former Oklahoma Rep.
Ernest Istook , now a fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington .
As BP and the Obama administration have struggled to respond to the oil spewing from the Deepwater Horizon blowout , oil is washing ashore from Pensacola , Fla. , to Venice , La. – a testament , critics say , to the lack of skimming capacity in and around the spill .
Norwegian cleanup protocol , for example , calls for skimmers with a minimum capacity of 9,700 barrels of oil a day ( 407,400 gallons a day ) to work a major offshore spill .
The largest vessels currently in the Gulf have a 4,000 - barrel - a - day capacity .
The Obama administration has been hammered for not calling in larger international skimmers sooner in the spill cleanup , a situation that 's now changing .
But retired Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , the US pointman on the spill , says the main challenge of the spill is that it " presents ... as a massive collection of smaller patches of oil , " which is why the spill unified command is ramping up the numbers – not necessarily the size – of vessels , aiming to put 750 skimming vessels to work by mid-July .
“ From the beginning , our response has been dynamic to match the ever - shifting threat posed by this disaster , and that is why in early June we aggressively increased our focus on skimmers to combat the oil leaking from BP ’s well , ” Allen says .
“ We will continue to fight oil with as many skimmers as we can bring to bear on the water , while looking at every possible option for marshalling additional assets to impacted areas along the entire Gulf Coast . "
Moreover , the EPA will likely have to take a careful look at the A Whale , since it decants the oily mixture and discharges the water back into the Gulf .
Most skimmers now at work corral an oil - water mixture that is then separated on shore .
To date , skimmers in the Gulf have collected 671,000 barrels ( 28.2 million gallons ) of oil and water mix from the Gulf .
At the highest estimates of 60,000 barrels of oil a day flowing from the well , more than 4 million barrels of crude could have leaked into the Gulf already .
Collection efforts at the wellhead averaged 25,000 barrels a day before hurricane Alex skirted past , briefly stopping the siphoning activities .
The collection capacity at the bottom of the Gulf could double after another collection vessel , the Helix , arrives on the scene in the next few days .
The A Whale , for its part , could collect more than 125 times the amount of the largest skimmer currently working the Gulf .
It 's capable of slurping up 300,000 barrels of oil ( 21 million gallons ) of oil in 10 hours , and offloading it to a companion vessel , A Elephant .
Mr. Su is already readying two other retrofitted tankers , the B Whale and C Whale , for service in the Gulf .
If approved , A Whale – which has a main stack decorated with a blue whale – would be used near the wellhead , where the oil is the thickest on the surface but where boat traffic is also the heaviest .
It uses 12 large intakes to collect surface oil in its path .
Not everyone is convinced A
Whale is the right ship for the job .
Confronting a widely dispersed spill like the one in the Gulf , a large tanker like the A Whale might not be efficient enough to make its operation worthwhile , says Dennis Bryant , a former Coast Guard officer and now a maritime consultant in Gainesville , Fla .
" This would be using a very large ship that 's very expensive to operate to tackle something that , in my mind , it 's not going to be particularly good at , " says Mr. Bryant .
" It could be very good in other situations , but I do n't think that this is the spill for it . "

Image caption Hillary Clinton visited the Schindler Museum in Krakow
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the US will donate $ 15 m ( £ 10 m ) to preserve the site of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz - Birkenau .
Mrs Clinton was on a visit to Poland , where she oversaw the signing of a key missile base agreement .
She warned of a " steel vice " of repression crushing democracy and civil liberties activists in countries such as Iran , Egypt and Zimbabwe .
She held up Poland , which elects a new leader on Sunday , as a model democracy .
More than a million people , most of them Jews , were murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz during World War II .
The money to preserve Auschwitz - Birkenau depends on Congressional approval .
Mrs Clinton defended US funding for advocacy groups in other countries , which some governments condemn as meddling .
Mrs Clinton said social activists in many countries were being harassed , censored , arrested or killed .
The Iron Curtain no longer existed , she said , " but we must be wary of the steel vice in which governments around the world are slowly crushing civil society and the human spirit " .
Mrs Clinton later travelled on to Azerbaijan , and is also due to visit Armenia and Georgia .
' Evolving threats '
The secretary of state witnessed the signing of the amendment to the ballistic missile agreement with her Polish counterpart , Radoslaw Sikorski , in the southern city of Krakow .
The deal sets up a permanent US missile base as part of a revamped version of the controversial missile defence shield .
Russia opposes a Polish base hosting US missiles .
Mrs Clinton said the new deal did not threaten Russia .
Mrs Clinton said the agreement would " protect Poland and our allies from evolving threats , such as those from Iran " .
In Azerbaijan and Armenia , Mrs Clinton will push for a resolution of the region 's conflicts and will seek to bolster US access to an overland route used for supplying troops to Afghanistan , says the BBC's David Stern in Kiev .
In Georgia , Mrs Clinton will have to reassure officials that the government of embattled President Mikhail Saakashvili still has US support despite Washington 's attempt to improve relations with Russia , our correspondent adds .
Everything about this is odd .
Julian Assange , the founder , director , frontman , guiding spirit of global whistleblowing service WikiLeaks looks a bit odd for a start .
Tall , cadaverous , dressed in ripped jeans , brown jacket , black tie , battered trainers .
Somebody says he looks like Andy Warhol with his prematurely white hair , but I can't remember who , which will bother the hell out of him because accuracy is everything .
He detests subjectivity in journalism ; I fear that part of him detests journalists , too , and that WikiLeaks – which describes itself as an " uncensorable system for untraceable mass document leaking " – is essentially a way of cutting out subjectivist idiots such as me .
If Assange was producing this article , he would post the rambling hour - and - a - half - long talk he delivers at the Centre for Investigative Journalism 's summer school at London 's City University online , plus the 10 minutes we spend talking on the way to a restaurant – I almost get him run down by a speeding BMW , which would probably have changed the course of investigative journalism – and the additional 20 minutes of chat in the restaurant before it 's politely suggested I 've exhausted my time .
" When you 're dealing with any secondary sources [ about me ] , be extremely careful , " he says as we walk , even picking holes in a recent New Yorker piece , enormously long , detailed , no doubt majestically fact - checked , but in which the writer makes an assumption about one of his supporters based on little more than the T - shirt she is wearing .
" Journalism should be more like science , " he tells me in the restaurant .
" As far as possible , facts should be verifiable .
If journalists want long - term credibility for their profession , they have to go in that direction .
Have more respect for readers . "
He likes the idea of a 2,000 - word article backed by 25,000 words of source material , and says there is no reason why you can't provide that on the internet .
Come to think of it , I 'm not sure that car was a BMW , or even that it was speeding .
Assange unveiled wikileaks.org in January 2007 and has pulled off some astonishing coups for an organisation with a handful of staff and virtually no funding .
It has exposed evidence of corruption in the family of former Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi , published the standard operating procedures for the Guantánamo Bay detention centre , even made public the contents of Sarah Palin 's Yahoo account .
But what has really propelled WikiLeaks into the media mainstream is the video it released in April of a US helicopter attack in Baghdad in July 2007 , which killed a number of Iraqi civilians and two Reuters personnel , Saeed Chmagh and Namir Noor - Eldeen .
The video , posted in a 39 - minute unedited version and as an 18 - minute film called Collateral Murder , gives a chilling insight into US military attitudes : sloppiness in identifying targets ( the helicopter pilots mistook the Reuters employees ' cameras for weapons ) , eagerness to finish off a grievously wounded man as he attempts to crawl to safety , and lack of concern even for two children in a van that arrives to pick up the bodies and is immediately attacked .
" It 's their fault for bringing their kids to a battle , " says one of the pilots .
" That 's right , " replies his colleague matter - of - factly .
This , though , is one of the most one - sided battles you will ever witness .
Very few cameras can bring down a helicopter gunship .
My thesis , soon to be exploded by Assange along with pretty well everything else I have predetermined on the basis of what I have read about him , is that this remarkable video is a transformative moment for WikiLeaks .
But just before I can put that to him , a handsome , bearded student who was at the talk springs forward .
" Julian , before you go , can I just shake your hand , " he says , " because I really love what you do and you 're like a hero , you really are . "
They shake hands .
The icon and the acolyte .
The Warhol parallel becomes ever stronger : Assange as impresario of a new form of news .
So the thesis .
" Did the April video change everything ? " I say .
This is a rhetorical question , because I am quite sure it must have .
" No , " he says .
" Journalists always like an excuse for why are they talking about something now when they did n't talk about something a week ago .
They always like to say something is new . "
He does , though , accept that the scope of WikiLeaks is expanding rapidly .
At the beginning of his talk , he said his head was " full of so many things at the moment " , as if to excuse the faltering , unstructured nature of his presentation .
What things ?
" We have been trying to raise funds for the past six months , " he says , " so we 've been doing very few releases and now we have an enormous queue of submissions that has piled up .
We 're working on those and working on engineering systems to speed up our publishing pipeline . "
WikiLeaks has just five full - time staff and about 40 others who , he says , " very frequently do things " , backed by 800 occasional helpers and 10,000 supporters and donors – an amorphous , decentralised structure , which might become the model for many media organisations in the future , as what might be called " journalism factories " become both outmoded and unfinanceable .
This is a delicate moment in the development of what Assange prefers to think of as a " movement " .
" We have all the problems that a growing startup organisation has , " he says , " combined with an extreme adversarial environment and state spying . "
The danger of penetration by the security services is acute .
" It makes it hard to get new talent quickly , " he says , " because everyone has to be checked out , and it makes internal communication very difficult because everything has to be encrypted and security procedures put in place .
And we also have to be ready to respond to lawsuits . "
On the plus side , the recent fundraising drive produced $ 1 m , mostly from small donors .
Large trusts , though , have steered clear of WikiLeaks because of political suspicions , worries about the legality of posting leaked material on the internet , and the common failing that western - based funding bodies are happy to underwrite exposés of malpractice in the developing world but less willing to look into the murky corners of so - called first world countries .
Is WikiLeaks the journalistic model for the future ?
He gives a characteristically lateral answer .
" All over the world the barriers between what is inside an organisation and outside an organisation are being smoothed out .
In the military , the use of contractors means that what is the military and what is not the military is smoothed out .
Newswise , you see the same trend – what is the newspaper and what is not the newspaper ?
Comments on websites from the general public and supporters . . . "
His point trails away , so I press him to make a prediction about the shape of the media in a decade or so from now .
" For the financial and specialist press , it 'll still look mostly the same – your daily briefing about what you need to know to run your business .
But for political and social analysis , that 's going to be movements and networks .
You can already see this happening . "
Assange has to be careful about his personal security .
Bradley Manning , a 22 - year - old US army intelligence analyst , has been arrested and charged with allegedly giving WikiLeaks the footage of the Baghdad attack , and the US authorities believe the organisation has another video of an attack on the Afghan village of Granai in which many civilians were killed .
There have also been disputed reports that WikiLeaks may be holding 260,000 classified diplomatic cables , and the US authorities have been quoted as saying they want to interview Assange about all this material , publication of which would they say breach national security .
Some sources with links in the intelligence agencies have warned him he is in danger and advised him not to travel to the US .
He refuses to confirm that Manning was the source of the Baghdad video , but says whoever did leak it was " a hero " .
At the talk I heard a man close to me say to his neighbour : " Do you think there 'll be spooks here ?
The US are after him , you know . "
And of course it 's possible .
But giving a public talk to 200 students in the centre of London does not suggest someone who is in fear of extraordinary rendition .
On the other hand , the organiser of the lecture tells me Assange tends not to stay in the same place two nights in a row .
So is he taking the threats seriously ?
" When you first get them , you must take them quite seriously .
Some very senior people advised me that there were significant problems , but there 's a clarity now .
The public statements from the [ US ] state department have mostly been reasonable .
Some statements made in private have not been reasonable , but the demeanour of those private statements has changed over the past month and have become more positive . "
Assange , despite his faltering manner , exudes self - confidence , immodesty even .
When I ask him whether the rapid growth and increasing significance of WikiLeaks surprises him , he says no .
" I was always confident the idea would succeed , otherwise I would n't have spent my time on it or asked other people to spend their time on it . "
He has spent a good deal of that time recently in Iceland , where freedom of information is protected and he has high - level supporters .
It was here that the complex work of decrypting the video of the Baghdad attack was done .
But he says he has no real base .
" It 's just like a war correspondent , I 'm everywhere , " he says .
" Or like anyone setting up a multinational corporation , where you go visit all the regional offices .
We have supporters in many countries . "
Assange was born in Queensland in 1971 into what sounds a highly unconventional family – here one is relying on those secondary sources he warned me about , and it really would be useful to see the documentation .
His parents ran a touring theatre company , and he went to 37 different schools ( though some accounts suggest his mother thought school encouraged deference to authority , so educated him mainly at home ) .
His parents divorced , his mother remarried , there was a bustup with her new husband , which led to her , Julian and his half - brother going on the run .
It all sounds too Warholian to be true , but I suppose we have to trust it .
There is no time to ask him for his life history , and I do n't suppose he'd be very interested to tell it if there was .
His replies generally are brief and a little hesitant , and when I ask him whether there is anything that WikiLeaks would n't publish he says , " That is n't an interesting question , " in his soft Australian accent , and leaves it at that .
Assange is not someone who feels the need to fill dead air .
He fell in love with computers in his teens , became a skilled hacker and formed a group called International Subversives , which broke into US defence department computers .
He married at 18 , and he and his wife soon had a son , but the marriage broke down and he fought a long custody battle , which , it is said , entrenched his dislike of authority .
There are also suggestions he felt some people in the government had been conspiring against him .
So we have a neat journalistic picture : computer expert with two decades of hacking experience , hostility to authority , conspiracy theorist .
Setting up WikiLeaks in his mid-30s looks like an inevitable move .
" That 's more a journalist sees something now and then tries to find a rationale for it , " he says .
" This is how history is produced in general .
We see something now and we try and make a story that is cohesive to explain it .
But that 's not what I see .
It is true that there are certain abilities that I had , and I was also fortunate to be in a western country with access to financial resources and the internet , and there are very few people who have the particular constellation of abilities and connections that I did .
It is also true that I have always been interested in politics , geopolitics , and possibly secrecy to some degree . "
This is not really an answer , but it 's all I 'm going to get .
Again like Warhol , there is an air of cultivated vagueness .
In his talk , Assange had said that he is neither of the right nor the left – his enemies are forever trying to pin labels on him in order to undermine his organisation .
What matters first and foremost is getting the information out .
" First the facts , ma'am , " is how he summarises his philosophy to me .
" Then we 'll get down to what we want to do about it .
You can't do anything sensible until you know what the situation is that you 're in . "
But while he rejects political labels , he says WikiLeaks does have its own ethical code .
" We have values .
I am an information activist .
You get the information out to the people .
We believe a richer intellectual and historical record that is fuller and more accurate is in itself intrinsically good , and gives people the tools to make intelligent decisions . "
He says an explicit part of their purpose is to highlight human rights abuses , no matter where they are carried out or who perpetrates them .
He has described the provision of a safe platform for whistleblowers – his key tenet is the protection of sources – as a calling , and I ask him whether this will now always be the core of his life .
His reply surprises me .
" I have many other ideas , and as soon as WikiLeaks is strong enough to flourish without me I 'll go on with these other ideas .
It is strong enough to survive quite well without me now , but I do n't know that it would flourish . "
Is WikiLeaks 's impact in the four years since it was founded an inherent criticism of conventional journalism ?
Have we been asleep on the job ?
" There has been an unconscionable failure to protect sources , " he says .
" It is those sources who take all the risks .
I was at a journalism conference a few months ago , and there were posters up saying a thousand journalists had been killed since 1944 .
That 's outrageous .
How many policemen have been killed since 1944 ? "
I misunderstand him , thinking he is bemoaning so many journalistic deaths .
His point , though , is the reverse – not how many journalists have been killed in the line of duty , but how few .
" Only a thousand ! " he says , his voice rising a little when he realises I have n't grasped his point .
" How many have died in car accidents since 1944 ?
Probably 40,000 .
Police officers , who have a serious role in stopping crimes , far more of them die .
They take their job seriously . "
But journalists take their job seriously , " I protest .
" They do n't take their job seriously , " he says .
" Nearly all of the thousand who 've died since 1944 have been stringers in places like Iraq .
Very few western journalists have died .
I think it 's an international disgrace that so few western journalists have been killed in the course of duty , or have been arrested in the course of duty .
How many journalists were arrested last year in the United States , a country of 300 million people ?
How many journalists were arrested in the UK last year ? "
Journalists , he says , let other people take the risks and then take the credit .
They have been letting the state , big business , vested interests get away with it for too long , and a network of hackers and whistleblowers hunched over computers , making sense of complex data and with a mission to make it freely available , is now ready to do a better job .
It 's an incendiary argument , and one I 'd stay and contest if he was n't sipping white wine and about to order dinner .
But one thing I would point out .
The number of journalists killed since 1944 is closer to 2,000 .
After all , remember , accuracy , getting the facts straight , presenting the truth unvarnished , is everything in the brave new media world .

Questions and Suggestions
Tuberculosis ( TB ) is no longer a disease that just affects the poor , as an increasing number of people from the higher strata of society are falling prey to the disease .
According to the recent observations made by the Mumbai District TB Control Society ( MDTCS ) , most people from the affluent class in the city are suffering from extra pulmonary TB ( any TB outside of lungs ) .
The 2010 report of the Revised National TB Control Programme ( RNTCP ) states that 20 % of TB cases in the world are from India .
And , as of 2010 , Mumbai has 16 % of sputum positive suspect cases , with 55 % being new sputum positive and 33 % being smear positive re-treatment cases .
According to Dr Santosh Revankar , member secretary , MDTCS , people from the higher strata are mostly immuno - compromised .
“ TB is an airborne disease and even though many recover from it , there are cases where the bacillus travels through the lymph nodes in extra pulmonary sites like the heart , spine and even skin , ” said Revankar .
“ Overcrowding in a place also contributes to rampant increase in TB .
For example , a pregnant lady ’s immunity is lower because of blood dilution so the internal strength of the body to fight against the bacillus comes down . ”
Revankar added that the general trend among the affluent class is that they tend to hide the disease because there is a stigma attached to it .
“ Other trends observed are that they take treatment from consultants , who do not stick to regulations recommended by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) .
So many cases do n’t come forward .
But , we have a dedicated surveillance now which is changing attitudes .
Every fever and cough case , which does n’t respond to antibiotics is investigated further for sputum acid fast bacilli test , ” said Revankar .
According to Revankar , while TB is the biggest killer in India , the good news is that there is a direct observed treatment , which is consuming the medicine before the health officer and not at home .
“ The RNTCP has revised the dosage , duration and methodology in curing TB to cut down on default rate of patients undergoing treatment at home , ” added Revankar .
In March , I asked Bank of America about allegations that it was manipulating its balance sheet using tactics akin to Lehman Brothers ’ “ Repo 105 ” -- an accounting maneuver that Lehman had used to move assets off its balance sheet and hide its risks .
We 'd had questions for BofA after financial blogger John Hempton took a closer look at the bank 's annual reports and noted that BofA 's end - of - quarter assets were consistently lower than its average assets throughout the quarter .
( Here ’s a Repo 105 refresher . )
When I contacted it at the time , Bank of America did n't deny that it moved assets around , and instead said it followed the law and accounting standards :
Efforts to manage the size of our balance sheet are routine and appropriate , and we believe our actions are consistent with all applicable accounting and legal requirements .
So I was interested to read this Wall Street Journal Page 1 headline over the weekend : “ BofA Admits Hiding Debt . ”
In recent letters sent to the SEC , Bank of America “ admitted to making six transactions that incorrectly hid from view billions of dollars of debt , ” reported the Journal .
The transactions — made between 2007 and 2009 - - involved as much as $ 10.7 billion , less than to the $ 50 billion that Lehman hid before declaring bankruptcy in 2008 .
( Read Bank of America 's letters from April 14 and May 13 . )
According to BofA , its error was in booking these six “ repos , ” or short - term borrowing , as sales .
Doing so moved debt off its balance sheet , making the company ’s profile look better to investors .
This is also what happened when Lehman booked its Repo 105 transactions as sales instead of borrowing .
The Journal points out that such end - of - quarter “ window dressing is n’t illegal in itself , ” but “ intentionally masking debt to deceive investors ” is a violation of regulatory guidelines .
( It ’s also worth pointing out that former Lehman officials are in some legal trouble over Repo 105 , and Lehman ’s auditor , Ernst & Young , is being investigated in the U.K. )
A BofA spokesman told me today the bank still stands by the statement it gave us back in March .
How is it that the bank can say it believes its " actions are consistent with all applicable accounting and legal requirements " while also admitting accounting errors to the SEC ?
You can judge for yourself :
The initial statement , which the bank continues to stand by , is quite broad .
It seems to acknowledge moving assets around -- thus " efforts to manage the size of our balance sheet " -- but denied that any of those management techniques broke laws or accounting rules .
BofA reiterated almost the exact same language in its April 14 letter to the SEC : " We believe that our efforts to manage the size of our balance sheet are appropriate and our policies are consistent with all applicable accounting and legal requirements . "
But in its May 13 letter to the SEC , Bank of America stated : " Although the accounting guidance is subject to interpretation , we concluded that , based on the intent and lack of economic substance , sale accounting was not appropriate for these transactions . "
Bank of America also said that the mistake was not material to its earnings and balance sheet .
( Lehman executives have also said that Repo 105 was n’t used to create a “ false impression ” to mislead investors . )
When I spoke today with Bank of America spokesman Jerry Dubrowski , he argued that there was a " profound difference " between what Lehman Brothers did and what Bank of America did -- the difference being intentionality , levels of disclosure , and the size of the transactions :
We found no evidence of Repo 105 transactions .
We did find a handful of transactions , relatively small in nature when compared to our balance sheet , were accounted as sales and should ’ve been accounted as borrowings .
The issue of Repo 105 was a deliberate attempt to mask size of balance sheet from investors .
[ Dubrowski later clarified that this is how Lehman was described in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy examiner 's report , and not a Bank of America characterization of Repo 105 . ]
There ’s a profound difference between what Lehman did and Bank of America discovered when we looked at those transactions .
Lehman did not report average assets over the period , and Bank of America did , so investors could compare average assets to end - of - quarter assets .
Lehman moved I think it was $ 50 billion off a balance sheet that was significantly smaller than Bank of America’s .
You ’re talking about magnitude .
The bank 's new disclosures about these six transactions -- what it has called " dollar roll " transactions -- came in response to a March 29 letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The agency 's letter came a few weeks after the examiner 's stunning report on Lehman , and if you 're keeping count , a week after our post .
According to the Journal , the SEC has been investigating the transactions since then and could be releasing these findings as early as this week .
The Journal says the SEC “ has n’t taken any action against BofA over the matter , " and " the fact that the letter was released suggests the SEC has concluded its review . "
Bank of America said in its letters to the SEC that it has n’t done these types of transactions since early 2009 , and said it has told its staff to “ ‘escalate ’ consideration of any unusual balance - sheet changes . ”
I guess I can’t really blame my neighbour for what happened .
You see , I ’d been out of town for the past week , and the endless crying in The Human Centipede is rather convincing ( the plot and dialogue are another matter ) .
As far as my neighbour knew , my girlfriend had been home alone when the screaming started , and can you really expect a single mother to intervene ?
And I guess I can’t really blame the police , either .
As far as cops go they were decent enough .
Of course they took the throwing star my brother given me the day before , fresh off the plane from Japan , and left on the coffee table next to me ( restricted weapons , I guess , though I do n’t really know why ) but they did n’t charge me for it .
And yeah , one of them threatened to cap my ass while I was getting him my ID ( “ Sir , if you pull a throwing star out of that pocket I will shoot you ” ) , but there was no real malice in his voice .
And of course – once they ’d realized all this was just a misunderstanding – they proceeded to snoop around with their flashlights , and run our names to look for some sort of crime to arrest us for – but once again , they did n’t do this any more roughly than was necessary .
No tearing apart books or knocking things off the shelves .
Just a methodical investigation of all our personal belongings .
So in the end , I really should n’t be so upset .
But sometimes I dream of a different sort of Police Department .
One that is n’t just another gang , granted privilege by our rulers , but a Department that is part of , representative of , and answerable to the citizens .
I can imagine last night in my head .
“ Ah , sorry for interrupting your evening Mr Aurini .
Glad we got it all sorted out .
I ’m Officer Dalidowicz , by the way , and this is my beat .
If you ever need any help you know who to call . ”
And then my girlfriend and I would have made a new friend , our neighbourhood would have had a new face – and I ’d still have my suriken .
You see , here ’s the thing about heuristics / methodologies : they only measure what they ’re intended to measure .
And when you try and appraises them by asking how many times they measure whatever criteria they ’re programmed to measure , all you ’re really testing for is laziness in your agents .
The way things go right now , the Police department takes every opportunity to troll for minor crimes ; for anything short of murder , their interest is going to be focused on the victim and what they can get them for ; finding the person who stole your bike or laptop would take a different approach , something wholly alien to the current process .
And by threatening us bottom feeders with minor offences – things that should n’t be illegal , or ‘ tax collector ’ crimes such as most traffic tickets – they occasionally find a path to move up on the big fish .
This is the world we ’re living in .
Where each and everyone of us is a suspect , a potential provocateur , a troublemaker who is to be roped in and coerced any time we cross paths with the boys in blue .
Never a citizen , an agent of Canada , building this country , or a member of a community .
It ’s a different sort of surveillance state we ’ve got going here , where you ’re potentially subject to analysis at the drop of a hat – but at least they do n’t violate your ‘ Rights ’ .
Two lessons , then , I guess :
1. Do n’t watch The Human Centipede .
At best you ’ll waste an hour and a half of your life , at worst you suffer a police raid .
2 . Do n’t be poor .
That never helps .
Especially not in Calgary , the Heart of the New West .
I took the time out last week to watch the first two entries in Pixar / Disney ’s beloved ‘ Toy Story ’ franchise preparing myself for the third , and proposed , final entry of the series .
Going into ‘ Toy Story 3 ’ expectations were high , having read a few initial reviews and hearing of the great buzz around a few early screenings .
Let me digress a bit by saying that I have enjoyed every single Pixar / Disney collaboration thus far , and each and every film has been a four star or better ( on a five star scale ) for me .
I am going to rank the Pixar films in a separate post later this week , and there has n’t been a single bad film in the group .
Having said that , if I had to pick one film that impressed me the most , it would have to be ‘ Toy Story 1 ’ .
The film set the bar high for any future Pixar release , and while each and every film has been very good to great , the original ‘ Toy Story ’ remained , in my opinion , the highlight of the Pixar universe … until now .
‘ Toy Story 3 ’ is that rare film that appeals to everyone , young and old .
The same can be said for its predecessors , but there is something extra here that elevates emotions to the next level .
In the first act of this series , we were introduced to the main ‘ toys ’ and we got a chance to see the bond between Andy , their owner , and the toys themselves .
The second act brought us more of the adventure aspect of the toys , and how they interacted with each other .
Well , the third act gives us everything that the first two films had and much more .
Not only does the film begin with an incredible action sequence , which is shown through the eyes of the toys , it manages to maintain this level of excitement through the entire film .
The opening sequence reminds us of why these toys were probably wanted in the first place , as it shows what each and every one of them was made to do , or just how incredible a childs imagination can be .
After the rousing opening , you might be thinking how can this get any better ?
Well , not only does it get better … it steadily improves .
The writers of this film need to be commended on just how well they keep the audience wanting more , and wanting to see just what happens to our heroes next .
The pace is well thought out , and the emotional roller coastal the film takes you on is something that is rarely seen in any film these days .
You smile and laugh at the opening … you feel bad for the toys once Andy decides that he no longer has any use for them ( well , except one of them ! ) … you ’re upset when a mistake is made by Andy ’s mother …elated when the toys basically determine their own destiny … happy for them once they get there …worried about them once they realize what their new home is really all about …and so on .
There are many ups and downs here , but all of them are key to what makes this series as cherished as it is .
Seeing all of the old favorites back in action was a treat , but what really amazes is just how well the new toys ( well , new to the story , but not ‘ new ’ , if you know what I mean ) are integrated into the world we already know and love .
It truly is a great script , and this is why the film seemlessly works to have all of the toys co-exist .
The highlight , and low - lights of every toy is brought forward , and we actually get to see some interesting back story to the films nemesis .
And what a nemesis he is …although , I could see it coming , those that were with me did n’t and it ’s a nice little twist that just adds even more creativity to the world these toys have created for themselves .
The world the toys live in is not unlike ours .
This is the central focal point of ‘ Toy Story 3 ’ .
The emotions we feel as human beings are shown through the toys eyes .
What they feel …we feel , and vice versa .
Just as the opening sequence is impressive , the final action sequence is probably the single best animated action sequence I ’ve ever seen , and you will be on the edge of your seat .
Sounds silly , right ?
Edge of your seat for an animated film about toys ?
Well , you will and once you see the sequence you will understand what I mean .
It ’s a true test of loyalty , teamwork , and friendship …once again , all attributes that we , as human beings , rely on to make it through our daily lives .
The final 15 minutes of ‘ Toy Story 3 ’ is the most emotional of any animated film thus far .
Why ?
Up until this point , we realize that the toys need something to continue on …is it Andy ?
or is it something more ?
Also , you feel for Andy , as he has to make a decision in the final moments that is difficult for him , but it is a decision that he has to make to continue on as well .
There very well may not be a greater bookend to a franchise than there is here , and even though I ’m sure we will see these characters again in short films , as far as full length features go , ‘ Toy Story 3 ’ is about as close as we can get to cinema perfection … and needless to say , it is the best film of 2010 so far .
* Note : I did see the film in 3D , and while it was very impressive , the review is based on the film alone .
The 3D is not really necessary to the enjoyment of this movie .
Rating :
Hot off the success of ‘ Shrek Forever After ’ , Dreamworks is readying the spinoff , ‘ Puss In Boots ’ .
The “ Shrek ” spin - off “ tells the hilarious and courageous ( daring , bold , brave ) tale of Puss ’s ( Antonio Banderas ) early adventures as he teams with mastermind Humpty Dumpty ( Zach Galifianakis ) and the street - savvy Kitty ( Salma Hayek ) ( above with Puss ) to steal the famed goose that lays the Golden Eggs ” .
The film is to be released November 4 , 2011 .
Weekend box office …’ Toy Story 3 ′ brought in an estimated $ 109 million , making it Pixar ’s highest debut thus far .
The film should continue to do really well over the next few weeks , and probably will continue to bring it in quite heavily until the release of ‘ Despicable Me ’ on July 9 .
Coming in second in it ’s second week was ‘ The Karate Kid ’ , which made an additional $ 29 million .
‘ The A - Team ’ was third with $ 13.7 million , and rounding out the top 5 was ‘ Get Him to the Greek ’ and ‘ Shrek Forever After ’ .
The weekend ’s other new release , ‘ Jonah Hex ’ , tanked as expected , and only grossed a paltry $ 5.1 million , for an 8th place finish .
Enlarge By Web Bryant , USA TODAY USA TODAY OPINION USA TODAY OPINION On Religion Faith .
Religion .
Spirituality .
Meaning .
In our ever - shrinking world , the tentacles of religion touch everything from governmental policy to individual morality to our basic social constructs .
It affects the lives of people of great faith — or no faith at all .
This series of weekly columns — launched in 2005 — seeks to illuminate the national conversation .
The U.S. Catholic Church is still shuddering from the effects of the sexual abuse crisis .
Most Catholics are still critical of the church 's handling of the matter , and one in 10 are considering leaving the faith altogether .
Some believe that clerical celibacy is at the core of the crisis , while others blame the all - male character of the priesthood .
Reading such accounts , though , it 's easy to forget that we have not the slightest idea how serious the abuse problem is among Catholic priests as opposed to other professionals dealing with children .
That statement may sound outrageous — of course Catholic priests have a huge abuse problem !
But why do we think that ?
News stories frequently note similar cases involving members of a wide range of professions , not just clergy of all denominations but also scoutmasters and secular schoolteachers .
So how do their rates of abuse compare with those of priests ?
We have precisely no evidence on the issue .
No reputable scholar has ever conducted a survey of the abuse problem as it affects any other profession , in a way that would allow us to make direct comparisons with the Catholic clergy .
If anyone believes that priests offend at a higher rate than teachers or non-celibate clergy , then they should produce the evidence on which they are basing that conclusion .
I know of none .
Saying " everybody knows " does not constitute scientific methodology .
Beyond question , though , the abuse issue affects non-Catholic settings .
Particularly eye - opening is the detailed report on " Educator Sexual Misconduct " that Hofstra University professor Charol Shakeshaft compiled for the U.S. Department of Education in 2004 .
Among other findings , we read that about 10 % of secular school pupils in grades eight to 11 report having been at the receiving end of such sexual misconduct , broadly defined .
That does not mean that 10 % of teachers misbehave , rather that a tiny number offend frequently , and egregiously : very much the same situation , in fact , as among Catholic priests .
Why , then , do we hear so much about Catholic cases ?
What is different about the Catholic Church is the manner in which its problems have come to light , and this involves both the nature of the institution itself and the workings of the law .
As a result , the church is much more open to civil litigation than any other institution .
These lawsuits allow the exposure of numerous cases that would never have surfaced if the perpetrators were not priests .
Institutional memory
The next time you read an account of an abuse scandal affecting priests , note the time frame in which the acts allegedly occurred .
Almost certainly , it will date from long ago , probably 30 years or more .
Why is that ?
Typically , an individual sues a church over abuse that he suffered in his childhood , and in the Catholic context , he might well find written evidence to confirm his charges of misconduct long ago .
He is , after all , dealing with an institution that prizes its collective memory and preserves records dating back centuries .
The victim can not only find embarrassing information about Father John Doe , but his lawyers also then can force a diocese to disclose ever more information about ancient charges against other priests , which can lead into other jurisdictions .
One case thus becomes the basis for a whole network of interlocking investigations .
Perhaps it 's good that such older abuse cases are still coming to light , but the long passage of time makes it very unlikely that the charges can be investigated in a fair or reliable way .
Nor does the plaintiff in a civil case have to meet the high standards of a criminal case , of proof beyond a reasonable doubt .
He just has to convince a jury that his allegations are more probably true than not .
Most civil cases involving priestly abuse go forward on the basis of evidence that would not stand up in a criminal court .
Often , dioceses settle dubious cases to avoid expensive legal proceedings , but such closure can be a mixed blessing .
Whatever the merits of the particular case , critics take the fact of settling to suggest that the church is paying blood money to conceal its crimes .
That 's not just a church problem .
Celebrities and corporations face the same problem , that the public does not understand the workings of litigation .
As the resulting Catholic horror stories accumulate , so many media organizations develop a ready - made format for reporting them , a familiar mythology of specifically Catholic malpractice .
Saying that does not mean charging any particular news outlet with deliberate religious prejudice :
Some go to great lengths to be fair to accused clergy .
But when we approach the issue as a specifically Catholic one , we inevitably cast the church as villain , to the exclusion ofother interpretations .
The more firmly the public accepts the image of the sinister priest , the harder it becomes to find juries who will disbelieve abuse allegations .
The more cases are reported , the more people come forward to publicize their own complaints .
Most plaintiffs are reporting genuine victimization , but some are not .
Abuse in public schools
Few institutions , secular or religious , offer anything like the same advantages for plaintiffs .
The internal records of other bodies are rarely as thorough as those kept by the Catholic Church , and they lack the elaborate organizational framework .
It 's simply not as easy to dredge up old cases .
And specific legal oddities mean that it 's much harder to sue other institutions .
As public entities , public schools , for instance , operate under governmental or sovereign immunity .
While schools can be sued , plaintiffs face restrictions that do n't apply to Catholic dioceses .
Financial liability is limited , and complaints have to be brought within a set time , using rigid administrative procedures .
As a result , at least until recently , it just was not possible to pursue cases from long ago .
But that might be changing .
Recently , plaintiffs have found ways to sue public schools for abuse they suffered long ago , charging that school districts violated their federal civil rights to receive an education free of the menace of harassment or sexual discrimination .
In one well - publicized case that should serve as a national wake - up call , a woman won a $ 3.7 million judgment against a Kentucky school district for sexual abuse she experienced in the late 1970s .
However widely this particular decision may apply , it 's very likely that such lawsuits will spread in coming years , so that we will undoubtedly be hearing a great deal more about abusive educators .
Presently , though , pedophile pastors or teachers are little known to the general public , while pedophile priests have become a familiar villain .
In consequence , cases of abusive priests are reported as part of a systematic crisis within a deeply flawed church , while non-Catholic offenders are treated as isolated villains , just bad apples within their professions .
The sexual exploitation of children is a heinous offense with lifelong consequences , and the trauma is all the greater when the offender is a trusted mentor , a pastor , priest , or teacher .
It is profoundly unjust to focus all our attention on the victims of one type of perpetrator to the exclusion of others .

( Mother Nature Network ) --
Some beaches suffer from pollution , but there are many gorgeous , pristine escapes that offer a sanctuary to wildlife and travelers alike .
We scoured the planet to find the most spectacular shorelines -- and , no surprise , most of our top choices are on protected land or are nearly impossible to reach .
Whitehaven Beach , Whitsunday Islands , Australia
This 4.3 - mile white sparkling beach has won many awards , including " Cleanest Beach in Queensland , " and national awards for resource recovery and environmental protection .
The breathtaking beach is located on Whitsunday Island , the largest of a 74 - island chain .
Visitors are limited by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and must register with a tour guide for access .
Playa Matapalo , Osa Peninsula , Costa Rica
Known as the lungs of the Earth , the Osa Peninsula is blessed with a dense forest and a conservation - minded government .
Half of the 500,000 species of flora and fauna located in Costa Rica can be found here .
The area is also home to beautiful Playa Matapalo , a gray - sand beach popular with surfers that leads into the Portalon National Wildlife Refuge complete with a marine turtle protection project .
Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve , Oahu , Hawaii
Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve was n't always so clean .
The state has been enforcing strict rules for beachgoers in the former volcanic crater site since 1990 , and it is the first Marine Life Conservation District in Hawaii .
Visitor numbers are restricted and an educational video about preserving the fragile ecosystem is mandatory before entry .
Now the living reef environment is one of the top spots in the state for snorkeling .

Koh Libong , Trang Province , Thailand
While many popular beaches in Thailand have been trashed by tourism , Trang Province officials are committed to sustainability and ecotourism .
Koh Libong is the province 's largest island and has been protected with the help of Swedish environmentalists .
The sparsely populated area does n't get many tourists , leaving the golden beaches open to crabs , birds , turtles and dugongs .
Las Islas Cies , Galicia , Spain
Often considered one of the best beaches in Europe , the white sand of Las Islas Cies remains beautiful because the island is protected as a national park .
The number of visitors is restricted , cars are prohibited and overnight stays are restricted to camping .
Many beachgoers tell stories of feeling as if they are the only ones on the island .
Even though it's on the Atlantic Ocean , the water is as calm as a lake .
MNN : 9 amazing caves from around the world
Sancho Bay , Fernando de Noronha , Brazil
The island of Fernando de Noronha is a protected marine ecological reserve , and only 420 tourists are allowed to access the beach at one time .
Those who do visit will find 15 beaches with sparkling blue water and white sand beaches , but Sancho Bay , surrounded by natural walls , is one of the most unspoiled and secluded spots on the island .
It is accessible only by a ladder that 's wedged in a rock crevice .
Short Sands Beach : Oswald West State Park , Oregon
Many trails lead to the beach in Oswald West State Park , and they all wind through an amazing forest of towering mature trees .
Expect to see surfers toting their boards to the waves .
The beach is tucked away in a cove and surrounded by mountains , which makes it feel secluded from the rest of the world .
Visitors can also access a 13 - mile stretch of the Oregon Coast Trail from this beach .
Goosewing Beach Preserve , Little Compton , Rhode Island
Beach , dune and coastal pond environments come together in this scenic Rhode Island spot .
Goosewing Beach is owned by the Nature Conservancy of Rhode Island and other groups , an effort to protect endangered shorebirds .
It is one of the few breeding sites for the piping plover .

The latest MacOS release ( 10.6 , or “ Snow Leopard ” ) comes with a new monospace font .
It ’s called “ Menlo ” and it ’s a slightly modified form of the standard Linux font ( with appropriately weightly Linux name ) “ DejaVu Sans Serif Mono ” , which is itself an updated form of Bitstream Vera Sans Mono .
Apple ’s modifications are a definite improvement to my eyes , mostly because they thicken up some of the wispier glyphs from DejaVu , like the underline and period .
There ’s a great comparison over here .
One thing that bothered me , though , is that they turned the zero into a 1980s - style “ slashed circle ” .
Unhip , daddy -o!
Naturally I searched for a font editor , and the best one I found was Font Forge , an old Linux app ported to the Mac but still requiring X11 .
So that ’s two ways OS X is borrowing from Linux for font support .
What ’s up with that ?
Was there an elite cadre of fontistas working on Linux machines in a secret bunker ?
Linux is , um , not usually known for its great designers .
I could n’t limit my tweaking to the zero glyph , so in the end I made about a dozen changes .
Bitstream released these fonts with a very open license that only requires that you change the name if you change anything about the font , so I ’m releasing my changes with the same license , as the font “ Mensch ” .
A summary of the changes I made :
Zero is back to being a circle with a dot in the middle .
The ampersand ’s loop was closed .
That was also bugging me .
Three is rendered in the gothic style , because the gothic style is clearly superior .
Lowercase L is drawn in a more traditional style ( the Menlo variant looks bizarre to me ) , and one is turned gothic .
I think the original artist drew the L weirdly to make it extremely clear that it ’s not a one , but if you draw a gothic one , the difference is obvious even with a simpler L .
The bang , question , lowercase I , and lowercase J are made friendlier by turning the dots into actual circles , not just blocks .
Angle brackets are embiggened to facilitate languages like Java and C++ that use them to enclose class names .
They parallel parens and square brackets in size now .
Q and lowercase Q are made more distinct .
Lowercase Q gets a little more spunk .
( This was a bit gratuitous . )
Here ’s a sample of Mensch in use in code :
Does n’t it look cool ?
Do n’t you want it now ?
Here ’s the link !

Just three days after adding crash protection to Firefox , Mozilla rushed out another release on Friday because people playing Farmville complained that their browser was shutting down the Facebook game .
Mozilla added what it calls " out of process plug - ins " ( OOPP ) -- a feature designed to keep the browser up and running when a plug - in crashes -- to Firefox 3.6.4 , which shipped June 22 .
If Adobe 's Flash Player , Apple 's QuickTime or Microsoft 's Silverlight crashes or is unresponsive for more than 10 seconds , Firefox 3.6.4 displays a message telling the user that the browser has killed the plug-in .
But the 10 - second pause was too short .
" Following the release of Firefox 3.6.4 we heard from some users , mainly those using older computers , that they sometimes expect longer periods of non-responsiveness from plug-ins , especially with games , " said Mike Beltzner , the director of Firefox , in a post to the Mozilla blog Friday .
" For these users , the default timeout of 10 seconds was too short . "
Mozilla addressed the issue by bumping up the wait - to - terminate period to 45 seconds in Firefox 3.6.6 , which launched June 25 .
According to messages on Bugzilla , Mozilla 's bug - tracking database , the change was largely driven by gripes from users playing the popular Web - based Farmville game .
Farmville is a Flash - based game by San Francisco - based developer Zynga .
" Now that ( Firefox ) 3.6.4 has shipped , we are seeing an increasing number of reports that some users are unable to play Farmville , because Farmville hangs the browser long enough for our timeout to trigger and kill it , " said Mozilla developer Justin Dolske in a Bugzilla entry Friday night .
" Let 's hit this with a big hammer and make it 45 ( seconds ) . "
Mike Shaver , Mozilla 's head of engineering , agreed .
" There 's a massive regression in user experience for a meaningful number of users of an extremely popular property , and that a raised timeout remedies it , " said Shaver in a follow - up Bugzilla message .
" For now we need to get out of a bad hole before it gets any worse . "
Although complaints about Firefox 's quick killing of hung plug-ins were not limited to Farmville , that game was the squeaky wheel that got the update grease .
" A lot of people play Farmville .
To ignore those people for any length of time could have a significant effect on Firefox 's share of browser users , " said Firefox user Jeff Rivett on Bugzilla Sunday .
" The problem already existed , but the perceived impact suddenly changed , giving it a much higher priority . "
Users can update to Firefox 3.6.6 by downloading the new edition or by selecting " Check for Updates " from the Help menu in the browser .
Another solution , suggested Mozilla , is to completely disable OOPP .
A support document spells out the steps users must take to kill crash protection .

Introduction :
Design :
You can compare the Motorola DROID X MB810 with many other phones using our
.
large 4.3 ” TFT display
buttons
Motorola DROID X MB810 360 Degrees View :
The Android army continues to grow with the introduction of the Motorola DROID X ( MB810 ) by Verizon Wireless .
When the original Motorola DROID A855 came out last year , we were impressed by the device ’s features and build quality , as it was unique and clearly was the phone to beat .
Since then , we ’ve seen Verizon release other Android phones , such as the Motorola DEVOUR A555 LG Ally VS740 , and the HTC Droid Incredible ADR6300 , with each one targeted to a slightly different audience .
Since its release three months ago , the HTC Droid Incredible has been the premier smartphone on Verizon , sporting a 3.7 ” WVGA AMOLD display , 1GHz Snapdragon processor , 8GB internal storage and an 8 MP autofocus camera .
Unfortunately , Samsung has n’t been able to keep up with demand for its AMOLED display , which has caused a shortage , thus delaying the shipping of orders for the HTC Droid Incredible by several weeks .
Because of this , many people are looking for an alternative .
The timing could not have been better for Motorola .
Enter the DROID X .
Not only does it have a large 4.3 ” TFT WVGA display , 1GHz OMAP 3630 processor , 8 MP autofocus camera , and 8GB of internal memory , but it ’s also the first Verizon smartphone to record 720 p videos and come with a HDMI output for connecting to an HDTV .
Included in the retail package is the Motorola DROID X MB810 smartphone with a 16GB Class 4 microSDHC memory card preinstalled , 1540 mAh battery , wall charger with detachable microUSB cable , and user guides .
Since the Motorola DROID X comes endowed with a 4.3 ” display , the phone ca n’t help looking big , measuring 5.02 ” H x 2.57 ” W , but Motorola has taken steps to make it as thin as possible , just 0.39 ” thick , except for the hump at the top that houses the camera , which is about 0.60 ” thick .
Some may not like this , but the alternative would have been to make the entire phone thicker , so we ’d rather have the rest of the phone thin .
The overall construction of the Motorola DROID X MB810 feels solid , as it is built from metal and covered with a soft - touch coating , similarly to the original Motorola DROID A855 , though it is coming in at 0.5 oz less weight ( 5.47 oz total ) .
The DROID X balances well in the hand , neither top heavy nor bottom heavy , but when placed in your pants pocket , you ’ll know it ’s there , mostly due to its size .
Thewith 480x854 resolution and 16 M color support is what truly makes the Motorola DROID X stand out .
When placed next to the HTC Droid Incredible and the original Motorola DROID , you can clearly see the difference in the screen size .
Since the display on the DROID X is TFT , you do n’t get as good black levels as with AMOLED , but images still look amazing and text is clear and sharp .
Instead of using capacitive , the Motorola DROID X has four physical buttons located under the display for the Menu , Home , Back , and Search .
We liked that they are physical and require an actual press to get a response , as the front capacitive buttons on the HTC Droid Incredible and Motorola DROID can easily be touched by mistake while holding the phone .
On the left side of the DROID X is the microUSB port and micro HDMI ( type D ) video connector , while on the top is the power / lock button and 3.5 mm headset jack , and on the right are the volume rocker and shiny red camera key .
The back houses the external speaker , 8 MP camera with flash , and the battery compartment , which has to be opened to access the microSDHC memory card slot .
We should also point out that the Motorola DROID X comes with 3 microphones : one under the display that is used for picking up your voice when talking on the phone , one on the top that is used for noise cancellation while on calls , and one on the back for directional sound when recording videos .
' World News ' Political Insights : Tea Party Boil May Save Harry Reid
Be careful what you wish for : Primaries test incumbents , grass - roots energy .
WASHINGTON , June 6 , 2010  --
In this year of strange political bedfellows and stranger political outcomes , consider the case of Harry Reid and the tea partiers .
The Senate majority leader is about as loathed a figure as there is in the tea party rank - and - file .
The fact that he 's up for reelection in Nevada this year leaves him as perhaps the top target of the still - emerging movement .
All three Republicans vying to win the nomination Tuesday to take on Reid , D - Nev. , consider themselves tea partiers .
And therein rests a potential problem for the GOP that could cost them the chance to take down Reid this year .
The late momentum going into Tuesday 's primary is with Sharron Angle , who has sought to claim tea party enthusiasm by endorsing a phasing - out of the Social Security system and a shuttering of the Department of Education .
Recent polls show either of the other two Republicans -- establishment choice Sue Lowden or Danny Tarkanian , the son of former UNLV basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian -- as stronger general - election candidates against Reid in Nevada , a classic purple state these days .
Angle 's fiery candidacy is the latest manifestation of the potential for the tea party movement to cut both ways for Republicans .
Its vast political energy already defeated the party establishment 's choice in Kentucky earlier this month , and helped spark a three - way race for the Senate in Florida .
Now , in Nevada , Democrats hope tea partiers leave Republicans with a weaker general - election candidate against the Senate 's top Democrat .
Here are some other big storylines likely to emerge Tuesday , in the single biggest day of voting until Election Day 2010 :
California Dream
Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina -- favored in the GOP primaries for governor and Senate , respectively -- appear set to top the ticket for Republicans in the Golden State .
The story will be too intriguing to resist :
Two highly successful female CEOs , offering a new face for the Republican Party -- and strong chances for the GOP in a heavily Democratic state .
But the only folks not interested in that particular story may be Whitman and Fiorina themselves .
The two candidates are not close personally , and neither campaign wants to be saddled with potential baggage from the other candidate 's corporate record .
Add to that the likelihood that Whitman and Fiorina will shatter every known campaign spending record in the nation 's most populous state , in campaigns that will be largely funded out of their own pockets , and Democrats may not mind running against this particular team .
Arkansas Backlash
The political establishment could get another harsh message in Arkansas , with Sen .
Blanche Lincoln struggling to hold on to the Democratic Party 's nod in a primary run-off against Lt. Gov. Bill Halter .
The race pits organized labor against the Obama White House .
Former President Bill Clinton , still a popular figure among Democrats in Arkansas , is trying to drag Lincoln over the finish line .
Either candidate will have an uphill climb in the fall .
But it may be Halter who has greater potential in the general election :
He can run as a Washington outsider in a year when such candidates are far more popular than incumbents , and he does n't have a voting record he'd need to defend in the fall .
Palin's Pull
A bizarre series of revelations will test Sarah Palin 's choice for governor of South Carolina .
Nikki
Haley is facing down allegations from two men who say they had affairs with her -- charges she vehemently denies .
She 's even said that she 'd resign the governor 's office if proof were to emerge that she had been unfaithful to her husband .
Palin is sticking by Haley in her race against Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer , for the seat held by someone who 's no stranger to sex scandals : Republican Gov. Mark Sanford .
Palin 's pull will also be tested in the Tuesday primary in Iowa , where she has endorsed former Republican Gov. Terry Branstad over Bob Vander Plaats , who is generally seen as the tea party favorite .

11 Necessity is the Mother of Invention
A Brief Personal Account of The First Large - Scale Displacement Digester
by L. John Fry
Fig. 31 Where it all began .
L.J. Fry 's South Africa farm
I owned and operated a hog farm outside Johannesburg .
The average standing population was 1000 .
It was a model farm on 25 acres and ran most efficiently except for one considerable problem : the two tons ( wet weight ) of manure produced daily .
For years I composted it and spread it inches thick over the farm and used a rotary hoe to chop it into the soil .
This required scraping it up , piling it , watering it , and turning the piles twice , at least , then loading it on a truck and finally spreading it more or less evenly .
Heavy rains played havoc with it at times .
Often drought required using precious water to dampen the compost .
It required a lot of labor .
I then read of a suggestion that manure might decompose in the same manner as solids do in most sewage works , namely decomposition in a liquid form by methane bacteria .
Would it work on pig manure also ?
I went to the main sewage treatment plant in Johannesburg , and was taken round the entire unit .
I found the decomposition of solids ( called digestion ) most interesting .
If such solids could undergo a complete metamorphosis as to be unrecognizable from the raw product , then manure solids would presumably do the same .
There was one big difference .
Municipal waste is washed down the sewer lines with large quantities of water .
On the other hand , manure was collected by shovel and carted by wheelbarrow .
Water had to be added to turn it into a slurry .
After many months , frequent visits to the sewage works , and long hours in the local University library , I took back to the farm a sample of actively working bacteria in a sealed container as a " starter " to try out on pig manure .
I used a series of 50 gallon oil drums , cut the tops off and poured in a slurry of pig manure .
Into each drum I then added a measured quantity of " starter , " some from the sewage works and some from a sump located at the lowest point below the piggery .
Next I fitted 30 gallon drums into the slurry .
Some three weeks later the drum with the " sump starter " began to generate gas .
The smaller drum filled slowly with gas and rose above the surface of the slurry .
It was then the summer of 1956 - 1957 , days in the low 80 °F ( 27°C ) , nights 20° cooler .
It was surprising that the sharp variations of 20 °F ( 11°C ) did not kill the bacterial " brew . "
The first drum to rise was the one half fresh raw pig slurry and half " brew " from the sump .
All the others followed eventually , some weeks later , probably due to insufficient starter " brew . "
Design of the First Full Scale Displacement Methane Plant
After my success with the sump digester and a great deal of " weighing the options " I decided on a plan of twin digesters with fixed roofs and a series of gas holders to store some of the gas generated .
Having twin digesters side by side had the advantages of :
Using one as a primary and the other as a secondary digester .
Should the primary be overloaded and have a bacterial breakdown , the secondary would then be available to receive at least part of the load .
The primary digester would eventually be brought back to use by splitting the load between the two .
Different manures could be used for experimentation .
Digester Description
Outside the digester a basin was made 12 ' x 8 ' x 2 ' deep with the floor sloping to a grid made of angle iron 3 ' x 6 ' with a steel screen of 3/8 " rod with 1 " mesh .
The very heavy 3/8 " rod was found necessary to withstand the suction pull of the sludge pump and for preventing corrosion .
A short ramp up to the basin allowed for wheelbarrows of manure to be run up and tipped into the basin .
This was done daily and amounted to about 26 wheelbarrow loads of about 2 cubic feet each .
Water ( about 250 gallons ) was then hosed in and the whole mass raked with a garden rake .
When mixed to a slurry , the pump was started and the mass moved to a sand trap .
A simple but efficient system was used .
A drum with a tight fitting lid and sturdy clamp had an inlet half way down and an outlet near the top .
Sand settled to the bottom .
It was inefficient in that the sand had to be cleaned out daily and this could be done only after the top half was cleaned out first .
From there the raw slurry entered the digester through a short straight pipe , the outside portion being 2 ' above the level of the inside of the digester and the digester end down to 1 ' from the floor .
Thus no air entered the digester .
The digesters were each 50 ' long and 11 ' wide , concrete floor flat at the inlet end and sloping down sharply to the far end .
Fig. 32 Digester with storage tank in background
At the lowest point was another straight pipe as a digester outlet made of 3 " pipe with a gate valve .
It is important to note that all pipes in a digester be straight to allow for rodding out .
It is necessary from time to time .
Vital statistics to digester design and loading were brought to light by this first unit and will be discussed in detail under the heading of 1 ) loading rates , 2 ) displacement , 3 ) scum accumulation , and 4 ) gas yields .
In anticipation of having a serious problem with scum accumulation I set short lengths of pipe into the concrete roof at various angles pointing down to the digester contents , in line with the long sides of the digester .
The intention was to recirculate supernatant under pressure with a sludge pump to break the scum layer by getting the whole digester contents to rotate .
The scum would then be broken up and forced into the more liquid mass .
In practice all that happened was that the jet of supernatant made a neat hole in the scum and the mass did not move .
As a second measure , I let in a series of pipes through the floor of the digesters and recirculated gas through a compressor to bubble up and crack the scum .
This might have been effective if used daily or weekly with absolute regularity .
But once the scum became a foot thick it would no longer break up .
Also the vent holes in the floor became clogged with sand .
Both methods were failures .
Scum remained a major problem .
I suspect that many have encountered similar difficulties and have abandoned methane digestion in favor of other methods of treatment , solely because of it .
In a small digester it is not too difficult to handle ( Inner Tube Digester ) .
In a large scale unit it can build up to 1 foot depth in a year .
Scum consists of tightly knit scraps of straw from bedding or animal feed , held together by a dark colored sticky substance thrown up through the supernatant levels in the bubbling zone .
It covers the entire surface more or less evenly .
Here we come to another advantage of the displacement digester .
Since the scum forms evenly , the larger the surface area it has to form on , the longer it takes before it becomes a thick mat .
It takes up so much digester space that the whole digester becomes overloaded due to the slurry being forced through too quickly .
It then has to be either broken up and mixed back into the fermentation or physically removed .
It is my experience that when it is broken up it merely reforms again within a short time .
Little , if any , is decomposed and withdrawn with the effluent .
The problem , therefore , resolves itself to a question of physical removal at intervals .
In order to make room in the digester to load in the daily quota of slurry , withdrawals were made from the outlet end from the lowest point , that is , the sludge outlet .
I withdrew 3 or 4 days ' worth of effluent at a time , of 500 gallons each .
To do this I backed my tank truck into a short excavation so that the top of the tanker was about 2 feet below the digester roof level .
A 3 " plastic connection and two 3 " valves completed the withdrawal circuit .
On the top of the tank truck was an opening to vent out air when the tanker was being filled .
Into this I fitted a tennis ball in a cage so that when sludge rose to the vent joint , the tennis ball shut off when the tank filled .
This prevented messy overflows .
The effluent was then spread on fields as a fertilizer .
There was also a strong demand for it in Johannesburg where it was used in winter to bring up the grass faster in the spring than any other known method .
Gas yield from the two digesters averaged 8,000 cubic feet per day .
The gas was analyzed at the City Gas Works at 711 BTU per cubic foot ( sea level value ) .
Sometimes the gas yield went as high as 12,000 ft3 for weeks at a time , after a digester had recently been returned to work .
It was a matter of delayed action of the brew .
From the time the digester was half full to the time it was full ( about 3 weeks ) , the bacteria did not generate much gas .
At about the time it filled up , the backlog would surge gas production .
To provide the heat to the first displacement digester , I built an engine room adjacent to the digester outlet end .
The engine was fueled by 6000 cubic feet of gas daily and the cooling water and exhaust gases were returned to the digester to maintain the optimum temperature .
The exhaust gas was led through a series of boulders against one digester wall .
The boulders were packed with dry earth covered , in turn , by a layer of concrete as weatherproofing .
Fig. 33 Spreading the effluent
The engine design called for a maximum cooling water temperature of 140 °F ( 60 °C ) .
This coincided exactly with the maximum temperature for pipes laid on the digester floor .
If a higher temperature had been used , the sludge would have " caked " on the pipes and prevented the transfer of the heat .
So a small 3/ 4 " pump was installed , driven directly by the engine , and run at slow speed ( to improve endurance ) to circulate water .
In the circuit there was also a 200 gallon header tank to keep the lines full at all times .
In winter it was bypassed and in summer the 200 gallon tank was taken into the circuit as a means of cooling the water to prevent the digester temperature from rising over 95 °F ( 35 °C ) .
The engine and digester combination ran day and night for 6 years , except for occasional stoppages and for repairs .
We are taking the experience gained from this major experiment to draw plans for a series of projects in methane digestion , in a range of sizes .
However , it is worth mentioning that the whole methane plant including engine cost about $ 10,000 and produced 8000 ft3 gas daily .
At the altitude of 5500 ft above sea level the B.T.U. value was 585 per ft3 .
Thus , 4,680 B.T.U. ( x10< sup>3</sup > ) per day or 46.8
Therms .
At the present 1973 price in Santa Barbara this amounts to $ 7.57 per day or $ 16,578 over the 6 years , in gas alone .
The saving in labor in the loading and spreading of manure made for a far faster return on capital .
By far the greatest return was neither in gas nor labor saving , but in the value to the soil of the effluent returned as a fertilizing material .

My son wakes up between 5:30 and 5:50 every morning .
We call him the CEO .
He rolls out of bed , stomps toward his door , opens it , walks out , slams the door as hard as he can , then stomps into our bedroom saying , " Come on , let 's go downstairs " in his little boy voice .
If I want to wake up early , I do n't even set an alarm clock anymore .
I just rely on him .
So when I wanted to get up early to write about Thursday night 's Game 6 in Boston , I just assumed he would wake me up in time .
Nope .
He woke up at 6:45 .
An hour late .
I hopped out of bed for a hasty wake - up shower , but not before asking him , " What happened ?
Where were you ? "
His answer : " I do n't know , Daddy .
I did n't wake up . "
Same goes for the Cleveland Cavaliers .
They never woke up .
You could pick this series apart for years , but the NBA playoffs boil down to one thing : urgency .
For professional basketball , there are three types and three types only .
The first occurs when a team collectively says , " We would walk through fire to win this game . "
( Think 2008 Celtics , 2009 Lakers or 2010 Suns . )
The second happens when a former champion that has battled internally to keep its edge says to itself , " You know what ?
We 're not done yet .
We 're not ready to give this up . "
( Call it a retro-urgency .
Think 2010 Celtics or 2010 Lakers . )
The third is faux urgency -- when a team 's players do n't trust each other or their coach and do n't have the right leadership in place , but they 're desperately pressing to make a bad situation work anyway .
That 's the worst kind of urgency .
They all fully understand the magnitude of the moment , only they can't quite do enough about it .
Maybe it looks as if they 're trying , but their body language betrays them .
( Important note :
If you do n't want to leave out the 2010 Atlanta Hawks , " complete apathy " is the fourth type of urgency .
By the way , I have no idea whether Orlando has real urgency or faux urgency .
I 'm leaning toward the latter .
Stay tuned . )
You cannot call what happened in the Cavs - Celtics series an upset .
Boston played better in five of the six games .
The C's had four of the five best players .
They were better defensively .
Their best player ( Rajon Rondo ) played better than Cleveland 's best player ( LeBron James ) .
They had playoff - proven guys who kept coming through .
They had better crowds .
They showed more heart .
This was not an upset but still , it felt like one .
And only because we were duped by Cleveland 's faux urgency ( for most of the season , it felt genuine ) and Boston 's retro-urgency ( for most of the season , it was dormant ) .
The playoffs hinge on toughness , chemistry , defense , leadership and urgency .
Cleveland lost all those battles .
Every one of them .
I once heard a great story about Game 6 of the 2006 Finals , when Miami was trying to clinch the title in Dallas , from someone who has seen the unedited footage of Miami 's huddles in the second - half timeouts .
Pat Riley basically stopped coaching .
Threw out his X's and O's .
Quit giving advice .
Stopped drawing up plays .
So what did he do ?
He screamed at his guys like a boxing trainer .
You 're tougher than them !
YOU'RE TOUGHER THAN THEM !
Do n't let up !
They are ready to quit !
They are ready to fold !
Keep attacking them !
Keep getting to the rim !
Keep knocking their asses down !
No layups !
No dunks !
Stay together !
YOU ARE TOUGHER THAN THEM !
YOU ARE TOUGHER THAN THEM !
That 's what he did for the entire second half .
Eventually , his players believed him .
Remember that story when you 're picking apart James this summer .
From the moment he entered the NBA , he 's been asked to do everything himself .
He 's never had a good coach .
He 's never had a great teammate , or even a very good one .
These past two years , he 's been asked to vacillate between Magic Mode and MJ Mode depending on the situation .
Because his front office screwed up so many times , his supporting cast ended up being a peculiar blend of hand - me - downs , discount guys and bargain pickups from teams that wanted to cut salary .
It ended up being too much .
One - man teams do n't win titles .
As summer free agency approaches , LeBron 's camp will shift public blame to his coach ( Mike Brown , who could be sued by Cavs fans for coaching malpractice after this series ) and his GM ( Danny Ferry , who dropped the ball at the 2009 trade deadline and never found LeBron a Pippen - type supporting guy ) .
His people will make the following sentiment clear to Cleveland owner Dan Gilbert : For LeBron to even consider staying , you need to splurge on a better coach and a better GM .
And even then , LeBron might leave .
Part of me does n't blame him .
Part of me .
Because the other part feels as if we learned something substantial about LeBron James this spring .
I always thought his ceiling looked like this : Jordan 's DNA crossed with Magic 's DNA crossed with Bo Jackson .
Nope .
Take the Jordan DNA out .
Have to .
Jordan was a ruthless mother ******.
Jordan was a killer .
Jordan did n't care if his teammates despised him .
Jordan never , ever , not in a million years , would have allowed his team to quit in the final two minutes of Thursday night 's game the way LeBron did .
His teammates feared him , loathed him , revered him and played accordingly .
Bird had that same quality .
In the second half of his career , so did Magic .
Winning meant so much to those guys that their teammates almost did n't have a choice ; they had to follow suit .
Or else .
LeBron James is 25 years old .
He has played seven seasons -- 548 regular - season games and 71 playoff games .
There 's a feeling that he can still get better and , with better teammates , maybe he could .
But fundamentally , to paraphrase Bill Parcells , he is what he is at this point -- a gregarious , larger - than - life , supremely gifted basketball player who 's better at making us say " WOW ! " than anything else .
If he owned that cutthroat Jordan chromosome , or Magic 's leadership chromosome , it would have surfaced by now .
In Wednesday 's column before Game 6 , I mentioned how there comes a point in every great player 's career when you have to pour the cement , let it harden and see what you have .
We poured the cement for LeBron in this series .
It hardened last night .
We know what we have .
And last night , LeBron 's DNA finally made sense to me .
Throw Jordan out .
Throw Magic out , too , except for the " controls sections of a game with passing / rebounding " part .
Keep Bo. Now , add this guy Julius Erving .
I will explain .
Doc was one of the 20 best NBA players of all time .
( In my book , I ranked him 16th . )
Like LeBron , he did things on a basketball court that nobody had ever seen before .
Like LeBron , he made the court shrink with a full head of steam .
Like LeBron , his peers revered his talents .
Like LeBron , he was articulate and thoughtful .
Like LeBron , you watched him from afar and thought , " He seems like a good guy . "
Like LeBron , he was a small forward who rebounded bigger than his size ( at least the first few years ) .
Like LeBron , his durability was almost unparalleled .
( Doc played in 1,277 of a possible 1,395 games , including seven seasons of 95 - plus games ) .
Like LeBron , women and children loved him .
Like LeBron , he was extremely savvy about his image ( and how to cultivate it ) .
Like LeBron , he was an incredible , once - in - a - generation athlete .
Like LeBron , his faulty outside shooting plagued him , so teams laid off him , packed the middle and prayed he would miss 20 - footers .
And , like LeBron , he was a nice guy .
( Hold that last thought for a second . )
Doc at age 26 ( ABA , 1975 - 76 season , his fifth ) : 29.3 PPG , 11.0 RPG , 5.0 APG , 50.7 % FG .
LeBron at age 25 ( this year , his seventh season ) : 29.7 PPG , 7.3 RPG , 8.6 APG , 50.3 % FG .
Doc in the ' 76 playoffs ( 13 games ) : 34.7 PPG , 12.6 RPG , 4.9 APG , 53.3 % FG .
LeBron in the ' 10 playoffs ( 11 games ) : 29.1 PPG , 9.3 RPG , 7.6 APG , 50.2 % FG .
The big difference : Doc captured two ABA titles ( in ' 74 and ' 76 ) .
LeBron has n't won anything .
Of course , the ABA played right into Doc 's wheelhouse :
The league did n't have enough big guys , nobody played defense , a school - yard - type game carried the day , and the league was diluted enough that someone as gifted as Doc could run roughshod .
When the ABA and NBA merged in the summer of 1976 , Doc switched teams ( to Philly ) and the big question became , " When will Dr. J win an NBA title ? "
Now here 's where the parallels get interesting .
Doc spent the next six seasons falling short as everyone picked him apart .
Stuff like , " He 's not the same guy that he was in the ABA , " " He 's too nice , he does n't have a killer instinct " and " His teammates are letting him down . "
The ' 77 Sixers ( a selfish team of freelancers ) memorably self - combusted in the Finals against Bill Walton 's methodical Blazers .
When the ' 78 Bullets shocked Philly in six , not only did Washington 's Bobby Dandridge outplay Doc in the series but everyone started calling David Thompson ( rather than Doc ) the NBA 's best ABA import .
The '79 Spurs knocked Philly out again , with San Antonio 's Larry Kenon playing Doc to a draw .
( That March , Sports Illustrated ran a feature called " Hey , What 's Up With the Doc ? " and wondered whether his best years were behind him . )
Once Philly quietly started building a team of unselfish guys around him ( Caldwell Jones , Bobby Jones , Mo Cheeks ) and found him a second scorer ( Andrew Toney ) , Doc 's fortunes changed : Finals appearances in 1980 and 1982 , as well as a ( dubious , but still ) MVP award in 1981 .
But only when Philly acquired Moses Malone , a true alpha dog and the league 's best player at the time , did Doc finally get an NBA ring ( in 1983 ) .
Let 's go back to those first three Philly seasons : Doc was stuck playing with guys such as George McGinnis ( the ultimate ball stopper , owner of the all - time turnover record ) , World B. Free ( gunner ) , Darryl Dawkins ( great athlete , low basketball IQ ) , Jellybean Bryant ( Kobe 's dad -- I do n't need to say any more ) and Doug Collins ( another guy who needed shots ) .
He deferred to them way too much .
For the ' 76 Nets , Doc averaged 22.7 shots per game .
From ' 77 through ' 79 : 16.7 , 16.4 , 18.7 .
Do you realize what a joke that was ?
Unfortunately , he was too nice of a guy .
Doc allowed everyone else to determine his destiny .
When he tried to take over it never felt right .
He was always one of those flow - of - the - game stars .
Always .
The same quality that made him a wonderful teammate also made him a liability if things were falling apart .
( Sound familiar ? )
Doc's
Philly teams kept self - combusting at the worst possible times .
The ' 77 Sixers took a 2 - 0 lead in the Finals , then blew four straight .
They lost do - or - die playoff games by two points ( 1978 ) and three points ( 1979 ) .
In 1980 , everyone remembers Magic ( only a rookie ) playing five positions , notching a 42 - 15 - 7 and improbably winning Los Angeles the title ; nobody ever wonders why Philly , playing at home against a team missing the 1980 MVP ( Kareem ) , laid such an unforgivable egg .
In 1981 , the Sixers blew a 3 - 1 series lead to Boston in the Eastern Conference finals , losing the last three games by five points total .
( And by the way , they led in the final minute of all three games . )
By the time Philly blew the 1982 Finals , the consensus on Doc was this : phenomenal player , loved by all , an ambassador for the game , one of the best ever does n't quite have it .
Then Moses showed up , Philly finally won a title , and people everywhere forgot they had felt that way .
Back to LeBron : I think we know what we have .
He 's Doc 2.0 with a little Magic and a healthy dose of Bo sprinkled in .
That means the following
1. LeBron can win an NBA title ( or titles ) as the best player on a really good team with another leader in place ( whether it 's a great coach or another player ) .
2 . If LeBron switches teams to a similar situation to the one he had in Cleveland these past two years ( basically , LeBron and the LeBronettes ) , that wo n't translate to titles .
( FYI : He finished seven wins short last spring and 10 wins short this spring .
Not even close . )
Staying in Cleveland , hiring John Calipari and sign - and - trading Jamison and Hickson to Toronto for Chris Bosh that wo n't solve the problem here .
Neither will jumping to the Knicks / Clippers / Mavericks .
3 . If he cares about winning titles ( multiple ) and reaching his full potential as a player , he has only one move : the Chicago Bulls .
That 's always been the play .
If you 've been listening to my podcast or reading this column , you know that I 've been touting this possibility since the winter , and here 's why : Deep down , I think LeBron ( and , just as important , the people around him ) realizes that he needs one more kick - ass player to make his life easier .
That means Miami or Chicago .
And really , I can't imagine him signing with Miami because Dwyane Wade is almost too good .
LeBron wants help , but he does n't want to be perceived as riding someone else 's coattails , either .
Wade might be the best player alive for all we know -- he certainly was in 2006 , and he 's been banged - up and trapped on bad teams ever since .
No , Chicago makes more sense .
Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah proved they were warriors these past two springs .
They could be LeBron 's Pippen / Grant or McHale / DJ. Easily .
Rose could take the creative load off LeBron on nights when he does n't have it .
Rose could come through a few times in the clutch .
Rose could hide some of LeBron 's faults .
It 's the single smartest basketball move for LeBron James .
It 's the Michael Corleone move .
Of course , it does n't have the same upside as New York : Biggest market , great fans , most meaning .
If LeBron saved professional basketball in New York and brought Knicks fans their first title since 1973 ?
That 's the best available accomplishment in team sports right now .
Name me a better one .
You can't .
Biggest star , biggest city .
But it would n't be a smart basketball move .
He could bring only one good free agent with him , and from what we 've seen , would LeBron +
( Chris Bosh , Carlos Boozer , Joe Johnson or Amar'e Stoudemire ) combined with what the Knicks already have ( not much ) translate to anything more than what just happened in Cleveland ?
Please .
That 's the Sonny Corleone move .
The other realistic option : Just stay in Cleveland .
Finish what you started .
That 's the second - best available accomplishment in team sports right now :
Be like Tim Duncan .
Be the guy who did n't flee for greener pastures .
Be the guy who stayed when almost everyone else would have left .
Be the hometown kid who saved Cleveland sports , brought home the first title since 1964 and single - handedly removed the fatalistic malaise that hangs over the city .
Be the guy who proved loyalty matters more than anything else .
That 's the Connie Corleone move .
Remember when she finally forgave Michael for killing Carlo and became the matriarch of the family ?
Exactly .
Family trumped logic .
( And yes , if you 're scoring at home , the Clippers would be the Fredo Corleone move . )
It 's one of the greatest sports decisions I can remember : LeBron can choose winning ( Chicago ) , loyalty ( Cleveland ) or a chance at immortality ( New York ) .
We have one answer -- Doc 2.0 with some Magic and Bo sprinkled in -- and now , we 're waiting on the other .
Within the next six weeks , we will find out precisely what matters to LeBron James .
Just know that , wherever he lands , he 's going to need a little more help than we thought .
Final point : Between Games 5 and 6 of the Cavs - Celtics series , an Austin , Texas , reader named Chris Rider sent me the following e-mail :
" I figured LeBron out , dude .
I think you define a player by defining what is most important to them in one word .
" MJ -- Winning .
Hands down , all he wanted to do was win .
And that 's over - used for a lot of athletes , but not him .
" Kobe -- Greatness .
Yes he 's going to win some , but only because he wants to be considered great and that will be a by - product at times .
But you 'd also see him shoot his team out of a game ; jack 3s when he should press the issue and get to the paint .
He did n't mind losing a few games if people came away saying ' Kobe is great ; look what happens when he does n't shoot . ' "
" LeBron -- Amaze .
I think he just really wants to amaze people .
Which is why he spends 10 minutes before the game throwing underhand , left - hand half - court shots .
Why he celebrates amazing dunks and blocks , but is n't working just as hard to win .
I know the Cavs are n't great without him , but he 's got PLENTY on that team to win rings with . "
Is that totally fair ?
Probably not .
But just for fun , let 's extend Chris ' game
Russell , Magic , Bird , Duncan , Walton , West and Havlicek : Winning .
Wilt : Numbers .
Oscar and Barry : Perfection .
Shaq : Fame .
Kareem and Elgin : Pride .
Moses : Rebounds .
Malone and Garnett : Work .
Barkley : Fun .
Cousy , Stockton , Isiah , Pippen and Nash : Team .
For Doc and LeBron , you probably need more than one word .
By the rules of the game , we can use only one .
So we 're forced to pick this one : Amaze .
You are who you are .

The Chinese central bank made a vague announcement about its currency policy on its website today , which the officialdom , on cue , treated as a major move ( to wit : “ China vows increased currency flexibility ” at the Financial Times , “ Chinese say they intend to free up their currency , ” Washington Post ) . )
As we describe below , this “ announcement ” is basically a non-statement to silence Westerners calling for a revaluation in the runup to the Toronto G - 20 meeting later this month .
This is the full text of its English version :
In view of the recent economic situation and financial market developments at home and abroad , and the balance of payments ( BOP ) situation in China , the People´s Bank of China has decided to proceed further with reform of the RMB exchange rate regime and to enhance the RMB exchange rate flexibility .
Starting from July 21 , 2005 , China has moved into a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies .
Since then , the reform of the RMB exchange rate regime has been making steady progress , producing the anticipated results and playing a positive role .
When the current round of international financial crisis was at its worst , the exchange rate of a number of sovereign currencies to the U.S. dollar depreciated by varying margins .
The stability of the RMB exchange rate has played an important role in mitigating the crisis´ impact , contributing significantly to Asian and global recovery , and demonstrating China´s efforts in promoting global rebalancing .
The global economy is gradually recovering .
The recovery and upturn of the Chinese economy has become more solid with the enhanced economic stability .
It is desirable to proceed further with reform of the RMB exchange rate regime and increase the RMB exchange rate flexibility .
In further proceeding with reform of the RMB exchange rate regime , continued emphasis would be placed to reflecting market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies .
The exchange rate floating bands will remain the same as previously announced in the inter - bank foreign exchange market .
China´s external trade is steadily becoming more balanced .
The ratio of current account surplus to GDP , after a notable reduction in 2009 , has been declining since the beginning of 2010 .
With the BOP account moving closer to equilibrium , the basis for large - scale appreciation of the RMB exchange rate does not exist .
The People´s Bank of China will further enable market to play a fundamental role in resource allocation , promote a more balanced BOP account , maintain the RMB exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level , and achieve the macroeconomic and financial stability in China .
Yves here .
There are some real internal inconsistencies .
While this does represent an announcement of an intent to liberalize , it lacks any particulars as to timing and mechanisms .
Moreover , it specifically rejects the idea of widening the bands in which the RMB trades , which is the litmus test of a move to a market - based exchange rate ( you ’d expect gradual widening of the permitted band as a precursor to abandoning currency intervention ) .
Instead , what this appears to signal is a shift of the basis for managing the currency to :
1 . Use of a basket of reference currencies , rather than just the dollar .
China is contending that that is what it has been doing since 2005 , but the language allows for the possibility for a change in the mix .
Thus this signals China ’s intent to move away from a dollar reserve currency regime ( it has taken other measures along these lines , for instance , encouraging invoicing in currencies other than the dollar ) .
The problem is that a permitted trading band vs. a basket of currencies is what China supposedly implemented in 2007 , and the results have looked an awful lot like a dirty float against the dollar .
2. Arguing for the balance of payments as the metric of the appropriateness of the exchange rates .
China contends that because its balance of payments is improving ( as in its trade surplus is weakening ) it really does not need to do much ( as in it has ruled out a meaningful revaluation ) .
This is essentially an argument that the large trade deficit for March means critics need to lay off , a posture it took in April .
The problem , however , was the March deficit appears to have been the result of one - off factors .
China ’s exports in May were larger than expected , due to more robust export growth .
And note Chinese officials had expected exports to rise 50 % over 2009 .
The fact is , as Michael Pettis pointed out in his latest post , no country in modern times has ever run a trade surplus as a percent of GDP as large as China does .
That means even if it does decide to extricate itself from this position , it will want to do so gradually .
As Pettis noted :
As a share of global GDP China ’s recent trade surpluses ( roughly 0.6-0.7 % of global GDP ) are easily the highest recorded in the last 100 years .
This is all the more striking when you consider that the two previous record holders , the US in the late 1920s ( with a trade surplus equal roughly to 0.4 % of global GDP ) and Japan in the late 1980s ( 0.5 % of global GDP ) , were relatively much larger economies .
The US represented more than 30 % of global GDP in the late 1920s , and Japan represented 15 % of global GDP in the late 1980s .
By contrast China represents only 8 % of global GDP today .
In the same post , he also rejected the idea that China ’s trade balance is moderating :
In other words the cost of capital for China ’s already too - capital - intensive and overinvesting economy is declining , and so worsening the domestic imbalances , and all but assuring that China ’s trade surplus excluding Europe will surge ( and maybe even including Europe it will still rise ) .
In fact one of the least surprising of the “ surprises ” of recent months was China ’s May trade figures .
Here is what an article on Thursday in the South China Morning Post says : Mainland ’s exports rose 48.5 per cent in May from a year earlier and imports were up 48.3 per cent , the General Administration of Customs said on Thursday , giving the country a trade surplus of US $ 19.53 billion , up from just US $ 1.7 billion in April .
The median forecast of 32 economists polled by Reuters was for exports to rise 32 per cent and imports to climb 45 per cent , with a projected trade surplus of US $ 8.8 billion .
Sources said on Wednesday that export growth was up about 50 per cent from a year ago , giving a boost to global financial markets as investors expressed relief that the country ’s fast growing economy did not appear to be juddering to a sharp halt .
Some surprise , although I should add that I have a worrying feeling that the subsequent applause by the global stock markets may have got it exactly backwards .
Net exports had to surge after the temporary contraction earlier this year , and in fact if you exclude the impact of commodity stockpiling , which overstates outflows due to consumption imports and understates outflows due to investment , China ’s trade surplus would have probably been much higher .
It is being artificially reduced by commodity stockpiling , which of course must be reversed at some point in the future .
I expect that Chinese net exports will continue very strong this year , perhaps even taking into account the effect of the European crisis , which should be excluded from the number .
And of course I expect US net imports , and with it US unemployment , will surge to politically unacceptable levels throughout this year and next , thanks in large part the European crisis and the unwillingness of anyone else to absorb it .
Yves again .
With this as background , there is a completely different way to read the China announcement .
Start from the top :
Starting from July 21 , 2005 , China has moved into a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies .
Since then , the reform of the RMB exchange rate regime has been making steady progress , producing the anticipated results and playing a positive role .
When the current round of international financial crisis was at its worst , the exchange rate of a number of sovereign currencies to the U.S. dollar depreciated by varying margins .
The stability of the RMB exchange rate has played an important role in mitigating the crisis´ impact , contributing significantly to Asian and global recovery , and demonstrating China´s efforts in promoting global rebalancing .
Yves here .
First , the “ basket of currencies ” talk is technically accurate but misleading .
China allowed for a widening of the band against the dollar and a smidge of appreciation .
And the talk on what happened during the crisis is more than a bit of a distortion .
China is effectively contending that by keeping its dollar peg during the crisis ( when the dollar was rising , which was to China ’s disadvantage ) it was being a good soldier and “ promoting global rebalancing ” .
Huh ?
Although China ’s trade surplus shrank in early 2009 , the big story of trade during the crisis was : 1 . Trade volumes plunged and 2 .
China ’s surplus in quite a few months was at record levels .
Why ?
Pretty much every other trade surplus nation saw its surplus collapse ( Japan in particular , as its yen soared ) and China got a disproportionate share of what trade there was .
Calling that an effort to promote global rebalancing is a serious distortion .
( By the way , old Asia hands will recall the US unwittingly promoted this construction , that of keeping a dollar peg when other currencies were depreciating as being pro-stability , during the 1997 Asian crisis , when China no doubt considered devaluing the renminbi , but stood pat at the US ’s request ) .
So as I read this announcement , China has committed to do ….. absolutely nothing .
In fact , this language could just as easily be used to justify shifting its dirty float to be against the dollar ( which is now comparatively strong and will continue to be so as long as the eurozone is on its austerity kick ) to putting greater weight upon the euro in its basket , which would lead to a devaluation against the dollar .
Note I am not saying that will happen , but the announcement does not preclude that idea if China ’s trade surplus were to deteriorate .
Notice the goals the PBoC commits itself to meet :
…. further enable market to play a fundamental role in resource allocation , promote a more balanced BOP account , maintain the RMB exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level , and achieve the macroeconomic and financial stability in China .
Yves here .
Note the contradictions : you ca n’t have the market play a “ fundamental role ” in setting FX rates , and “ maintain the RMB exchange rate basically stable . ”
And China is not going to make any moves that compromise “ macroeconomic and financial stability in China . ”
I ’m not the only observer to read this announcement cynically .
From the Wall Street Journal :
Beijing ’s move may not , however , result in a large appreciation of the yuan .
Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad , former head of the International Monetary Fund ’s China division , cautioned that Beijing is returning to a policy of linking the yuan to a basket of currencies , without identifying the composition of the basket .
About a quarter of China ’s trade is in euros , a currency that has been in a steep slide against the dollar recently .
If the euro composes a large share of China ’s invisible basket , the yuan could actually weaken relative to the dollar , Mr. Prasad warned .
“ If the world now says , ‘ Let your currency float against the dollar , ’ the Chinese could say , ‘ Do you really want it to depreciate ? ’ ” Mr. Prasad said , describing Beijing ’s move as “ canny . ” Mr. Prasad said China ’s main concession was therefore not the content of its new policy , a return to the one that was in place before the global financial crisis .
Rather , Beijing ’s principal shift was in the timing , offering at least a symbolic gesture ahead of the summit in Toronto next weekend of leaders from the Group of 20 major industrialized and emerging economies .
“ They ’ve actually accomplished two significant objectives , ” Mr. Prasad said .
“ They ” re taking away the political heat , but without significantly affecting their export competitiveness . ”
So what does this announcement really achieve ?
Buy time .
As we noted , there was a firestorm of criticism in Washington over the sharp rise in Chinese exports in May .
This announcement comes right before the G20 meeting , where China was sure to come under attack if nothing appeared to have changed .
The Administration really does not want a row with China right now ; Geithner was clearly reluctant to brand China a currency manipulator ( as he was being pushed to do by Congress in April , when China miraculously announced a trade deficit right before the required Treasury semi-annual window ) and now has even less reason to want to , given that we are looking for China ’s support in the row between North and South Korea over North Korea ’s alleged sinking of a South Korean warship and in sanctions against Iran .
So not surprisingly , the Administration is playing along and touting this non-commitment as meaningful .
From Bloomberg :
Geithner , in a statement , praised China ’s decision and added that “ vigorous implementation would make a positive contribution to strong and balanced global growth . ”
The Obama administration received advance notice of the announcement , U.S. officials said .
And analysts are also talking China ’s book while pointing out that this takes the heat off China for now :
“ It makes it a lot more difficult for Washington and Congress to do China bashing , ” { Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Global Economist Jim ] O’Neill said .
“ The Chinese are increasingly confident they can make this adjustment to a domestic - driven economy rather than the one relying on exporting low - value - added stuff to the rest of the world . ”

But as Pettis pointed out , China has been increasingly reliant on investment as a source of growth , simply unheard of levels relative to GDP .
And he points out another not widely recognized fact : this actually impedes the process of shifting to more consumption , which is necessary for China to become less export oriented ( ie , it has plenty of opportunity to sell goods internally if it can increase income levels and consumption rates over time ) ;
More importantly , China ’s financial repression is also at the heart of the imbalance in the Chinese economy .
By transferring large amounts of wealth from the household sector to net borrowers ( perhaps as much as 5 - 10 % of GDP annually , as I explain in an earlier entry ) , it creates the large growth differential between national GDP and household income that is at the root of China ’s very high savings and very low consumption levels .
I should add that if much of this investment is non-economic , as I believe it is , this will exacerbate even further the differential .
Why ?
Because the total economic cost of the investment ( which must include the real debt forgiveness implied by excessively low interest rates ) , and which will be borne over the future as the cost are amortized in the form of debt repayment , exceeds the total economic value of the investment ( which must include externalities ) , which will accrue upfront .
This means that we get more investment - driven growth today and less consumption - driven growth tomorrow .

The Chinese officialdom clearly can , at any point , announce and implement policies to move the RMB either higher relative to other currencies and / or allow wider trading bands as a way to move towards a less controlled currency regime .
But I do n’t see any reason to expect it to happen until China gets more pushback from its trading partners .
Their enthusiastic responses to this noncommittal announcement seem likely to insure that has been kicked down the road until China ’s continuing trade surpluses force politicians to turn the heat back on .

The football - shaped molecules are the largest molecules ever found in space
Scientists have detected the largest molecules ever seen in space , in a cloud of cosmic dust surrounding a distant star .
The football - shaped carbon molecules are known as buckyballs , and were only discovered on Earth 25 years ago when they were made in a laboratory .
These molecules are the " third type of carbon " - with the first two types being graphite and diamond .
The researchers report their findings in the journal Science .
This provides convincing evidence that the buckyball has ... existed since time immemorial in the dark recesses of our galaxy Harry Kroto , Chemistry Nobel laureate
Buckyballs consist of 60 carbon atoms arranged in a sphere .
The atoms are linked together in alternating patterns of hexagons and pentagons that , on the molecular scale , look exactly like a football .
They belong to a class of molecules called buckminsterfullerenes - named after the architect Richard Buckminster Fuller , who developed the geodesic dome design that they so closely resemble .
The research group , led by Jan Cami from the University of Western Ontario in Canada , made its discovery using Nasa 's Spitzer infrared telescope .
Professor Cami and his colleagues were not specifically looking for buckyballs , but spotted their unmistakable infrared " signature " .
" They oscillate and vibrate in lots of different ways , and in doing so they interact with infrared light at very specific wavelengths , " explained Professor Cami .
When the telescope detected emissions at those wavelengths , Professor Cami knew he was looking a signal from the largest molecules ever found in space .
" Some of my undergraduate students call me a world record holder , " he told BBC News .
" But I do n't think there 's a record for that . "
Image caption
The molecules were named after the developer of the geodesic dome
The signal came from a star in the southern hemisphere constellation of Ara , 6,500 light - years away .
Professor Cami said the discovery was perhaps not surprising , but was " very exciting " .
" Lots of scientists have expected that they would exist in space , because they are amongst the most stable and durable of materials , " he said .
" So once they 've formed in space , would be very hard to destroy them .
" But this is clear evidence of an entirely new class of molecule existing there . "
The researchers now want to find out what fraction of the Universe 's carbon might be " locked up " in these spheres .
They also want to use the known properties of buckyballs to gain a better understanding of physical and chemical processes in space .
The discovery may even help shed light on other unexplained chemical signatures that have already been detected in cosmic dust .
Third way
Back on Earth , the discovery of buckyballs ' existence was also accidental .
Researchers were attempting to simulate conditions in the atmospheres of ageing , carbon - rich giant stars , in which chains of carbon had been detected .
" The experiments were set up to make those long carbon chains , and then something unexpected came out - these soccer ball type molecules , which just looked weird , " said Professor Cami .
" And now it turns out that those conditions that were deliberately created in a laboratory actually occur in space too - we just had to look in the right place . "
Sir Harry Kroto , now at Florida State University in the US , shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of buckyballs .
He commented : " This most exciting breakthrough provides convincing evidence that the buckyball has , as I long suspected , existed since time immemorial in the dark recesses of our galaxy .
" It 's so beautiful that it 's been hiding from us and it took an experiment trying to uncover what was going on in stars to find it . "
He told BBC News : " All the carbon in your body came from star dust , so at one time some that carbon may have been in the form of buckyballs . "
The defendant in the Times Square bomb plot pleaded guilty on Monday for his role in the aborted attack , an abrupt and expedited end to a terror plot that extended into Pakistan and an Islamic militant group there .
The defendant , Faisal Shahzad , 30 , listened as each count of the 10 - count indictment was read to him , and then indicated that he understood the charges and the penalties that he faced .
“ I want to plead guilty 100 times over , ” said Mr. Shahzad , who faces life in prison .
Mr. Shahzad described his training in Pakistan , where he said he went specifically to learn from the Pakistani Taliban how to build a bomb that he planned to detonate in the United States .
His guilty plea was consistent with his behavior since his arrest on May 3 , when he began cooperating with federal authorities for more than two weeks without counsel and waiving his Miranda rights .
The only question would be whether Mr. Shahzad would be seeking some sort of leniency in sentencing in return for his assistance , something his lawyers may be seeking .

NEW YORK – Outgoing Ambassador to the UN Gabriella Shalev told American journalists on Monday that Israel is “ the most isolated , lonely country in the world , ” and that the biggest threat to its existence is not Iranian nuclear proliferation , but international attempts to delegitimize it .
Shalev told an Israel Project luncheon in Washington that threats to Israel ’s right to defend itself constitute the “ first challenge ” of the Jewish state , according toShalev cited Iran and tensions with the Palestinians as other significant problems , but particularly highlighted the international community ’s actions toward Israel as being potentially detrimental to the country ’s future .
She specifically cited European court prosecutions of Israeli officials for alleged human rights offenses and UN efforts to single out Israeli conduct for reprimand .
Shalev said that as sanctions resolutions at the UN put international pressure on Iran , Israel ’s biggest threat is now those who question the Jewish state ’s right to exist and defend itself , thereported .
Israel Project president Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi toldshe felt Shalev ’s remarks had been on point .
“ Iran has been the No. 1 issue in the pro-Israel community for many years , but right now there is something of a sigh of relief that the world has come to a deeper understanding that Iran is not just Israel ’s threat , it is the world ’s threat , ” Mizrahi said , citing sanction developments in the US , UN and Europe .
“ What [ Shalev ] was saying was that everyone at the UN in theory supports Israel ’s right to defend itself , but when it ’s actualized , they stop supporting it in many cases , ” Mizrahi said , citing the May 31 Gaza flotilla incident as an example .
“ I think [ Shalev ] is right .
I think that this is a major problem , and we ’re deeply , deeply concerned about it .
” In terms of the United Nations , UN Watch director Hillel Neuer told thefrom Geneva that “ Ambassador Shalev is exactly right .
While the UN was founded on the highest ideals , many of its influential assemblies have turned into Ground Zero for ‘ lawfare ’ – the Arab - led assault on Israel using international law to weaken its legitimacy and international standing .
” Efforts to utilize international law as a blunt instrument against Israel , Neuer said , are particularly evident in the context of the Human Rights Council , a UN body based in Geneva .
“ Out of some 40 resolutions adopted since 2006 , more than 70 percent target Israel , while granting impunity to Hamas terror , ” Neuer said of the Human Rights Council .
“ Victims of abuses worldwide are ignored .
The [ HRC ] currently has multiple inquiries under way against democratic Israel , yet none on massacres committed by gross violators like China , Iran , Sudan , or Kyrgyzstan .
Eleanor Roosevelt and René Cassin , the proud Zionists who created the UN ’s human rights system in response to the atrocities of World War II , are surely turning in their graves .
” Responding to these remarks , a spokesperson for the UN Secretary General ’s office said on Tuesday that “ Israel is a member in good standing of the United Nations , which has repeatedly stressed the rights of the Israeli people , as has Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon .
Israel ’s rights as a member state have been established repeatedly , including through General Assembly and Security Council resolutions .
” At a departing reception held for Shalev last week in New York by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations , Susan Rice , the US ambassador to the UN , praised her efforts at the world body .
Rice told attendees that she would “ continue US efforts to combat all international attempts to challenge the legitimacy of Israel – including and especially at the United Nations . ” Mizrahi pointed out that at Monday ’s luncheon , Shalev ’s remarks were not made in a despairing tone .
“ She was very hopeful , ” Mizrahi said .
“ She was n’t demoralized .
She ’s fighting it . ”

In regards to episode 1266 :
Y’all were talking about Hulu and it ’s $ 10 monthly–ad included –subscription service and I have an opposing viewpoint on the issue .
I pay for cable and that cable includes ads .
I pay for HBO and HBO includes ads .
HBO has ads before and after a program , not during .
I pay extra for HBO because I am delivered uninterrupted content and that adds value to the channel ; enough value that it ’s worth paying for .
There is no value to HBO if they interrupted East Bound and Down with ads ( or if it censored the awesome Kenny Powers which it would have to do if it did rely on ads like a traditional network ) .
Likewise Hulu is a supplemental service to my cable , and it is n’t quite a cable replacement .
It may not be directly linked to my FiOS in terms of a supplemental package for my cable ( like HBO is ) , but I as the consumer view it as supplemental to my cable .
If I am paying for supplemental service I would not personally want interruptions .
Sure they ’re adding more content , and iPad / iPhone apps , but Netflix already exists in this arena for cheaper ( and Buffy is available on Netflix instantly too… ) and you get those discs at home .
If Hulu needs to pack in the cost effectiveness then charge $ 10 once for the mobile app , or only add ads to the beginning or end of shows .
Simply put the outrage is n’t because there are ads exactly , its because we ’re being asked to pay a premium for almost no additional value added .
It ’s simply not worth it , and we were all waiting in anticipation for something worth paying for .
Love the show !
Peace on ya ,
Jason

I missed this the other day , but thankfully Amanda at Pandagon included it in a post about Beck .
Listen to this :
Here we have a woman who received a tax cut from the recovery act ( stimulus ) and Glenn Beck is telling her to send it back .
Why ?
I 'm not sure .
Even though he speaks super - slowly , it 's difficult to understand the justification for returning the money to the government .
However , it sounds like Beck wants this obviously middle class woman who earns , jointly with her husband , somewhere in the middle five - figures , to send the money back because the president will be reminding Americans about where it came from ( which he actually did in his weekly address yesterday ) .
In other words : return the tax cut because this president gave it to you .
Unbelievable .
And I 'm getting emails from Beck supporters denying the notion that Beck is scamming them out of their money .
Amanda writes :
Here ’s what I ’m thinking is going on :
The woman has been trained by right wing media to be so paranoid that she can’t emotionally handle the fact that her refund check was bigger because of the Obama tax cuts , especially since that caused her to feel a pang of gratitude towards Obama , who she know she ’s supposed to hate .
And she wants to disbelieve her own eyes , but I ’m guessing that her obsession with getting a treadmill comes straight from a doctor telling her that ’s what she needs to do or else she may be facing even more serious health problems --- she mentions that she ’s on oxygen , and I think she ’s really torn .
And she could really use that money .
And Beck basically demands that she choose loyalty to right wing media and to paranoid hatred of Obama over her own health and well - being .
It 's insane .
It 's really just insane .
Beck is telling her to give up the money and better health because the money came from an Obama tax cut .
Actually , I 'm shocked he did n't insist she use the money to buy some of his conveyor - belt crap .
BP has taken responsibility for the Gulf oil spill and is leading the cleanup effort .
But a kaleidoscope of different companies was working on the Deepwater Horizon rig when it exploded April 20 and could be held legally at fault in the future .
What role are they playing in the cleanup ?
Here is a look at what they are doing :
RELATED : Should other firms in Gulf oil spill blame game be helping BP ?
Transocean
Transocean , which is based in Switzerland , owned the Deepwater Horizon oil rig .
Transocean has three ships , the Discoverer Enterprise and Development Driller II and III , which , according to fleet update reports on the company ’s website , are charging a combined $ 1.5 million per day to BP to assist with spill - stopping efforts .
The Discoverer Enterprise is currently collecting about 630,000 gallons of oil a day from the well .
The Development Drillers II and III are drilling the relief wells thought to be the only means of permanently plugging the well .
The three vessels were all under contract with BP prior to the Deepwater Horizon ’s rig explosion , says company spokesman Guy Cantrell , who adds that he does not believe the terms of those contracts have changed since .
Transocean also has around 600 employees both on and offshore who are involved in ending the spill , he says , but declined to say if BP would also be responsible for compensating those employees .
Halliburton
Halliburton was working on cementing the Deepwater Horizon ’s oil well about 20 hours prior to the accident .
Since the blowout , the company has provided services including “ intervention support to help secure the damaged well and planning and services associated with drilling relief well operations , " said President of Global Business Lines Timothy Probert in congressional testimony May 11 .
Halliburton has deployed “ survey - management experts to assist in planning the path of the relief wells , ” he said .
In addition , the company is collaborating on “ an effort to develop an integrated ranging system to expedite the intersection of the original well , ” added Mr. Probert in the testimony .
Halliburton and BP both declined to say whether Halliburton ’s work to stop the spill was under contract with BP .
Halliburton spokeswoman Teresa
Wong also declined to say how many Halliburton employees or how much of the company ’s equipment may be being used in stopping the ongoing Gulf catastrophe .
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and Mitsui Oil Exploration had 25 percent and 10 percent stakes , respectively , in the well .
Anadarko was a non-operating investor of the well with no employees working on the rig and , according to company spokesman John Christiansen , “ all questions regarding our liability will be addressed at the appropriate time . ”
The company initially released three vessels after the blowout and currently has several of its technical experts assisting with finding a way to stop the leaking well , Mr. Christiansen says .
But regarding who is paying for those resources , “ we do n’t know how it will be worked out eventually , ” he says .
He adds that though the company is not presently assisting with oil cleanup , Anadarko has offered its services to the unified command center , and “ we stand by ready to do whatever is necessary . ”
Officials at Mitsui could not immediately be reached for comment .
Cameron International
Cameron International was the manufacturer of the well ’s blowout preventer , the device designed to prevent such spills , but which failed in this case .
Company spokesman Mike Pascale said Cameron had no comment at this point regarding any potential liability , and notes that no employees of the company were working on the rig during the accident .
Cameron employees are in the Gulf assisting with their expertise to stop the oil spill , but Mr. Pascale declined to say how many employees or which company is paying them for their work .
Cameron is not assisting with cleanup efforts , he says .
Other companies
Schlumberger Ltd. was contracted by BP and had a crew onboard the Deepwater Horizon to conduct wireline services .
That crew left the rig 11 hours prior to the April 20 explosion , according to a statement released by Schlumberger last month .
Additionally , testimony given during May 11 congressional hearings named MI - SWACO as the well ’s mud engineer subcontractor , along with Weatherford International Ltd. , the casing subcontractor .
Officials at Schlumberger and MI - SWACO could not be reached for comment .
Weatherford declined comment .
Of the 126 people working on the Deepwater Horizon , 79 were Transocean employees , six were BP employees , and 41 were contract workers , including four Halliburton employees and five from MI - SWACO .

Member of the Woman 's Social and Political Union who advocated for women 's right to vote
Not to be confused with Suffragist
A suffragette was a member of an activist women 's organisations in the early 20th century who , under the banner " Votes for Women " , fought for the right to vote in public elections , known as women 's suffrage .
The term refers in particular to members of the British Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU ) , a women - only movement founded in 1903 by Emmeline Pankhurst , which engaged in direct action and civil disobedience . [ 1] [ 2 ]
In 1906 , a reporter writing in the Daily Mail coined the term suffragette for the WSPU , from suffragist , to belittle the women advocating women 's suffrage .
The militants embraced the new name , even adopting it for use as the title of the newspaper published by the WSPU .
Women had won the right to vote in several countries by the end of the 19th century ; in 1893 , New Zealand became the first self - governing country to grant the vote to all women over the age of 21 .
[3 ]
When by 1903 women in Britain had not been enfranchised , Pankhurst decided that women had to " do the work ourselves " ; [ 4 ] the WSPU motto became " deeds , not words " .
The suffragettes heckled politicians , tried to storm parliament , were attacked and sexually assaulted during battles with the police , chained themselves to railings , smashed windows , set fire to postboxes and empty buildings , set bombs in order to damage churches and property , and faced anger and ridicule in the media .
When imprisoned they went on hunger strike , to which the government responded by force - feeding them .
The first suffragette to be force fed was Evaline Hilda Burkitt .
The death of one suffragette , Emily Davison , when she ran in front of the king 's horse at the 1913 Epsom Derby , made headlines around the world .
The WSPU campaign had varying levels of support from within the suffragette movement ; breakaway groups formed , and within the WSPU itself not all members supported the direct action .
The suffragette campaign was suspended when World War I broke out in 1914 .
After the war , the Representation of the People Act 1918 gave the vote to women over the age of 30 who met certain property qualifications .
Ten years later , women gained electoral equality with men when the Representation of the People ( Equal Franchise )
Act 1928 gave all women the vote at age 21 .
Background [ edit ]
Women 's suffrage [ edit ]
Although the Isle of Man ( a British Crown dependency ) had enfranchised women who owned property to vote in parliamentary ( Tynwald ) elections in 1881 , New Zealand was the first self - governing country to grant all women the right to vote in 1893 , when women over the age of 21 were permitted to vote in all parliamentary elections .
[ 3 ]
Women in South Australia achieved the same right and became the first to obtain the right to stand for parliament in 1895 .
[ 6 ]
In the United States , white women over the age of 21 were allowed to vote in the western territories of Wyoming from 1869 and in Utah from 1870 .
British suffragettes [ edit ]
In 1865 John Stuart Mill was elected to Parliament on a platform that included votes for women , and in 1869 he published his essay in favour of equality of the sexes The Subjection of Women .
Also in 1865 , a women 's discussion group , The Kensington Society , was formed .
Following discussions on the subject of women 's suffrage , the society formed a committee to draft a petition and gather signatures , which Mill agreed to present to Parliament once they had gathered 100 signatures .
[ 7 ]
In October 1866 , amateur scientist Lydia Becker attended a meeting of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science held in Manchester and heard one of the organisors of the petition , Barbara Bodichon , read a paper entitled Reasons for the Enfranchisement of Women .
Becker was inspired to help gather signatures around Manchester and to join the newly formed Manchester committee .
Mill presented the petition to Parliament in 1866 , by which time the supporters had gathered 1499 signatures , including those of Florence Nightingale , Harriet Martineau , Josephine Butler and Mary Somerville . [ 8 ]
In March 1867 , Becker wrote an article for the Contemporary Review , in which she said :
It surely will not be denied that women have , and ought to have , opinions of their own on subjects of public interest , and on the events which arise as the world wends on its way .
But if it be granted that women may , without offence , hold political opinions , on what ground can the right be withheld of giving the same expression or effect to their opinions as that enjoyed by their male neighbours ? [ 9 ]
Two further petitions were presented to parliament in May 1867 and Mill also proposed an amendment to the 1867 Reform
Act to give women the same political rights as men , but the amendment was treated with derision and defeated by 196 votes to 73 . [ 10 ]
The Manchester Society for Women 's suffrage was formed in January 1867 , when Jacob Bright , Rev. S. A. Steinthal , Mrs. Gloyne , Max Kyllman and Elizabeth Wolstenholme met at the house of Dr. Louis Borchardt .
Lydia Becker was made Secretary of the Society in February 1867 and Dr. Richard Pankhurst was one of the earliest members of the Executive Committee . [ 11 ]
An 1874 speaking event in Manchester organised by Becker , was attended by 14 - year - old Emmeline Goulden , who was to become an ardent campaigner for women 's rights , and later married Dr Pankhurst becoming known as Emmeline Pankhurst . [ 12 ]
During the summer of 1880 , Becker visited the Isle of Man to address five public meetings on the subject of women 's suffrage to audiences mainly composed of women .
These speeches instilled in the Manx women a determination to secure the franchise , and on 31 January 1881 , women on the island who owned property in their own right were given the vote . [ 13 ]
Formation of the WSPU [ edit ]
Emmeline Pankhurst founded the WSPU in 1903 and became the most prominent of Britain 's suffragettes .
In Manchester , the Women 's Suffrage Committee had been formed in 1867 to work with the Independent Labour Party ( ILP ) to secure votes for women , but , although the local ILP were very supportive , nationally the party were more interested in securing the franchise for working - class men and refused to make women 's suffrage a priority .
In 1897 , the Manchester Women 's Suffrage committee had merged with the National Union of Women 's Suffrage Societies ( NUWSS ) but Emmeline Pankhurst , who was a member of the original Manchester committee , and her eldest daughter Christabel had become impatient with the ILP , and on 10 October 1903 , Emmeline Pankhurst held a meeting at her home in Manchester to form a breakaway group , the Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU ) .
From the outset , the WSPU was determined to move away from the staid campaign methods of NUWSS and instead take more positive action : [ 14 ]
It was on October 10 , 1903 that I invited a number of women to my house in Nelson Street , Manchester , for purposes of organisation .
We voted to call our new society the Women 's Social and Political Union , partly to emphasise its democracy , and partly to define it object as political rather than propagandist .
We resolved to limit our membership exclusively to women , to keep ourselves absolutely free from party affiliation , and to be satisfied with nothing but action on our question .
' Deeds , not words ' was to be our permanent motto .
Emmeline Pankhurst [ 15 ]
The term " suffragette " was first used in 1906 as a term of derision by the journalist Charles E. Hands in the London Daily Mail to describe activists in the movement for women 's suffrage , in particular members of the WSPU . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
But the women he intended to ridicule embraced the term , saying " suffraGETtes " ( hardening the ' g ' ) , implying not only that they wanted the vote , but that they intended to ' get ' it . [ 19 ]
WSPU campaigns [ edit ]
At a political meeting in Manchester in 1905 , Christabel Pankhurst and millworker , Annie Kenney , disrupted speeches by prominent Liberals Winston Churchill and Sir Edward Grey , asking where Churchill and Grey stood with regards to women 's political rights .
At a time when political meetings were only attended by men and speakers were expected to be given the courtesy of expounding their views without interruption , the audience were outraged , and when the women unfurled a " Votes for Women " banner they were both arrested for a technical assault on a policeman .
When Pankhurst and Kenny appeared in court they both refused to pay the fine imposed , preferring to go to prison in order to gain publicity for their cause . [ 20 ]
In July 1908 the WSPU hosted a large demonstration in Heaton Park , near Manchester with speakers on 13 separate platforms including Emmeline , Christabel and Adela Pankhurst .
According to the Manchester Guardian :
Friends of the women suffrage movement are entitled to reckon the great demonstration at Heaton Park yesterday , arranged by the Women 's Social and Political Union , as somewhat of a triumph .
With fine weather as an ally the women suffragists were able to bring together an immense body of people .
These people were not all sympathisers with the object , and much service to the cause must have been rendered by merely collecting so many people and talking over the subject with them .
The organisation , too , was creditable to the promoters ... The police were few and inconspicuous .
The speakers went by special [ tram ] car to the Bury Old Road entrance , and were escorted by a few police to several platforms .
Here the escorts waited till the speaking was over , and then accompanied their respective charges back to the special car .
There was little need , apparently , for the escort .
Even the opponents of the suffrage claim who made themselves heard were perfectly friendly towards the speakers , and the only crowding about them as they left was that of curiosity on the part of those who wished to have a good look at the missioners in the cause . [ 21 ]
Stung by the stereotypical image of the strong minded woman in masculine clothes created by newspaper cartoonists , the suffragettes resolved to present a fashionable , feminine image when appearing in public .
In 1908 the co-editor of the WSPU 's newspaper , Votes for Women , Emmeline Pethick - Lawrence , designed the suffragettes ' colour scheme of purple for loyalty and dignity , white for purity , and green for hope .
Fashionable London shops Selfridges and Liberty sold tricolour - striped ribbon for hats , rosettes , badges and belts , as well as coloured garments , underwear , handbags , shoes , slippers and toilet soap . [ 22 ]
As membership of the WSPU grew it became fashionable for women to identify with the cause by wearing the colours , often discreetly in a small piece of jewellery or by carrying a heart - shaped vesta case [ 23 ] [ 22 ] and in December 1908 the London jewellers , Mappin & Webb , issued a catalogue of suffragette jewellery in time for the Christmas season . [ 24 ]
Sylvia Pankhurst said at the time : " Many suffragists spend more money on clothes than they can comfortably afford , rather than run the risk of being considered outré , and doing harm to the cause " .
[ 22 ]
In 1909 the WSPU presented specially commissioned pieces of jewellery to leading suffragettes , Emmeline Pankhurst and Louise Eates . [ 24 ]
The suffragettes also used other methods to publicise and raise money for the cause and from 1909 , the " Pank - a - Squith " board game was sold by the WSPU .
The name was derived from Pankhurst and the surname of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith , who was largely hated by the movement .
The board game was set out in a spiral , and players were required to lead their suffragette figure from their home to parliament , past the obstacles faced from Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and the Liberal government . [ 25 ]
Also in 1909 , suffragettes Daisy Solomon and Elspeth McClelland tried an innovative method of potentially obtaining a meeting with Asquith by sending themselves by Royal Mail courier post ; however , Downing Street did not accept the parcel . [ 26 ]
Sophia Duleep Singh , the third daughter of the exiled Maharaja Duleep Singh , [ 27 ] had made a trip from her home in London to India , in 1903 , to see the celebrations for the accession of King Edward VII as emperor of India and was shocked by the brutality of life under British rule .
On her return to the UK in 1909 , Singh became an ardent supporter of the cause , selling suffragette newspapers outside her apartment at Hampton Court Palace , refusing to pay taxes , fighting with police at protests and attacking the prime minister 's car . [ 28 ] [ 29 ]
1912 was a turning point for the suffragettes , as they turned to using more militant tactics and began a window - smashing campaign .
Some members of the WSPU , including Emmeline Pethick - Lawrence and her husband Frederick , disagreed with this strategy but Christabel Pankhurst ignored their objections .
In response to this , the Government ordered the arrest of the WSPU leaders and , although Christabel Pankhurst escaped to France , the Pethick - Lawrences were arrested , tried and sentenced to nine months ' imprisonment .
On their release , the Pethick - Lawrences began to speak out publicly against the window - smashing campaign , arguing that it would lose support for the cause , and eventually they were expelled from the WSPU .
Having lost control of Votes for Women the WSPU began to publish their own newspaper under the title The Suffragette . [ 30 ]
The campaign was then escalated , with the suffragettes chaining themselves to railings , setting fire to post box contents , smashing windows and eventually detonating bombs . [ 31 ]
Some radical techniques used by the suffragettes were learned from Russian exiles from tsarism who had escaped to England . [ 32 ]
In 1914 , at least seven churches were bombed or set on fire across the United Kingdom , including Westminster Abbey , where an explosion aimed at destroying the 700 - year - old Coronation Chair , only caused minor damage . [ 33 ]
Places that wealthy people , typically men , frequented were also burnt and destroyed whilst left unattended so that there was little risk to life , including cricket pavilions , horse - racing pavilions , churches , castles and the second homes of the wealthy .
The also burnt the slogan " Votes for Women " into the grass of golf couses . [ 34 ]
Pinfold Manor in Surrey , which was being built for the Chancellor of the Exchequer , David Lloyd George , was targeted with two bombs on 19 February 1913 , only one of which exploded , causing significant damage ; in her memoirs , Sylvia Pankhurst said that Emily Davison had carried out the attack . [ 34 ]
There were 250 arson or destruction attacks in a six - month period in 1913 [ 34 ] and in April the newspapers reported " What might have been the most serious outrage yet perpetrated by the Suffragettes " :
Policemen discovered inside the railings of the Bank of England a bomb timed to explode at midnight .
It contained 3 oz of powerful explosive , some metal , and a number of hairpins - the last named constituent , no doubt to make known the source of the intended sensation .
The bomb was similar to that used in the attempt to blow up Oxted Railway Station .
It contained a watch with attachment for explosion , but was clumsily fitted .
If it had exploded when the streets were crowded a number of people would probably have been injured . [ 35 ]
There are reports in the Parliamentary Papers which include lists of the ' incendiary devices ' , explosions , artwork destruction ( including an axe attack upon a painting of The Duke of Wellington in the National Gallery ) , arson attacks , window - breaking , postbox burning and telegraph cable cutting , that took place during the most militant years , from 1910 to 1914 . [ 36 ]
Both suffragettes and police spoke of a " Reign of Terror " ; newspaper headlines referred to " Suffragette Terrorism " . [ 37 ]
One suffragette , Emily Davison , died under the King 's horse , Anmer , at The Derby on 4 June 1913 .
It is debated whether she was trying to pull down the horse , attach a suffragette scarf or banner to it , or commit suicide to become a martyr to the cause .
However , recent analysis of the film of the event suggests that she was merely trying to attach a scarf to the horse , and the suicide theory seems unlikely as she was carrying a return train ticket from Epsom and had holiday plans with her sister in the near future . [ 38 ]
Imprisonment [ edit ]
In the early 20th century until the outbreak of World War I , approximately one thousand suffragettes were imprisoned in Britain . [ 39 ]
Most early incarcerations were for public order offences and failure to pay outstanding fines .
While incarcerated , suffragettes lobbied to be considered political prisoners ; with such a designation , suffragettes would be placed in the First Division as opposed to the Second or Third Division of the prison system , and as political prisoners would be granted certain freedoms and liberties not allotted to other prison divisions , such as being allowed frequent visits and being allowed to write books or articles . [ 40 ]
Because of a lack of consistency between the different courts , suffragettes would not necessarily be placed in the First Division and could be placed in the Second or Third Division , which enjoyed fewer liberties .
This cause was taken up by the Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU ) , a large organisation in Britain , that lobbied for women 's suffrage led by militant suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst . [ 41 ]
The WSPU campaigned to get imprisoned suffragettes recognised as political prisoners .
However , this campaign was largely unsuccessful .
Citing a fear that the suffragettes becoming political prisoners would make for easy martyrdom , [ 42 ] and with thoughts from the courts and the Home Office that they were abusing the freedoms of the First Division to further the agenda of the WSPU , [ 43 ] suffragettes were placed in the Second Division , and in some cases the Third Division , in prisons , with no special privileges granted to them as a result . [ 44 ]
Hunger strikes and force - feeding [ edit ]
Suffragette being force - fed
Suffragettes were not recognised as political prisoners , and many of them staged hunger strikes while they were imprisoned .
The first woman to refuse food was Marion Wallace Dunlop , a militant suffragette who was sentenced to a month in Holloway for vandalism in July 1909 . [ 45 ]
Without consulting suffragette leaders such as Pankhurst , [ 46 ]
Dunlop refused food in protest at being denied political prisoner status .
After a 92 - hour hunger strike , and for fear of her becoming a martyr , [ 46 ] the Home Secretary Herbert Gladstone decided to release her early on medical grounds . [ 43 ]
Dunlop 's strategy was adopted by other suffragettes who were incarcerated . [ 47 ]
It became common practice for suffragettes to refuse food in protest for not being designated as political prisoners , and as a result they would be released after a few days and could return to the " fighting line " . [ 48 ]
After a public backlash regarding the prison status of suffragettes , the rules of the divisions were amended .
In March 1910 , Rule 243A was introduced by the Home Secretary Winston Churchill , allowing prisoners in the Second and Third Divisions to be allowed certain privileges of the First Division , provided they were not convicted of a serious offence , effectively ending hunger strikes for two years . [ 49 ]
Hunger strikes began again when Pankhurst was transferred from the Second Division to the First Division , inciting the other suffragettes to demonstrate regarding their prison status . [ 50 ]
Militant suffragette demonstrations subsequently became more aggressive , [ 43 ] and the British Government took action .
Unwilling to release all the suffragettes refusing food in prison , [ 47 ] in the autumn of 1909 , the authorities began to adopt more drastic measures to manage the hunger - strikers .
In September 1909 , the Home Office became unwilling to release hunger - striking suffragettes before their sentence was served . [ 48 ]
Suffragettes became a liability because , if they were to die in custody , the prison would be responsible for their death .
Prisons began the practice of force - feeding the hunger strikers through a tube , most commonly via a nostril or stomach tube or a stomach pump . [ 47 ]
Force - feeding had previously been practised in Britain but its use had been exclusively for patients in hospitals who were too unwell to eat or swallow food .
Despite the practice being deemed safe by medical practitioners for sick patients , it posed health issues for the healthy suffragettes . [ 46 ]
The process of tube - feeding was strenuous without the consent of the hunger strikers , who were typically strapped down and force - fed via stomach or nostril tube , often with a considerable amount of force . [ 51 ]
The process was painful , and after the practice was observed and studied by several physicians , it was deemed to cause both short - term damage to the circulatory system , digestive system and nervous system and long - term damage to the physical and mental health of the suffragettes . [ 52 ]
Some suffragettes who were force - fed developed pleurisy or pneumonia as a result of a misplaced tube . [ 53 ]
Women who had gone on hunger strike in prison received a Hunger Strike Medal from the WSPU on their release . [ 54 ]
Legislation [ edit ]
In April 1913 , Reginald McKenna of the Home Office passed the Prisoners ( Temporary Discharge for Ill Health ) Act 1913 , or the Cat and Mouse Act as it was commonly known .
The act made the hunger strikes legal , in that a suffragette would be temporarily released from prison when their health began to diminish , only to be readmitted when she regained her health to finish her sentence . [ 51 ]
The act enabled the British Government to be absolved of any blame resulting from death or harm due to the self - starvation of the striker and ensured that the suffragettes would be too ill and too weak to participate in demonstrative activities while not in custody . [ 47 ]
Most women continued hunger striking when they were readmitted to prison following their leave . [ 55 ]
After the Act was introduced , force - feeding on a large scale was stopped and only women convicted of more serious crimes and considered likely to repeat their offences if released were force - fed . [ 56 ]
The Bodyguard [ edit ]
In early 1913 and in response to the Cat and Mouse Act , the WSPU instituted a secret society of women known as the " Bodyguard " whose role was to physically protect Emmeline Pankhurst and other prominent suffragettes from arrest and assault .
Known members included Katherine Willoughby Marshall , Leonora Cohen and Gertrude Harding ; Edith Margaret Garrud was their jujitsu trainer .
The origin of the " Bodyguard " can be traced to a WSPU meeting at which Garrud spoke .
As suffragettes speaking in public increasingly found themselves the target of violence and attempted assaults , learning jujitsu was a way for women to defend themselves against angry hecklers . [ 57 ]
Inciting incidents included Black Friday , during which a deputation of 300 suffragettes were physically prevented by police from entering the House of Commons , sparking a near - riot and allegations of both common and sexual assault .
Members of the " Bodyguard " orchestrated the " escapes " of a number of fugitive suffragettes from police surveillance during 1913 and early 1914 .
They also participated in several violent actions against the police in defence of their leaders , notably including the " Battle of Glasgow " on 9 March 1914 , when a group of about 30 Bodyguards brawled with about 50 police constables and detectives on the stage of St Andrew 's Hall in Glasgow .
The fight was witnessed by an audience of some 4500 people . [ 58 ]
World War I [ edit ]
At the commencement of World War I , the suffragette movement in Britain moved away from suffrage activities and focused on the war effort , and as a result , hunger strikes largely stopped . [ 59 ]
In August 1914 , the British Government released all prisoners who had been incarcerated for suffrage activities on an amnesty , [ 60 ] with Pankhurst ending all militant suffrage activities soon after . [ 61 ]
The suffragettes ' focus on war work turned public opinion in favour of their eventual partial enfranchisement in 1918 . [ 62 ]
Women eagerly volunteered to take on many traditional male roles – leading to a new view of what women were capable of .
The war also caused a split in the British suffragette movement ; the mainstream , represented by Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst 's WSPU calling a ceasefire in their campaign for the duration of the war , while more radical suffragettes , represented by Sylvia Pankhurst 's Women 's Suffrage Federation continued the struggle .
The National Union of Women 's Suffrage Societies , which had always employed " constitutional " methods , continued to lobby during the war years and compromises were worked out between the NUWSS and the coalition government . [ 63 ]
On 6 February , the Representation of the People Act 1918 was passed , enfranchising all men over 21 years of age and women over the age of 30 who met minimum property qualifications , [ 64 ] [ 65 ] gaining the right to vote for about 8.4 million women . [ 65 ]
In November 1918 , the Parliament ( Qualification of Women ) Act 1918 was passed , allowing women to be elected into parliament . [ 65 ]
The Representation of the People Act 1928 extended the voting franchise to all women over the age of 21 , granting women the vote on the same terms that men had gained ten years earlier . [ 66 ]
1918 general election , women Members of Parliament [ edit ]
The 1918 general election , the first general election to be held after the Representation of the People Act 1918 , was the first in which some women ( property owners older than 30 ) could vote .
At that election , the first woman to be elected an MP was Constance Markievicz but , in line with Sinn Féin abstentionist policy , she declined to take her seat in the British House of Commons .
The first woman to do so was Nancy Astor , Viscountess Astor , following a by - election in November 1919 .
Legacy [ edit ]
Nineteen - year - old Fay Hubbard selling suffragette papers in New York , 1910
In the autumn of 1913 Emmeline Pankhurst had sailed to the US to embark on a lecture tour to publicise the message of the WSPU and to raise money for the treatment of her son , Harry , who was gravely ill .
By this time the suffragettes ' tactics of civil disorder were being used by American militants Alice Paul and Lucy Burns , both of whom had campaigned with the WSPU in London .
As in the UK , the suffrage movement in America was divided into two disparate groups , with the National American Woman Suffrage Association representing the more militant campaign and the International Women 's Suffrage Alliance taking a more cautious and pragmatic approach [ 67 ]
Although the publicity surrounding Pankhurst 's visit and the militant tactics used by her followers gave a welcome boost to the campaign , [ 68 ] the majority of women in the US preferred the more respected label of " suffragist " to the title " suffragette " adopted by the militants . [ 69 ]
Many suffragists at the time , and some historians since , have argued that the actions of the militant suffragettes damaged their cause . [ 70 ]
Opponents at the time saw evidence that women were too emotional and could not think as logically as men . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ]
Historians generally argue that the first stage of the militant suffragette movement under the Pankhursts in 1906 had a dramatic mobilizing effect on the suffrage movement .
Women were thrilled and supportive of an actual revolt in the streets .
The membership of the militant WSPU and the older NUWSS overlapped and were mutually supportive .
However , a system of publicity , Ensor argues , had to continue to escalate to maintain its high visibility in the media .
The hunger strikes and force - feeding did that , but the Pankhursts refused any advice and escalated their tactics .
They turned to systematic disruption of Liberal Party meetings as well as physical violence in terms of damaging public buildings and arson .
Searle says the methods of the suffragettes harmed the Liberal Party but failed to advance women 's suffrage .
When the Pankhursts decided to stop their militancy at the start of the war and enthusiastically support the war effort , the movement split and their leadership role ended .
Suffrage came four years later , but the feminist movement in Britain permanently abandoned the militant tactics that had made the suffragettes famous . [ 76 ] [ 77 ]
After Emmeline Pankhurst 's death in 1928 , money was raised to commission a statue , and on 6 March 1930 the statue in Victoria Tower Gardens was unveiled .
A crowd of radicals , former suffragettes and national dignitaries gathered as former Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin presented the memorial to the public .
In his address , Baldwin declared : " I say with no fear of contradiction , that whatever view posterity may take , Mrs. Pankhurst has won for herself a niche in the Temple of Fame which will last for all time " . [ 78 ]
In 1929 a portrait of Emmeline Pankhurst was added to the National Portrait Gallery 's collection .
In 1987 her former home at 62 Nelson Street , Manchester , the birthplace of the WSPU , and the adjoining Edwardian villa ( no. 60 ) were opened as the Pankhurst Centre , a women - only space and museum dedicated to the suffragette movement . [ 79 ]
Christabel Pankhurst was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1936 , and after her death in 1958 a permanent memorial was installed next to the statue of her mother . [ 80 ]
The memorial to Christabel Pankhurst consists of a low stone screen flanking her mother 's statue with a bronze medallion plaque depicting her profile at one end of the screen paired with a second plaque depicting the " prison brooch " or " badge " of the WSPU at the other end . [ 81 ]
The unveiling of this dual memorial was performed on 13 July 1959 by the Lord Chancellor , Lord Kilmuir . [ 82 ]
In 1903 , the Australian suffragist Vida Goldstein adopted the WSPU colours for her campaign for the Senate in 1910 but got them slightly wrong since she thought that they were purple , green and lavender .
Goldstein had visited England in 1911 at the behest of the WSPU .
Her speeches around the country drew huge crowds and her tour was touted as " the biggest thing that has happened in the women movement for sometime in England " . [ 83 ]
The correct colours were used for her campaign for Kooyong in 1913 and also for the flag of the Women 's Peace Army , which she established during World War I to oppose conscription .
During International Women 's Year in 1975 the BBC series about the suffragettes , Shoulder to Shoulder , was screened across Australia and Elizabeth Reid , Women 's Adviser to Prime Minister Gough Whitlam directed that the WSPU colours be used for the International Women 's Year symbol .
They were also used for a first - day cover and postage stamp released by Australia Post in March 1975 .
The colours have since been adopted by government bodies such as the National Women 's Advisory Council and organisations such as Women 's Electoral Lobby and other women 's services such as domestic violence refuges and are much in evidence each year on International Women 's day . [ 84 ]
The colours of green and heliotrope ( purple ) were commissioned into a new coat of arms for Edge Hill University in Lancashire in 2006 , symbolising the university 's early commitment to the equality of women through its beginnings as a women - only college . [ 85 ]
During the 1960s the memory of the suffragettes was kept alive in the public consciousness by portrayals in film , such as the character Mrs Winifred Banks in the 1964 Disney musical film Mary Poppins who sings the song Sister Suffragette and Maggie DuBois in the 1965 film The Great Race .
In 1974 The BBC TV series Shoulder to Shoulder portraying events in the British militant suffrage movement , concentrating on the lives of members of the Pankhurst family was shown around the world .
And in the 21st century the story of the suffragettes was brought to a new generation in the BBC television series Up the Women , the 2015 graphic novel trilogy Suffrajitsu : Mrs. Pankhurst 's Amazons and the 2015 film Suffragette .
In February 2019 , female Democrat members of the US Congress dressed predominantly in white when attending President Trump 's State of the Union address .
The choice of one of the colours associated with the suffragettes was to signify the women 's solidarity . [ 86 ]

Teacher Accuses Coworkers of Sprinkling Her With ' Holy Water ' Because She 's an Atheist The two teachers have been reassigned to other jobs in Broward County .
May 25 , 2010  --
Two Florida teachers have been put on desk duty after a fellow teacher accused them of sprinkling " holy water " on her because she 's an atheist .
Leslie Rainer and Djuna Robinson , 20 - year veterans of the Broward County School District , said a complaint from teacher Schandra Rodriguez led to their being escorted out of the Blanche Ely High School in Pompano Beach , Fla. , in front of their students .
Rodriguez claimed in the complaint that Rainer and Robinson had poured " holy water " over her in front of students who were discussing religion , according to Marsy Smith , a school district spokeswoman .
" The two teachers have been administratively reassigned pending the outcome of the investigation , " Smith said " They 've been assigned to a different function within the county but away from students . "
Smith declined to go into more detail about the incident , citing an ongoing investigation by the Broward County School Board .
But Rainer 's and Robinson 's attorney , Johnny McCray , said the allegations are puzzling because no liquid of any kind was ever poured on Rodriguez .
No criminal charges have been filed .
Messages left at Rodriguez 's Pompano Beach home were not immediately returned .
ABC News ' Miami affiliate WPLG received no answer when it knocked on her door .
" The allegation that Ms. Robinson threw holy water on anyone is absolutely false , " McCray said .
Teachers Claim ' Holy Water ' Comment Was a Joke
Rainer was standing in the classroom when the incident occurred , McCray said .
Both Rainer and Robinson are self - proclaimed Christians .
On March 11 , the classroom of students was discussing the recent earthquake in Haiti when the conversation turned to religion , McCray said .
" One of the kids made a statement that Ms. Rodriguez is an atheist and Ms. Rodriguez said , ' I do n't deny that , ' " McCray said .
" Then some of the students starting saying that , ' It looks like someone needs to sprinkle Ms. Rodriguez with some holy water . ' "
It was then , McCray said , that Robinson came to the doorway that adjoins her classroom with Rodriguez 's with a bottle of perfume .
" Ms. Robinson obtained a little bottle with some perfume in it in jest , and the students will all confirm she never went close to Miss Rodriguez , " McCray said .
" Ms. Rodriguez was on the other side of the classroom and that was basically it . "
McCray said he has interviewed several students who were present during the incident and they " deny that any holy water was sprinkled on Rodriguez . "
He also said the three teachers all sat and had lunch together later that same day , a gathering , he added , that would not have happened if Rodriguez had been as upset as she later claimed to be in a complaint to the school .
Rainer and Robinson were unavailable to comment beyond a news conference with their lawyer Monday at which Robinson told reporters , " I miss my students , I miss them a lot . "
FOR months Yukio Hatoyama 's tenure as prime minister has looked in doubt .
But his decision on June 2nd to resign and take down Ichiro Ozawa , his equally powerful sidekick , with him has shocked Japan 's political establishment .
It throws the country 's politics into disarray just when it is in the midst of a democratic upheaval and faces pressing economic problems that cry out for strong leadership .
It was not immediately clear who would replace Mr Hatoyama .
Naoto Kan , deputy prime - minister and finance minister , was considered the most likely candidate , though an internal election of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) was called on June 4th and other cabinet members may stand against him , political analysts said .
None of the potential candidates openly canvassed for the removal of Mr Hatoyama and Mr Ozawa , so it is hard to identify anyone in the party 's leadership who looks exceptionally courageous or politically astute .
It was also unclear how significant Mr Ozawa 's resignation as the DPJ 's secretary - general is .
The party is split between those who support him , and those who fear him as an unprincipled schemer who has built and destroyed parties in a lonely thirst for power .
His supporters credit him for orchestrating the DPJ 's election triumph last August that drove the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) from power for only the second time in 54 years .
He may continue to lurk in the wings of the DPJ and run the campaign for election to the upper house , which takes place this summer , not least because he controls the party 's purse strings .
His opponents , however , increasingly regarded him as a liability who meddled with cabinet - level policy decisions by whispering , Svengali - like , into Mr Hatoyama 's ear .
Embroiled in money scandals , they argued that he and Mr Hatoyama left the impression that the DPJ was no different from the discredited LDP , with its history of corruption scandals , that the voters had rejected last year .
Some senior cabinet members plotted behind the scenes against the two men .
However , when the end came it was more of Mr Hatoyama 's own doing than anyone else 's .
In his resignation speech to his party 's lawmakers , Mr Hatoyama admitted that his mishandling of a row with America over an American marine base in the island of Okinawa cost him his job , coupled with lavish political - funding scandals that have led to indictments of former members of his and of Mr Ozawa 's staff .
Though he once again denied his responsibility for the funding disaster , the two resignations would help the DPJ become “ new and cleaner , ” Mr Hatoyama said .
The immediate catalyst for his downfall was Mr Hatoyama 's decision last Friday to support a plan with America to relocate a United States marine base , called Futenma , within the island of Okinawa , rather than removing it elsewhere .
Besides breaking a personal promise to Okinawans to get rid of the base , Mr Hatoyama was also forced to sack Mizuho Fukushima , the head of one of the DPJ 's two coalition parties , from his cabinet because she opposed the Futenma plan .
This set off a damaging chain of events .
On May 30th her party , the Social Democrats , abandoned the coalition and the following day indicated it might support a censure motion in the Diet against Mr Hatoyama .
It was not clear whether his party held enough seats to block such a motion in the upper house , nor that it would enjoy the support of its own lawmakers from Okinawa .
Opinion polls taken after the Futenma decision also showed a slump in Mr Hatoyama 's support , down from 71 % nine months ago to as low as 17 % .
This lengthened the DPJ 's odds in the upper - house election .
Some of the party 's lawmakers up for re-election were told by their constituents that Mr Hatoyama 's indecisiveness over Futenma and his financial scandals might cost them their re-election , which led them to openly discuss removing him .
To make things worse for the DPJ , support for the LDP , which voters dealt a long - overdue thrashing to last year , edged ahead for the first timein the polls this week .
When Mr Ozawa began to publicly distance himself from Mr Hatoyama , it became clear that the prime minister 's days were numbered .
What was n't clear was whether Mr Ozawa would be caught in Mr Hatoyama 's downward spiral .
He was .
Mr Ozawa 's departure leaves the DPJ deeply divided .
Through a combination of carrot and stick he had managed to keep his supporters and opponents bound together .
Some of the latter have admitted to being wary of upsetting him lest he abandon the DPJ and drag his loyalists with him .
“ He 's a loose cannon and you want to tie him down , ” says Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo .
Neither Mr Hatoyama nor Mr Ozawa appeared keen to grapple with Japan 's serious fiscal problems , including a debt - to - GDP ratio that is the highest in the world and only gets worse because of entrenched deflation .
Mr Kan , the potential replacement as prime minister , discovered to his surprise when he took over as finance minister this year how vulnerable the country 's skewed public finances were .
After seeing the thrashing private investors were giving Greece , he began to talk about tax reform .
Wall Street economists believe that whoever replaces Mr Hatoyama will need to address these problems directly , and might also have to raise the consumption - tax rate .
Masaaki Kanno of JPMorgan in Tokyo says any new leader will need to tackle the fiscal problem , slow growth and deflation in short order — though he doubts Mr Kan has a sufficient sense of urgency on the matter .
If Mr Ozawa remains lurking in the DPJ 's wings , any chance such serious issues will be aired in an election season will be diminished .
Base drubbing : A deal over a marine base mends a rift between the two allies–but opens a new one within Japan
They were the happy exceptions — high school sweethearts whose passionate romance led to a famously stable marriage in a capital perpetually rocked by tawdry scandals and sleazy affairs .
But on Tuesday , less than a month after they marked their 40th wedding anniversary , former Vice President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Al Gore and his wife , Tipper , announced they were breaking up .
The couple , who have four grown children , disclosed the news in a brief e-mail to friends and supporters .
Gore , 62 , and his wife , 61 , gave no hint of whatever hidden turmoil might have caused their union to crumble .
“ We are announcing today that after a great deal of thought and discussion , we have decided to separate , ” the e-mail said .
“ This is very much a mutual and mutually supportive decision that we have made together following a process of long and careful consideration . ”
If many Americans were disappointed , longtime friends seemed stunned and saddened .
A couple that had lived much of their lives in the public eye apparently had kept their heartbreak quiet .
Donna Brazile , who ran Gore ’s failed Democratic presidential campaign in 2000 , said she was sending the couple “ lots of loving thoughts and loads of prayers .
They will get through it because these two people truly love one another . ”
A family friend in Nashville , who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter , said he was “ as surprised as everyone else . ”
“ They ’re pretty private when it comes to their personal lives , ” the friend said .
“ They just managed all these years to do that — to keep private ....
When my wife heard the news she said , ‘ I ’d have lost a lot of money on that bet . ’
But what do we know about the pressure of people under the spotlight ?
Who knows what that does to people ? ”
A close confidant who said he had spoken recently with both Gores dismissed the inevitable speculation about infidelity .
“ There ’s nothing to that , ” he said .
“ Nothing whatsoever . ”
Henry Howard , the Gores ’ next - door neighbor in upscale Arlington , Va. , said the couple led busy but often separate lives .
He said they rarely seemed to appear together at their Tudor - style home outside Washington .
“ Usually one would come at a time , ” Howard said .
“ Tipper was there more over the last couple years , and then Al would come in between trips . ”
Gore was vice president to Bill Clinton from 1992 to 2000 .
His pursed - lips propriety and seemingly rock - steady marriage stood in sharp contrast to a president whose sexual affair with a White House intern led to a national scandal and impeachment .
The couple ’s separation also came as a surprise because of the most famous kiss in modern politics .
In 2000 , when Gore accepted the Democratic nomination for president at a national convention in Los Angeles , Tipper Gore told the cheering crowd that she fell in love with her husband when they met at a high school dance in 1965 .
They married five years later .
When she finished speaking , the new nominee pulled his startled spouse into a tight embrace , and they exchanged a lip - locking , three - second smooch that dominated news cycles for days .
One Sunday TV talk show guest prudishly called it “ X - rated , ” and another declared it “ disgusting . ”
Gore , who often seemed wooden on the campaign trail , insisted he was surprised that his buss caused such a buzz .
“ Somebody said , ‘ Are you trying to send a message ? ’
I said , ‘ Actually , I was trying to send a message to Tipper , ’ ” he told CBS ’ “ The Early Show . ”
Gore ’s show of public affection gave his flagging campaign a boost in the polls , especially among women .
But the kiss was just a kiss :
Gore lost the presidency to George W. Bush after a disputed election .
Their romance also hit the headlines when Gore supposedly claimed they had inspired the 1970 book “ Love Story , ” which was made into a film .
The author , Erich Segal , later said he had partly based a character on Gore , but had not based any on his wife .
The Gores have gone public with some of their previous personal trials .
Tipper Gore struggled with clinical depression in the early 1990s after their son , Albert , was hit by a car and nearly died .
In the mid-1980s , she led a campaign to limit access to rap music and other recordings with explicit lyrics or content , drawing ire from many performers .
The effort led to the voluntary use of parental advisory stickers on selected releases .
During her husband ’s vice presidency , Tipper Gore became a fervent advocate for better treatment of those with mental health problems .
Al Gore has devoted himself since leaving public office to campaigning against global warming , which he called a “ true planetary emergency . ”
In 2007 , he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
The Gores did not say whether they planned to divorce , or whether they would divide their property .
This year , the couple spent nearly $ 8.9 million to buy an Italianate - style ocean - view villa with a swimming pool and fountains on 1.5 acres in Montecito , near Santa Barbara .
In their e-mail , the couple asked for “ respect for our privacy and that of our family , ” and said they would not comment further .
Kalee Kreider , a spokeswoman for the Gores , said they considered their Nashville home their primary residence .
She said she could not comment on whether they both intended to remain in the city .

Rev. Jesse Jackson urges early voting in SC
" We 've made remarkable progress in the last century , " Jackson said .
" We can not let it go back . "
A former apprentice has been convicted and fined over a fiery workplace prank at a Hallam factory , in eastern Melbourne , in 2008 .
Daniel Bridgborn was badly burnt when he was drenched in flammable brake cleaner and set a light while working under a truck at MTU Detriot Diesel in Hallam .
The Ringwood Magistrates ' Court heard Gladysdale man Matthew Lever , 23 , and his two workmates , Dylan Poulton and Robin Marshall , had been fooling around by setting themselves alight as well as work benches in the days leading up to the attack .
One had set " fire to his bum " the day before .
Prosecutor Susan McCarthy said it was Lever who poured the highly explosive chemical on Mr Bridgborn .
His workmate then set him alight .
Lever 's lawyer Tim Marsh told the court the burning of the worker was not a case of workplace bullying , but the result of a four - day carry on .
" There was a degree of amusement or entertainment value on the day .
It was all done for a laugh , " he said .
Mr Marsh said there was a misunderstanding between all three men about what was about to happen but agreed it was risky and dangerous behaviour .
Lever quit his job the same day and his two accomplices were fired .
Magistrate Kate Hawkins convicted and fined him $ 5,000 plus court costs .
His two co-accused were dealt the same punishment in 2008 .
The court heard the diesel company had carried out its obligations under the health and safety act in educating the workers .
Possible problems with a $ 2 - billion physics experiment could delay the space shuttle ’s final flight and further complicate White House plans to retire the orbiter fleet this year .
At issue is a van -sized device called the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer , which scientists hope will tell them more about the universe and its beginnings .
The AMS is scheduled to fly aboard Endeavour in July to be installed aboard the International Space Station , but a potential design flaw has forced NASA to consider postponing the mission .
The trouble lies with the experiment ’s magnets , which are designed to work within a few degrees of absolute zero .
The magnets will bend interstellar particles as they flow through the middle of the tube - shaped device ; scientists will be able to identify the electronic charge of the particles by how they curve .
Supporters say it ’s the best tool to find a mysterious substance called antimatter , which is believed to make up half of the universe .

The experiment will test the Big Bang theory , which says that the universe formed from equal parts of matter and antimatter .
Just about everything known in the universe -- from people to planets -- is composed of matter .
But finding antimatter has been difficult because it is destroyed whenever it comes into contact with matter .
Scientists think antimatter particles are present in space and can be observed as they flow through the AMS magnetic field .
But engineers are worried that the AMS may not work as expected when attached to the outside of the space station .
Heat from the sun and the station could warm the magnets , which could make them malfunction or shorten the experiment ’s three - year life span .

Scientists are testing the AMS to gauge the problem , and hope to have results by mid-April .
In the meantime , NASA officials are preparing to swap the planned July 29 launch of Endeavour with a September mission that was supposed to be the shuttle ’s final flight .
“ We are evaluating launch options for the STS - 134 [ Endeavour ] flight as prudent planning in case the results of the testing does not come back as expected , ” NASA spokesman John Yembrick said .
“ It is premature to speculate on whether the . . . launch date will slip .
Endeavour is still targeted to launch on July 29 , ” he added .
The project ’s lead scientist would not say how long it will take the AMS team to assess , and potentially fix , the heat problem .
But Samuel Ting , a Nobel Prize - winning physicist , remained confident that the AMS would be ready this year .
Advertisement
“ No matter what , we are going to fly this year , ” said Ting , a physics professor with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
He even expressed hope that the upcoming tests could help engineers find a way to extend the AMS experiment past its three - year life to coincide with new plans to extend station operations to 2020 .
Once the AMS is in space , he joked , “ You can no longer send a graduate student to fix it . ”
The project , at Johnson Space Center in Houston , must arrive at Kennedy Space Center in Florida by June 1 to make a July launch .

The White House has budgeted an extra $ 600 million through Dec. 31 in case shuttle flights slip into the final three months of this year .
Administration officials are uncertain what would happen if the AMS flight went into 2011 .

A couple of weeks ago , I was out on the road in Northern California , heading southeast from Sacramento on Highway 16 toward the foothills of the Sierra Nevada .
It ’s a beautiful drive , and on that blistering summer day I might have noticed the massive old oaks dotting the rolling hills or the occasional solitary weathered barn as the highway shimmered in the heat up ahead .
But I was on a mission .
I hung a right onto Highway 49 , heading toward the heart of California ’s Gold Country .
“ Historic 49 , ” as it ’s often called , meanders through scenic little Gold Rush towns with names like Drytown and Sutter Creek before continuing on toward Jackson and Angels Camp , where one Samuel Clemens originally made a name for himself under the pen name Mark Twain , writing about a jumping frog .
But I was n’t out for the scenery , or a history lesson .
I wanted pie .
Advertisement
Fresh blackberry pie , to be exact .
I stopped in Amador City and walked down the wooden plank sidewalk to Buffalo Chips Emporium , a tiny storefront diner complete with an old - fashioned soda fountain , and ordered a slice of pie from owner Ashley Putz as she worked the griddle behind the counter .
It came still warm , its sugar - dusted crust glittering in the sunlight through the front window , the light , flaky exterior quietly shattering under the fork with each bite .
Underneath , the rich berry filling oozed slightly — the thick , sweet glaze cradling tender , slightly tart berries that seemed to pop with every mouthful .
It was magical .
To my mind , nothing celebrates summer quite like fresh fruit pie .
It ’s as if we ’re taking the best the season has to offer — beautiful , vibrantly colored fruit nurtured to ripeness under a hot sun — and packaging that bounty in a tender , flaky crust .
Like a gift .
A great fruit pie is perfection , made simple .

Oh , my !
Pie recipes , “ how - to ” videos and more from the L.A. Times Test Kitchen .
Almost any summer fruit works in pie : berries , stone fruit — I ’ve even seen recipes for grape pie — so long as the fruit has had a chance to ripen .
Most fully ripened fruit has a wonderful balance of flavors already , blending sweetness with enough subtle tartness to give a wonderful depth of flavor .
The key to a great fruit pie is choosing the right fruit ; even under a double crust , quality shows .
Under - ripened fruit can be tough and often has not had a chance to develop enough sugar for good flavor ; conversely , over - ripened fruit can be too sweet and unbalanced in flavor , not to mention too soft for good pie texture .
The trick is to keep it simple .
Let the fruit speak for itself by not disguising it with a bunch of other flavors — a fruit pie is about the fruit , after all .
Keep in mind that as the fruit cooks , the flavors will evolve and soften with natural sweetness .
It ’s all a matter of taste , but I tend to go a little lighter with the sugar in my pies because of this , to keep the complexity of the fruit flavor at the forefront .
One of my favorite pies is a classic cherry pie .
Although jarred sour cherries are great , I love when I can find them fresh .
Problem is , sour cherries have such a small window of availability and might be difficult to find depending on where you live .
Advertisement
I recently tried making a pie using fresh sweet cherries , which are much easier to find .
I sweetened the cherries with less sugar , as they ’re naturally sweeter , and tossed the pitted fruit with a little Grand Marnier and vanilla to brighten the flavors and to give the cherries a little more depth .
The resulting pie is simple but rich with flavor , and I loved the slightly firmer texture from the fresh fruit .
With fruit pies it often seems that the consistency of the pie can be almost as important as the fruit itself .
As the fruit cooks , it softens , releasing its juices .
To keep these juices from turning the pie into a soup as it bakes , a thickener is added .
There are several to choose from , with the most common being flour , cornstarch and tapioca .
Although all of the thickeners set up the filling for slicing , each has its characteristics and strengths .
Advertisement
Flour tends to have weaker holding power , and more of it must be used to “ set up ” a pie filling .
But it ’s readily available , has a creamy texture and can gently soften the flavors in the filling .
When the pie sets , a flour - thickened pie filling tends to have a cloudy appearance with thicker texture .
Cornstarch , on the other hand , has much greater holding power and will give a much more transparent though not quite clear look to the filling .
Cornstarch - thickened pies tend to have softer , gel - like fillings .
Tapioca will result in a bright , clear filling , though the granules can give the filling a coarser texture .
A properly thickened pie should have a filling that is strong enough to suspend the fruit but delicate enough to give easily when sliced .
Great pie fillings wo n’t run , but they will ooze just a little , slowly and seductively .
Advertisement
It ’s best to make sure the pies bake until the filling is noticeably bubbling , ensuring that the thickener has had sufficient time to cook through and activate .
And give the pie sufficient time to cool after it bakes to give the filling time to set up .
It can be hard not to slice into a temptingly fragrant pie as soon as it comes out of the oven , but give it time ; patience is definitely a virtue here .
The type of thickener can also affect the flavor and harmony of the overall pie .
When I first tried that sweet cherry pie , I used flour .
While it worked fine to thicken the filling , I found that the flour muted the more delicate flavor of the sweet cherries ; cornstarch was a better choice , as it allowed the cherry flavor to shine and gave the filling a nice gloss .
Conversely , I find flour to be the perfect thickener for a nectarine pie .
I combine the fruit with a touch of almond extract ( almonds go so well with stone fruit ) and just enough sugar to lightly sweeten , then top it with a sweet almond crumble .
The flour gives the filling a soft , almost creamy feel and matches perfectly with the bright , almost - lemony notes of the nectarines .
Sometimes the best summer fruit pies are the ones in which the fruit is n’t cooked at all ; it ’s just piled high in a pie shell and coated with a beautiful glaze .
Advertisement
Strawberries are a perfect example .
As wonderful as they are cooked , strawberries can lose their vibrant color and end up with a mushy texture .
Fresh strawberries are enticingly bright and vibrant , full of flavor .
To emphasize that , I toss the strawberries in a glaze combining fresh orange juice and rum steeped with a little mint as it cooks .
I use cornstarch to thicken , adding enough to the glaze to give the berries a nice sheen without making them gummy .
Chill the pie for a few hours to allow the glaze to set up , then serve .
One bite and your mouth is hit with the fresh harmony of strawberry flavor complemented by bright notes of orange and rum , and a cool hint of mint .
Perfect for even a blistering hot summer day .
And if I did n’t know how easy it was to make , I might drive all day for a pie like this .

This is a guest post from Tomas Barreto , a developer who works at box .
net .
They recently adopted HTML5 drag and drop as a way to share files with other people using new features in Firefox .
The included video is a pitch for the feature and service , but shows how easy it is to do simple HTML5 - based upload progress even with multiple files .
Tomas gives an overview of the relatively simple JavaScript required to do this , and how improvements in Firefox 4 will make things even easier .
Also have a quick look at the bottom of the post for links to additional docs and resources .
At Box.net , we ’re always exploring new ways to help users get content quickly and securely onto our cloud content management platform .
So when asked , “ What feature would make you use Box more ? ” during the Box Hack Olympics in April , my colleague CJ and I decided to tackle the most intuitive way to upload files : simply dragging them from the desktop into Box .
We considered technologies ranging from Gears to Firefox plugins , but only HTML5 had sufficient adoption .
By using some of the JavaScript APIs defined in the HTML5 standard , CJ and I could create a seamless drag and drop experience for our users on supporting browsers .
Furthermore , using an HTML5 - based upload feature would allow us to enable users to select multiple files at once , and also display progress on the client without polling .
And with HTML5 adoption across the latest versions of three of the top four browsers , we felt confident about building an upload method based on this new technology without the trade - offs of using a third - party plug -in .
We rolled out the first rev of our drag and drop feature a few weeks ago , and we ’re impressed with how quickly it has been adopted .
It ’s already one of the most popular ways to get files onto Box , and in its first week it surpassed our old AJAX upload method .
You can check out our demo video to get a feel for the feature :
To build this feature , we referenced a handful of online examples that explained how to use Firefox 3 FileReader object and the drag and drop file event support .
Our first implementation used this object to load the file into memory and then took advantage of the latest XMLHttpRequest events to track progress on the client .
var files = event.originalEvent.dataTransfer.files ; // drop event var reader = new FileReader ( ) ; reader .onload = function ( event ) { var file_contents = event.target.result ; var request = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; ... // attach event listeners to monitor progress and detect errors var post_body = '' ; .. // build post body post_body += file_contents ; .. // finish post body var url = ' http://example.com/file_upload'; var request = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; request.open ( " POST " , url , true ) ; // open asynchronous post request request.setRequestHeader('content-type ' , ' multipart/form-data ; boundary= " " ' ) ; // make sure to set a boundary request.send ( post_body ) ; } reader.readAsBinaryString( files [ 0 ] ) ;
This approach worked well because we could use the same server processing code that we previously used for uploads .
The main disadvantage here is that the FileReader object reads the entire file into memory , which is not optimal for a general upload use case .
Our current HTML5 implementation uses this logic and has forced us to restrict drag and drop uploads to just 25 mb .
However , thanks to recommendations from the Mozilla team , we ’ll be taking an alternative approach for V2 of drag and drop , where the file is read chunks as needed by the request .
Here ’s how we ’re going to do it :
var files = event.originalEvent.dataTransfer.files ; // drop event var url = ' http://example.com/file_upload'; var request = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; request.open ( " POST " , url , true ) ; // open asynchronous post request request.send ( files [ 0 ] ) ;
Since this approach is not formatted as a multipart form - data , it will require some adjustments on our back - end to support receiving file uploads in this way .
However , it ’s definitely worth the trade - off since we ’ll get all the benefits of the previous method and we do n’t need special file size restrictions .
In the future , we ’ll consider using yet another way to efficiently upload files that is supported in Firefox 4 and uses the traditional multi-part form :
var files = event.originalEvent.dataTransfer.files ; // drop event var url = ' http://example.com/file_upload'; var request = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; var fd = new FormData ; fd.append ( " my File " , files [ 0 ] ) ; request.open ( " POST " , url , true ) ; // open asynchronous post request request.send ( fd ) ;
We ’re already exploring more ways to enrich the Box experience using HTML5 .
With HTML5 , we can build faster , richer and more interactive features with native browser support , and bridge the traditional gap between desktop software and web applications .
Here are just a few cool new upload - related features on our roadmap :
Pause / Resume uploads using the Blob slice API to split files into chunks ( this will be a huge robustness boost , especially for large uploads )
Allowing uploads to resume even after the browser closes by caching the file using IndexedDB support ( possibly in Firefox 4 )
We ’d also like to begin a discussion about supporting the reverse drag and drop use case : dragging files from the browser to the desktop .
Based on our users ’ enthusiasm around the drag and drop upload feature , we think the reverse functionality would well received .
If you are interested in contributing to a specification for this feature , please let us know ( html5 [ - at$ ] box.net ) !

Former Rep. Eric Massa ( D - N.Y. ) resigned amid allegations that he sexually harassed male staffers .
Abused staffers net nearly $ 1 M a year
Taxpayers have paid out nearly $ 1 million per year in settlements to congressional employees who have been harassed or otherwise treated badly by their political bosses over the past 14 years , according to records from the Office of Compliance .
The payouts stem from hundreds of complaints from employees , some of whom may have been sexually harassed or treated so poorly that third - party mediators were brought in to negotiate cash payoffs to settle the cases .
Advertisement
In fiscal year 2007 , for example , the OOC — an agency that administers a confidential dispute resolution system — settled 38 cases , with 25 resulting in monetary awards worth $ 4 million .
In fiscal year 2009 — the most recent year reported by the OOC — the office settled 13 cases for nearly $ 830,000 .
These settlements may be especially relevant if aides who were allegedly abused by former Rep. Eric Massa ( D - N.Y. ) seek restitution .
Massa resigned under allegations that he sexually harassed male staffers .
Quite often , the harassment cases , after a secretive mediation process , can land staffers retroactive raises , vacation time and cash payouts for their perceived pain and suffering .
For privacy reasons , the details of all these cases — including the names of the victims and the alleged harassers — are almost never made public .
Lawmakers , regardless of whether they are guilty of workplace violations , do not pay a dime for the settlements , while taxpayers foot the bill for the lawyers .
An unprecedented new report to be released Tuesday by the OOC sheds light on the larger problem of harassment in the congressional workplace — the OOC is often stymied by members of Congress and at times left largely powerless to inform employees about their workplace rights .
When the OOC recently tried to make contact with the Hill ’s 30,000 employees to send them a survey gauging their knowledge of workplace rights , the office was blocked from having access to congressional e-mail addresses ; only 892 surveys were returned .
Despite the efforts of a few vocal supporters of the OOC and its mission , including Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( D - Fla . ) and Sens. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) and Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) , most workers do not realize the avenues of recourse that the OOC offers in cases of sexual harassment and other workplace disputes , while many members and chiefs of staff are not fully aware of their obligations as employers .
“ Educating employing offices about their obligations is just as important as educating employees about their rights .
Employing offices who remain unaware of their legal obligations in the workplace are unknowingly opening themselves up to lawsuits , which are expensive , time - consuming , distracting and bring unwanted publicity , ” said OOC Executive Director Tamara Chrisler .
In a series of deep - background interviews done by POLITICO , aides and other Hill employees have complained about everything from unequal maternity leave policies to unwelcome advances to hostile treatment from members of Congress and other superiors .
“ I wish I had known about the Office of Compliance , ” one former aide to a Texas House member told POLITICO .
“ When the whole Massa thing came out , we heard about his staff reporting him and were shocked they could report their member .
I feel bad for so many staffers who think they ca n’t stand up for themselves . ”
Another Hill aide who is considering reporting a harassment case said : “ There are times I ’ve wanted to go over [ to the OOC ] , but the general feeling is ... you ’ll be fired or blacklisted from the Hill . ”
The Massa scandal may be a case study in the lack of awareness about the OOC and the inability of Congress to effectively police workplace harassment rules .
Massa staffers , according to their lawyers , suffered through sexual innuendo and similar behavior for months , unaware that they could seek counseling and mediation through the OOC , which was created to enforce the Congressional Accountability Act in 1995 .
While the Massa case inspired House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) to begin working to improve the OOC ’s visibility , the majority of Hill workers still have little to no knowledge of their rights — or the existence of the OOC — largely because of years of communication challenges , according to the OOC report .
Congress has exempted itself from having to inform employees about their workplace rights by posting notices in offices — a practice required by law in the public and private sectors .
Congress is also not required to keep records that would show a paper trail of lawmakers ’ past misbehavior .
“ Being a Hill employee is different from other places because the job is about your name .
Bringing a claim is like asserting you are n’t loyal enough .
Someone who is loyal would n’t bring problems like this up , ” said Alexis Rickher , an employment discrimination lawyer with Katz , Marshall & Banks who is currently helping represent one of Massa ’s accusers .
“ With the Massa mess , it ’s clear that the younger staffers did n’t have a sense of when things cross the line . ”
The OOC is expected to gain access to at least part of the House e-mail system soon and to hold a forum during new member orientation .
But no such collaboration is happening on the Senate side , according to aides close to the House ’s project .
The Senate Rules Committee , which helps oversee the OOC , did not respond to a request for information from POLITICO .
In the meantime , the process of settling workplace complaints remains secretive and byzantine , allowing members of Congress to quietly agree to cash payouts to settle cases and to keep potentially career - ending scandals under wraps .
The OOC offers employees a four - step resolution process .
It includes initial confidential counseling , followed by mediation by a neutral third - party mediator .
If the employee is dissatisfied with the mediation result , he or she can seek to have the case decided by a third - party hearing officer through the OOC or file a federal civil lawsuit .
“ You could imagine the repercussions for a congressman if an allegation becomes public , ” said employment lawyer George Chuzi , who represented Christine Niedermeier , a former aide who accused Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) of sexually harassing her several years ago .
“ It ’s worth it to pay them , especially if it ’s not their money , just to have the thing kept confidential .
It ’s worth it to them just to keep inappropriate allegations out of the public airwaves . ”
The head of the federal response to the gulf oil spill announced Tuesday night that the government and BP would delay a crucial test to determine whether it was safe to use a newly applied sealing cap to finally shut down the runaway well .
It is hoped that the test will determine whether there are any serious leaks plaguing the 13,000 - foot hole in the earth -- apart , of course , from the notorious leak at the top .
The test was originally scheduled to take place Tuesday evening .
Now it appears that it will not take place until late Wednesday at the earliest .
In a statement on the government ’s spill response website , former Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen said the timetable changed after a discussion he had with Energy Secretary Steven Chu , BP officials , geologists and other experts .
Advertisement
“ As a result of these discussions , we decided that the process may benefit from additional analysis that will be performed tonight and tomorrow , ” Allen said in a statement .
A representative from the spill response ’s information center could not elaborate on the reasons for the delay , and BP and Department of Homeland Security officials did not respond to calls late Tuesday .
Allen ’s four - sentence statement specifically mentioned that the group of experts had reviewed a seismic mapping run that was made around the well site Tuesday morning .
Allen is scheduled to make a statement Wednesday afternoon .
The new cap , which was affixed to the well Monday , holds out hope for an end to a disaster that has stretched nearly three months , but success is far from certain .
Much depends on the upcoming test , which will give experts an idea about how stable the well is below the sea floor .

If it is determined that there are likely leaks in the underground pipe , closing off the well with a cap could exacerbate them .
That could eventually send oil seeping up through other parts of the sea floor , making a solution exponentially more difficult .
In that case , to prevent that possibility , BP and government officials would let the oil continue to flow out from the top of the well , where some of it would be collected using riser pipes and containment ships .
The company promises that new ships and new technology will allow it to collect all of the flowing oil -- estimated at up to 60,000 barrels a day -- by late July .
But if tests show the well to be stable for 48 hours , BP may use the 150,000 - pound cap to block all of the flowing oil for the first time since the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig on April 20 .
To conduct the test , the company will slowly shut off the valves that allow oil to flow from the new cap .
The well will be sealed , and if test results are good , the seal will remain .

At a news conference in Houston early Tuesday , Allen said he was “ very confident ” that crews could use the cap to stop the oil flow , but only long enough to perform the test .
“ What we ca n’t tell is the current condition of the well bore below the sea floor , ” he said .
As a result , Allen was reluctant to guess at the chances of success .
Allowing the ships to take up the oil is only a partial fix , since the vessels would have to disconnect in the event of a hurricane .
Government and BP officials have long maintained that the only permanent solution will come when the gushing well is intercepted by one of two relief wells now under construction .
The nearest relief well could have the troubled well plugged up with drilling mud and cement by mid-August , BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said .

Sharon Gauthe , a community organizer from Thibodeaux , La. , has been following updates on the repair on TV .
“ I just pray it ’s going to work , ” she said .
In New Orleans on Tuesday , it was the human cost of the spill , and the policies it has spawned , that dominated the second day of hearings by a new commission directed by President Obama to study the rig blowout and its effects .
Much of the conversation focused on the Obama administration ’s unveiling Monday of a revamped moratorium on deep - water drilling .
Last month , a federal judge ruled that the administration likely acted “ arbitrarily and capriciously ” when it issued its original moratorium a few weeks after the rig blowout so that safety rules could be reassessed .
Administration officials hope the new moratorium , which they say is more narrowly drawn than the original , will pass muster with the courts .

It had not won approval , however , with many Louisianans , who fear that a moratorium would cost the state thousands of jobs .
In a presentation to the commission , Charlotte Randolph , president of coastal Lafourche Parish , said the spill had devastated the local fishing industry and that the moratorium was “ adding insult to injury . ”
Randolph , one of several speakers who opposed the moratorium , estimated that 45 % of the parish ’s tax base could be affected by the ban , which could last through Nov. 30 .
Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc. , one of the companies that challenged the administration ’s earlier deep - water drilling moratorium , said in a statement Tuesday that it was reviewing the revised moratorium and had “ substantial concerns about its consistency ” with the federal judge ’s ruling last month .

Meanwhile , the bills continued piling up for BP .
The White House announced Tuesday that it had sent another bill to the oil company and other “ responsible parties ” on the hook for the government response .
This time the tab came to about $ 100 million , bringing the total billings to $ 222 million so far .
BP has paid the first three bills , totaling $ 122.3 million , in full , the White House said .

Times staff writer Richard Simon in Washington contributed to this report .
WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama says it ’s time to roll back “ billions of dollars in tax breaks ” for oil companies and use the money for clean energy research and development .
Obama made the comments Wednesday in prepared remarks for a speech at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh .
He said the catastrophic Gulf oil spill shows the country must move toward clean energy by embracing energy efficiency , tapping natural gas and nuclear power and eliminating tax breaks for big oil .

Obama said that the Gulf spill “ may prove to be a result of human error – or corporations taking dangerous shortcuts that compromised safety ” – but that deepwater drilling is inherently risky and America cannot rely solely on fossil fuels .
He also vowed to make a new bid to push energy legislation through Congress , saying the US oil “ catastrophe ” showed America could no longer be hostage to fossil fuels .
Obama signaled a political effort to pivot from the disastrous impact of the Deepwater Horizon disaster to future climate change and energy policy , in an advance copy of remarks he was due to deliver in Pittsburgh later in the day .
“ The only way the transition to clean energy will succeed is if the private sector is fully invested in this future — if capital comes off the sidelines and the ingenuity of our entrepreneurs is unleashed , ” he said .
“ The only way to do that is by finally putting a price on carbon pollution , ” Obama said , noting that the House of Representatives had already passed a climate change bill , which had become stalled in the Senate .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The votes may not be there right now , but I intend to find them in the coming months , ” said Obama , who is increasingly under political siege over his handling of the BP oil spill .
“ I will make the case for a clean energy future wherever I can , and I will work with anyone from either party to get this done .
“ We will get this done .
The next generation will not be held hostage to energy sources from the last century . ”

Prospects for the energy bill in the Senate remain uncertain , following the collapse of a bipartisan effort to pilot it through the chamber in the run-up to crucial mid-term elections in November .
Some experts question whether the year - long battle to enact health care reform drained the kind of political capital Obama will need to get the bill through the Senate in a highly polarized political environment .

For several years now , the trend among geeks has been to abandon the RSS format .
RSS , or Really Simple Syndication , is a way to queue up and serve content from the internet .
Source : The Case for RSS — MacSparky
Geeks might not like RSS , but it ’s an essential tool if you monitor news or need to stay up to date with developments in a subject area .
An RSS feed is a way of listing online material .
There ’s a feed for this site if you ’re interested .
It sends out a short headline and an extract for each new post .
That way you can stay up to date with everything published here without needing to constantly revisit the site to check for updates .
Separate feeds
Some big sites break up their news rivers into separate feeds .
At the New York Times or The Guardian you can choose to read the technology news feed .
At ZDNet you can pick subject feeds or selected a feed for an individual journalist .
Sometimes you can also roll your own niche feeds from big sites by using a search term to get a list of all stories including a certain key word .
The beauty of RSS is that it is comprehensive .
It misses nothing .
If you go offline for a week you can pick up where you left off and catch up immediately .
RSS is comprehensive
The alternatives are social media sites like Twitter or Facebook .
They are nothing like as comprehensive or as easy to manage .
Tweets go flying past in a blur on Twitter .
All the main social media sites manage your feed .
They decide what you see .
This means you can miss important posts as they get pushed out of sight .
That does n’t happen with RSS .
In his story David Sparks says you need to be on Twitter all the time to catch news .
Make that : you need to be on Twitter all the time AND staying more alert than most people can manage .
Universal feed
The other great thing about RSS is the format is so universal .

Last year at E3 2009 , I saw a Wii bowling ball accessory at the CTA booth .
I thought to myself , “ Come on .
Who would really buy that crap ? ”
Now at E3 2010 , it feels like CTA is just making dumb accessories for people dumb enough to by them .
Introducing their latest featured accessory invention that no one ever needs .
The inflatable go - kart !
Go past the break for more photos of what you do n’t need .
Update : I misspelled “ by ” for “ buy . ”
Thanks for pointing that out .
Note to self .
Do n’t post while still drunk from an E3 party .
Seriously .
Who buys this junk ?
Is this really necessary ?
CTA needs to stop creating useless pieces of plastic .
Just sayin’ .
Via Ralph Luker , here ’s an animated recapitulation of the world ’s nuclear tests since 1945 .
Even with every month reduced to a second , it takes several minutes to gain momentum ; from the end of the 1950s through the end of the 1980s , however , the whole thing becomes rather bewildering and about as depressing as tiny beeps and flickers of light can be .
A few random observations :
Image caption Still from the leaked US military video from July 2007
A US military analyst , Bradley Manning , has been arrested on suspicion of leaking classified combat video and documents to a whistle - blower website .
Specialist Manning , 22 , was detained during a tour of duty in Iraq , and is being held in Kuwait pending further investigations .
The WikiLeaks website posted a video which it says shows the US military shooting civilians in Baghdad in 2007 .
It has not confirmed Spc Manning as its source for the helicopter footage .
News of his arrest first broke on the Wired.com website .
A former hacker said he had turned the analyst in out of concern for US national security .
' Boasting ' about leaks
In a statement , the US army in Iraq said Spc Manning was " placed in pre-trial confinement for allegedly releasing classified information " .
WikiLeaks ' organisers said they were given the footage , which they said came from cameras on US Apache helicopters .
They said they decrypted it , but would not reveal who gave it to them .
The WikiLeaks site campaigns for freedom of information and posts leaked documents online .
A lot of people have labelled me a snitch Adrian Lamo , Former hacker Hacker reports ' Wikileaks source '
The ex-hacker , Adrian Lamo , said Spc Manning " boasted " to him about passing the helicopter video to WikiLeaks .
Mr Lamo said Spc Manning claimed to have leaked video footage showing an air strike in Afghanistan in July 2009 .
The local authorities said nearly 100 people were killed in the attack at Garani
Spc Manning also said he had passed on 260,000 classified US diplomatic cables .
However , WikiLeaks has said it was not sent the diplomatic cables .
" A lot of people have labelled me a snitch , " Mr Lamo told BBC News .
" I guess I deserve that on this one but not as a generality . "
Child casualties
The video from Iraq shows a US helicopter strike in July 2007 in which about 12 people died .
On the transmission , US soldiers on the ground can be heard establishing that there are two child casualties and agreeing to take them to hospital .
The Pentagon has not disputed the authenticity of the video but has been working to trace the source .
At the time , the US military said the helicopters were engaged in combat operations against a hostile force .
The NAACP on Tuesday posted newly released video in an effort to support a USDA official who was forced to resign a day earlier , after a previously published video showed her telling a story about not giving her " full force " support to help a white farmer .
The NAACP also called for the U.S. Agriculture Department to reinstate Shirley Sherrod , who on Tuesday said the Obama administration refused to listen to her side of the story before forcing her out on Monday evening , over a video excerpt that she insists was taken out of context .
In the earlier version of the video Sherrod , then Georgia director of rural development , is seen telling a story about assistance she provided to a white farmer 24 years ago .
The video released by the NAACP Tuesday shows Sherrod explaining she initially did n't help the farmer with " full force , " but realized she was wrong and went on to help him save his farm .
Sherrod , who is black and was working at the time for a nonprofit group , said she learned that the plight of poverty goes beyond race .
" When I made that commitment I was making that commitment to black people and to black people only , " she said in the video released Tuesday .
" But you know , God will show you things .
...
You realize that the struggle is really about poor people . "
The video excerpt that aired Monday focused on Sherrod 's admission that she was reluctant to help the white farmer in part because so many black farmers were suffering .
The Monday excerpt excluded the end of Sherrod 's story , seen Tuesday , in which she talks of helping save the white farmer 's property from foreclosure .
" Working with him made me see that it 's really about those who have versus those who do n't , " she said later in the video .
" And they could be black , they could be white , they could be Hispanic -- it made me realize that I needed to help poor people . "
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced Monday evening that Sherrod had resigned based on the release of the shorter video , saying the department has " zero tolerance for discrimination . "
But the NAACP , after earlier condemning Sherrod , reversed its position Tuesday and called on Vilsack to " reconsider . "
NAACP CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous originally released a statement calling Sherrod 's comments " shameful " and saying the group was " appalled by her actions . "
But the NAACP later said Tuesday it would conduct an " investigation " and review the full tape , which was shot for the NAACP by DCTV .
Late Tuesday , Jealous effectively retracted his earlier statement and blamed the media for the confusion .
" With regard to the initial media coverage of the resignation of USDA official Shirley Sherrod , we have come to the conclusion we were snookered by Fox News and Tea Party activist Andrew Breitbart into believing she had harmed white farmers because of racial bias , " he said .
" Having reviewed the full tape , spoken to Ms. Sherrod , and most importantly heard the testimony of the white farmers mentioned in this story , we now believe the organization that edited the documents did so with the intention of deceiving millions of Americans . "
FoxNews.com was among several media organizations that carried the story of the initial video released Monday .
It remains unclear who edited and released the shorter video .
Breitbart , who initially reported the story on Monday , said in an interview Tuesday with Fox News ' Sean Hannity , that he received the video from " an individual in Georgia . "
He said he decided to post it on his website as an example of hypocrisy at the NAACP , which recently condemned racism within the conservative Tea Party movement .
Sherrod , in a TV interview Tuesday morning , said she lost her job because the Obama administration overreacted to the original story .
" They were not interested in hearing the truth .
No one wanted to hear the truth , " she said .
Vilsack said Wednesday he will reconsider the department 's decision to oust Sherrod .
" I am of course willing and will conduct a thorough review and consider additional facts to ensure to the American people we are providing services in a fair and equitable manner , " Vilsack said .
A White House official who asked not to be named told Fox News on Tuesday that President Obama was briefed on the circumstances behind Vilsack 's decision to fire Sherrod after the fact and fully supported the decision .
As for the white farmer Sherrod helped , his wife told FoxNews.com on Tuesday that there was no discrimination .
She said the administration should not have forced out Sherrod .
" She 'll always be my friend , " Eloise Spooner said .
She said the incident Sherrod was referring to happened more than two decades ago and that she and her husband Roger worked together closely to keep the farm out of foreclosure .
" I do n't think they gave her a chance to tell really what happened , " Spooner said .
" I do n't think they 'll find anybody that can fill the job any better than she did .
That 's my opinion . "
At the end of a segment on a " the G - shot " , ABC 26 anchor Michael Hill asked reporter Catherine Shreves a question that made it quite apparent he has no idea how banter works .
Video after the jump .
Everything about this video is delightful .
The way his fellow anchor 's face drops upon hearing the question .
The nervous paper shuffling and voice lilting by the reporter while trying to respond without bursting into laughter .
The irony of talking about phones that are going to be ringing a lot .
You name it .

Oaksterdam University , where stoners go to get schooled on the art of growing ganja , is n’t exactly a bastion of blue - collar idealism .
Or it was n’t until this week , when the staff and faculty at Oaksterdam ’s Oakland campus joined the Oakland United Food and Commercial Workers Local 5 .
What would have seemed like a strange union in the halcyon days of organized labor now seems to make a modicum of sense , and not just to potheads :
If anyone can muscle California politicians into supporting marijuana legalization , it ’s the UFCW .
In November , Californians will vote on a ballot initiative to “ control and tax cannabis . ”
If the initiative passes , California residents ages 21 and up will be allowed to use marijuana recreationally .
Pollsters have
reported a dead heat among the bill ’s supporters and opponents , and bong - rippers are so excited they can hardly see straight .
But there are still six months to November , which is plenty of time for the scale to tip in favor of prolonging prohibition .
Enter the UFCW and all that comes with union membership :
An army of picketers and flier distributors , influence in the California legislature , and deep , green campaign coffers .
“ This partnership legitimizes the cannabis industry , ” said Dale Sky Clare , a charming redhead who serves as Oaksterdam ’s Chancellor when she ’s not teaching Medical Marijuana 101 .
“ Until now , we ’ve always been a movement . ”
And movements are not so good at pressing flesh with legislative suits .
Or convincing skeptical voters that there ’s no harm in legalizing Hindu Kush and Strawberry Cough .
But Clare believes the UFCW officials when they say they can help the marijuana movement do both those things .
“ They ’re offering protection , ” Clare said in a recent interview .
“ When we walk into a city council meeting with a local union who they ’ve trusted for years to regulate local industries , it ’s like comfort food to them .
They trust unions .
The fear of back alley deals dissipates . ”
At first , the folks at Oaksterdam did n’t want a union .
The employees were happy with their pay , their hours , and the way the school is managed .
They ’re so used to feeling marginalized by mainstream
institutions , that they “ were worried about how the unions might interfere with what has been a really healthy relationship , ” Clare said .
“ It took some convincing and educating of our employees to get them to accept the union . ”
Nothing much will change at Oaksterdam now that it ’s unionized , she added .
Sure , vacation days , dispensed amicably and generously in the past , will be set in stone .
But otherwise , the university already has enviable employee - friendly policies in place .
Still , Clare sees the deal as a win-win .
Oakland ’s UFCW Local 5 will “ educate its members ” about the advantages of controlling and taxing marijuana , and encourage them to spread the gospel of letting adults do what they will in private .
Not because the union endorses marijuana use , says Local 5 organizer Dan Rush , but because weed and hemp , like cigarettes and alcohol in UFCW supermarkets , mean jobs .
Union jobs .
If anything , it ’s the UCFW that has the most to gain .
Private sector union membership in 2009 was roughly half of what it was 30 years ago .
Barring federal interference , passage of California ’s marijuana ballot initiative would lead to the creation of tens of thousands of weed - related jobs : sales staff , pot sommeliers , personal buyers , growers , shippers , packagers , renovation gigs for remodeling retail space .
By getting in on the ground floor , the UFCW has a chance to dominate in an industry where employees and employers alike are –as of this moment anyway– far less skeptical of organized labor than the long - unionized supermarket industry .
Enter Rush , a lifelong resident of Oakland and a veteran UFCW organizer .
“ I was watching the revitalization of the community thanks to Oaksterdam and the other ancillary medical marijuana groups , ” he said in an interview .
“ I took a couple of days off and studied all of
the initiatives , which is what I do for my union .
In doing that , I stumbled across the tax , control , and regulate initiative .
And I thought ,
This is going to create a gazillion jobs if it gets passed . ”
Kaching !
Rush went to Oaksterdam and started on knocking on doors .
“ What I heard from many of the workers was that they had great jobs , they loved Oaksterdam , they loved their employer , but the problem that they
had was that they did n’t get a lot of dignity or respect in the community .
So I said to Oaksterdam ’s people , Why do n’t we band together and go get the justice and dignity that you guys deserve ? ”
Luckily for Oaksterdam , money can buy something resembling respect–a captive political audience .
But the UFCW has taken a slightly different approach in selling the ballot measure .
“ This is a recreational use initiative , but we refer to it as a jobs creator , ” Rush said .
“ We do n’t care if people smoke pot , we do n’t care if they do n’t smoke pot .
Our members work in those stores and sell alcohol and tobacco .
We do n’t advocate drinking or smoking , but our people have good stable union jobs because those products are taxed and regulated . ”
Something else that only the UFCW can do is win attention and support from national political figures who otherwise would keep the marijuana measure at arm ’s length .
Sen. Barbara Boxer , a recipient of tens of thousands of UFCW dollars , has come out against the measure to legalize marijuana .
Will she change her tune now that one of her largest financial supporters is representing the pot industry ?
Will the UFCW maker Boxer change her tune ?
Local 5 President Ron Lind wo n’t make any promises , as the California UFCW and the California Labor Federation have yet to officially endorse the marijuana ballot measure , but he ’s capable of reading –and speaking –between the lines .
“ We hope that elected officials who are supported by labor are going to take a different look at this issue now that it ’s about labor , ” he said on Wednesday .
While the UFCW has only gained 100 medical marijuana employees–some from Oaksterdam , more still from a handful of Oakland dispensaries –it hopes to corner the market if Control and Tax passes .
“ One day down the road , when the big corporations try and move into this industry , we as the pioneers of this industry intend for this industry to be union , ” Rush said .
Clare , on the other hand , could n’t care less if other marijuana groups unionize .
“ Some will and some wo n’t , ” she said .
“ And that ’s fine . ”
But in the absence of other institutional allies , “ the unions are still going to be working for this industry as a whole . ”

THE AVANT - GARDE OF TERROR
Joanne Richardson
All economy ultimately reduces itself to the economy of time , Marx said somewhere .
And vice versa , time is economy , measurement and circulation for profit .
The clock did not always exist .
It was invented for the organization of life under the rules of exchange .
Trade and the exchange of commodities necessitated movement through space , and the calculation of the time taken up by movement from a point to its destination led to the practice of attaching the money - form to chronological time .
Time = Money .
Banal truisms always hide something precisely because they appear self - evident .
In 2001 in Zagreb , during an exhibition made on the occasion of the 153rd anniversary of the Communist Manifesto , Darko Fritz , displayed Time = Money =
Time on the electronic board of a tram .
The tram 's normal destination was from HDLU ( the Croatian Visual Artists House ) to the main square .
But the tram did not follow its linear path to the square , it just circled HDLU .
Unsuspecting passengers got on the tram and found out it was free , but they did n't reach their destination .
The tram moved through space but without a goal and , in a sense , without time .
This was one of several recent artistic projects in Eastern Europe that identify not with territory but with the act of movement itself .
And this is also the distance that separates them from the historical project of the avant - gardes .
It 's often said that Dada , as a movement , was born in Zurich on February 5 , 1916 .
But this is wrong .
February 5 , 1916 was the opening night of Hugo Ball 's and Emmy Hennings ' Cabaret Voltaire , and they had invited artists who lived in Zurich , " whatever their orientation " to make presentations and contributions of all kinds .
There was no Dada group , no unison under a common ideological programme , but just an eclectic gathering of people linked only by their opposition to the war .
Ball , dressed as an obelisk , read abstract phonetic poems , others performed gestural dances wearing Janco 's grotesque masks , and recited simultaneous poetry .
The performances were ephemeral , consuming themselves in their act of production .
Tzara 's manifesto of 1918 captures the early mood of Dada : " To put out a manifesto you must want : ABC , to fulminate against 1,2,3 , to fly into a rage and sharpen your wings to conquer and disseminate little abcs and big abcs , to sign , shout , swear , to organize prose into a form of absolute and irrefutable evidence ... I write a manifesto and I want nothing . "
The first Dada manifesto questioned the logic and the desire behind making manifestoes .
It answered politics , but not from the inside in the language of a dialectical critique .
Dialectics does not negate in an absolute , explosive flash , but piecemeal , by rejecting only what is irrational , dogmatic , or contradictory in the system , so as to strengthen its rational core , to enable it to grow and return a profit .
Tzara once said , dialectics kills - it consumes the desire of life as it beats its wings against the limits of the impossible .
Dialectics temporalizes space and spatializes time .
Different geographical territories are identified with stages of history , invested with the march of historical progress .
Hence Hegel can interpret the geographical territory of the Prussian State as the fulfillment of the temporal logic of the becoming in - and - for - itself of self - consciousness .
And time itself is spatialized , represented as a culmination of moments , never a simple present , always dependent on what comes before , and determined by what will follow .
Time is subjected to a calculation of profit , it becomes a restricted economy in Bataille 's sense .
Time projects itself into a future that recuperates the losses of vanishing , ephemeral moments , and becoming is endured because it is always on the way to Being .
Dada is time without space and space without time .
Zurich became significant as the territory of the birth of Dada only because it was a non-territory or a kind of non-place .
Those who gathered there were emigres of their own countries , having fled in protest of the national politics that led to the outbreak of the war .
So from the beginning , Dada never identified itself with any territory and mocked ideological discourse - especially the manifesto - form as the most fanatical expression of the logic of territoriality .
It is through the laws and proclamations of their manifestoes that the avant - gardes instituted themselves as micro-nations , as states in miniature .
If Dada began by not defining itself , if its members tried to define it years later but could never quite get it right , Surrealism launched itself in 1924 in the form of a dictionary definition : " Surrealism , noun .
Psychic automatism in its pure state , by which one proposes to express … the actual functioning of thought …
Surrealism tends to ruin once and for all other psychic mechanisms and to substitute itself for them in solving all the principal problems of life . "
Surrealism defined itself through its purity of vision , a vision that was total and sought to institute itself over the whole of the fallen world .
From the moment of Breton 's break with Tzara , Surrealism adopts a juridical tone .
The break came in 1921 during the mock - trial of Maurice Barres for " crimes against the security of the human spirit . "
Barres had once been an admirer of Nietzsche and Stendhal but had become a nationalist and a leader of the reactionary League of the French Nation .
The trial started as a typical Dada farce , Barres was played by a wooden mannequin seated in the defendant 's chair .
Breton played the judge , Ribemont - Dessaignes , the prosecutor , Aragon and Soupault , counsel for the defense , and Tzara and the others were witnesses .
When Tzara protested to the grave overtones of what was supposed to be a mock trial , Breton was outraged that he was making light of the seriousness of Barres 's crimes .
With this first open clash of two incompatible worlds , Surrealism 's trial and excommunication of Dada had effectively began , even if Surrealism as a movement still lacked a name .
After the mock trial , real trials followed .
In 1925 , after reading Trotsky 's biography of Lenin , Breton saw the light and decided that the political line which Surrealism had been searching for could only be found in the doctrine of the Bolshevik Revolution .
He published a confession in L'Humanite , " Only a semantic confusion has allowed the persistent misunderstanding that there was a Surrealist doctrine of Revolution ...
There was never a Surrealist theory of Revolution .
We want the Revolution ; however , we want revolutionary means .
Of what do these means consist ?
Only of the Communist International and for France , of the French Communist Party . "
Unwillingness on the part of Vitrac , Soupault , and Artaud to follow Surrealism into this new direction led to their expulsion from the group .
Breton held a meeting in November 1926 at the cafe Le Phophete to explain the criteria for expulsion , " Consideration of individual positions : are all these positions defensible from a revolutionary viewpoint ? ...
To what degree are they tolerable ? "
In 1929 he sent a letter asking members of the Surrealist movement for an account of their present ideological position .
Many refused to reply and were excluded by omission .
Those who did reply were " invited " to a meeting on March 11 at the Bar du Chateau .
Each man was singled out and put on trial for their moral qualifications .
7 more Surrealists ( Baron , Duhamel , Fegy , Prevert , Man Ray , Tanguy , and Vidal ) were judged unfit and excluded " by reason of their occupations and character . "
Ribemont - Dessaignes , disgusted with the juridical tone of the meeting , made a loud exit .
He later wrote to Breton : " I consider that the self - appointed task of purification that you devote yourself to is absolutely counterrevolutionary .
It condemns you to impotence which is the mark of the Surrealist movement ...
You are the bureaucrats of purity and judgment . "
Hugo Ball called Dada a " flight out of time " - not only out of its own historical time , but also out of time that measures itself dialectically , as projection .
As production of ephemeral performances , events without goals , Dada existed without projecting itself forward ; the present moment became self - sufficient , acquiring the sense of an infinite duration .
It 's Dada 's existence without projection that became intolerable to Breton , who wanted the movement to become serious , to set goals , to become a project , to ally itself with the historical destiny of the proletariat .
Surrealism is a re-dialecticization of Dada ; Breton , exhibiting a mad passion for Hegelian language , labels Dada the mere negative moment , which must be negated and surpassed by becoming positive and abolishing the ephemerality of individual moments of intensity for the sake of a future promise .
The double negation of Surrealism is a reintroduction into the world of serious politics and high literature .
And a re-identification with territory , with a particular French political exigency dating back to the Jacobin revolutionary tradition , characterized by proclaiming negations and abolitions , affirming goals in advance , denouncing enemies and ideas that exceed the limits of the system - characterized , consequently , by a need for trials and excommunications .
History repeats itself , the second time not as farce , but as tragedy .
In 1947 , another Romanian Jew arrived in Paris , having changed his name from Jean - Isidore Goldstein to Isidore Isou , as an evident allusion to Tristan Tzara 's ( Samuel Rosenstock 's ) reinvention of his name .
Isou 's first act in Paris was interrupting a lecture on Dada by Michel Leris ( with Tzara seated in the audience ) to announce that " Dada is dead : Lettrism has taken its place . "
Lettrism , as a collection of a youth underclass , many of whom were unemployed , homeless or destitute , was also marked by a sense of alienation , of not belonging to a territory or identifying with a national ideology .
Having rejected the proletariat as a passive , integrated class which had possessions and families to worry about and thereby lacking the ability to compromise itself , Isou saw the revolutionary potential as belonging to youth , to anyone " who does not yet coincide with his function . "
The character of youth , as Isou saw it , was its gratuitousness - it was outside the economy of profit , the dead time of the market , the moral imperative of work , and the dialectical necessity of the project .
Guy Debord and the others who split from Isou and seceded to form the Lettrist International , enacted this gratuitousness in their daily existence by drifting through the streets of Paris in search for a passionate solicitation by the architecture , wearing painted clothing , and leaving traces in the form of graffiti on walls : " Never Work , " " Free the passions , " " Live without dead time . "
Having rejected economic prohibitions as obsolete , the LI dwelled somewhere on the margins of the economy through theft and other so - called " crimes . "
Lettrist films imposed a ban against images and refused representation , evacuating cinematic space .
The LI spoke of their urban drifts and street actions as " ephemeral , without a future , passageways … "
The LI stammered in a new language of the intensity of moments ( the revolution actualized in a single deed ) , in which every desire became poetry .
They created gestures and actions that were outside a dialectical economy of profit , separated from the banality of informational discourse , refusing the permanence of works .
But they remained trapped in old structures and old forms of organization , invoking the Hegelian dialectic and Saint Just as the ghost of Jacobin terror .
Gradually the group transformed itself from a marginal youth subculture to the Situationist International , self - proclaimed prophets of a new revolution who measured their value against all the previous names of history .
They abandoned the primitive looking two page mimeographed Potlatch for the sophisticated and slick SI journal .
Potlatch had contained strange , cryptic fragments , short poems , bursts of illumination .
The SI issued long theoretical essays , definitions , and manifestoes that proclaimed theirs was the only coherent critique and true revolutionary practice .
Since they alone possessed the correct theory , the SI expelled ideological deviations , and during its lifetime excluded 45 of its 70 members .
Why such an uncanny repetition , considering the different histories of Surrealism and the SI ?
Surrealism had copied an external model - the bureaucratic organization of the French Communist Party .
But the SI not only repudiated the PCF and the small Trotskyist , Maoist and Guevarist groupuscules , but the question of how to avoid bureaucratic organization was at the center of its theory and programs .
The unsigned " Instructions for Taking up Arms " claimed that the most important problem for a revolutionary project is " establishing new types of human relationships within the organization itself " which demand " participation on the part of everyone . "
In " To Have as a Goal Practical Truth , " Vaneigem wrote that the SI " refuses to reproduce within itself any of the hierarchical conditions of the dominant world .
The only limit to participating in its total democracy is that each member must have recognized and appropriated the coherence of its critique . "
What Vaneigem describes as the non-hierarchical organization of the SI is similar to a band of equals or a society of brothers bound by the pact of the founding doctrine .
Inside the band there is no hierarchy , everyone is equal , experiments are collective , actions and texts are produced together , often unsigned .
Some people in the group may have more power because they do more work and take more responsibility but the momentary uneven distribution of power is inevitable and is not a matter of power being usurped .
It 's unfair to accuse the band of equals of reproducing a mode of social organization based on hierarchy and bureaucracy .
Bureaucracy is characterized by representation and substitution .
As Trotsky said in the context of Bolshevism , the party substitutes itself for the people , claiming to be their representative .
Certain members of the party substitute themselves for the whole , and eventually one leader substitutes himself for the totality .
Power is continually displaced and the field of action is removed from the majority , inevitably creating a culture of alienation .
The band of equals is an expressive form of politics , characterized by immediacy and participation .
There are no scales , no ascending or descending lines , and distinctions are not recognized .
There 's only one central distinction : there are members of the group bound by the pact , and then there are enemies .
Enemies are completely other .
It is not that someone who falls out of step with the pact becomes less equal ; whoever deviates from the doctrine is no longer recognized as a being endowed with rights and value .
Enemies become unspeakable , once excluded , their names are forgotten .
As Alexander Trocchi said after he was excluded from the SI , " Guy would n't even mention the names of the people I was involved with ... exclusions were total .
It meant ostracism . "
Eliane Brau had been the first to speak of the necessity for " autoterrorism " - each member of the group needed to go through a rite of purification , a self - education in revolution , in which previous social relations , inherited habits and moral conventions had to be ruthlessly wiped out .
Those who hesitated or only went half - way were judged traitors to the pact that bound the group together .
The power of the band became enormous , extending its dominion over every detail of personal life and moral judgment , assuming the form of a guiding principle for the sake of which all other social relations were renounced .
This is what every army dreams of accomplishing - cutting new recruits off from their previous lives so that the combat unit becomes their new family and the fear of letting down their brothers and comrades in arms becomes greater than the fear of sacrifice or death .
Perfect love can abolish both fear and judgment .
The surface resemblance between the historical avant - gardes and terrorist cells reflects an underlying collusion between territory and terror .
Territory is not the same as space - space is unbounded and amorphous , while territory is a juridical concept which implies delimitation and ownership .
According to dictionary definitions , territory is a tract of land that is marked off to designate that it falls under the dominion of a political unit ( a prince , a sovereign state , another form of government or an institution ) .
The synonyms for territory are : confines , boundary , battleground , commonwealth , domain , dominion , protectorate , satellite , nation , state , country .
Legal dictionaries make the etymological connection between territory and terror even clearer : territory is " a part of a country , separated from the rest , and subject to a particular jurisdiction .
The word is derived from terrere , and is so called because the magistrate within his jurisdiction has the power of inspiring salutary fear by arrest and removal . "
It 's not a coincidence that " terrorism " as a word is born on the eve of the French Revolution as a euphemism for the power of the nation - state .
Robespierre affirmed that terror is necessary " to found and consolidate democracy , to achieve the peaceable reign of the constitutional laws . "
To baptize a territory is to draw boundaries around previously unmarked space ; territorialization is a mapping that is simultaneously physical and ideological .
Terror follows from virtue defined as the " love of country and its laws " - it is not an accidental consequence of the newly founded nation but its internal emanation .
The new territory created by the Revolution of 1789 is the Republic of France , in other words , the ideology of republicanism .
The founding doctrine ( expressed in the various manifestoes & decrees : The Decree Abolishing the Feudal System , The Declaration of the Rights of Man , The Constitution 1791 , The Law of the Suspects , The Constitution of Year III ) sets boundaries on the possible through the institution of laws , and it marks the inside from the outside through the concepts it invents .
The founding law extends its protection only to citizens , and the " only citizens in the Republic are the republicans " or those who ally themselves ideologically with the revolution .
The others , all the " assassins who tear our country apart " are potential enemies always lurking on the horizon , and the revolution demands that they be deprived of civil rights , spied on , denounced , incarcerated and guillotined .
The first precedent for the criminalization of those who did not share the virtue of the republic was laid down during the trial of Louis XVI by Saint - Just : " The whole object of the committee was to persuade you that the King ought to be judged as a simple citizen , but I tell you that he ought to be judged as the enemy …
It is therefore the right of the convention as representing the whole people , to condemn the King to death and it better do so quickly . "
Terror is only the pursuit and elimination of what does not belong to the constituted territory .
If this sounds despotic , then it is , in Robespierre 's elegant phrase , only " liberty 's despotism against tyranny . "
The reign of terror left its mark on history not just through the notorious trials and executions but through the social transformations that followed from Jacobin ideology , which called for the centralization of the state and the equality of citizens through the leveling of ranks and social distinctions .
Before the revolution , sovereignty was a private , transcendental relation between each person to the king as an indirect representative of god ; with the revolution , modern sovereignty became an immanent , public relation of citizenship as people became bound to each other through their abstract relation to the law of the republic .
In Saint - Just 's utopia , which became real according to the ruse of history , citizens had to carry identity cards ( called " certificates of good citizenship " ) issued by their local commune , and every house had to have documents posted on its door listing its legal occupants .
Borders were invisible but everywhere , even inside the republic , and because their passage had to be strictly controlled , citizens needed certified documents to travel from one city to another .
Territory was recreated as the mirror image of this new form of sovereignty - France was divided into a mathematical grid of departments , cantons , and municipalities to make public surveillance and adjudication of law easier and to facilitate the flow of commodities with increased speed .
Each department was to be run exactly as its neighbor .
Since differences were aristocratic , every effort was taken to eradicate individual cultures , regional dialects , and local customs .
In schools language became standardized and curriculum was controlled by the state .
In " Republican Institutions , " Saint - Just proposed that " children shall belong to their mother until they are five years old ; after that they shall belong to the republic until death . "
He also demanded that " Every man twenty - one years of age shall publicly state in the temples who are his friends " and that the punishment for refusal should be banishment .
The ultimate scope of the terror was to abolish every detail of private life so that raising children , the character of people who lived in the same house , even relations among friends … would become public affairs presided over by the state .
Antoine Louis Leon de Richebourg de Saint - Just , born on August 25 , 1767 , executed on July 27 , 1794 , prophet of a virtue that lay dormant in everyone 's heart but had suppressed and twisted for centuries by the aristocratic masters of the old world , was one of the heroes and acknowledged ancestors of the Situationists , even back in their Lettrist days .
The voice of Saint - Just haunted Debord 's first film , Howls for Sade ; the beautiful youth with the soft cheeks was remembered as one of the " enfants perdus " - a failed revolutionary , misunderstood by posterity , silenced by the march of history .
Quotes from Saint - Just were borrowed ciphers in Situationist writings , reminders that " The only reason one fights is for what one loves , " warnings that " Those who make revolution half way only dig their own graves . "
The " decline " of the SI did not take place after 1968 but in the 1950s when the group transformed itself into a territory .
When the Lettrist International fused with COBRA and changed its name to the SI , writing acquired primacy - as the re-presentation of earlier lived experiments in intelligible form and visible retroactively as a project that carried the historical weight of destiny .
As the " coherent critique " became dominant and their experiences and ideas acquired mythic proportions , the tone of the writings also became increasingly juridical and self - righteous .
The so - called " mistakes " and " imperfections " that were grounds for exclusion from the group were projected as a failure of individuals to measure up to the theory .
In the end it was inevitable that reality itself should be condemned for not corresponding to the SI 's theoretical predictions .
The most vulgar display of retroactive bad conscience is the story about May 68 in " The End of an Era " and in Rene Vienet 's book on the occupation movement .
The SI rejected the interpretation by Cornelius Castoriadis ( a former mentor whose theories they often plagiarized ) that the students constituted the most radical impulse of the insurrection .
In reality , that is , according to Situationist theory , the proletariat made a comeback as the vanguard of revolution after a long period of silence and stagnation .
This interpretation contradicts the fact that the striking workers , when asked what they wanted , had most often replied with a demand for higher wages .
The SI explain away this inconsistency by claiming that although what the proletariat " had wanted was revolution … they had been unable to say it " since they lacked " a coherent and organized theory . "
The nascent revolution failed because the proletariat " proved incapable of really speaking on their own behalf " - in other words , they needed someone with a coherent critique to explain to them what they had really wanted but were unable to say .
The SI has sometimes been referred to as the last avant - garde , with their separation in 1972 marking the end of an era when art , radical desire and political militancy came together .
The idea that the avant - garde is dead , which first became a fashion during the 1980s , was the product of two different collective fantasies .
Conservatives like Achille Bonito Oliva and Arthur Danto announced that the avant - garde had reached the end of its history and attained the greatest era of freedom art had ever known - a mirror of the great freedom of the liberal utopia of the market .
" New " left critics who spoke the language of Adorno ( Suzi Gablik , Andreas Huyssen , Hans Magnus Enzenberger , and Nicos Hadjinicolau ) viewed this liberal utopia of " reconciliation " as a euphemism for the completely administered society .
They read the death of the avant - garde as the visible nightmare of a moment of unfreedom , a complete paralysis of the critical impulse resulting from their absorption and recuperation by the culture industry .
Both fantasies affirmed the end of a mixture of radical art & politics , whether by obsolescence or impossibility .
And both highlighted an external movement at the expense of the internal dynamic .
The avant - garde is really dead , but not for the reasons invoked by the specialists of art .
They were not innocent victims destroyed in their struggle with an external power - either crushed by totalitarian states or colonized by the culture industry - they were the vehicles of their own self - destruction .
It 's not a trivial thing that the term " avant - garde " was borrowed from military language - it refers to an elite group , organized by strict discipline , who goes into battle first to pave the way for the attack , perhaps sacrificing itself in the end so the army can advance the cause of its righteous war .
If this metaphor started out as a parody , it became real in the course of history , and in the final instance , the avant - gardes became doubles of the very logic of territorial power they sought to challenge .
It was the group NSK who , during the 1980s in Yugoslavia , unmasked this secret complicity in its most spectacular form .
Laibach was born in 1980 in the republic of Slovenia .
Against the new wave of democratization that followed Tito 's death , Laibach enacted a theater of power that was , as Boris Groys has called it , " more total than totalitarianism . "
Laibach appears on the stage in black quasi-military uniforms with armbands , against a background of fascist , communist and religious symbols , swastikas made of axes dripping blood , national flags and deer antlers , black crosses , and moving images of wartime footage .
The music mixes the drum rhythms of military marches , instrumental techno beats , excerpts from political speeches by Tito : " We have shed a sea of blood for the fraternity and unity of our nations .
We shall allow no one to interfere or plot from within to destroy this fraternity and unity . "
The rhythm of each song is repeated into the next at an obsessive pace , with the same rigidity as the body language of the performers .
Emptied of content , Laibach performs the audience , holding up a mirror of servitude in which individuals abolish themselves by identifying with the ideology of the state .
In 1984 Laibach joined 3 other groups , Irwin , Scipion Nasice Sisters Theater , and New Collectivism , to found a 30 + person collective , NSK , Neue Slowenische Kunst .
NSK defined itself as a uniform collective that took the State as a model of organization , industrial production as its method of working , and " identification with ideology " as the content of its aesthetic productions .
NSK 's strategy was neither an open denunciation of the power of the state , nor a parody of its operations , but an excessive re-staging of the aesthetic basis and seductive legitimation of territorial power .
According to Zizek , by over - identifying with the language of power , NSK revealed the hidden reverse of what must usually be suppressed for power to function unquestioned .
And the reason Laibach were considered dangerous by the Yugoslavian authorities who banned their performances was precisely because they took ideology more seriously than it is willing to take itself .
Following Zizek 's lead , the small group of critics who have written about NSK have focused almost exclusively on NSK 's relation to the State and the strategy of over - identification as the defining element which supposedly sets it apart from overt political critique as well as from the previous avant - gardes .
But identifying with the mode of organization of state power was common to the hoaxes and interventions of Zurich and Berlin Dada as well as some of the early hoaxes of Surrealism and Lettrism .
The Berlin Dadas established a " revolutionary central council " and demanded that all laws and decrees would be subject to its approval .
In " What is Dadaism and what does it want in Germany , " they called for the union of artists and intellectuals on the basis of the expropriation of property , the communal feeding of all , the introduction of progressive unemployment , the introduction of simultaneous Dada poems as communist state prayers , and the regulation of all sexual relations through the Dadaist sexual center !
Johannes Baader interrupted the Weimar assembly to announce his candidacy for President of the World .
Raoul Hausmann later called their actions and manifestoes " a monstrous mockery of all political tendencies . "
It can be said especially of the Dadas that they aimed to reveal the obscenity of state power , political parties , and ideological discourse .
What 's different about NSK is that it revealed the obscenity of the avant - gardes by over - identifying with their territorialism to the point of dissolution .
NSK is dialectics at a standstill , repeating frozen fragments of the avant - garde image - the effect is like a record that skips , or of a found footage film in which an isolated gesture or a fragment of a slogan is repeated until the rhythm acquires a demented pitch , becoming unbearable .
The negation is not recuperated in a positive movement that would complete the unfinished project of the avant - garde and reconcile its historical contradictions ; on the contrary , any desire to identify with the legacy of the avant - garde becomes absurd .
History does not travel everywhere at the same speed .
In historically underdeveloped countries ( in Western Europe and especially in North America ) , a thousand and one appropriations of the Situationists are still in fashion under new labels like tactical media , communication guerilla , cultural jamming and aesthetic terrorism .
The same old story is repeated with minute variations and less spectacular results : small groups with big pretensions come together , write countless manifestoes , issue new proclamations , occasionally make it into the media spotlight , have periodic quarrels and exclusions , and eventually break apart .
These repetitions do n't eclipse history as much as they appropriate it one - sidedly in terms of its beautiful slogans , while passing over in silence its consequent realities .
In Canada , I saw protestors against corporate globalization march with a soviet hammer and sickle against the background of the Canadian flag ; in Germany on May 1 , I watched demonstrators take to the streets wearing Che Guevarra t- shirts .
Many of us would shake our head in disapproval over these examples , dismissing them as the outdated hallucinations of a revolutionary vanguard tradition that now deserves its place in the trashcan of history .
The politics of the day is decentralized , nonhierarchical , horizontal , participatory and transparent .
But is it necessarily less totalitarian ?
What the historical tradition of the avant - gardes showed is that the dichotomy between centralization and decentralization or hierarchy and horizontality were chimeras , false detours .
The most antihierarchical groups can advocate total equality and participation among the members and at the same time be the most rabid examples of totalitarianism , excluding all those who fail to recognize or appropriate the coherence of the critique .
If " actually existing socialism " deserves to be criticized it is just as much for its hierarchical chain of command and bureaucracy of privilege as for its dogmatism - the conviction that only its own worldview was correct , the inability to admit any contradictory ideas or criticism , and the exclusion of any realities which questioned the correctness of the theory .
Some anarchists and antiauthoritarians today are also totalitarians - absolutely convinced of the righteousness of their beliefs , immune to any criticism , and incapable of dialoguing with anyone who thinks differently .
At a recent Indymedia meeting , it was decided that during a public debate we should only talk about the positive achievements of the network and that no one should bring up recent scandals about the problems of the Open Publishing Newswire because this would betray the spirit of solidarity .
At a festival of media makers in Amsterdam , an Italian " comrade " said to me that it did n't matter if the new tactical media avant - garde were using the same methods as the state or even neo - fascist groups and that we should stop criticizing each other because it was counter - revolutionary .
Is this an old fiction we have n't yet learned how to live without ?
A new form of group collaboration emerged in Eastern Europe in the beginning of the 1990s that was a conscious alternative to the old model of the avant - gardes .
And it 's not insignificant that it arose in those countries where decades of centralization of every aspect of life under the mystical shell of solidarity now provoked an immediate suspicion toward manifestoes , proclamations of 5 year plans , and one - line slogans which were devoid of content and betrayed only the incapacity to think the present .
Whereas the tendency of the avant - garde had been an inward contraction toward unity under a common manifesto and programme , these new collaborative associations did n't come together as a self - promotion of ideas under a group name , but for the production of collaborative projects and works .
As the desire for writing manifestoes vanished so has the importance of names .
Ujlak was a group in Hungary , born in 1992 , abolishing its name in 1995 ( after they became well known ) , though they are still working together without any name .
Ujlak - translated as the " new inhabitants " - was from the beginning a name without a name , since the name simply referred to their practice of using empty spaces like bathhouses , abandoned factories , and warehouses .
Theirs was not an " occupation " since they did n't claim these space under their own name or seek to found a new territory - even one for an alternative culture - like the many squats or occupied autonomous social centers in other countries .
Ujlak defined itself only through its constant movement from one place to another , always becoming for a moment the new inhabitants .
A friend from the Romanian group the Institute , recently told me of their plans to take possession of a space , but added that " contrary to the cultural tradition that has been consecrated in Western Europe since 1968 , our space will be evacuated and not occupied . "

A simple homemade Van de Graaff generator
In the previous two projects , we stole high voltage from a television set to power our high voltage motors .
In this project we will build a device that can generate 12,000 volts from an empty soda can and a rubber band .
The device is called a Van de Graaff generator .
Science museums and research facilities have large versions that generate potentials in the hundreds of thousands of volts .
Ours is more modest , but is still capable of drawing 1 / 2 inch sparks from the soda can to my finger .
The spark is harmless , and similar to the jolt you get from a doorknob after scuffing your feet on the carpet .
An empty soda can
A small nail
A rubber band , 1 / 4 inch by 3 or 4 inches
A 5x20 millimeter GMA - Type electrical fuse ( such as Radio Shack # 270- 1062 or # 270-1061 )
A small DC motor ( such as Radio Shack # 273-223 )
A battery clip ( Radio Shack # 270-324 )
A battery holder ( Radio Shack # 270-382 )
A styrofoam cup ( a paper cup will also work )
A hot glue gun ( or regular glue if you do n't mind waiting )
Two 6 inch long stranded electrical wires ( such as from an extension cord )
Two pieces of 3/4 inch PVC plumbing pipe , each about 2 or 3 inches long
One 3/4 inch PVC coupler
One 3/4 inch PVC T connector
Some electrical tape
A block of wood
To build the toy , you need :
That sounds like a lot of stuff , but take a look at the step - by - step photos below , and you will find that the whole project can easily be put together in an evening , once all the parts have been collected .
We 'll start at the bottom , and work our way up .
The first thing to do is to cut a 2 to 3 inch long piece of 3/4 inch PVC pipe , and glue that to the wooden base .
This piece will hold the generator up , and allow us to remove it to more easily replace the rubber band , or make adjustments .
The PVC " T " connector will hold the small motor .
The motor fits too loosely by itself , so we wrap paper or tape around it to make a snug fit .
The shaft of the motor can be left bare , but the generator will work a little better if it is made fatter by wrapping tape around it , or ( better ) putting a plastic rod with a hole in the center onto the shaft to act as a pulley for the rubber band .
Next , we drill a small hole in the side of the PVC " T " connector , just under the makeshift pulley on the motor .
This hole will be used to hold the lower " brush " , which is simply a bit of stranded wire frayed at the end , that istouching the rubber band on the pulley .
As the photo shows , the stranded wire is held in place with some electrical tape , or some other tape or glue .
The rubber band is now placed on the pulley , and allowed to hang out the top of the " T " connector .
Next , cut another 3 or 4 inch piece of 3/4 inch PVC plumbing pipe .
This will go into the top of the " T " connector , with the rubber band going up through it .
Use the small nail to hold the rubber band in place , as in the photo below .
The length of the PVC pipe should be just enough to fit the rubber band .
The rubber band should not be stretched too tightly , since the resulting friction would prevent the motor from turning properly , and increase wear on the parts .
Cut the styrofoam cup about an inch from the bottom , and carefully cut a 3 / 4 inch diameter hole in the center of the bottom of the cup .
This hole should fit snugly onto the 3/4 inch PVC pipe .
Now drill three holes near the top of the PVC union coupling .
Two of these holes need to be diametrically opposite one another , since they will hold the small nail which will act as an axle for the rubber band .
The third hole is between the other two , and it will hold the top " brush " , which , like the bottom brush , will almost touch the rubber band .
The top brush is taped to the PVC union coupler , and the coupler is placed on the 3/4 inch pipe , above the styrofoam cup collar .
The rubber band is threaded through the coupler , and held in place with the small nail , as before .
Bare the top brush ( so it has no insulation ) and twist it to keep the individual wires from coming apart .
You can solder the free end if you like , but it is not necessary .
The free end of the top brush will be curled up inside the empty soda can when we are done , and thus electrically connect the soda can to the top brush .
We need a small glass tube to act as both a low - friction top pulley , and as a " triboelectric " complement to the rubber band , to generate static electricity by rubbing .
Glass is one of the best materials to rub against rubber to create electricity .
We get the tube by taking apart a small electrical fuse .
The metal ends of the fuse come off easily if heated with a soldering iron or a match .
The solder inside them drips out when they come off , so be careful .
The glass , the metal cap , and the molten solder are all quite hot , and will blister the skin if you touch them before they cool .
The resulting glass tube has nice straight , even edges , which are " fire polished " for you , so there is no sharp glass , and no uneven edges to catch on the PVC and break the glass .
The next step is a little tricky .
The small nail is placed through one of the two holes in the PVC union coupler , and the small glass tube is placed on the nail .
Then the rubber band is placed on the glass tube , and the nail is then placed in the second hole .
The rubber band is on the glass tube , which is free to rotate around the nail .
Now we glue the styrofoam collar in place on the PVC pipe .
I like to use a hot glue gun for this , since the glue can be laid on thickly to stabilize the collar , and it sets quickly and does not dissolve the styrofoam .
At this point we are ready for the empty soda can .
Aluminum pop - top cans are good for high voltage because they have nice rounded edges , which minimizes " corona discharge " .
With a sharp knife , carefully cut out the top of the soda can .
Leave the nice crimped edge , and cut close to the side of the can so as to leave very little in the way of sharp edges .
You can smooth the cut edge by " stirring " the can with a metal tool like a screwdriver , pressing outward as you stir , to flatten the sharp edge .
Tuck the free end of the top brush wire into the can , and invert the can over the top of the device , until it rests snugly on the styrofoam collar .
The last step is to attach the batteries .
I like to solder a battery clip to the motor terminals , and then clip this onto either a nine - volt battery , or a battery holder for two AA size batteries .
The nine - volt battery works , but it runs the motor too fast , making a lot of noise , and risking breakage of the glass tube .
It does , however , make a slightly higher voltage , until the device breaks .
To use the Van de Graaff generator , simply clip the battery to the battery clip .
If the brushes are very close to the ends of the rubber band , but not touching , you should be able to feel a spark from the soda can if you bring your finger close enough .
It helps to hold onto the free end of the bottom brush with the other hand while doing this .
To use our generator to power the Franklin 's Bells we built in the previous section of the book , clip the bottom brush wire to one " bell " , and attach a wire to the top of the generator , connecting it to the other " bell " .
The pop -top clapper of the Franklin 's Bells should start jumping between the soda cans .
It may need a little push to get started .
How does it do that ?
You may have at one time rubbed a balloon on your hair , and then made the balloon stick to the wall .
If you have never done this , try it !
The Van de Graaff generator uses this trick and two others to generate the high voltage needed to make a spark .
The first trick
When the balloon made contact with your hair , the molecules of the rubber touched the molecules of the hair .
When they touched , the molecules of the rubber attract electrons from the molecules of the hair .
The you take the balloon away from your hair , some of those electrons stay with the balloon , giving it a negative charge .
The extra electrons on the balloon repel the electrons in the wall , pushing them back from the surface .
The surface of the wall is left with a positive charge , since there are fewer electrons than when it was neutral .
The positive wall attracts the negative balloon with enough force to keep it stuck to the wall .
If you collected a bunch of different materials and touched them to one another , you could find out which ones were left negatively charged , and which were left positively charged .
You could then take these pairs of objects , and put them in order in a list , from the most positive to the most negative .
Such a list is called a .
The prefixmeans " to rub " .
The Triboelectric series
asbestos
rabbit fur
glass
hair
nylon
wool
silk
paper
cotton
hard rubber
synthetic rubber
polyester
styrofoam
orlon
saran
polyurethane
polyethylene
polypropylene
polyvinyl chloride ( PVC pipe )
teflon
silicone rubber
Our Van de Graaff generator uses a glass tube and a rubber band .
The rubber band steals electrons from the glass tube , leaving the glass positively charged , and the rubber band negatively charged .
The second trick
The triboelectric charging is the first trick .
The second trick involves the wire brushes .
When a metal object is brought near a charged object , something quite interesting happens .
The charged object causes the electrons in the metal to move .
If the object is charged negatively , it pushes the electrons away .
If it is charged positively , it pulls the electrons towards it .
Electrons are all negatively charged .
Because like charges repel , and electrons are all the same charge , electrons will always try to get as far away from other electrons as possible .
If the metal object has a sharp point on it , the electrons on the point are pushed by all of the other electrons in the rest of the object .
So on a point , there are a lot of electrons pushing from the metal , but no electrons pushing from the air .
If there are enough extra electrons on the metal , they can push some electrons off the point and into the air .
The electrons land on the air molecules , making them negatively charged .
The negatively charged air is repelled from the negatively charged metal , and a small wind of charged air blows away from the metal .
This is called " corona discharge " , because the dim light it gives off looks like a crown .
The same thing happens in reverse if the metal has too few electrons ( if it is positively charged ) .
At the point , all of the positive charges in the metal pull all the electrons from the point , leaving it very highly charged .
The air molecules that hit the metal point lose their electrons to the strong pull from the positive tip of the sharp point .
The air molecules are now positive , and are repelled from the positive metal .
The third trick
There is one more trick the Van de Graaff generator uses .
After we understand the third trick , we will put all of the tricks together to see how the generator works .
We said earlier that all electrons have the same charge , and so they all try to get as far from one another as possible .
The third trick uses the soda can to take advantage of this feature of the electrons in an interesting way .
If we give the soda can a charge of electrons , they will all try to get as far away from one another as possible .
This has the effect of making all the electrons crowd to the outside of the can .
Any electron on the inside of the can will feel the push from all the other electrons , and will move .
But the electrons on the outside feel the push from the can , but they do not feel any push from the air around the can , which is not charged .
This means that we can put electrons on the inside of the can , and they will be pulled away to the outside .
We can keep adding as many electrons as we like to the inside of the can , and they will always be pulled to the outside .
Putting all three tricks together
So now let 's look at the Van de Graaff generator with our three tricks in mind .
The motor moves the rubber band around and around .
The rubber band loops over the glass tube and steals the electrons from the glass .
The rubber band is much bigger than the glass tube .
The electrons stolen from the glass are distributed across the whole rubber band .
The glass , on the other hand , is small .
The negative charges that are spead out over the rubber band are weak , compared to the positive charges that are all concentrated on the little glass tube .
The strong positive charge on the glass attracts the electrons in the wire on the top brush .
These electrons spray from the sharp points in the brush , and charge the air .
The air is repelled from the wire , and attracted to the glass .
But the charged air can't get to the glass , because the rubber band is in the way .
The charged air molecules hit the rubber , and transfer the electrons to it .
The rubber band travels down to the bottom brush .
The electrons in the rubber push on the electrons in the wire of the bottom brush .
The electrons are pushed out of the wire , and into whatever large object we have attached to the end of the wire , such as the earth , or a person .
The sharp points of the bottom brush are now positive , and they pull the electrons off of any air molecules that touch them .
These positively charged air molecules are repelled by the positively charged wire , and attracted to the electrons on the rubber band .
When they hit the rubber , they get their electrons back , and the rubber and the air both lose their charge .
The rubber band is now ready to go back up and steal more electrons from the glass tube .
The top brush is connected to the inside of the soda can .
It is positively charged , and so attracts electrons from the can .
The positive charges in the can move away from one another ( they are the same charge , so they repel , just like electrons ) .
The positive charges collect on the outside of the can , leaving the neutral atoms of the can on the inside , where they are always ready to donate more electrons .
The effect is to transfer electrons from the soda can into the ground , using the rubber band like a conveyor belt .
It does n't take very long for the soda can to lose so many electrons that it becomes 12,000 volts more positive than the ground .
When the can gets very positive , it eventually has enough charge to steal electrons from the air molecules that hit the can .
This happens most at any sharp points on the can .
If the can were a perfect sphere , it would be able to reach a higher voltage , since there would be no places where the charge was more concentrated than anywhere else .
If the sphere were larger , an even higher voltage could be reached before it started stealing electrons from the air , because a larger sphere is not as " sharp " as a smaller one .
The places on our soda can where the curves are the sharpest are where the charge accumulates the most , and where the electrons are stolen from the air .
Airin an electric field of about 25,000 volts per inch .
Ionized air conducts electricity like a wire does .
You can see the ionized air conducting electricity , because it gets so hot it emits light .
It is what we call a spark .
Since our generator can draw sparks that are about a half inch long , we know we are generating about 12,500 volts .
Troubleshooting
If you are n't detecting any high voltage ( no sparks , does n't attract hair or paper ) then you might try some of these suggestions .
Try a different type of rubber band .
Some are slightly conductive , which at 12,000 volts means conductive enough to leak all the current you have so carefully built up .
Have a supply of many different types of rubber band to try .
Make sure everything is very clean .
Dirt and grease can be slightly conductive , and that will be enough to make the device fail .
Make sure the top brush is touching the metal of the can .
Some cans have a plastic coating inside .
Scrape it off ( or burn it off ) to make a better connection .
Make sure there are no sharp points extending outside the can .
It is OK to have sharp points pointing inside the can , from the cut part of the top .
Sharp points cause corona losses .
Make sure the brushes are not touching the rubber band .
This will put a coating of copper on the rubber , and make it conductive .
Make sure you have a good ground connection .
Make sure the motor is spinning fast .

Since people can't spell Van de Graaff , you may want to try various spellings .
Some fun with the Van de Graaf generator
One of the fun things to do with a Van de Graaff generator is to show how like charges repel .
We take a paper napkin , and cut thin strips of the lightweight paper .
We then tape the ends of the paper together at one end , and tape that end onto the Van de Graaf generator .
The effect will look somewhat like long hair cascading down the soda can .
Now turn the Van de Graaff generator on .
The thin strips of paper all get the same charge , and start to repel from one another .
The effect is " hair raising " .
The strips start to stand out straight from the can , like the hair on the back of a scared cat .
A high voltage ion motor
This motor is very simple to build , and goes together in a few minutes .
All you need is two pieces of wire , the small metal cap from the fuse we took apart in the previous project , and some cellophane tape .
The motor creates an ion wind that spins it around like a helicopter .
First , take one piece of wire ( a straightened paper clip will do ) , and cut the end at an angle so it is sharp .
Bend the other end into a rough loop or triangle , so the wire will stand up with the sharp point facing straight up .
A little tape will help hold it onto the table , or a block of wood .
The armature ( the part that spins ) is made from the other piece of wire and the metal cap we saved when we took apart the fuse .
Sharpen both ends of the wire by cutting the ends at a diagonal , like we did with the base wire .
Bend the wire into an S shape .
The pointed ends of the wire should point at 90 degrees from the center straight part of the wire .
Attach the metal cap to the center of the wire with tape .
Place the cap onto the pointed end of the base wire , and bend the S shaped ends of the armature wire down , so it will balance easily on the sharp end of the base wire .
The armature should now spin freely if you tap it gently .
Connect a source of high voltage to the base wire using an alligator clip or a wire .
The high voltage source can be the Van de Graaff generator , or just a couple square feet of aluminum foil pressed against the front of your television set , as we did in earlier projects .
As the high voltage is turned on , the armature will start to spin in the direction away from the sharp points .
The Van de Graaff generator may need a good ground , or a person holding onto the ground wire .
The television will give the motor a good kick every time it is turned on or off , and turning it on and off every second will get it spinning quite rapidly .
How does it do that ?
The motor works by ionizing the air , and then pushing against the ionized air .
As we explained in the previous project , electric charges are concentrated by sharp points .
The sharp points on the ends of the armature concentrate the charges so much that the air around the points becomes charged as well .
Since the air has the same charge as the wire , the two repel one another .
You can actually feel a small wind coming from the sharp point .
As the wire pushes on the charged air , they both move away from one another .
The air blows away , and the wire spins .
