Ah , feel the eliminationism .
Rep. Gregg Harper , a Mississippi Republican , had a jocular interview with Politico 's Anne Schroeder Mullins and popped out this little knee - slapper :
Mullins :
What in the world does the Congressional Sportsmen ’s Caucus do ?
Harper :
We hunt liberal , tree - hugging Democrats , although it does seem like a waste of good ammunition .
Coming from a congressman from a state still renowned for its lynchings and murders not just of black people but white civil - rights workers -- in an era many of us can still remember clearly -- this kind of " humor " is anything but funny .
However , it is the kind of thing we 've come to expect to today 's Republicans , is n't it ?
Not that makes any difference to Blue Dog Democrats like Ben Nelson .
As Media Matters notes :
Ironically , Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) , a co-chair of the caucus , has praised the group for being bipartisan .
" Unlike some of the other activities in Washington , Republicans and Democrats reach across the aisle and join hands to work together , not as Republican or Democrat , but as sportsmen and women , " he wrote .
Someone should ask Ben Nelson if he enjoys hunting liberal Democrats too , since that 's what his caucus is apparently viewed as a venue for .
( Addendum : Somehow I 'm not surprised that Harper is a Mississippian who thinks John Grisham is a " literary great " who surpasses Faulkner and Welty .

Israeli authorities recently destroyed structures that had been built at the outpost
By Erica Chernofsky
BBC News , Jerusalem
While many Israeli teenagers spend the summer hanging out on beaches or in shopping malls , Evyatar Slonam , 17 , is sitting on an exposed hillside in the southern West Bank at the Jewish outpost of Mitzpe Avichai .
" We want there to be a mall right here , " explains his friend Yehoyada , 15 , indicating the hilltop surrounded by Palestinian houses and olive groves .
" Tel Aviv once looked like this , too . "
Mr Slonam fingers his long , brown sidelocks as he attempts to explain the ideology that drives some young Israelis known as the the Hilltop Youth to flout both Israeli and international law and build shacks they hope will eventually become established settlements in the West Bank .
The US is demanding that Israel stops building in all settlements in the West Bank , which are illegal under international law .
Outposts are illegal even under Israeli law , and Israel agreed to remove them under the 2003 US - sponsored Road Map peace plan .
Israeli authorities have stepped up demolitions of smaller outposts - and the settlers are accelerating building and rebuilding structures at the sites .
Evyatar Slonam was raised in a religious home and his parents support his activism
The Hilltop Youth movement 's members are often found camping out in the makeshift communities , and have a reputation as wayward teens eager to clash with Israeli authorities and Palestinians alike .
Mr Slonam says the only law he heeds is the law of God .
" God gave us all of Israel , it all belongs to the Jews . "
" It 's not like I 'm going to Egypt and claiming land there .
This is Israel , " he says of the land Israel has occupied since the 1967 Arab - Israeli war .
" It 's the land of the Israeli people , the Jewish people , so we 're allowed to be here . "
Raised in a religious home in the Tzofim settlement , he studies in a seminary for much of the year , and says he is not at all interested in girls or alcohol and his parents support his activism .
A large skullcap , or yarmulke , covers his head and tzitzit , a religious fringed garment , hangs down from under his scruffy T - shirt .
I wo n't lie , of course it was exciting .
I knew I was going to get into fights .
There were kids who only wanted to do it for the excitement and the fun , but for me it came from a real ideology that was important to me
Yonatan Human rights groups say young settlers are in many cases involved in clashes with Palestinians .
But Mr Slonam says he has never attacked Palestinians , even when stones have been thrown his way - and would only fight Israeli security forces if they used violence to force him from the outpost .
Last week , police forces destroyed the makeshift homes .
They have since been replaced with a tent , a structure made of wooden posts and metal slats , and old sofas on the rocky hillside .
The residents sleep on mattresses on the ground , relieve themselves in the open air and shower at a nearby settlement .
Gaza anger Mr Slonam became involved with the Hilltop Youth during the 2005 evacuation of some 8,000 Jews from settlements in Gaza .
Many right wingers felt betrayed by their country - which originally sent the settlers there - and by the army that forcibly removed those who refused to leave .

He has been arrested twice , once here at Mitzpe Avichai , for refusing to leave by police order .
" I understand laws , " he says , " but I know that if I 'm not here the same thing that happened in [ the Gaza settlement block of ]
Gush Katif will happen again .
" We gave [ the Palestinians ] land and they gave us rockets , " he says , in reference to the rise in attacks on southern Israel that accompanied the Islamist group Hamas 's rise to power in the wake of the withdrawal .
Late last year , following a wave of settler violence , Israeli Welfare Minister Isaac Herzog dubbed the Hilltop Youth a " security threat " and a " dangerous phenomenon " .
Announcing plans to open " rehabilitation " centres for the youth , he said : " Just as there are programs for criminal youths , there must be programs for hilltop youth , too .
" In the long term , a warm home and the proper framework can push the [ appeal of the ] hilltops aside . "
' Rebellion ' Yonatan , 21 , says he was once a " notorious " Hilltop Youth .
He comes from a religious family , but rebelled by turning secular , dropping out of high school and experimenting with drugs and alcohol .
It is a militant bohemianism .
Yes , they have nationalistic goals , but they also want to get away from bourgeois society , to get away from the system
Shlomo Fischer
Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University Yonathan was arrested for trying to enter Gaza during the 2005 withdrawal , and was treated in hospital for injuries sustained protesting during the 2006 evacuation of homes at the West Bank outpost of Amona .
" I wo n't lie , " he admits , " of course it was exciting . "
" I knew I was going to get into fights .
There were kids who only wanted to do it for the excitement and the fun , but for me it came from a real ideology that was important to me . "
Now he serves in the Israeli military at a base minutes away from outposts where he once fought off soldiers and police .
" In the army you meet everyone , rightists and leftists , and I have to try and influence from the inside .
I have to show them that Hilltop Youth are n't just what you see on TV . "
Some see in the Hilltop Youth an element of anti-establishment rebellion common among teenagers in many societies .
" It is a militant bohemianism , " says Shlomo Fischer , a sociologist at Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University .
" Yes , they have nationalistic goals , but they also want to get away from bourgeois society , to get away from the system , from authority , from their parents , from school .
Many right - wing Israelis felt betrayed by the Gaza pull - out " They are ready to confront the Palestinians and Israeli security forces violently for some romantic bohemian ideal of authenticity . "
Yet there are figures the Hilltop Youth respect , like right - wing activists Nadia Matar and Daniella Weiss .
" Each and every one of these kids are like my children , " says Ms Matar , co-founder of Women in Green , a Zionist organisation .
" It 's an honour to be arrested for settling the land of Israel . "
Ms Matar has been detained over a dozen times for protesting against the closure of outposts .
Mr Fischer describes her as " a revolutionary who uses these kids as her soldiers " .
Yonatan was once one of these " soldiers " .
And even now , when asked what he would do if the Israeli military demanded he help remove settlers from their hilltops outposts , his answer is immediate .
" I would give up my gun .
I would refuse .
I just can't evict a Jew from his house in the land of Israel . "

New Haven
ON Oct. 1 , 1959 , I took part in a parade for the 10th anniversary of the Communist revolution that led to the founding of the People ’s Republic of China .
I was a middle - school student in the central city of Xian , and my classmates and I gathered at school before dawn .
We marched into the city ’s main square , where senior party leaders would review the parade .
As members of the Young Pioneers , a Communist youth organization , we were all in uniform  we boys in crisp white shirts tucked into navy slacks and the girls in white shirts and blue pleated skirts that swayed in the brisk morning breeze .
Each of us had a red scarf neatly tied around the neck .
We were like meticulously arranged flowers , waiting for inspection .
The senior party leaders showed up late , as usual .
By the time they delivered their slogan - filled speeches and initiated the flag - raising ceremony , we had already been standing like statues for several hours , our feet planted to the ground .
Nobody was allowed to make a noise or leave the group , even though I badly needed to answer the call of nature .
Instead , I raised my arms repeatedly and joined the crowd in shouting : “ Long live the Chinese Communist Party !
Long live Chairman Mao ! ”
Standing next to me was a student who seemed to share my anxiety .
She was pretty , with closely cropped hair .
Her eyes darted around impatiently .
We waved our arms , chanting slogans like everyone else .
Weighing in at $ 16.7 billion , the homebuyer tax credit being pushed by Sens. Johnny Isakson ( not pictured ) and Chris Dodd ( above ) makes up the bulk of the roughly $ 20 billion total .
Price tag for another ' stimulus ' : $ 20 B
The Senate appears ready to drop about $ 20 billion for two pieces of economic stimulus that no one wants to label “ stimulus , ” in the form of additional jobless benefits for unemployed workers and an extended , expanded tax credit for homebuyers .
Weighing in at $ 16.7 billion , the homebuyer tax credit being pushed by Sens. Johnny Isakson ( R - Ga. ) and Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) makes up the bulk of that total .
The Joint Committee on Taxation released that estimated price tag Tuesday .
Advertisement
Isakson and Dodd plan to offer their housing tax credit extension as an amendment to legislation extending jobless benefits .
The jobless benefits – the second bit of stimulus the Senate is likely to approve – would cost about $ 2.4 billion according to a preliminary estimate by the Congressional Budget Office .
The cost of the extended jobless benefits would be offset by extending the federal unemployment tax on employers through June 30 , 2011 .
Republicans want to amend the Democratic bill so it is paid for with stimulus funds and have objected to leadership 's attempts to pass the jobless benefits bill by voice vote .
If the Isakson - Dodd amendment becomes law , taxpayers would have likely spent more than $ 30 billion on spurring home sales alone , since the original yearlong housing tax credit – limited to first - time buyers only – included in the $ 787 billion stimulus is estimated to cost about $ 15 billion by the time it expires at the end of the year .
That does n’t seem to be fazing many senators .
“ I have n’t had any objection yet , ” Isakson said , ticking off a bipartisan list of expected supporters including Barbara Mikulski ( D - Md. ) , Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) and Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) .
He said he believes leadership will allow Dodd and him to offer the amendment when the unemployment bill comes to a vote .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republican Sen. John Ensign , hailing from recession battered Nevada , both support extending the existing housing tax credit .
“ Cost obviously is a concern on any issue but if you take the $ 85 billion to AIG , $ 700 billion in TARP , $ 787 billion stimulus – and you compare all those to what happened $ 16 billion did in the first - time homebuyer tax credit , it ’s a pretty good return on the investment , ” said Isakson .
Not everyone agrees with that assessment .
Some housing experts criticize the housing tax credit as poorly targeted and not much bang - for - the - buck .
It ’s widely estimated that the tax credit spurred 350,000 home sales that would not otherwise have happened .
That means the government spent $ 43,000 per new home sold , according to Brookings Institution economist Ted Gayer .
The Isakson - Dodd amendment would expand the tax credit to all homebuyers , as well as double the existing income caps so that couples making up to $ 300,000 and individuals making up to $ 150,000 would qualify .
Isakson , a former real estate agent , believes this expansion will help the still - struggling housing market get on its feet .
“ You ca n’t do this forever , but I think if you do open [ the credit ] up so it appeals to the move - up market as well , you give the housing market the chance to begin what everybody knows has to happen and that ’s a recovery , ” Isakson said .
If the story of Jesus Christ is n’t literally true , then Christianity is a fraud that promotes “ a positively wicked doctrine , ” conservative writer Christopher Hitchens told Fox & Friends Monday morning .
Hitchens , an avowed atheist whose 2007 book God is Not Great attempts to divorce conservatism from religious teachings , discussed the role of religion in American society in the wake of a recent study ( PDF ) that shows the number of Americans who claim no religious affiliation has roughly doubled in the past two decades , from 8.2 percent in 1990 to 15 percent in 2008 .
ADVERTISEMENT
The study , conducted by Trinity College in Hartford , Connecticut , predicts that a full one - quarter of Americans will have no religious affiliation by 2028 .
The study notes that the number of non-believers among younger people is considerably higher than among older people , suggesting that the trend of Americans growing less religious will continue in coming years .
Those people who claim no religious affiliation are “ not all atheists by any means , ” Hitchens told host Gretchen Carlson .
“ They ’re just people who do n’t attend a church , do n’t have a faith .
I think it ’s fair to call them agnostics .
The number of people , like myself , who think religion is false , that it ’s a delusion and that it ’s bad for you , is still pretty small . ”
Hitchens said Americans are increasingly turning against organized religion “ because they want to push back against theocracy and the parties of God and the awful challenge they pose to us internationally . ”
“ By the way , your side seems to be winning in public schools , at least across America , ” Carlson told Hitchens .
Hitchens appeared on Fox with pastor Douglas Wilson , who appeared along with Hitchens in the recent documentary Collision , which explores the battle of ideas between the religious and the non-religious .
ADVERTISEMENT
The two came to an unexpected agreement on one issue :
They both attacked the notion , popular among some secular thinkers , that Christianity is a socially positive thing even if it ’s not true .
“ If Jesus did n’t come back from the dead , then Christianity is appalling , it ’s an appalling fraud and delusion and every unbeliever should attack it , ” Wilson said .
“ Christianity is not good for the world because it makes people decent and sober and that sort of thing .
At the end of the day , if it ’s not true , if it ’s not objectively true , then I do n’t have any more use for it than Christopher does . ”
Hitchens echoed that idea , but made it clear he does actually consider Christianity a fraud .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ They say , well the Bible story ’s not really true , they ’re morality tales .
Do n’t listen to it , because if it ’s based on a fraud , if the virgin birth and the resurrection and the miracles did not occur , which they did not , then those teachings are immoral , they teach that sins can be forgiven by throwing them on to a scapegoat — a positively wicked doctrine . ”

THIS DISH IS SO GOOD .
I found it on Pink Bites and I can’t say enough good things about it .
It tastes exactly like something that you ’d get at a Chinese restaurant .
Mongolian beef is Kramer ’s favorite thing to get when we go out for Chinese , so I was really happy that I was able to recreate his favorite dish !
I ca n’t wait to make this again .
The sauce is incredible and goes great over rice on its own .
Recipe after the jump , as always !
Your ingredients .
I used cube steak , but you can use whatever cut of meat you ’ve got , mostly .
Slice it against the grain if you use cube steak , though .
I even put mine in the freezer for about 10 minutes to make it easier to slice .
Sprinkle the cornstarch over the sliced beef .
Shake of the excess cornstarch in a colander or mesh sieve .
Add the ginger and the garlic to the pan .
Then add the soy sauce , water , brown sugar and red pepper flakes .
Cook the sauce for about two minutes .
And transfer to a bowl .
Cook the meat in the same pan until no longer pink .
Add the sauce back to the pan .
I reduced the sauce for about 10 minutes on medium - high heat because I wanted it to be pretty thick , like at a restaurant .
Serve over rice and enjoy !

EBay Buys Stake in Craigslist
By : Nick Wingfield
In an unusual pairing of an Internet colossus and a classified - listings Web site with a cult following , eBay Inc. said it acquired 25 % of Craigslist , a deal that Craigslist 's executives say will allow the site to retain one of its most treasured assets : its soul .
The deal follows a long courtship of Craigslist by some of the top Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Internet companies , including Yahoo Inc.and Google Inc. , according to people familiar with the matter .
EBay said its investment was part of a broader interest in the online classified - advertising market , a potential growth area for the company .
Founded almost ten years ago by San Francisco software engineer Craig Newmark , Craigslist has found a devoted audience among users in the Bay Area , New York and other cities across the U.S. , who trawl its listings looking for everything from apartments to second - hand furniture to romantic encounters .
While Craigslist is profitable , it has taken an unorthodox approach to doing business , charging only for those services its users deem " appropriate " -- a policy eBay has agreed not to meddle with , according to Mr. Newmark , the company 's chairman .
The deal with eBay , financial terms of which were n't disclosed , ends a long hunt for an outside investor that divided Craigslist 's small group of shareholders and threatened its nonconformist philosophy .
EBay acquired its stake from a former Craigslist executive who was seeking to sell his shares .
Mr. Newmark and the Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster said in separate messages posted on the Web that they never imagined a stake in Craigslist ending up in the hands of a publicly - traded company .
Still , the former Craigslist executive made it clear to the company that he intended to sell his shares and began approaching other parties , including eBay .
Messrs .
Newmark and Buckmaster said they warmed to the idea of eBay buying the former executive 's stake after eBay executives made it clear they would n't ask it to alter its mission .
" They have no interest in asking us to change that in anyway , " Mr. Buckmaster said in an interview .
" They 're happy with us having our full autonomy .
They recognize us as experts at what we do . "
Craigslist executives declined to identify the former shareholder , but a person familiar with the matter said he is Phillip Knowlton , a resident of the San Francisco Bay Area .
Mr. Knowlton did n't return voice mail and email messages seeking comment .
For eBay , the deal reflects a growing focus on classified listings , a market that differs from eBay 's auctions , in which shoppers bid on an item and winners commit to purchase merchandise when the auction closes .
Earlier this year , eBay paid $ 149 million to acquire Mobile.de , a Germany automobile classified Web site .
Without a controlling stake in Craigslist , though , eBay wo n't derive any classified revenue in the near term from its investment .
" There are people for whom classifieds are the simplest way of selling something , " said eBay spokesman Hani Durzy .
" The reason we did this minority investment really was for learning purposes it gives us access to learn how the classified market online works . "
EBay 's motivation could also partly be defensive , allowing it to keep a stake in Craigslist out of a competitor 's hands and giving it the chance to acquire the remainder of Craigslist should the company 's founders decide to sell , according to a person familiar with the matter .
In the past year , Mr. Knowlton , the former Craigslist executive , approached numerous venture - capital firms and Internet companies ; Google and Yahoo , among others , had shown great interest in a possible deal with the company , according to people familiar with the matter .
Spokeswomen for Google and Yahoo declined to comment .
Without naming any suitors , Mr. Buckmaster confirmed that Craigslist fielded a lot of calls from potential investors and acquirers .
" We may get one inquiry a week , " he said .
" Everyone was intrigued that these guys were able to build a profitable business in a sector that had seen more than its share of flameouts , " said Bill Burnham , a partner at Softbank Capital Partners , who said he had n't personally sought to invest in Craigslist .
The seemingly modest financial ambitions of Craigslist 's executives make it more of cultural phenomenon than a traditional high - tech startup .
Although it has dozens of categories teeming with listings on its various local sites , the company charges only recruiters and employers in San Francisco , Los Angeles and New York for posting job listings .
A person familiar with Craigslist 's finances estimates it will have between $ 7 million and $ 10 million in revenue this year , figures the company declines to confirm .
The possibility Craigslist could charge for many more areas of its site , such as real - estate listings , is what attracted so much interest from investors .
Messrs .
Newmark and Buckmaster , though , are n't in any rush to cash in .
The company routinely posts messages on its discussion boards asking users whether they would object to new fees in certain areas of the site .
For instance , it recently decided to keep portions of its job listings in New York and Los Angeles free for low - budget - film makers and others after members asked the company to do so .
When he originally gave a stake in Craigslist to the executive that sold his shares to eBay , Mr. Newmark said , he never expected them to be worth anything .
" I made a gift of some equity in craigslist to a guy who was working with me at the time , " Mr. Newmark wrote on his Internet blog ( www.cnewmark.com).
" I figured it did n't matter , since everyone agreed that the equity had only symbolic value , not dollar value . "
Craigslist is run by a staff of 14 from two floors of an unglamorous Victorian in San Francisco 's foggy Sunset district .
Mr. Buckmaster has never owned a car and his driver 's license lapsed several years ago , which he says will complicate his ability to visit eBay 's headquarters in San Jose .
Mr. Newmark rarely drives his hybrid Toyota Prius , which he routinely lends to friends .
The response to the eBay deal on Craigslist 's own discussion boards after it was announced on Friday was mostly negative .
One posting said , in halting language : " This is a mistake .
eBay bad and robotic , Craig 's List human and good .
And now on the way to selling out . "
Mr. Buckmaster said most of its users know Craigslist wo n't change , though .
" We have to take our lumps from the knuckleheads , " he said .
The energy watchdog today said UK consumers faced potentially steep price rises in their gas and electricity bills as supplies become more volatile .
In a review of Britain 's energy market , Ofgem said an investment of up to £ 200 billion is needed to secure supplies and meet environmental targets .
It lists four possible scenarios for the future and in one - that of a strong resurgence in global economies along with missed renewable and carbon targets - Ofgem warned prices could surge by more than 60 per cent by 2016 before falling back .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ofgem said the cheapest scenario - with a hike in bills of 14 per cent by 2020 - factors in a slow recovery from the recession , coupled with global green stimulus packages .
In this option , high carbon prices and Government policies support investment in renewables , nuclear and carbon capture and storage .
Another scenario sees green measures coupled with strong economic growth and consumer bills rising by 23 per cent by 2020 .
Ofgem said this would see Britain 's reliance on gas fall , but demand for electricity would increase with a greater use of electric vehicles and heat pumps .
The regulator said that if the recession continues and gas and electricity prices remain low in the short term , it could reduce the incentive to build new nuclear and renewable power infrastructure .
In this scenario , the country would be increasingly reliant on imported gas for new gas - fired power stations and while bills would not rise by much in the early years , they are expected to climb 22 per cent by 2020 .
Ofgem said the possibility of a 60 per cent hike in bills by 2016 would be caused if wholesale gas prices spiked as a result of resurgent global economies competing for energy resources .

This scenario also assumes that no new nuclear facility would become operational before 2020 .
But the regulator said even in this scenario , bills would drop back and it predicts that by 2020 consumers would pay 25 per cent more than this year .
The four scenarios include reductions in carbon emissions of between 12 per cent and 43 per cent from 2005 levels .
Ofgem said the biggest challenges to Britain 's energy supply are the country 's growing reliance on a volatile global gas market and its ageing power stations , which are nearing the end of their lives .
The regulator also said " significant changes " may have to be made in the way we consume and generate power to manage the " variability associated with increasing reliance on wind power " .
It said a " massive " investment of between £ 95 billion and £ 200 billion in power plants and other infrastructure was necessary " to secure both energy supplies and climate change targets " .
Ofgem chief executive Alistair Buchanan said : " These are big challenges .
Consumers are already enduring high energy prices .
" This is why we are consulting with consumer and environmental groups , the academic community and industry to ensure any policy proposals we make are grounded on the best evidence available .
" Early action can avoid hasty and expensive measures later . "
Gary Smith , national officer of the GMB union , said : " This report demonstrates that central planning is essential to ensure that the lights stay on .
" How many more red light signals do our politicians have to see before they take action ? "
Shadow energy secretary Greg Clark said the challenges in the energy sector came about because of Government " dithering " .
He said the Tories would take " immediate action " to authorise five gigawatts of capacity in clean coal and publish planning guidance for companies wishing to invest in nuclear power - which he said ministers had held back without good reason .
" This is the characteristic over the last 12 years , " Mr Clark said .
" There has been no policy , effectively .
We are in the situation we are because they have had their head in the sand for 12 years . "
Ofgem said current rates of investment would have to be more than doubled to meet the high levels needed .
Consumer bills will be pushed up by the level of infrastructure investment and by the increasing cost of carbon - particularly if oil and gas market prices continue to rise as they have been since 2003 , or spike sharply .
Gas dependence is predicted to increase " dramatically " , especially if environmental measures are not fully successful .
The regulator identified the greatest risk as maintaining gas supplies through a severe winter .
Ofgem said that while the outlook for this winter is " more comfortable " - with National Grid anticipating high capacity and good gas infrastructure - its analysis suggests " that existing regulatory and market arrangements may well be tested severely over the next two decades " .
Today 's report outlines the regulator 's provisional assessment of supply issues and is due to make further recommendations - potentially including new policy - at the end of the year .
Association of Electricity Producers chief executive David Porter said Ofgem was " absolutely right " to call for investment in the energy sector .
He warned it was not possible to deliver changes " on the cheap " , adding : " In the end , the customer does pay . "
And he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme : " What we need to do is make sure that the political and regulatory framework that we operate in enables companies to make the right economic decisions , and then customers will have the least possible price increases . "

Beastiary Legal In Final Fantasy XIV
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Thursday , 8th of October 2009 - 10:16 PM ]
These shots do look like Square Enix is dead serious in giving what people have come to expect from them : a visually stunning game .
Most MMOs do n't go all out on the graphics because it is hard on personal systems as well as server communications .
To have high end graphics calculations sent and compiled between the could translate to slower gameplay , more LAG , and overheating graphics cards and systems .
Catering to a diverse audience is why things are kept on the low end for graphics , but these shots of the creatures are something you would expect to be in an offline Final Fantasy game .
Just look at the Ogre and be in awe .
Hopefully the minds over at Square Enix have figured out how to efficiently do all of this so that our PS3s and PCs will be able to run the game at full settings without worry .
I really want to see these things animated in these resolutions and definitions .
Morbols beware of this FF fan .
Here are the first ten creatures they have added to the website .
I 'd expect to see more in the not to far off future , as is the Squenix way .
Enjoy .
The United States Supreme Court granted a request Tuesday to delay its decision on whether the Obama administration may continue to block the release of images depicting the torture of terror war detainees in U.S. custody .
The decision to delay comes as Congress and the Obama administration appear to have agreed on the passage of a new law that would delegate all authority over the photos to the Secretary of Defense , effectively removing the courts from the process .

“ The Obama administration believes giving the imminent grant of authority over the release of such pictures to the defense secretary would short - circuit a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union under the Freedom of Information Act , ” the Associated Press reported on Saturday .
“ The ACLU said the administration ’s about - face ‘ makes a mockery ’ of Obama ’s campaign promise of greater transparency and accountability , and damages efforts to hold accountable those responsible for abusing prisoners , ” CNN added on Tuesday .
The photos relate to abuse alleged to have taken place between 2001 and 2005 in Abu Ghraib and six other prisons .
Some of the photos were said to depict rape and sexual abuse , though the Pentagon has denied this .
Some of the images depict U.S. soldiers pointing guns at the heads of prisoners .
Another , according to Solicitor General Elena Kagan , shows a soldier “ holding ‘ a broom as if sticking its end into the rectum of a restrained detainee , ’ Kagan said , quoting from an investigation report prepared by the Pentagon , ” AP reported .
Justices were expected to discuss the case during a closed - door session on Friday , but a letter from the solicitor general may have played a role in their decision to delay that hearing .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Kagan ’s letter advised the court about Congress ’ ‘ recent and significant legislative developments , ' ” Fox News noted .
“ Her request was unusual in that she asked the justices to delay consideration of the government ’s own case .
But the letter shows the Obama administration ’s top priority is keeping the pictures sealed – and that it believes that can be better accomplished by legislative means than court action . ”
The Pentagon said US military commanders had sternly warned the president that the photos could be used as a recruiting tool by extremists and jeopardize the safety of US troops .
Federal courts have ruled against the government in a series of decisions on the matter after the ACLU sued to force disclosure .
“ Congress should not give the government the authority to hide evidence of its own misconduct , and if it does grant that authority , the Secretary of Defense should not invoke it , ” ACLU National Security Project Director Jameel Jaffer said in a press release .
“ If this shameful provision passes , Secretary Gates should take into account the importance of transparency to the democratic process , the extraordinary importance of these photos to the ongoing debate about the treatment of prisoners , and the likelihood that the suppression of these photos will ultimately be far more damaging to our national security than their disclosure would be . ”

“ The publication of these photos would not add any additional benefits to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals , ” President Obama said in May after reversing his promise to have the images released .
Here ’s a twist :
How many lightbulbs does it take to change a person ?
For Ulf Erdmann Ziegler , the answer is 3,000 .
That ’s how many bulbs are squirreled away in his modest apartment here in Frankfurt , the number that turned an otherwise ordinary guy into a hoarder , made him the object of his neighbors ’ pity and got him thinking about death and divorce .
His enormous stockpile is the fruit of a frenzied summer shopping spree .
For weeks , he spent many of his waking hours on the phone and online tracking down vendors and snapping up enough incandescent bulbs to last him the rest of his life .
The buying binge was necessary , he said , to beat a ban by the European Union .
As of Sept. 1 , the manufacture and import of 100 - watt incandescent bulbs have been outlawed within the EU , to be followed by their dimmer brethren in coming years .
Once current stocks are gone , such bulbs will join Thomas Edison in the history books .

“ It will run out , ” Ziegler warned of the limited supply , “ and everyone will be sorry . ”
The ban is part of the EU ’s effort to retard global warming .
The object is to encourage people to switch from traditional energy - wasting incandescent bulbs to compact fluorescent lamps , which last longer and are up to 75 % more efficient .
For EU officials , it ’s all about the math .
Ditching old - fashioned bulbs , they say , will save nearly 40 billion kilowatt - hours a year by 2020 , equivalent to the output of 10 power stations .
Australia has already abandoned incandescent bulbs , and the United States is set to begin phasing them out in the next few years as well .
But not everyone considers it such a bright idea .
The ban has been met with some resistance in Europe , showing what happens when the collective goal of greening the planet clashes with issues of individual choice and even aesthetics .

Dissenters such as Ziegler have sprung up across the continent , people who complain that fluorescent lamps are inferior , more expensive and come with their own environmental problems .
Art galleries fret over how best to display their works without the warm glow cast by incandescent bulbs .
A petition to save the conventional bulb is circulating on the Internet .
There have also been reports of runs on lighting stores .
In Britain , where major retailers began taking 100 - watt incandescent bulbs off their shelves even earlier , in January , a retired teacher in southern England spent $ 800 of her pension to buy 1,000 of them .
“ There ’s been quite a bit of consumer backlash , ” acknowledged Peter Hunt , chief executive of Britain ’s Lighting Assn .
“ A lot of it we expected . ”
To help consumers and manufacturers get used to the change , the EU decided not to ax all incandescent bulbs at once .
Last month ’s ban covers 100 - watt clear bulbs and all frosted ones .
Clear 40 - and 60 - watt incandescents are to be eased out by September 2012 .
Advertisement
The advantages of the ban outweigh any deficiencies , EU officials say .
Good - quality fluorescent bulbs can last years , many times the life span of regular bulbs , so although they cost more , they are more economical in the long run .
The new lamps also cut electricity bills because of their more efficient use of energy .
In conventional bulbs , most of the energy is lost as heat rather than converted to light .
“ You can . . . look at it the same way that you ’re looking at improvements of washing machines and fridges , where consumers do n’t even notice that the fridges [ have ] become more efficient , ” said Andras Toth , a policy officer in the EU ’s energy directorate .
Maybe .
But then how to explain that low - energy fluorescent lamps have been around for 25 years but have never caught on with consumers ?
Though he supports the switch - over , Hunt acknowledges that there were good reasons why fluorescent bulbs were passed over on store shelves .
Advertisement
“ The early ones were the size of large jam jars , they flickered , they had a cold blue light and they took a long time to switch on , ” he said .
“ So it ’s not surprising that consumers have a bad preconception of this lighting . ”
The technology has improved considerably on all those counts , Hunt said .
But fluorescent bulbs have n’t shaken their bad rap .
Their start - up time still lags well behind the instant on - and - off of incandescent bulbs .
They can not be used with dimmer switches .
And the most commonly available ones still do not provide the same spectrum of light as the old lamps , which worries art collectors , photographers and others who need light sources that offer sharp color rendition .
( Officials point out that halogen bulbs , which give off light of a similar quality to incandescent varieties , remain on the market . )
Then there is the fluorescent bulbs ’ mercury content , up to 5 milligrams per bulb .
Cleaning up a shattered bulb requires more than just sweeping up jagged shards :
Users should ventilate the room and avoid touching pieces with bare skin .
Advertisement
Still , “ if you compare it to other mercury content , like dental fillings , the amount we ’re talking about is really rather small , ” Toth said .
“ And you have to be extremely unlucky to be exposed to it in a dangerous way . ”
None of that cuts any ice with Ziegler .
A writer and former art critic , he sees the EU ’s ban as unnecessarily extreme .
Why not slap a tax on the old - fashioned bulbs , rather than outlaw them entirely ?
“ The law just says you ca n’t use the best lightbulb ever invented , ” he grumbled .
Advertisement
A few months ago , with the Sept. 1 deadline looming like a neon sign , he decided to take preemptive action .
With typical German precision , he went through every room of his apartment with a floor plan in hand , marking an X wherever there was a light fixture -- about 25 in all -- and noting what kind of bulb it required .
Then he took the checklist to his local vendor , who worked out how many bulbs Ziegler would need for the next decade .
“ I said forget 10 years , ” Ziegler recalled .
“ I want a lifetime supply . ”
That , though , posed an unanticipated question .
At 50 , he suddenly had to ponder -- or guess -- how much longer he expected to live .
He drafted his wife into his existential contemplations , and together , like actuaries , they finally decided that a lifetime supply meant enough bulbs to last 30 years .
Advertisement
Laying his hands on 3,000 incandescent bulbs was another story .
He cleaned out one supplier and went on to the next , seeking them out on the Internet .
Bulky packages kept arriving at the apartment , and “ I was not unaware of the pitying looks of my neighbors , ” he confessed in a newspaper column .
Thankfully , his wife supported his panic buying , because she “ hates [ fluorescent bulbs ] even more than I do , ” Ziegler said .
But that sparked yet another uncomfortable discussion .
Who gets custody of the hoard in case of divorce ?
( Stay tuned . )
For now , the incandescent cache is carefully stowed away in the attic , to which Ziegler disappears to extract an unusually shaped bulb to show a visitor the way a wine lover might disappear down the cellar to produce a prized bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild .
Advertisement
Ziegler still hopes the EU ban will somehow fail , or be repealed .
He ’s mulling the idea of writing a political manifesto on behalf of the incandescent bulb , laying out its history and its merits .
And he urges people to build their own stockpiles as soon as they can , before supplies dry up .
“ If you want to get in on it , get in , ” he said .
“ It ’s not too late . ”

JERUSALEM --
The United Nations Human Rights Council endorsed a report that alleges possible war crimes by both Israel and Hamas during the December - January Gaza War , despite a last - minute diplomatic push by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
The report , by South African jurist Richard Goldstone , calls for both sides to conduct investigations of allegations or face referral to war - crimes tribunals .
Such an outcome is highly unlikely , however , since any final U.N. stamp of approval for such a move would have to be made ...

Two massive blasts shook central Baghdad on Sunday , killing at least 136 people and wounding 500 , and destroying three government ministry buildings , according to the Times of London ’s Oliver August reporting from Baghdad .
It was the most destructive attack of 2009 .
August notes that the likely perpetrators were either Baathists from the old regime or Sunni Muslim extremists , both of whom want to stop a new , Shiite - and Kurdish - dominated status quo from settling upon Iraq .
AFP Arabic service says that the first car exploded at 10 am Baghdad time at a crowded intersection near the ministry of justice and the ministry of municipalities .
The second was detonated ten minutes later on Salihiya St. in front of the Baghdad Province administrative office .
Many dead bodies are suspected of still being beneath the rubble of the ministries of justice and public works buildings , which collapsed on the employees .
The ministries were protected by blast walls and the truck bombs could not get that close , but the explosives used were so ungodly powerful that they swept the blast walls away .
I have no pretensions to forensics expertise , but that sounds like a clue to me ; where are the guerrillas getting such remarkable high explosives ?
Aljazeera English has video :
The particular ministries that were struck may be significant , since Iraq operates on a spoils system and ministries tend to be dominated by political parties and ethnic groups .
The Minister of Public Works is Riyadh Gharib , a prominent member of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , which is close to the clerics in Tehran .
Public
Works as a ministry would thus have a lot of ISCI party members as employees and it is also a huge source of political patronage .
Baathists or Sunni extremists would have every reason to hit it .
The Ministry of Justice had been less politicized , but from 2007 was in the control of the Shiite United Iraqi Alliance .
The Minister of Justice from last February is Judge Dara Nur al - Din , an independent Kurd .
He had been a member of the Interim Governing Council under Paul Bremer , for which some groups in Iraq may not have forgiven him .
The ministry of justice also oversees court cases and executions , including of prominent Baathists , executions that Nur al - Din has defended , and which have angered the anti-government guerrillas .
As for the Baghdad Provincial government ( it is both a province and a city ) , it has been dominated since the January , 2009 , provincial elections by the State of Law coalition of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , the leading element of which is the Shiite Islamic Mission Party ( Da’wa ) .
So if the guerrillas who set these bombs were trying to kill party cadres attached to ministries , you ’d have to conclude they were trying to kill those of the ruling Shiite religious parties , and also to take revenge on the new regime for the Ministry of Justice ’s executions of Baathists and Sunnis .
The attacks inevitably had implications for the January , 2010 , parliamentary elections , insofar as they make Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki and his ascendant Islamic Mission Party look incompetent in providing security .
Since al - Maliki has done a fair job of restoring security to cities such as Basra , this success is a campaign talking point for him , which the guerrillas are attempting to deflect .
There are two dangers here .
One is that US hawks will make such attacks a pretext for delaying US troop withdrawal .
These sorts of attacks happened all the time when the US troops were patrolling Baghdad , and they only ever were stopped by extreme measures that were impractical for the long run , such as walling off whole neighborhoods and producing 80 percent unemployment .
The second is that Nuri al - Maliki will attempt to deflect any blame for the blasts onto Syria , which he views as harboring Baathist elements who plan these attacks out .
Shaky revolutionary regimes like that of Baghdad often go to war to shore themselves up , and Iraq - Syria border clashes are not impossible .
The US Republican Party ’s avaricious and illegal war on Iraq destabilized the eastern Mediterranean , perhaps for decades , creating long - term challenges to US and global security of which the Baghdad blasts are very possibly only minor omens .

The Joan Trossman Bien Miller - McCune Interview with the Department of Toxic Substances Control – July 13 , 2009
( Bien conducted this interview as part of our co-bylined August 24 , 2009 Miller - McCune article “ 50 Years After America ’s Worst Nuclear Meltdown – Human error helped worsen a nuclear meltdown just outside Los Angeles , and now human inertia has stymied the radioactive cleanup for half a century . ” )
Norman E. Riley was the Santa Susana Field Laboratory ( SSFL ) Project Manager for two years ending August 19 , 2009 as EnviroReporter.com reported in “ Coup de Goo . ” Riley was replaced on the project by 25 - year Department of Toxic Substances Control ( DTSC ) veteran Rick Brausch , best known previously as the agency ’s policy and legislative director .
In this interview , Riley says that he considers the legislation to cleanup SSFL , State Senate Bill 990 , to be a “ hindrance ” and “ unnecessarily restrictive . ”
Riley also laid out Boeing ’s possible plan to sue the State over SB - 990 and dropped this bombshell : “ If we are not able to reach an agreement with them [ Boeing ] for the land pursuant to 990 standards , then there will be litigation . ”
Joan Trossman Bien :
Why has the cleanup of the lab taken so long ?
Norm Riley :
The reason the cleanup has been taking so long is that things have to be done in a stepwise fashion .
One has to begin with a characterization of the site .
In other words , an investigative effort to make sure of the nature and extent of contamination is fully understood .
And that process is not yet completed .
We are still in the middle of that site characterization effort .
It ’s a large site , it ’s a complicated site .
And we expect to be finished with the characterization work in 2012 .
We do n’t yet know what it will entail because we do n’t yet know the full extent of the contamination because the investigation has not been completed .
I think it ’s a reasonably good bet that there will be significant excavation that occurs .
Which is to say that contaminated soils will be scooped up and placed into a truck and carried away from the site to a proper disposal facility .
It is also possible that there may be other technology applied .
For example , with respect to certain kinds of organic contaminants in the soil , a bio-remediation is a possibility .
With respect to the contaminated ground water , there are a variety of things that might be done .
That might include some sort of pumping and treating of the contaminated groundwater , sort of assisted oxidation , perhaps some sort of bioremediation , we do n’t know yet .
And we wo n’t know until technologies with potential applications are tested to make sure that they ’re effective .
This is roughly 3000 acres of extremely complicated geology , highly fractured bedrock on top of a mountain in an arid environment .
There have certainly been larger facilities that have been cleaned up , Rocky Flats , for example , is a substantially larger site in Colorado .
I know of no other site in California as large and as complicated as this one , however .
There was the 2005 Topanga Canyon fire .
There yet may be other fires .
There was one last year that came pretty close to the facility that required people living nearby to evacuate their homes .
Yes , it is an area that is prone to fire .
If there were fire , it might complicate the investigative effort but depending on what we are doing there and what burns it may or may not hinder clean up activities .
Let me give you an example .
The last time fire swept across the Santa Susana facility , it burned a lot of water line , PVC pipe .
That sort of thing is disruptive and I ’m sure it could happen again .
And if our clean up activities were dependent on the use of such hardware that we would have a problem , and I suppose it is possible , though it seems less likely to me , that an earthquake could be similarly disruptive .
Though I rather doubt that an earthquake would have any significant effect on the contamination problems up there .
Fire may well because fire will change the chemical composition , it will alter chemically on constituents that are at or near the surface and it would add to constituents .
Dioxins , for example are a common combustion product which happen to be dangerous compounds .
But an earthquake does n’t do that .
The biggest single problem that we face right now …well , it ’s certainly not financial because the entities that we are dealing with have the financial means to clean the site up .
There are certainly some technical challenges .
The ground water system there is very complex .
Fractured bedrock , for example .
And it greatly complicates the problem of removing contaminants that are held within the fractured matrixes .
And certainly there are political situations which complicate this project .
But I do n’t think any of the problems that I have touched upon are insurmountable .
I think with time we will be able to solve all those problems and we will get this site cleaned up .
I think that if everything goes according to plan , 2017 is a realistic date but it wo n’t take much to cause that date to slip .
Being able to hit 2017 means being able to adhere to a schedule that is already pretty tight .
If something unforeseen were to happen like a failure on the part of the responsible parties to complete some aspect of the work or a failure of the state to complete its review because you lose staff and things like that were to occur it would jeopardize the 2017 schedule and cause the schedule to slip .
But at this point , I still think that despite the enormous difficulties we confront , I still think that 2017 is a realistic target date .
As for the state ’s financial situation , it has already affected it .
People that work for me and myself are furloughed three days a month .
We confront the possibility of a fourth day .
So that ’s three days a month that we are not working on this project .
And it may be potentially four days a month that we are not working on this project .
That means no one is reviewing the data .
No one is out inspecting activities that are going on at the site .
Absolutely , the current financial situation has an impact on the whole project .
The stimulus funding has materialized for the DOE [ Department of Energy ] .
DOE has put down about $ 40 million of stimulus money to complete the characterization of the former nuclear area , Area IV .
There ’s going to be a radiological survey performed by EPA paid for by DOE using stimulus dollars .
But there are no other stimulus dollars forthcoming .
There ’s no stimulus money coming to DTSC , for example , which would somehow enable us to overcome more easily the challenges we face .
There is no stimulus money coming to NASA that I know anything about .
There certainly none going to Boeing .
I do n’t agree with the concerns that this move by NASA to declare its property as excess somehow signals their intent to walk away from their clean up obligation .
NASA fully intends to clean up the site .
It is [ going ] through this excess property procedure because it is required to do so by regulation .
It no longer needs that land for mission purposes .
We decided , we being the people in the United States of America , we decided to end the shuttle program .
That ended NASA ’s need for that particular property .
So it is required by federal law to notify members of Congress and others that it no longer needs the land for mission purposes and therefore the land is called excess and the federal government then steps through procedures to dispose of the property .
But none of that says NASA is going to walk away from the clean up .
So I believe that concerns in that direction are exaggerated .
Has SB - 990 been helpful in moving the clean up forward ?
No .
Has it been a hindrance ?
Yes .
That is because the entities responsible for meeting those standards have resisted of those standards which they consider to be unreasonable .
I think that the standards are unnecessarily restrictive .
We ’re talking about …
It says clean up the site to an agricultural standard .
Agricultural !
When that is done , and we certainly will enforce the law because that is our job , I ’m not suggesting that we ’re not going to uphold SB - 990 and I will be very disturbed if your article says otherwise , we will enforce SB - 990 .
But here ’s a fact : when this clean up is done , this is going to be the cleanest land in Southern California .
You can go to any other farmland , farmland , in this state today , and it will not meet SB - 990 standards .
That ’s because of all the chemicals that are on it , exactly .
And its farmland and you and me and our kids and everybody else are perfectly happy to eat the fruits and vegetables that come off that land .
This dirt that will be excavated from Santa Susana in order to meet the agricultural standard , will be in some cases , good enough , clean enough to be used a clean fill material at other sites .
It ’s not that contaminated .
And , finally , and this is very important for you to understand , clean ups are normally geared to reasonably foreseeable land use .
You clean up depending on what you intend to do with the land .
If you know the land is going to be used for industrial purposes , then you clean up to a standard consistent with that foreseen land use .
Here , the reasonably foreseeable land use is open space parkland .
Not residential .
This is going to be park land .
No one is ever going to build a house up here .
It ’s going to be open space .
So we are talking about a requirement for a clean up that is orders of magnitude more stringent than is necessary for the open spaces scenario .
And therefore , very expensive to complete .
And that is why the parties responsible for the clean up have resisted 990 and that is why I say that 990 has not helped speed up the clean up .
Have I tied this together for you adequately ?
Do you understand what I ’m telling you ?
There was an agreement [ to not develop the land as residential ] , but it failed .
But we continue to have assurances from the Boeing Company and from NASA that that is what they would like to see happen to this property .
They are not interested in seeing this property developed for residential use .
They do n’t want to see it developed for industrial use .
They want this to be open space .
And Boeing , which owns the vast majority of the land , can certainly make that happen .
Boeing intends to give the property to the State after it is clean up .
It will be state land and it will be a park , open space , wildlife preserve , and it will be very clean .
It is important that you get it right .
Please understand , I have not said that we think 990 is unconstitutional , I said that we intend to enforce 990 .
You asked me if I felt 990 has helped speed up the clean up and I said no , it has n’t because there has been resistance to 990 by the responsible parties who have even talked about the possibility of litigating .
If we are not able to reach an agreement with them [ Boeing ] for the land pursuant to 990 standards , then there will be litigation .
I would imagine it would get started almost immediately because there is a statute of limitations that runs out at the end of this year .
If they are going to file a claim concerning constitutionality of the measure .
they have to do it in within two years of it going into effect January 1 , 2008 .
That means they have got to certainly get it started before January 1 , 2010 , and might actually be tied to the date it was signed into law by the Governor , which is something like October 17 , 2007 , which would be October 17 , 2009 .
There ’s a 2 year window and we are fast approaching that limit so if there is going to be litigation ; it would have to get started soon .
Boeing is not a company without means .
They have some very good lawyers .
Boeing does not want to litigate because it is a waste of time and money .
Boeing is not one to litigate .
What Boeing wants to do is clean this site up and they want to clean it up to 990 standards even though they are not happy about it and do n’t think it is necessary .
They want to clean it up to 990 standards but they want to make sure that in doing so that they are treated reasonably .
There are various ways that one can interpret provisions of 990 and they want the law to be interpreted reasonably , not unreasonably .
They do not want , we do n’t want them to end up in a situation where they end up excavating a million or two million cubic yards of dirt because people in command of the situation decide that it has to be interpreted in some particularly stringent way .
Do you have any idea what an excavation of a million cubic yards of dirt would entail ?
Let me tell you .
First , it would take about 20 years .
That ’s twenty years of trucks flying up and down the roads every day .
Second of all , it would be an ecological catastrophe because it would moonscape the mountain and I do n’t think any of us wants to denude the mountain .
And who has the final say in the interpretation ?
DTSC .
That is my department .
DTSC has the final say in the matter but this is a political project .
So there are political forces at play .
There are people with political influence who have some say in the matter , too .
This is a highly politicized project and let ’s just say that we work very hard here at DTSC that members of the public are kept informed about what we are doing .
We do our best to meet on a regular basis with members of the public to answer their questions .
There are some questions that we will never be able to answer .
And there are some people who will never be satisfied with the fact that there are certain questions that ca n’t be answered .
So they will never be happy no matter what we do , no matter how hard we try , they will never be happy .
I ’ve been working on this project since early 2007 .
In one respect , yes , this is the most difficult project I have ever tackled .
Look , this is a difficult project technically .
But that is not what makes this project the most challenging that I ’ve ever tackled .
What makes this project the most challenging that I ’ve ever tackled is the emotional side of it .
It ’s the preconceived notions that people bring to every meeting , to every discussion that make this one of the most difficult projects that I ’ve been involved with in the course of my career .
People think that their ailments are caused by exposure to the elements from the mountain .
And they ’re afraid .
But the science does n’t support that .
The meltdown was fifty years ago .
They want me to tell them their cancers are caused by Boeing .
We ca n’t do that .
No , I do n’t think there will be an answer to that question .
Not ever .
The survey will not answer any of those questions .
Absolutely not .
Definitively not .
All the survey will tell us if it is contaminated and , if so , to what extent .
What are the constituents that are contaminating the surveyed property ?
Where are they , how wide , how deep , how far ?
Whether they are responsible for someone ’s bladder cancer who lives two miles away or who worked at the property back in the 1950s or 60s , we ca n’t say that .
I ’m not saying we ca n’t say it because we do n’t want to say it .
There ’s no way to prove that .
There are so many other things that could cause the kinds of cancers that people unfortunately have .
And we all know what those factors are .
There are lifestyle issues , there ’s smoking , there ’s diet , there ’s genetic predisposition , there are certainly environmental exposures that could be responsible .
But who ’s to say that the exposure that caused somebody ’s cancer came from Santa Susana as opposed to some other location .
Could be the gas station , or wherever you lived before you moved to West Hills , who knows ?
Just the fact that you live in an urban setting increases your risk of cancer above that which a person who lives in a rural setting because there are more pollutants in the air in an urban environment than there are in a rural setting .
NIEUWS
WE KUNNEN DÓÓR !
september 2020 – Goed nieuws voor Hotel Modern én voor collega - instellingen als Orkater , Productiehuis Zeelandia , Vis à Vis , Peergroup , Dood Paard en Urland .
Het kabinet maakt 15 miljoen euro vrij voor het Fonds Podiumkunsten ( FPK ) .
Dit bedrag is nodig voor de instellingen die in augustus van het FPK een positief advies kregen , maar waarvoor niet genoeg geld beschikbaar was .
In totaal 71 instellingen kwamen onder de zaaglijn terecht en krijgen nu dus alsnog subsidie .
De extra middelen komen na stevige lobby vanuit de cultuursector .
POSITIEVE BEOORDELING , GEEN SUBSIDIE
augustus 2020 – Een grote klap voor ons : ondanks een goede beoordeling en een positief advies toch geen structurele subsidie van het Fonds Podiumkunsten .
We zijn geschokt en verdrietig , maar ook strijdlustig .
De Adviescommissie noemt Hotel Modern uniek in haar uitstraling en werkwijze , en spreekt van solide en virtuoos vakmanschap .
Ook onze voortrekkersrol op het gebied van live animatietheater , zowel nationaal als internationaal , wordt geroemd .
Wij staan nu bij de 71 instellingen die onder de ‘ zaaglijn ’ terechtkwamen : wel een positief advies , maar er is geen geld meer .
Bijna alle gezelschappen die met poppenspel werken dreigen te verdwijnen .
Een onvoorstelbaar verlies voor het beeldende theater – dat kunnen we niet laten gebeuren .
We beraden ons op actie … en houden jullie op de hoogte .
VOORSTELLINGEN AFGELAST VANWEGE COVID-19
maart 2020 – Vanwege de Corona epidemie heeft Hotel Modern op last van de regering de voorstellingen van Ons Wereldrijk en Kamp moeten afgelasten .
Kaartkopers krijgen bericht van de theaters .
Samen met hen denken we na over extra speelbeurten om u de gelegenheid te geven alsnog de voorstellingen te kunnen zien .
Op de websites van onze tourneetheaters vindt u meer informatie en wij houden u op de hoogte via deze plek op onze website .
Blijf gezond , zorg voor elkaar , en we hopen u weer te zien in het theater .

Dit zijn wij ! ’ ” ( Leeuwarder Courant )
Lees hier een interview over de voorstelling op de site van Theater Rotterdam .
Luister hier het gesprek terug met Herman Helle in het programma Nooit meer slapen op Radio 1 .
Hij was ook te gast bij het VPRO programma OVT op Radio 1 .
HOTEL MODERN ONTVANGT OEUVREPRIJS
september 2019 – Met trots melden we dat Hotel Modern de Oeuvreprijs voor Poppenspel is toegekend : de Wim Meilinkprijs .
De feestelijke uitreiking vond plaats in september 2019 .
Uit het juryrapport ( fragment ) :
“ Herman Helle , Arlène Hoornweg en Pauline Kalker van Hotel Modern hebben in 20 jaar een oeuvre opgebouwd van memorabele miniatuurvoorstellingen die ingrijpende verhalen invoelbaar maken .
Hotel Modern is beroemd geworden met een eigenwijs , luchtig en tegelijkertijd diepzinnig spel met spullen , filmbeeld en illusie .
De spelers maken live animatiefilms op het toneel .
Het publiek ziet de filmbeelden op een scherm , maar het ziet ook de makers , terwijl zij de scènes zorgvuldig opbouwen en camera ’s door de decortjes bewegen .
Legendarisch zijn De Grote Oorlog en Kamp , waarin de gruwelen van de eerste en de tweede wereldoorlog worden verbeeld met een vingercamera in een miniwereld met poppetjes van ijzerdraad , stof en klei .
Ook memorabel is de skyline van koelkasten uit Heden Stad of de mensheid verbeeld als garnalen in Garnalen Verhalen .
Hotel Modern vertaalt de grote mensenwereld in het kleine alledaagse .
Onze diepste angsten en verlangens worden teruggebracht naar de hanteerbaarheid van een houtje en een touwtje .

Sayed Pervez Kambaksh , the student sentenced to death in Afghanistan for trying to promote women 's rights , has been freed from prison .
The Independent has learned that he is now living outside the country after being secretly pardoned by President Karzai .
The fate of the 24 - year - old trainee journalist became an international cause célèbre after his plight was revealed by this newspaper .
A petition to secure justice gathered more than 100,000 signatures and the Afghan government came under intense pressure from the international community to release him .
Mr Kambaksh was moved from his cell in Kabul 's main prison a fortnight ago and kept at a secure location for a few days before being flown out of the country .
Prior to his departure , he spoke of how his relief was mixed with deep regret at knowing he was unlikely to see his family or country again .

Only a handful of people were aware of the intensive diplomatic negotiations which took place behind the scenes to get Mr Kambaksh out of jail , details of which cannot be revealed to protect those , Afghans and foreigners , who were involved .
Hardline Islamists , including a number of political figures close to the government of President Karzai , have repeatedly called for Mr Kambaksh 's execution and were fiercely critical when an appeal court reduced the original death sentence to 20 years ' imprisonment .
One senior diplomatic source said : " The danger is very real and we are well aware that there will be a reaction when it becomes clear that Pervez had gone .
It was imperative he was safely out of the way before attempts could be made to block that . "
The Afghan president has been repeatedly told that the continuing incarceration of the trainee journalist damaged the credibility of his already - tarnished administration .
His release however , comes at a particularly volatile time in Afghanistan with bitter recriminations and threats of violence following a disputed election .
The Kambaksh case has highlighted how human rights gains have been eroded since the fall of the Taliban eight years ago .
Although Mr Kambaksh has found refuge thousands of miles away , he will have to live the rest of his life in fear of retribution .
According to senior officials Mr Karzai has been well aware of how Mr Kambaksh 's case was reinforcing the negative image of his country abroad but also had to be mindful of not being seen to be bowing to Western pressure .
Now his role in rectifying something which was widely seen as a miscarriage of justice will be lauded by the West , human rights groups and progressive opinion in Afghanistan .
But he will face opposition from religious conservatives , which may prove electorally costly if there is a second - round run off at the polls .
Mr Kambaksh was originally arrested in October 2007 after some students and staff at his university in Mazar - i- Sharif in the north of the country accused him of disseminating material on women 's rights which " insulted Islam " .
He was charged with blasphemy and sentenced to death at a trial three months later .
He told The Independent from his cell in Balkh prison that a " confession " had been beaten out of him and he had not been allowed legal representation or allowed to speak during the four - minute hearing behind closed doors .
However , international pressure continued behind closed doors , and the student was moved to a jail in Kabul to appeal against his conviction .
The case against him appeared to be crumbling with a number of prosecution witnesses withdrawing their testimony .
Another plank of the case , that he had written part of the downloaded internet report himself , appeared to collapse after The Independent tracked down the real author , an Iranian émigré woman living in Europe .
In October last year Afghanistan 's supreme court set aside the death sentence but ruled he must serve at least 20 years in prison .
Diplomatic pressure continued behind closed doors and finally came to fruition with the signing of an " amnesty " by President Karzai .
* Gordon Brown last night announced plans for an international summit on Afghanistan ’s future .
The proposals were set out in a letter to the UN with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
Mr Brown proposed the conference afterthe Afghan election result is settled .
The summit will focus on the “ Afghanisation ” of the country , including faster training of its armed forces and police .
Britain would offer to host the meeting .
People power : The Independent 's campaign
The Independent launched its campaign to secure justice for Pervez Kambaksh the day after he was condemned to death in January 2008 .
Within 24 hours President Hamid Karzai was inundated with appeals while more than 13,500 Independent readers signed our petition .
During a debate in the House of Commons David Miliband , the Foreign Secretary , Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat leader , and William Hague , Shadow Foreign Secretary all spoke out .
Louise Arbour , the UN commissioner for Human Rights , and the Nato Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer also urged Afghanistan to reconsider the case .
On 6 February 2008 , the then -US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice intervened .
Two days later Mr Karzai said : " Justice will be done " .
By May 2008 , 100,000 people had signed the petition .
Five months later the death sentence was quashed .
A Colorado company said it created 4,231 jobs with the help of President Obama ’s economic recovery plan .
The real number : fewer than 1,000 .
A child - care center in Florida said it saved 129 jobs with the help of stimulus money .
Instead , it gave pay raises to its existing employees .
Elsewhere in the U.S. , some jobs credited to the stimulus program were counted two , three , four or even more times .
The government has overstated by thousands the number of jobs it has created or saved with federal contracts under the president ’s $ 787 - billion recovery program , according to an Associated Press review of data released in the program ’s first progress report .

The errors could be magnified Friday with the release of data expected to show the creation or preservation of hundreds of thousands of jobs .
The White House seized on an initial report from a government oversight board weeks ago that claimed federal contracts awarded to businesses under the recovery plan already had helped pay for more than 30,000 jobs .
The administration said the number showed the stimulus program had exceeded expectations toward reaching the president ’s promise of creating or saving 3.5 million jobs by the end of next year .
But the 30,000 figure is overstated , at the very least , by nearly 5,000 , based on AP ’s limited review of some of the contracts -- because some federal agencies and recipients of the money provided incorrect job counts .
The review found some counts were more than 10 times as high as the actual number of jobs ; some jobs were credited to stimulus spending when , in fact , none were produced .
There ’s no evidence the White House sought to inflate job numbers , and the White House said agencies had been working to correct mistakes and would fix any others found .

Republican congressman Mark Kirk of Illinois 10th district has made a bizarre and discriminatory comment regarding the militarys do n't ask do n't tell policy .
" I think it 's worked out well , " he said .
" Keeping that all out of the workplace makes common sense . "
So gays are now ' that ' or is he referring to all our gayness or gay sex ?
Tell congressman Kirk to keep ' that ' bigoted opinion of his out of the workplace for the American people , tell him DADT is wrong !

I ’m proceeding with the redesign of my diagrams library slowly but surely .
I do n’t have a lot of time to work on it , hence the “ slowly ” .
But progress is being made .
It ’s still very much in the design phase , which makes it difficult for others to help , but Lennart has created a diagrams page on the Haskell wiki which I hope can be a good way to have an open design process and get input from the community .
There ’s a lot of stuff I have written down that I have n’t gotten around to putting on that page yet , but I hope to do that soon .
Occasionally I plan to write some blog posts about interesting issues that arise in the design ; today is the first .
Here ’s the background : a diagram is essentially a tree of sub - diagrams ( although there will be a principled way to refer to subdiagrams in other parts of the tree ; more on this in a future post ) , with leaves corresponding to atomic primitives .
Every node in the tree can ( optionally ) have some associated style attributes , such as stroke width and color , fill color , font , and other such things .
When we encounter a primitive at a leaf , how do we know what attributes to use when rendering it ?
It may have some associated attributes , but its parent node might also have some associated attributes , and other ancestor nodes higher up the tree might have attributes as well .
What we ’d really like to do is have a Style data type which has a Monoid instance :
data Style = Style { strokeWidth :: Double , strokeColour :: Colour ... } instance Monoid Style where ...
Then to determine the style to use for a leaf , we just combine the styles of all its ancestors using the monoid .
So , how to implement this Monoid instance ?
Well , first of all , what I wrote above is slightly bogus ; at the very least each particular attribute ought to be optional , so it should look something more like this :
data Style = Style { strokeWidth :: Maybe Double , strokeColour :: Maybe Colour ... }
To combine two Style records , we match them up field - by - field , and Just trumps Nothing .
So far , so good .
But how do we combine two fields containing Just ?
It seems we have two choices : we can be biased towards the top of the tree ( i.e. parent attributes override child attributes ) or towards the bottom ( i.e. child attributes override parent attributes ) .
Indeed , Data .
Monoid contains two newtypes , First and Last , whose Monoid instances exhibit exactly this behavior .
But here ’s the problem : in this application , one of these choices is n’t obviously better than the other .
In fact , it ’s easy to imagine situations where each would be the desired behavior .
For example , imagine that we have created a subdiagram that we want to use many times throughout a larger diagram .
Most of the time it will be blue , so it makes sense to specify that attribute as part of the subdiagram itself .
However , in one place we want it to be red , so we ’d like to be able to override its attributes with parent attributes .
On the other hand , imagine a situation where a diagram is going to be composed of many different subdiagrams , which all share the property that they are blue .
To avoid repeating ourselves , it makes sense to specify “ blueness ” as an attribute of the parent diagram and have all the subdiagrams inherit it .
However , one subdiagram should be red , so we ’d like to be able to override the parent attribute in this particular child .
What to do ?
A first cut might look something like this :
data Override a = Default | OverrideUp a | OverrideDown a data Style = Style { strokeWidth :: Override Double , strokeColour :: Override Colour ... }
The intention is that OverrideUp a overrides any attributes above / before it , and OverrideDown a overrides any attributes below / after it .
However , there ’s a problem : what should
( OverrideDown a ) `mappend` ( OverrideUp b )
be ?
The OverrideDown a claims to override the OverrideUp b … and vice versa !
So this does n’t really work .
We need a way to specify relative priorities .
So , another solution would just be to assign each attribute with a priority :
data Prioritized a = Default | Priority Double a data Style = Style { strokeWidth :: Prioritized Double , strokeColour :: Prioritized Colour ... }
For the Monoid instance , we just take the value with maximum priority .
This allows us to do what we wanted — overriding parent or child attributes is done simply by assigning a higher priority .
However , I really dislike this solution .
Having to specify a priority is annoying — but not only that , figuring out what priority to use to achieve your desired effect requires global knowledge about the value of the priorities used elsewhere .
One improvement we could make is to adopt the solution used by CSS : attributes are leaf - biased by default , but assigning a priority can override this .
That is ,
data Prioritized a = Default | Priority ( Maybe Double ) a
where the Monoid instance chooses the value with the highest priority , or the right / leaf - most value if no priorities are specified .
This might be the best option — but it ’s still somewhat unsatisfactory .
I wonder about a solution that allows you to say , “ I want to override the attribute on THAT node ” — where “ THAT ” represents some way to refer to a particular node by name ( what these names look like will be the subject of another post ) .
This might solve the problem of arbitrariness with the numerical priorities , but might also be veering into the realm of the overengineered …
Do n't like diet pop ?
Too bad .
High school students with a sweet tooth will be out of luck if Toronto school trustees adopt a proposal tonight for aspartame - only soft drinks to be sold in high school vending machines as early as this fall .
The switch to aspartame is being introduced by Refreshments Canada , an industry - sponsored organization that includes Pepsi and Coca - Cola , companies that are bidding for vending machine contracts with the schools .
And that is precisely the problem , say members of a Toronto District School Board committee who will discuss whether to allow only aspartame - sweetened soft drinks in vending machines , or get rid of vending machines altogether .
The administration , finance and accountability committee is looking at extending the current contract with Pepsi for a year to buy time to investigate other options .
The move to stock all vending machines in Toronto high schools with low - calorie alternatives is the last phase of the multi-stage Guidelines for School Partnership , a voluntary guideline created by Refreshments Canada to provide schools with healthier beverage options .
But it is also a move that Sheila Cary - Meagher , a trustee for Ward 16 and a committee member , says is forcing the board to decide between " a bunch of bad choices . "
Meagher says there is too much uncertainty about the long - term effects of aspartame to allow it to be the only option available to students .
Aspartame is an artificial sweetener 180 times sweeter than sugar , but without the calories .
Introduced in the United States in 1974 , aspartame has been permitted as a food additive in Canada since 1981 , and according to Health Canada is safe for human consumption .
But the proposal to be debated cites concerns about " its potential health impacts . "
" With the long - term safety of aspartame uncertain , permitting products that contain it as the only carbonated soda option available in vending machines in secondary schools could knowingly put student health at risk , " according to a staff report .
Aspartame - only soda also limits student choice , said Areez Dhalwani , a student trustee .
" Students should have the option of what they want to drink , " he said .
The removal of vending machines altogether is an unlikely option for the cash - strapped board , which could lose an estimated half a million dollars a year if the machines are removed , the report says .
Recommendations from tonight 's meeting will go to the June 24 board meeting for a final decision .
By George Will - October 18 , 2009
WASHINGTON --
As Harvard 's president , Larry Summers , economist and former Treasury secretary , was a lion in a den of Daniels .
The faculty Daniels , their tender feelings hurt by his occasional testiness , cowered together and declared him a meanie .
Facing a faculty vote of no confidence , he resigned .
Now he is Barack Obama 's principal economic adviser .
So , weary of John Boehner , leader of House Republicans , dwelling on rising unemployment , Summers sent him a letter .
In it he said , as Obama and his minions so consistently do , something that may be the text of this year 's White House Christmas card :
At least we are not George Bush , so there .
Summers said Obama " is committed to not repeating the fiscal mistakes of the last eight years . "
The letter , like its author , is trenchant and intelligent .
He notes that job creation was much better during the eight Clinton years -- an average of 225,000 per month -- than between November 2001 , the end of the last recession , and December 2007 , the beginning of this one , when the monthly average was just 94,000 .
And Summers tartly reminds Boehner that in 2003 the Republican - controlled Congress passed a new prescription drug entitlement " that was not offset by either spending cuts or tax increases " and that in its first decade will cost more than $ 1 trillion , including interest on the necessary borrowing .
But speaking of unfunded medical entitlements :
The furrowed Washington brows that currently express faux puzzlement about how the new health care entitlement -- aka " reform " -- will be paid for are theatrical .
There is no mystery .
The new entitlement will be paid for , to a significant extent , the way much of government is paid for -- by borrowing from China .
Republicans are operatic when they pretend to take seriously , in order to wax indignant about , the Democrats ' professed plan to partially pay for Sen. Max Baucus ' version of reform by cutting at least $ 400 billion from Medicare .
Supporters of the Baucus bill are guilty of many things , but not , regarding such cuts , of sincerity .
Congress regularly vows to make Medicare cuts , and as regularly defers them .
Today , Washington routinely speaks of trillions , as in :
This year 's trillion - dollar deficit .
And the $ 9 trillion in projected deficits over 10 years .
And the upward of $ 1.8 trillion that Baucus ' " $ 829 billion plan " would actually cost in the first 10 years ( 2014 - 23 ) in which its provisions would be fully operational .
But the number from which Washington flinches is 999,999,999,997 less than a trillion .
It is : 3 .
Many Democrats believe that rising unemployment means the nation needs a " second " stimulus -- but one they could call something other than a stimulus because it would be the third .
The first was passed in February 2008 , two months after the recession began .
Its $ 168 billion tax rebate failed to stimulate because overleveraged Americans perversely saved much of it .
Admitting that the first stimulus existed would complicate the task of justifying a third one , given that the second one -- the $ 787 billion extravaganza that galloped through Congress last February -- has not been the success its advocates said it would be .
The administration predicted that if Stimulus II were passed , unemployment would not go above 8.5 percent .
On CNN Feb .
9 , Summers was asked how soon Americans would " feel results , the creation of jobs . "
Summers answered , " You 'll see the effects begin almost immediately , " starting with " layoffs that otherwise would have happened . "
Summers ' formulation resembled various presidential statements , such as his goal " to create or save " 600,000 jobs in 100 days and up to 4 million jobs by 2010 , and the statement that as of June , Stimulus II had " created and saved " 150,000 jobs .
Assertions that things would be much worse if Stimulus II had not been passed cannot be refuted because they are based on bald claims about numbers of jobs " saved . "
Because those cannot be quantified , the assertions are unfalsifiable and analytically unhelpful .
They are , perhaps , helpful to the administration by blurring the awkward fact that since Stimulus II was passed , the unemployment rate has risen from 8.1 percent to 9.8 percent , and probably soon will pass 10 percent .
But one - quarter of Stimulus II will be spent this year .
Another quarter will be spent in 2011 .
Half will be spent in 2010 , an election year .
Which suggests that Stimulus II is , and Stimulus III would be , primarily designed to save a few dozen jobs -- those of Democratic members of the House and Senate .

One of the most interesting patterns that has ever been constructed in Conway ’s Game of Life is primer , a gun that fires lightweight spaceships that represent exactly the prime numbers .
It was constructed by Dean Hickerson way back in 1991 , yet arguably no pattern since then has been constructed that ’s as interesting .
It seems somewhat counter - intuitive at first that the prime numbers , which seem somehow “ random ” or “ unpredictable ” , can be generated by this ( relatively simple ) pattern in the completely deterministic Game of Life .
The gun works by firing lightweight spaceships westward , and destroying them via glider guns that emulate the Sieve of Eratosthenes .
A lightweight spaceship makes it past the left edge of the gun at generation 120N if and only if N is a prime number ( though for technical reasons , 2 and 3 are not outputted ) .
It was n’t too long after making primer that Hickerson realized that he could attach a gun to the bottom - left corner of it to turn it into a twin prime calculator by allowing each lightweight spaceship through only if another lightweight spaceship passed through 240 generations earlier .
Similarly , Jason Summers constructed a Fermat prime calculator in 2000 by shooting a glider at the lightweight spaceship stream every generation of the form 120 ( 2N + 1 ) , which ends up detecting exactly the Fermat primes .
So what other families of primes can we compute in Life by altering the output of the original prime - generating gun ?
Mersenne Primes
Mersenne primes can easily be computed using the exact same method as was used in the Fermat prime calculator — use a 7 - engine Cordership ( in blue below ) to bounce a glider back at the stream of lightweight spaceships , with the time required for the glider to reach the stream doubling each time .
An inverter ( in green below ) eliminates all lightweight spaceships that try to get past it unless it just received a glider from the Cordership .
By fiddling around with timing a tiny bit , we then have a Mersenne prime calculator :

Prime Quadruplets
Four prime numbers are said to form a prime quadruplet if they are of the form ( p , p+2 , p+6 , p+8 ) for some prime number p , which is the closest that four prime numbers can be together ( except for the degenerate cases of ( 2,3,5,7 ) and ( 3,5,7,11 ) ) .
Prime quadruplets are easy to compute because they can be thought of as consecutive pairs of twin primes .
Since we already have a twin prime calculator , we can just repeat its reaction .
The twin prime calculator works by attaching a period 240 gun ( in green below ) to the bottom - left corner of primer .
If it is timed correctly , it has the effect of allowing a lightweight spaceship through at generation 240N if and only if a lightweight spaceship tried to pass through at generation 240 ( N - 1 ) .
Thus , it will only allow a lightweight spaceship through if it represents a prime number of the form p+2 , where p is another prime number .
Well , simply attaching a period 720 gun ( in blue below ) then allows a spaceship through at generation 720N if and only if a lightweight spaceship tried to pass through at generation 720 ( N - 1 ) .
This has the effect of allowing a lightweight spaceship to pass through only if it represents a twin prime pair ( p, p+2 ) , and there is another twin prime pair of the form ( p - 6 , p - 4 ) .
That is , the only lightweight spaceships allowed through are those representing the upper members of prime quadruplets .
Java link : here
RLE file : here
Prime Pairs of the Form ( p , p+2 k )
The twin prime calculator mentioned earlier gives a way of computing prime pairs of the form ( p, p+2 ) , but what about pairs where the gap is larger than 2 ?
For example , the k=2 case gives what are known as cousin primes , and the k=3 case gives sexy primes ( yes , really ) .
For the case of cousin primes , the thing to notice is that every pair of cousin primes ( except for the first pair , ( 3,7 ) ) must be of the form ( 6n+1 , 6n+5 ) for some natural number n .
Thus , we can use two period 720 guns ( in blue below ) to allow only the upper prime in a cousin prime pair to pass through .
This is achieved by having the top gun fire at the lightweight spaceships representing primes of the form 6n+1 — if a lightweight spaceship is hit , then a block is created in the path of the other gun , which is fired at lightweight spaceships representing primes of the form 6n+5 .
If a prime was present at 6n+1 , then the lightweight spaceship makes it through unharmed at 6n+5 .
If there was no prime present at 6n+1 , then the bottom gun destroys the lightweight spaceship representing 6n+5 .
Java link : here
RLE file : here
Extending this idea to prime pairs of the form ( p, p+2k ) for k ≥ 3 is a bit more challenging , however , because it is possible for pairs to overlap .
For example , ( 37,43 ) is a sexy prime pair , as is ( 41,47 ) .
Up until now we have only been able to detect single pairs at a time , since the block that acts as our “ counter ” that keeps track of whether a prime was detected earlier is placed in the stream of incoming lightweight spaceships .
Thus , if it ’s possible for two pairs to overlap , we will get lightweight spaceships colliding with the block , causing a mess .
To get around this problem , we use a device ( known as a fanout , in green below ) that duplicates the stream of lightweight spaceships .
We then check for certain pairs on one stream , and the rest of the pairs on the other stream ( these devices are outlined in blue below ) .
Once we ’re done , we merge the resulting streams of lightweight spaceships back together ( using the devices in purple below ) .
To make this process a bit more explicit , I present a gun that computes prime pairs of the form ( p, p+8 ) .
In particular , a lightweight spaceship will make it past the left edge of this pattern at about generation 1620 + 120N if and only if both N and N+8 are prime .
Java link : here
RLE file : here
We now have all of the tools needed to build any pattern that computes prime pairs of the form ( p , p+2k ) as long as k = 1 or 2 ( mod 3 ) , though we may need to use the fanout device multiple times if it ’s possible for more than one pair to overlap .
If k = 0 ( mod 3 ) , however , it ’s much more difficult to construct the desired pattern , because not only can you have overlapping prime pairs like ( 5 , 11 ) and ( 7 , 13 ) , but you can have prime pairs in sequence such as ( 5 , 11 ) and ( 11 , 17 ) .
This problem can be remedied using the same tools as used in the ( p , p+8 ) prime calculator , though you may need to use a lot of fanout devices to make things work .
For example , computing the sexy primes using these tools would require at least four fanouts , and some clever elimination logic on each of the resulting five lightweight spaceship streams .
I do n’t feel up to that task myself , but it ’s nice to know that we have a method for constructing a sexy prime calculator .
The Epistle to the Implementors .
1 . Daniel Cristofani to those who implement the brainfuck language , greetings .
2 . The brainfuck language is among the simplest in existence , which lulls the unwary implementor to overconfidence ; for language implementation always calls for some care , and brainfuck implementation has a few wrinkles mentioned neither in the original documents of Urban Müller , nor in the excellent pages of Brian Raiter ; and some issues which are mentioned there are often ignored , or perhaps the documents are not read .
3 . The end of a line of text is represented differently on different platforms , and in different programming environments on the same platform .
ASCII specifies only that ten represents a " line feed " and thirteen a " carriage return " , so some systems use one , some the other , some both of them together .
Most brainfuck programs , including Urban Müller 's programs , use a ten alone .
For the sake of consistency , all brainfuck implementations should , as their default behavior , ensure both that brainfuck programs receive only a ten when an end - of - line is input , and that an end - of - line is output when a brainfuck program outputs a ten .
A really full - featured implementation would also provide an option to turn off any such filtration , for programs that do binary i/o.
4 . The end of input , or end - of - file ( EOF ) , is a similar but less tractable problem .
How the user conveys it depends on the environment .
More importantly , there is no consensus about what to do when executing a , command after the end of input : some implementations set the cell at the pointer to 0 ; some set it to - 1 ( or the unsigned equivalent ) ; and some leave its value unchanged .
The last of these has several advantages : brainfuck programs can easily be made to accept it as well as one of the others , simply by setting the cell to 0 or - 1 immediately before the , command ; for the input command to do nothing , when there is no input left , seems somehow cleaner and less arbitrary than to store a stipulated value ; and it is the natural behavior for tiny low - level implementations , the kind for which brainfuck was originally designed .
Still , arguments can be made for the other two behaviors as well , and a full - featured implementation should probably give all three as options .
Every implementation should at the very least do one of the three , at least on the first read after input is exhausted .
5 . Characters in brainfuck source other than the commands +,-.<>[ ] are comments , not errors ; implementations should ignore them .
Two additional hacks are somewhat sanctioned by tradition : # for " print state for debugging " and ! for " separate brainfuck code from its input " ( for brainfuck interpreters in brainfuck or other single - input - stream languages ) .
These special characters should not be multiplied unnecessarily .
6 . Extending the brainfuck language is like bolting parts to a skateboard in an attempt to build a pickup truck .
Nonetheless it is a popular activity and will probably remain so .
Some more interesting projects use brainfuck as a testbed for programming constructs .
Others remove or combine commands , sacrificing symmetry or simplicity .
At a minimum , all these efforts should be given names clearly distinct from ' brainfuck ' or any euphemism for it .
7 . The array should have at least 30,000 cells , if possible .
The pointer should start at the left end .
The > and < commands need not be equally numerous within balanced [ ] .
Output should be in a monospaced font .
Ideally , i/o should be done during execution , so interactive programs work .
Matching [ ] before execution is fastest , as are Frans Faase 's [ ] semantics .
8 . You might try programming in brainfuck , if you have n't .
Anyway , peace be with you .

Critics say that the 2009 act is an improvement over prior versions of military - commission regimes passed during the Bush administration .
But they say it is still substandard , offering a second - class system of justice designed to obtain quick convictions .
" While the new law addresses some of the defects of the military commissions , it fails to bring the tribunals in line with the Constitution and the Geneva Conventions , " said Jameel Jaffer , director of the American Civil Liberties Union 's National Security Project .
" The Obama administration has committed to closing the prison at Guantánamo , but closing the prison will have little meaning if the administration leaves in place the policies that the prison has come to represent , " he said .
With the signing of the legislation at the White House , defense officials now have 90 days to update rules and procedures for the commissions .
At least a dozen suspected Al Qaeda members and leaders – including self - proclaimed 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed – are already slated for commission trials .
The Obama administration is expected to soon announce which other detainees will also face military justice through the revised commission system .
The 2009 law retains the basic structure of the existing commissions .
A military judge presides over the trial , ruling on issues of law and evidence , and a panel of US service members decides issues of fact and guilt or innocence .
The panel can range from five members in lesser cases to at least 12 in trials involving a potential death sentence .
Under the law , the president must give his personal approval before an execution may be carried out .
The new law excludes statements obtained through torture or through cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment .
But Congress empowered the secretary of Defense to enact rules permitting admission of coerced statements and hearsay evidence .
These are departures from trial rights routinely provided to US service members in courts - martial .
Under the new law , defendants have the right to attend their entire trial and examine all evidence presented against them , to cross -examine witnesses against them , and to call their own witnesses .
Defendants may be excluded from a commission proceeding for being disruptive , but not to prevent them from being present during the presentation of classified evidence .
Military prosecutors are required under the new law to disclose the existence of any exculpatory evidence as well as any evidence that might impeach the credibility of a government witness .
The law permits appeals to the US Court of Military Commission Review , with further appeals to the federal appeals court in Washington and ultimately to the US Supreme Court .
It allows government prosecutors to file appeals before or during the trial , but it limits a defendant 's appeals until after the commission has concluded .
Congress granted the commission jurisdiction over 32 crimes .
Many of them are standard war crimes such as pillaging , denying quarter , taking hostages , torture , mutilation , and rape .
But the new law also authorizes military commissions to try individuals for conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism .
Critics say these are not war crimes .
The conspiracy and material - support charges appear designed , some say , to help the government win convictions in cases with weak evidence .
As part of the law , Congress urged Pentagon officials to make allowances for defendants to receive good legal assistance .
" The fairness and effectiveness of the military commission system ... will depend to a significant degree on the adequacy of the defense counsel and associated resources for individuals accused , particularly in the case of capital cases , " the law reads in part .
" Defense counsel in military commission cases , particularly in capital cases ... , should be fully resourced . "
Opponents of military commissions say that the federal court system in the United States is robust enough to prosecute Al Qaeda suspects .
" The Military Commissions Act of 2009 raises serious constitutional concerns , " said Virginia Sloan , president of the Constitution Project .
" Although they are an improvement from the 2006 version , the reformed commissions still fail to provide critical safeguards for the accused that are available in our traditional criminal justice system , " she said .
" This lesser degree of process is not justice . "

I 'm no warmonger , but I can think of no finer way to waste Friday afternoon than spending 10 minutes of the company 's time watching bullets striking various objects at one million frames per second .
The footage is just totally unbelievable .

To reach far beyond typical high speed photography ( keep in mind , we 're talking over 41,000 times the speed of traditional film ) , the footage was captured using dual Shimadzu HPV - 1 cameras shooting at a scant 312x260 resolution .
Regardless , the black and white tonal detail is still more than good enough to astound .

The obvious question must be asked : Why ?
What happens when newly - monied Russians design a super car ?
You get the successor to the first Russian super car , the B1 .
It 's the Marussia B2 and it's got looks to shame a Ferrari Enzo and , supposedly , a 420HP Cosworth mill .

We were n't holding out much hope for the Marussia B2 , but it 's turned out to be one of the pleasant surprises of the Frankfurt Motor Show with Enzo - like looks and supposedly a 420HP Cosworth mill .

We 're still a little foggy on the details , but it seems the Marussia B2 is built on the same frame as it's B1 predecessor but gets a specially built 3.5 liter Cosworth V6 , ranging from 245 HP to 420 HP .
Whatever the powerplant , it 's hard to argue on the looks — the thing is bad ass .
It 's got more cut lines than a knife fighter and while the forward visibility is probably pretty terrible , awesomely ridiculous is the only way we can describe it .
The loosening of relationship conventions , which is not limited to age but also includes race , religion and economic status , appears to be particularly evident among female baby boomers , sociologists say , who are faced with the tightest “ marriage squeeze ”  the smallest pool of compatible men as conventionally defined , those two to three years older , of similar background and higher levels of education and income .
The reason is that as women have delayed marriage , men still have a tendency to date and marry younger women .
In the last several years , as the loaded term cougar was popularized by the media ’s frenzied fascination with Demi Moore ’s marriage to Ashton Kutcher , 15 years her junior , and the dalliances and liaisons of other celebrities like Madonna and Katie Couric , researchers have begun to examine the older woman - younger man relationship .
It is one that has long been taboo , heavily influenced by the Freudian notion that the older women are mother substitutes or “ robbing the cradle . ”
“ For a long time we ’ve been fed this idea that women should look for a man to take care of her , a man that is more educated , has a better job and makes more money , ” said Sandra L. Caron , a professor of family relations and human sexuality at the University of Maine .
“ That might be fine and dandy if you ’re in high school and have this fairy tale Prince Charming .
But when you look at adult women , most are self - sufficient and they do n’t have to look for that . ”
Dr. Caron is an author of a 2006 study of couples in which the wife is at least 10 years older , which found surprisingly positive attitudes among the couples , although fear of stigma and insecurity about aging for the women , in particular , were common .
The study , published in the Journal of Couple and Relationship Therapy , reported that the couples thought their age difference mattered more to the outside world than to them , and that the men were more strongly drawn to the relationships at the start because of physical attraction .
Mr Blaney believes it is the first time a order has been served via Twitter The High Court has given permission for an injunction to be served via social - networking site Twitter .
The order is to be served against an unknown Twitter user who anonymously posts to the site using the same name as a right - wing political blogger .
The order demands the anonymous Twitter user reveal their identity and stop posing as Donal Blaney , who blogs at a site called Blaney 's Blarney .
The order says the Twitter user is breaching the copyright of Mr Blaney .
He told BBC News that the content being posted to Twitter in his name was " mildly objectionable " .
Mr Blaney turned to Twitter to serve the injunction rather than go through the potentially lengthy process of contacting Twitter headquarters in California and asking it to deal with the matter .
UK law states that an injunction does not have to be served in person and can be delivered by several different means including fax or e-mail .
Danvers Baillieu , a solicitor specialising in technology , said it was possible for anyone to approach the court about any method of serving an injunction if the traditional methods are unavailable .
" The rules already allow for electronic service of some documents , so that they can be sent by e-mail , and it should also be possible to use social networks , " he said .
Mr Blaney decided to use Twitter after a recent case in Australia where Facebook was used to serve a court order .
The blogger , who is also a lawyer and owns the firm serving the order , said that he thought that it was the first time Twitter had been used to deliver a court order .
The injunction - known as the Blaney 's Blarney Order - is due to be served at 1930 BST and will include a link to the text of the full court order .

Conviction for any of these crimes puts your future in doubt .
Around Syracuse , no one knows criminal defense more or fights harder than Michael Spano .
That ’s the kind of representation you need , from a highly experienced criminal trial lawyer serving Update New York .
Lush tropical rainforest once covered almost all of Indonesia 's 17,000 islands between the Indian and Pacific oceans .
And just half a century ago , 80 per cent remained .
But since then , rampant logging and burning has destroyed nearly half that cover , and made the country the world 's third largest emitter of greenhouses gases after the US and China .
Indonesia still has one - tenth of the world 's remaining rainforests , a treasure trove of rare plant and animal species , including critically endangered tigers , elephants and orang - utans .
However , it is destroying its forests faster than any other country , according to the Guinness Book of Records , with an average two million hectares disappearing every year , double the annual loss in the 1980s .
It is that frenzied rate of deforestation that has propelled Indonesia , home to 237 million people , into its top - three spot in the global league table of climate change villains .
According to a government report released last month , the destruction of forests and carbon - rich peatlands accounts for 80 per cent of the 2.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide emitted in the country annually .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The situation is partly a legacy of the 32 - year rule of the dictator Suharto , during which Indonesia 's forests were regarded purely as a source of revenue to be exploited for economic gain .
Suharto , who stepped down in 1998 , handed out logging concessions covering more than half the total forest area , many of them to his relatives and political allies .
Although the current Indonesian government , under President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , is committed to reducing deforestation and CO2 emissions , not much has changed on the ground .
Poor land management is compounded by lawlessness and corruption , and illegal logging is widespread .
According to one official estimate , the latter is responsible for the loss of 10 million hectares of forest .
Legal logging , too , is conducted at unsustainable levels , thanks to soaring demand from a rapidly expanding pulp and paper industry , in a country struggling with high levels of poverty .
The recent government report forecast that carbon emissions , which have risen from 1.6 billion tons in 1990 , will increase to 3.6 billion by 2030 , a leap of 57 per cent from today 's level .
The main reason is logging and clearing of forests for agriculture and industrial plantations , including oil palms .
The government granted permission last year for two million hectares of peatland to be cleared for oil palms .
The rapid spread of oil palm plantations , particularly on Sumatra and Borneo islands , is threatening the orang - utan 's forest habitat and hastening its extinction , according to conservationists .
Clearing land releases into the atmosphere the carbon stored in trees and below ground , either during burning or when the timber decomposes .
Forest fires – regarded as a cheap and easy way of clearing forest – are deliberately lit by farmers as well as timber and oil palm plantation owners , and occur regularly on Sumatra and Borneo during the dry season .
Indonesia supports the UN's Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation ( REDD ) initiative , welcoming the idea of being paid to conserve its forests .
However , some observers question whether the carbon credits it would receive will be priced high enough to make the scheme worthwhile .
At present , Indonesia accounts for 8 per cent of global carbon emissions , although the archipelago represents barely 1 per cent of the world 's landmass .
It still has the third largest tracts of tropical rainforest , after Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo , despite losing one - quarter of its forest cover between 1990 and 2005 .
One longstanding idea at NASA and among other space agencies for a possible future lunar base would involve an inflatable module , seen here being pressurized in this artist rendering .
Earth 's aged , crater - pocked , and bone dry - appearing moon may well sport a wet look .
That outlook is gaining momentum via a treasure - trove of new scientific measurements gleaned by an international armada of moon - orbiting scientific scouts , including a report last week that craters near the lunar poles , always in shadow , may harbor water ice .
What 's more is that such a prospect could fuel those eager to return human explorers to the moon , to establish a base camp there , and to hone talent and hardware for jumping off to other destinations .
History in the making
Locating , then mining and processing polar deposits of water ice on the moon , it is reasoned , would add up to a useful resource for future lunar inhabitants .
The idea of ice in the floors of sunlight - shy polar lunar craters was first aired in 1961 by Caltech researchers Kenneth Watson , Bruce Murray , and Harrison Brown .
And in the late 1970s , James Arnold of the University of California , San Diego , suggested that comets and water - rich asteroids crashing into the moon could deposit water to the lunar surface .
Still , is the chatter about new lines of evidence supportive of water ice at the lunar poles a slam dunk situation ?
" If ice is found we have to further explore it with landers , rovers , coring drills to assess its distribution and composition , " explained Bernard Foing , the European Space Agency ( ESA ) project scientist for the now defunct ESA SMART - 1 lunar orbiter .
He is also the director of the International Lunar Exploration working Group ( ILEWG ) .
Following that appraisal , Foing said that the next task is to organize how ice could be partly exploited on - the - spot in some areas to ease the next steps of human exploration towards an international lunar base .
Lunar natural parks
Foing also underscored the scientific merit of any ice find .
That is , the lunar ice should be left intact in some " lunar natural parks " as a precious historical record of impacting comets and water - rich asteroids that have delivered the goods to the moon .
Foing paints a view of what might be found , in terms of water ice at the poles .
" I would expect the water ice could come in thin layers separated by layers of covering protective dust layers , " he told SPACE.com .
" The ice thickness would vary with the history of bombardment of comets and water rich asteroids , but also could come in patches on the surface . "
How could water ice have stayed frozen inside shadowed craters , without sublimating into the lunar exosphere ?
According to Foing , layers at colder temperatures than 80 degrees Kelvin would take billion of years to sublimate , if protected early enough from sputtering by meteorites or from energetic solar wind particles .
Last week , NASA announced that its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter had found temperatures as low as minus 397 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 238 Celsius ) in some shadowed craters , making them possibly the coldest place in the solar system .
" The next challenge for future missions will be to land in the permanently shadowed bottom of a polar crater and extract a few meters core of soil , " Foing said , possibly sampling at once layers of comet material — or water rich asteroids — that impacted the moon in the past three billion years .
Uniform or patchy ?
Similar in view is Clive Neal , a professor of civil engineering and geological sciences at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana .
He is also chair of NASA 's Lunar Exploration Analysis Group ( LEAG ) and also sits on the Planetary Science Subcommittee of the NASA Advisory Council .
" If the water ice is a slam dunk situation , " Neal told SPACE.com , " we will need to know the distribution within the craters — is it uniform or patchy ? "
If such a find it is to be used to support future moon exploration , Neal said that the magnitude of the deposits will also need to be quantified .
" We will also need to figure out where this stuff came from , which means sampling and analyzing the deposits ' a non-trivial thing ! "
So whatever is new and forthcoming regarding Earth 's celestial next door neighbor , Neal has a bottom line : " This is an exciting time of discovery for the moon ! "
Developing story
Observations that signatures of water ice have been detected on the moon that are robust , sound , and hold up within scientific circles may take a while .
That 's the sense of Wendell Mendell , Chief of the Office for Lunar & Planetary Exploration , Constellation Systems Program Office at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston , Texas .
He added that this view is a personal judgment and in no way reflects NASA policy or plans .
" If the resource is found lurking within darkened craters , how do you get to it and extract either the ice or the water from some process ? "
Mendell asked .
Follow - on questions are many , Mendell told SPACE.com :
In that kind of environment , how do you get mechanical systems and electronic systems to work ?
How do you get to the bottom of the crater ?
You are not going to drive — are you going to fly in ?
What will the rocket blast do to the ice deposits ?
" Enthusiasts may tell you that all of these questions are just details left to the engineers , " Mendell said .
" If so , when will the infrastructure be available to deal with these challenging design and operational issues ? "
At first blush , even if water ice truly exists on the moon , it will be a curiosity , Mendell added .
" I also will not believe it just from remote sensing data . "
Sage advice comes from space scientist Alan Stern , former head of NASA 's space science office .
" This is a developing story .
My view is that much more will be known in a few months .
So what looks tantalizing or even confusing today will be more compelling or more definitive soon , " Stern said .
Leonard David has been reporting on the space industry for more than four decades .
He is past editor - in - chief of the National Space Society 's Ad Astra and Space World magazines and has written for SPACE.com since 1999 .
Friday night is for dumping embarrassing news , as media companies well know .
So it is that the New York Times now surfaces a secret deal in which NBC is said to cravenly promise to ease its criticism of Fox News .
Such an agreement would mitigate the most high - profile battle within contemporary media , a feud that hearkened back to the newspaper wars of the early 20th century and which offered heartening — ever so slightly heartening — evidence that , in an era of 500 channel television sets , corporate media did n't have to be toothless or dull media .
But it 's last chapter is all too predictable : A powerful , suited overlord got embarrassed by all the boat - rocking and called things to a halt .
The suit , in this case , would be GE 's Jeffrey Immelt , a frequent target of Fox shouting head Bill O'Reilly and his professional stalker Jesse Waters ; according to the Times , Immelt sealed a deal with News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch this past May , " with a handshake " at Microsoft headquarters .
Details were left to underlings Jeff Zucker , at NBC , and Gary Ginsberg , at News Corp :
[ They ] agreed that hosts on Fox and MSNBC would resist lobbing mortars at each
other or their parent companies , according to an employee with direct knowledge of the agreement ....
" For this war to stop , it meant fewer headaches on the corporate side , " the employee said ...
Then the orders went out to the troops — meaning , to journalists , now being told what true things they should avoid saying or investigating , because it was not in the interests of their corporate parent companies .
Or at least that 's what the Times ' sources say :
Phil Griffin , said on a daily conference call with producers that he wanted the channel 's other programs to follow Mr. Olbermann 's lead and restrain from criticizing Fox directly , according to two employees .
At Fox News , some staff members were told to " be fair " to G.E .
The feud between the two corporations dates back at least five years , to the first of MSNBC Countdown host Keith Olbermann 's relentless attacks on O'Reilly , who uses his highly - rated Fox News show to attack various lefty targets , including an abortion doctor , " Tiller the Baby - Killer , " who O'Reilly railed against some 28 times on his show , until someone finally murdered the guy .
O'Reilly attacks ginned up Olbermann 's ratings , but the feud spread ; O'Reilly , who refused to utter Olbermann 's name , lashed out at General Electric and NBC News ; News Corp .'s New York Post was enlisted to repeatedly jab at Olbermann .
Olbermann can be an insufferable blowhard , and there was no small amount of ego and self - interest behind his O'Reilly slams , a point emphasized in the Times ' story .
His attacks could go too far ; Olbermann once wore an O'Reilly mask and gave a Nazi salute , on air .
" It was time to grow up , " a source told the Times .
But it 's out of a swamp of impure motives and foolish mistakes than good journalism must arise , and for those who distrusted Fox News there was something comforting in the idea that MSNBC was ready to jump on the network 's misstatements , tasteless moments and overreaches .
Fox - lovers no doubt relished monitoring of the liberal media housed at 30 Rock . '
Olbermann protests to the Times that " I am party to no deal , " but the paper documents how he appears to have led the way on this one .
Our jaded hearts twinge only slightly for those NBC News staff who consider themselves journalists but swallow these sorts of orders from above ; far more upset is our id , at the prospect of relinquishing the great fun of a vigorous — and vigorously cleansing — media feud .

Darwin's theory of evolution : does it destroy the foundations of Christianity ?
Do Darwin ’s theories destroy the very foundations of the Christian faith , or are the two reconcilable ?
Five prominent writers offer their views .
Building Problem Solvers
Kenneth D. Forbus and Johan de Kleer
For nearly two decades , Kenneth Forbus and Johan de Kleer have accumulated a substantial body of knowledge about the principles and practice of creating problem solvers .
In some cases they are the inventors of the ideas or techniques described , and in others , participants in their development .
Building Problem Solvers communicates this knowledge in a focused , cohesive manner .
It is unique among standard artificial intelligence texts in combining science and engineering , theory and craft to describe the construction of AI reasoning systems , and it includes code illustrating the ideas .
After working through Building Problem Solvers , readers should have a deep understanding of pattern directed inference systems , constraint languages , and truth - maintenance systems .
The diligent reader will have worked through several substantial examples , including systems that perform symbolic algebra , natural deduction , resolution , qualitative reasoning , planning , diagnosis , scene analysis , and temporal reasoning .
Along the way , Forbus and de Kleer teach the art of building robust AI software .
They begin with simple examples such as search programs , and move to more complex cases on the cutting edge of AI techniques , such as model - based diagnosis systems and a qualitative reasoner .
This software has been tested and used extensively by graduate students and programmers in industry .
Although Building Problem Solvers is designed primarily as a text for advanced AI classes or AI programming classes , it can be used by researchers in university and industrial laboratories who want to apply these techniques to their work , and by programmers who want to incorporate these ideas in their applications .
Please read the legal notice before using any of the material associated with the book .
Kenneth D. Forbus is the Walter P. Murphy Professor of Computer Science and Professor of Education at Northwestern University .
Johan de Kleer directs the Systems and Practices Laboratory at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center .
Building Problem Solvers is included in the Artificial Intelligence Series , edited by Michael Brady , Daniel Bobrow , and Randall Davis .

Turning the heat on telecom minister A. Raja , the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) has registered a case saying there was large scale corruption in the allocation of 2G ( second generation ) radio spectrum licences .
Raja , the second - time telecom minister in the UPA government , had repeatedly denied any corruption in the 2G allocation to private companies in 2008 .
The FIR filed by CBI on Thursday names no person but merely mentions unknown officials of the department of telecommunications ( DoT ) and unknown private persons and companies as the accused .
The agency raided the DoT office in Sanchar Bhawan and the search for incriminating documents was on till late night in the wireless planning cell and in the office of the deputy directorgeneral ( access services ) of DoT .
Top bureaucrats of the ministry are under the CBI scanner .
The FIR confirms allegations of " serious irregularities " in the award of the spectrum licenses and a criminal conspiracy woven between DoT officials and certain private companies .
However , telecom minister A. Raja ruled out resignation in the wake of CBI searches in his ministry .
" The question of my resignation does not arise .
All decisions on spectrum licensing have been taken in accordance with procedures laid down by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( Trai ) and in consultations with the Prime Minister , " he told reporters .
But the CBI FIR said , " The licenses were awarded to these companies by putting a cap on the number of applicants against the recommendations of the Trai .
The licences to these private companies were given on a first - come - first - served basis at the rates of 2001 - which were very low - without any competitive bidding . "
CBI has acted within days of the Central Vigilance Commission ( CVC ) asking for a comprehensive CBI probe .
" The CVC findings show the spectrum was not allocated at the present market - driven price , no auction process was followed and no bids were invited .
We will now quiz senior DoT officials , including an IAS officer , " a senior CBI official said .
" The scam could run up to Rs 22,000 crore .
Firms which got the licences at throwaway prices later sold their stake to foreign operators at huge prices , " he added .
SOURCES said the CBI probe will concentrate on specific aspects like why DoT did not go for the auction process in accordance with Trai guidelines and instead opted for a firstcome - first - served approach .
It will also examine why licences were not issued at current prices and why no time cap was fixed for those who were given the licences .
" CBI will further analyse documents to ascertain if the DoT had cabinet approval for going ahead with its idea of not inviting global bids for such a big project , " according to sources .
Two companies that got these licences in 2008 - Swan Telecom and Unitech - are allegedly under CBI investigation .
Swan Telecom got the license for a mere Rs 1,537 crore .
It then sold its stake to a foreign operator at nearly three times the amount within a few months .
Unitech got the spectrum licence for Rs 1,650 crore from the DoT , which too , sold its stake to a Norwegian company for over four times this amount . "
The end loser was the government , which could have earned thousands of crores more , " said a CBI official .
In 2008 , the government had issued new licences bundled with start - up 4.4 MHz spectrum at a fee of Rs 1,651 crore .

Summary : Response to the usual anti-Richard Stallman crowd and their latest incitement against Free software ( and to a lesser degree Ubuntu )
THE headline is a response to Matt Asay ’s latest “ Free software is dead ” wishful thinking .
He is one of those opportunists who believe that they can simply relabel GPL - licensed software “ open source ” and then magically declare the FSF “ irrelevant ” and Free software “ dead ” .
It does n’t work that way .
“ Truth be told , Asay has disliked Richard Stallman all along . ” Richard Stallman does not shy away from politics and this comes at a cost .
Truth be told , Asay has disliked Richard Stallman all along .
This fact has been raised here many times before .
Like with the Shuttleworth incident , Stallman has been smeared again recently .
Free software supporters should not be dismayed , however , because these latest smears against Stallman typically come from pro-Big Business writers ( e.g. Apple users / advocates ) and also people of the Big Press .
They look for triggers to justify their disdain and then make convenient excuses for an outburst du jour .
Speaking from experience , I have not found a single person who agreed with the FSF before those ‘ incidents ’ and changed his / her mind .
I have seen about a dozen criticisms of Stallman 's remark and none surprised me .
The shrewder complainers ‘ sell ’ the illusion that things suddenly changed ; but it could not be further from the truth .
In the case of Tux Machines , for example , the Shuttleworth / Ubuntu unrest was nothing new .
The editor expressed similar sentiments several times before .
One reader of ours writes : “ I think the renewed sexism attack should be counted as an attack on rivals last week .
It was dirty and indirect but it was an attack . ”
On he goes saying in reply to Wallclimber that “ the best way to diffuse that is to look at the context and diffuse the lie . ”
She said that “ what ’s bad about these recent attacks is that they know exactly what buttons to push to get people worked up …
I think everyone ’s nerves are a little on edge lately . ” █
“ Today many people are switching to free software for purely practical reasons .
That is good , as far as it goes , but that is n’t all we need to do !
Attracting users to free software is not the whole job , just the first step . ”

Real - Time Cameras - Navigation and Occlusion
By Mark Haigh - Hutchinson
[ Gamasutra is proud to present an excerpt from the book Real - Time Cameras by Mark Haigh - Hutchinson , a veteran Retro Studios staffer who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2008 and passed away in 2009 .
The book , published posthumously with help from his colleagues and friends , is available now .
For more information on the book 's creation , please read this blog post . ]
The Camera as an A.I. Game Object
In many ways , the problems presented by camera navigation have parallels within the domain of artificial intelligence ( AI ) .
As suggested earlier [ in the book ] , the camera may be thought of as an AI character , at the very least in terms of the determination of its position and orientation within the game world .
The camera may be able to move more freely than many types of AI characters , however , since it is typically floating rather than being constrained to moving on surfaces or under the influence of a physical simulation .
This freedom of movement is one of the benefits of a virtual camera system when compared to real - world cameras .
Yet , even though the camera may determine its path finding in a similar way to that used by AI characters , there are usually additional constraints concerning ( for the most part ) aesthetic issues such as target object framing , target object distance , and render geometry avoidance .
There are many interesting areas of AI navigation research , such as robotics , that may be applied to cameras .
In particular , research toward autonomous methods of movement determination is highly relevant if we desire to have camera motion that is responsive to dynamic game events .
The references at the end of this excerpt contain several pertinent examples such as Borenstein .
Since there are a large variety of environmental types , we will assume here that the camera is constrained to remain within a closed environment consisting of a collision surface representation such as a polygonal mesh , with additional independent game objects .
Here closed means that the representation of the environment forms a contiguous surface that constrains all usual game objects ( even so , there may still be cases where it is necessary for the camera to be positioned outside of the environment ) .
The collision surface may be considered as a separate entity to that of the rendered world ( although they may in fact be the same ) , with additional information regarding surface materials stored on a per-face or sub - surface basis .
It is also assumed that mechanisms exist within the game engine to cast rays through the environment returning results as to collision points and the materials found at that point .
Additionally there may be a need to filter the types of materials that are eligible for detection in any particular ray cast ( e.g. , some surfaces may allow the camera to pass but not regular game objects ) .
Optimization and organization of collision data is not discussed in this book , but the reader is referred to VandenBergen and Ericson for more information about collision system design and implementation .
Additionally , Chapter 9 describes some of the main methods used in camera collision detection and avoidance .
Predictive cameras ( as described in Chapter 2 ) typically have better navigation results than reactive cameras , as they are more likely to anticipate changes to the environment that would occlude the player character .
Naturally , this comes at additional performance cost .
Navigation Techniques
Fundamental to all navigation methods are the ways in which the camera may request environmental data regarding potential obstructions or paths of motion .
The nature of the game environment , its data representation , and facilities offered by the game engine will greatly influence the choice of navigation techniques .
We may consider there to be two general classifications : dynamic and pre-defined .
Dynamic navigation techniques
Dynamic navigation refers to techniques that do not rely on predefined information to position or move the camera .
Instead , they question the game world to determine how the camera should be positioned on a per - frame basis .
Since this can be computationally expensive , a number of techniques may be required to amortize the processor cost .
An important consideration when using dynamic solutions is that it is difficult to account for the myriad of positions and actions that may be performed by the player .
This means that it is difficult to test all the permutations as well as to be certain that no special case exists that might be problematic for the chosen navigation solution .
Let us examine some of the more common dynamic navigation methods .
Ray casting
One of the simplest and most common navigation methods is that of the ray cast , a mathematical projection of a straight line through the virtual environment .
By using trigonometry it may be determined if the line would intersect with either the collision geometry corresponding to the environment or that of an object within it .
As might be expected , this can be computationally intensive especially given the complexity of many environments .
An important goal when implementing camera systems is to limit the amount of such testing whenever possible .
Amortization of ray casting is entirely possible and can be quite effective in reducing the processor requirements at a cost of limiting the amount of information available to use for navigation .
Fortunately , navigation does not require a per - frame updating of such information as its decisions are normally longer lasting and may take more time to evaluate than collision or other immediate concerns .
Similarly , reducing the set of data to be compared against ( e.g. , using spatial partitioning or material filtering ) is also recommended .
Ray casts can often provide extremely pertinent information for camera systems , for example , collision prediction and player character occlusion .
Furthermore , ray casts may be combined together to produce a more detailed view of possible obstructions .
On the other hand , since ray casting normally involves ( by definition ) projection of a 3D line through the game world , it is entirely possible for the ray to pass through small openings and thus not register a collision .
Normally this problem is reduced by simply increasing the number and positioning of the ray casts to cover a larger area , although care must be taken given the potential performance costs .
It may also be avoided by having a separate collision mesh that only pertains to camera movement and would thus not include such small openings .
An alternative solution is to use ray - casting hysteresis , that is , statistical information of the ray cast results gathered over multiple updates .
From this history , it is possible to generate a probability graph of likely ray collisions and to reduce the actual amount of ray casts per update .
The probability graph is then used to determine the influence applied to camera motion .
For example , according to the position of the ray cast relative to the camera , we can deduce that lateral or vertical motion of the camera is probably necessary to avoid a future collision if the ray is prevented from reaching its target .
The results of the ray casts can then be used to dictate potential camera motion in a variety of ways .
First , a weight or influence factor for each ray cast can be applied depending on the success of the ray cast .
Thus , rays not reaching the target cause the camera to move in a direction away from their position .
An alternate method often used is to cast rays from the target object back toward the camera .
The results of these ray casts are utilized in a similar manner .
If a ray is cut short then once again it influences the movement of the camera .
The degree of influence is often based on the proximity of the collision point to the origin of the ray cast , or sometimes simply a pre-defined weighting factor depending on the particular ray cast direction .
One of the problems with ray casting is that the determination of whether the ray intersects with the environment ( or indeed , other game objects ) is often computationally expensive .
Additionally , it is often necessary to apply property information to the collision surfaces .
This information may be used to determine if a collision or ray intersection is actually valid .
It is common that the game camera may ignore a significant portion of the environment if these filters are set appropriately .
This is typically performed by a simple masking operation of desirable properties against the set of properties applied to the surface .
Technical
A typical implementation of simple ray casts would use a fixed arrangement of source positions around the proposed position of the camera , with the rays extending toward the target object .
Care must be taken to ensure the arrangement does not intersect with world geometry .
Often the ray positions are arranged in a grid or other symmetric shape .
Each ray is given an influence factor that may be applied horizontally , vertically , or both .
If the ray cast fails to reach the future position of the target object , the influence is applied to the desired camera position .
The influence may even be calculated according to its position relative to the target .
For all ray casts
If ray cast successful
No influence applied
If ray cast fails
Scale influence factor by distance of ray cast collision from target
Add influence to desired camera position
End
Once the total influence has been calculated , the camera will move toward the desired position plus this influence .
Note that the influence may be calculated differently in each axis , if so desired .
Volume projection
Rather than simple rays , this technique projects a volume through the world from the camera position toward its target position .
This volume is typically an extruded sphere ( sometimes referred to as a capsule ) ; for simplicity and performance , it may be either rectangular or cylindrical .
Performance improvements can be gained by simulating the volume using several ray casts around the perimeter of the volume .
As with other collision determination techniques it is important to filter out any unimportant objects or geometry from the potential collision set .
Bounds checking of axis - aligned bounding boxes or similar techniques may be applied to initially cull objects .
Volume projection is often used to determine if the camera would fit within confined spaces , or when determining a new potential position relative to an object ( e.g. , after a jump cut ) .
It may also be used to ensure that camera motion is valid by projecting a motion volume from the current position to the desired position .
Sphere / cylinder collisions
The camera is often considered a sphere for collision purposes .
This is partly because sphere collisions are relatively straightforward , but perhaps also because spheres are likely to slide along collision surfaces .
The radius of the collision sphere should be slightly larger than the distance of the view frustum 's near plane from the camera , thus preventing interpenetration of the camera with render geometry .
This is only true , however , if the collision geometry of objects or the environment extend beyond that of the render geometry .
Note that this distance is also dependent upon the horizontal field of view .
Ideally , the collision volume encompasses all four vertices of the frustum at the near plane .
Alternatively , the camera collision volume may be considered as a simple vertical axis - aligned cylinder .
In environments where the camera will not move close to horizontal surfaces such as floors or ceilings , this approximation should provide equal functionality to a sphere at a reduced performance cost .
The same caveats apply regarding the near - plane distance , and vertical collision must take into account the elevation of the camera , which might change how geometry would interpenetrate the near plane .
In the case of first person cameras , no collision volume or testing may actually be necessary since the camera should be completely contained within the collision bounds of the player character ( it would also be somewhat disconcerting if the camera was prevented from moving and the player was not ) .
However , it is still necessary to ensure the collision bounds of the player are larger than the near - plane distance to avoid the same manner of rendering artifacts as those prevalent in third person cameras .
Interpenetration of the near plane is still possible if there are game elements ( such as game AI objects ) that do not test for collision against the player , or that have render geometry protruding from their collision volume .
Dynamic path finding
Real - time or dynamic path finding has obvious similarities to solutions used for AI object navigation of the game world .
However , path finding for cameras is more stringent than AI path finding -- aesthetic constraints play a large part .
The underlying idea is that precomputed information is available that defines the volumes of space available for motion through the world .
The data structure used to represent these volumes can vary but usually includes methods to traverse the volumes through connectivity information ( which may also be directional in nature ) .
Traditional search algorithms such as A * or Dijkstra 's Algorithm ( as described in many AI or computer science text books ) may be used to determine the most efficient path through the volumes , given weighting values that dictate the desirability of a particular path .
The desirability determination for camera motion is likely to be quite different from that of an AI object , however .
Once a path has been generated , the camera will follow the path until it reaches the desired position or the movement is interrupted by a new request .
Usually this occurs when the path is recomputed on a regular basis , to account for player motion or environmental changes and so forth .
Often the path searching occurs at two levels .
The high - level solution determines the overall motion of the camera between volumes , combined with a low - level solution to avoid game objects , proximity to collision geometry , and so forth .
The difference between this solution and ones used for AI is that the latter tend to deal with longer paths of motion along surfaces ( though sometimes flying or jumping ) , whereas cameras are normally relatively close to their target positions .
In the case of cameras , the path information is used more for collision avoidance rather than a complete motion path .
Longer motion paths such as those used during non-interactive cinematic sequences are most often pre-defined and do not require any type of navigation logic to be applied .
Dynamic path generation
Path generation differs from the path finding previously mentioned because the shape and length of the new path is not determined according to pre-determined information built into the game world .
Rather , information about the game world is dynamically determined according to the current situation and used to generate the most appropriate path when required .
Moreover , it is likely that this path will change over time , although this may cause unwanted camera movements .
Dynamic paths are typically used in situations where standard navigation is unable to determine an appropriate movement .
Another technique for dynamic path generation is to use information garnered from the motion of the player character .
In many situations , a history of player movement data may be used to derive a potential movement path for the camera .
If it is known that the player has passed through a confined space ( e.g. , a doorway ) , the camera may clearly follow the same path .
However , such a path would likely present a very different view of the player than normally seen .
Therefore , it may be necessary to generate a volume around the player movement points to find the potential limits of valid camera motion ( e.g. , as an extruded cylindrical volume ) .
This volume would be used to present a view in keeping with the expected displacement of the camera from the player character .
Visibility and rendering solutions
With the advent of hardware - assisted rendering , a new variety of solutions became available for determination of the desired camera position .
We start with the assumption that the final position for the camera will be somewhere relative to the target object , and that the desired position should have an unobstructed view of the target object .
Next , we add constraints for the distance and elevation of the desired position relative to the target object .
This produces a cylindrical band of potential positions around the target object .
Further constraints can be layered on top of these requirements , such as only allowing a certain angular displacement relative to the target object .
Given all these constraints , we now have a small subset of potential positions to be tested for viability .
If we were to render the world from each of these potential positions such that the camera was oriented toward the target object , it would result in scenes that may or may not show the target object according to occluding geometry or game objects .
If , instead , we render these views so that the target object is drawn in an easily distinguishable ( and unique ) color , the rendered screen buffer may be analyzed to determine if the target object was occluded .
If the object is sufficiently non-occluded , then we can consider the rendered camera position as a viable position .
Other hardware - accelerated techniques may be used to determine the occlusion of the target object from each of the potential positions , including depth buffer analysis .
By exploiting the parallel nature of the graphics hardware , the cost of this determination may be significantly amortized .
There are , however , some caveats to this approach .
First , the setup for rendering the scene from each potential position may be prohibitive .
Second , although rendering via hardware is fast , it is certainly not free .
The GPU and CPU cost may be reduced by techniques such as rendering the scene flat - shaded ( i.e. , no lighting ) , changing the view frustum to restrict the scene to only the area around the target object ( including far clip plane distance ) , and reducing the resolution of the rendered scene .
Once we have determined which of our original potential camera positions is the most preferred , we can then calculate a path or other movement method to take the camera from its current position to the desired position .
Although this technique works well in determining the position , it does not take into account geometry intervening between the current position and the desired position .
Additional constraints may be applied to avoid these problems .
A practical implementation of these techniques may be found in Halper .
Colliders
Colliders are a variant upon the standard ray casting techniques as previously mentioned .
The principle here is that the positions from which the ray casts are made are variable .
Each of these positions is enclosed within a small collision volume ( typically a sphere or approximated to this by another ray cast ) .
These position objects are referred to as colliders , since they are constrained to stay within the environment .
Usually the colliders will be arranged in a particular pattern around the camera , such as a circle or semi-circle .
The colliders are constantly attempting to regain their desired positions relative to the camera 's ideal position as the camera moves through the environment .
The arrangement of the colliders influences how the camera will react to the environment .
Each collider casts a ray toward the look - at position of the camera , or alternatively some other pre-defined point relative to the player character .
The result of the ray cast is used to offset the desired position of the camera motion .
The amount of influence exerted by a collider may be based on a number of factors :
The physical distance of the collider from the camera possibly calculated in local camera space and applied in the same manner .
A pre-defined influence factor per collider determined according to the position of a particular collider within the entire group .
The distance from each collider to the point at which its ray cast struck geometry .
The acceleration or velocity of the player character , possibly only in one axis depending on desired behavior ( e.g. , change elevation according to player speed ) .
Some combination of the above factors may be applied to some or all colliders .
Often there are several groups of colliders , each influenced by different factors .
The ways in which the influence is applied also varies , possibly using a weighted average or a centroid calculation .
Some experimentation will be required according to the types of environment encountered in a particular game .
Differing arrangements of these colliders may be used according to the type of behavior required for the environment .
Circular or semicircular arrangements are common , as are horizontal ones .
The arrangement may vary according to changes in the player character , most commonly velocity .
Colliders and other ray casting techniques are susceptible to " noise " produced by ray casts that collide with incidental environmental features that should not adversely affect camera motion .
Some knowledge of the environment may be used to filter out results that should not influence camera motion .
Tagging of surface properties may also be used to ignore or apply a reduced influence on the camera position determination .
Alternatively , surfaces may be tagged to act as motion constraints or to otherwise prevent the camera from approaching .
The arrangement of the colliders and the amount of influence each applies may require changing according to the environment properties ( e.g. , confined spaces , vertical columns , etc. ) or game play mode ( e.g. , to match changing movement characteristics of the player character ) .
Technical
Since the arrangement of colliders may vary considerably , here is only an outline of the algorithm used to determine their influence upon the desired camera position :
stl :: vector influence ;
// might be useful as a class
for ( int i = 0 ; i < colliders.size ( ) ; ++i)
{
influence.push_back(colliders[i].offset *
colliders [ i]. GetWeighting ( ) ) ;
// the weighting depends on line of sight and / or
// other factors such as the relative collider
// position
}
// will need to get an average or similar
return GetCentroid ( influence ) ;
The arrangement of colliders will change the calculation method used to determine the average amount of influence to apply .
A centroid calculation works well if the colliders are constrained to a plane , but however the final influence is calculated , it must also be applied in the same space as the collider 's offsets .
Pre-defined navigation techniques
Many of the problems associated with camera collision can be avoided by pre-computation of potential camera movement or by using pre-defined assistance based on knowledge of the environment ( whether defined explicitly by the camera designer or otherwise automatically pre-calculated ) .
Camera navigation pre-computation may take many forms , usually at a cost of both memory overhead and time to compute the allowable camera positions , although the latter is not generally as important .
Pre-computation typically has an advantage in lower processor overhead during run-time .
Assistance for navigation is often in the form of game script objects placed by designers and therefore tailored to the specific requirements of both game play and environmental concerns .
Chapter 6 discusses scripting and its application to camera motion and positioning ; however , it is possible to derive navigation assistance information from other game objects than those specifically designed to control camera behavior .
There are a variety of ways in which both types of information may be used to assist camera navigation and collision avoidance .
Many of these schemes share common ground with AI or robotic research techniques , and the bibliography outlines some of the relevant papers .
Some of the more common solutions are as follows .
Pre-defined paths
The most common solution for pre-computation is to literally store entire motion paths .
Several games have used this effectively since it also allows complete control over camera position ( and possibly orientation ) , irrespective or directly according to player action .
Nevertheless , path motion can be somewhat restrictive and could potentially result in the player experiencing a sensation of lack of control .
Conversely , the ability to directly specify the position of the camera is a boon when dealing with motion through a complex environment , especially if the determination of the position can be varied according to player position or action .
A full description of path - based camera motion may be found starting with the section Path in Chapter 7 .
Path motion behaviors
Although the camera may be constrained by using a path to completely define its motion , the interpretation of how the spline actually constrains the motion offers several alternatives .
Constrained path camera .
A constrained path camera is one that moves precisely along a defined path within the game world .
The camera is typically not allowed to leave this path under any circumstance , unless the path is no longer active .
This is one of the most typical uses of path cameras , so the camera position may be absolutely controlled to avoid collision or interpenetration with environmental features , and so forth .
Non-interactive movies are often driven by this type of camera ( as well as stationary or slaved position cameras ) .

Non-interactive movies are often driven by this type of camera ( as well as stationary or slaved position cameras ) .
Follow path camera .
In many cases , the motion of a camera on a constrained path may not appear as " organic " or " natural " as required by the game designers , even though the motion along the path may be smooth .
However , we may still wish to restrict camera motion in some fashion .
A follow path camera provides a mechanism to both restrict camera motion yet allow some variance .
In this case , the path only dictates a desired position -- how the camera reaches that desired position can be defined in a number of different ways -- i.e. , the camera is not locked directly to the path .
This may be likened to a " carrot " being dangled in front of the camera .
The camera will seek to the location defined by the current evaluation of the path , but is allowed to move in a direct line toward that position ( note that this same technique may be applied regardless of the position determination method ) .
Alternatively , we can use rules to control the distance away from the desired path that the camera is allowed to move ; for example , the path now becomes a tube ( typically cylindrical ) although the cross section may not be circular ( e.g. , ellipsoidal or rectangular ) .
Indeed , information about the shape of the path volume may be contained within the knots themselves to allow for variance of camera motion along the path ( including the radius of the tube ) .
Another approach is to use a parametric curve with the input parameter as the position of the camera along the path .
These methods allow local control over the camera without having multiple paths .
When restricting the motion of the camera away from the follow path , it is normally best not to use " hard " constraints as this will likely lead to unwanted motion artifacts .
A damped spring or attractor / repulsor may be used to provide a more analog response to the distance restriction .
Pre-defined volumes
Camera motion may also be restricted such that the camera is confined by the extents of a pre-defined volume .
The actual definition of the volume is somewhat variable .
It may consist of a simple convex shape such as a sphere , cylinder , ellipsoid , or cube .
Alternatively it may be derived from a complex collision mesh , much as would other game entities .
Complex shapes , of course , make navigation a more difficult proposition .
The desired position within the volume may be defined in a number of different ways .
Clearly , we can use the same techniques as mentioned earlier in this chapter regarding player character - relative positions with the additional constraint of remaining within the volume .
This approach is applicable to most of the dynamic determination methods , so that the pre-defined volume constraint is applied after the initial determination has been made .
It is typically easier to use fixed dimension volumes , but these could be varied according to game play requirements ; for example , the position of the player relative to a reference frame .
In the same manner as path behaviors , directly constraining the camera position may lead to non-continuous motion and often benefits from the use of forces or damped springs to keep the camera within the volume .
Attractors / repulsors
Effective navigation assistance may be obtained by using attractors or repulsors , where the camera is literally attracted to ( or repulsed from ) pre-defined positions , regions , or other game objects .
Often these positions are defined explicitly using script objects that are placed by the camera designer .
Alternatively , offline analysis can be made of the environment to determine automatic placement ; in practice this can be a difficult prospect without explicit rules governing their usage .
Both attractors and repulsors function by applying forces to the camera depending on the proximity ( and possibly orientation ) of the player or camera .
Note that these forces may not be implemented as part of the physical simulation ( even if such a facility is available ) ; rather they may simply influence the determination of the desired position or act as hard constraints during the actual camera motion .
The use of proximity as part of the calculation of forces suggests that the attractor or repulsor is spherical in nature , but this is not necessarily appropriate .
Cylindrical shapes are frequently the most useful , often with their major axis aligned to the world up - vector .
Simplistic shapes are common because of the relatively low cost in the calculation of the proximity of game objects , and thus the forces required .
Spheres , cylinders , and planes are common choices .
One specific example that is often problematic for cameras is navigation through doorways , particularly if the character moves quickly .
Other than the problems of ensuring that the door does not physically close either between the camera and its target or on top of the camera , doorways are frequently a problem because they are often confined spaces and there are many opportunities for the player character to move in ways that may cause the camera to be left behind .
Vertical doorways are the most common case encountered , where the door is aligned with the up - axis of the game world .
Horizontal doorways have additional challenges especially regarding camera orientation due to the potential for gimbal lock .
Additional problems occur when external events may cause the door to close rapidly , leaving the camera behind the closed door ( or worse , interpenetrating the door geometry ) .
To cope with such situations it is generally preferable that the door is held open while the camera is on the opposite side compared to the player , but this is not always possible .
Thus , it is often necessary to implement a fail - safe to ensure that the camera is never left on the wrong side of a closed door .
If the camera system is able to track the proximity of the camera to doorways or otherwise be informed of how the camera is positioned and oriented relative to the doorway ( e.g. , by means of a trigger volume ) , an axis - based attractor may be used to help guide the camera motion through the doorway .
A proportional attractor can apply forces to the camera dependent upon the camera position relative to the axis of desired motion through the doorway .
Care must be taken to ensure that these forces do not impart oscillation and that they are only applied when appropriate .
Considering the general case once again , the direction in which forces are applied by attractors or repulsors is also variable .
Common usage would have the forces acting in relation to the physical shape of the attractor or repulsors ; for example , a spherical attractor would pull objects toward its origin .
They can be based on a world - relative orientation ; a cylindrical repulsor may determine its force from the player character 's proximity to the central axis of the cylinder yet apply the repulsion force based on a fixed world orientation .
Attractors and repulsors are sometimes attached to ( or form part of ) other game objects .
Thus , they may vary in their position and effects .
As with any force - based solution , care must be taken to ensure that such objects only apply their forces when appropriate .
Stout discusses this in detail .
Ensuring that forces do not adversely influence the camera is the most difficult part of their usage .
Cameras do differ somewhat from AI objects in this determination however , since there are additional aesthetic considerations to consider ( such as the requirement to ensure smooth motion whenever possible ) .
Thus if the camera incidentally moves past an attractor , it is not necessarily appropriate that it should be influenced .
If the camera were moving away from the attractor , for example , we would not wish to apply any forces .
By careful choice of the attractor positions , camera motion can be made to avoid geometry or pass through confined environments without the necessity for complicated hand - scripted camera solutions .
Indeed , the attractor or repulsors can be combined with regular game objects ( such as doors ) to assist camera motion without any additional scripting support .
Flow fields
Flow fields are sparse arrays of vectors ( i.e. , directions ) , normally spaced apart in a grid across a 2D plane or within a 3D volume .
The spacing of the vectors is not necessarily uniform .
As the camera ( or other object ) passes through the flow field , vectors that are close to the camera affect its motion by applying a force in the direction of their orientation .
The strength of force may be dependent upon the distance of the camera from the plane or some other factor .
The name derives from the fact that the array of vectors is akin to a stream or other moving body of water that flows around objects .
By adjusting the direction of the vectors , we can ensure that the camera will move around obstacles in much the same manner .
Thus , it is important to ensure that the direction of the vectors will not cause situations to arise where the camera remains stationary as competing vectors cancel out their influence , or prevent the camera from clearing obstacles .
The use of flow fields is usually applied as an additional influence on camera motion , rather than the sole factor .
In addition , it is necessary to determine when the additional influence should be applied .
For example , the vectors could be uni- or bi-directional .
If the camera is able to navigate through the flow field in different directions relative to the flow field vector directions , the influence might only be applied when the camera motion is parallel to the direction of the vector .
Additionally , the amount of influence may also be proportional to the velocity of the camera .
Influence maps
Influence maps are another sparse array , similar to flow fields in some regards .
However , the mapping of the camera position from the influence map is normally based upon the position of the target object relative to the influence map rather than the camera itself .
Each position on the influence map corresponds to a different position in space for the camera to occupy .
The desired position derived from the influence map is used as an interpolant so that the motion of the camera from its current position will be smooth .
In some ways , spline motion can be considered a one - dimensional variant of the influence map .
In this case , the target object position relative to the spline maps back to a position that the camera should occupy on the same ( or a different ) spline .
Influence maps may be explicitly positioned or generated offline from collision or visibility information .
Potential fields
Derived from research into robot navigation , potential fields are a promising approach to dynamic camera navigation and collision avoidance .
While this is an advanced topic beyond the scope of this book , a brief overview might be helpful .
Potential fields are based on the principle of electrostatic forces ; that is , forces whose effect on objects is proportional to the distance of the object from the force applier .
Essentially , these forces are applied to the active camera to prevent its approach toward collision or render geometry .
Additionally these force components are added to the motion of the camera , aiding navigation through confined spaces and often avoiding many of the problems caused when the camera might be in collision with geometry .
The forces may be defined explicitly as points or plane surfaces and thus placed within the environment by designers in a similar manner to attractors and repulsors as previously mentioned .
Alternatively , their position and orientation may also be automatically generated as part of the cooking of world data .
Similarly , the collision geometry may be used to generate forces .
However , the complex nature of collision geometry would likely make determination of the forces closest to the camera computationally expensive .
One possible solution is to generate an implicit surface that approximates the collision geometry in a smooth and continuous manner and facilitates rapid determination of the closest positions to the camera .
See Bloomenthal for an introduction to implicit surfaces .
Robotics research has explored these techniques with mixed results ( e.g. , see Koren ) .
There are some notable limitations regarding the complexity of the environments , especially regarding dead - ends .
There may also be oscillation problems when the forces are applied from opposite directions simultaneously ( e.g. , in a narrow corridor ) .
Refer to Stout for more information on the practical application of potential fields within games .
An alternative and very promising solution is offered in Borenstein , using vector field histograms ( VFH ) .
Briefly , VFHs store information regarding the distance of obstacles from the object determined by infrared or other sensors .
These sensors are typically mounted either at fixed angular offsets or rotate around a central point , effectively casting rays into the environment .
The distance information returned at each angular offset may then be analyzed over time .
A histogram of known obstacles is thus constructed , providing sufficient information to determine potential collisions .

In populating the growing brain , neural stem cells must strike a delicate balance between two key processes – proliferation , in which the cells multiply to provide plenty of starting materials – and differentiation , in which those materials evolve into functioning neurons .
If the stem cells proliferate too much , they could grow out of control and produce a tumor .
If they proliferate too little , there may not be enough cells to become the billions of neurons of the brain .
Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine have now found that this critical balance rests in large part on a single gene , called GSK - 3 .
The finding suggests that GSK - 3 controls the signals that determine how many neurons actually end up composing the brain .
It also has important implications for patients with neuropsychiatric illness , as links have recently been drawn between GSK - 3 and schizophrenia , depression and bipolar disorder .
One of the genes associated with schizophrenia appears to use GSK - 3 as an intermediary to exert its effects on nerve cells .
In addition , lithium , a popular treatment for bipolar disorder , acts , in part , by shutting down GSK - 3 .
“ I do n’t believe anyone would have imagined that deleting GSK - 3 would have such dramatic effects on neural stem cells , ” said senior study author William D. Snider , M.D. , professor of neurology and cell and molecular physiology , and director of the UNC Neuroscience Center .
“ People will have to think carefully about whether giving a drug like lithium to children could have negative effects on the underlying structure of the nervous system . ”
In a study appearing online October 4th in the journal Nature Neuroscience , Snider and his colleagues created a mouse model in which both forms of the GSK - 3 gene – designated alpha and beta – had been deleted .
They decided to go after GSK - 3 – which stands for glycogen synthase kinase 3 – because it is one of the most studied kinases or signaling molecules in all of biology .
The researchers used a “ conditional knock - out ” strategy to remove GSK - 3 at a specific time in the development of the mouse embryo , when a type of cell called a radial progenitor cell had just been formed .
As the brain develops , neural stem cells evolve through three different stages -- neural epithelial cells , radial progenitor cells and intermediate neural precursors .
The radial progenitor cells are especially important because they are thought to provide the majority of the neurons of the developing brain but also differentiate themselves to give rise to all the cellular elements of the brain .
The researchers discovered that deleting GSK - 3 during this second phase of development caused the radial progenitor cells to be locked in a constant state of proliferation .
“ It was really quite striking , ” said Snider .
“ Without GSK - 3 , these neural stem cells just keep dividing and dividing and dividing .
The entire developing brain fills up with these neural stem cells that never turn into mature neurons . ”
GSK - 3 is known to coordinate signals for proliferation and differentiation within nerve cells through multiple “ signaling pathways . ”
Thus , the researchers looked to see what effect deleting the molecule had on some of these pathways .
They found that every one of the pathways that they studied went awry .
Snider and his colleagues now want to see if adding GSK - 3 back to their genetically engineered mice can convert the proliferating stem cells into neurons , possibly resulting in three to four times as many neurons in the mutants as normal .
“ I find that quite interesting because I ca n’t think of any other manipulation that potentially would enable you to simply dial up and down the number of neurons that are generated in the brain , ” said Snider .
Funding for the studies led at UNC came from the National Institutes of Health .
Study co-authors from Snider ’s laboratory at UNC include lead author Woo - Yang Kim , Ph.D. , postdoctoral research associate ; Xinshuo Wang , graduate student and Yaohong Wu , chief technician .
Researchers from the laboratory of James R. Woodgett , Ph.D. at the University of Toronto also collaborated on the project .
Initially I thought it was being a co-founder of Color of Change ( who are having some success with their call for a boycott of Glenn BecKKK 's show ) that instigated this .
Then I realized that this must go much deeper considering BecKKK has also got the Apollo Alliance in his sights .
http://apolloalliance.org/
I carried out some research to find out where this all began and discovered that it was Phil Kerpen from " Americans for Prosperity " who started it all .
Go here for the result of the research ( with embedded links ) that I posted Sunday night on Democratic Underground :

Here 's another article on The Reid Report that cites the research I posted on DU ...
The truth about Van Jones
A DUer posts an interesting find .
Jones , it seems , was n’t pushed out by Glenn Beck .
Beck was just the vehicle .
The real pushers were anti-climate change advocates from , wait for it , the oil industry .
From this DU post , which identified Phil Kerpen from “ Americans for Prosperity ” as the man “ who started it all . ”
Apparently , he even bragged about his role on Fox News yesterday , and also issued the following boast on his website : How Van Jones Happened and What We Need to Do Next
Now that Jones has resigned , we need to follow through with two critical policy victories .
First , stop cap - and - trade , which could send these groups trillions , and second repeal the unspent portion of the stimulus bill , which stands to give them billions .
The Van Jones affair could be an important turning point in the Obama administration if we use it as a window to understand the structure of the left and to stop the huge power - grab now taking place in the name of green jobs .
It ’s also one of the most significant things I ’ve ever had the honor of being involved in .
... =snip= Americans for Prosperity is also the group that sent buses around the country to town hall dust-ups , where its speakers compared healthcare reform to the Holocaust , and its proponents hung members of Congress in effigy ( they ’re also connected to the Jack Abramoff web of intrigue and tangentially , to the birthers ) but their main issue is climate change — or rather climate change denial , for the purposes of stopping any reform that would cost its financial benefactors money .

Funding
From Desmogblog.com
The Big Money behind Americans for Prosperity =snip= AFP , and its former incarnation the Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation , are the third largest recipient of funding from the Koch Family of Foundations , which is run by the ultra - conservative oil baron Charles G. Koch .
The Koch Family of Foundations has been a major funding source for many of the think tanks that are in the business of delaying action on climate change issues .

Update
Brave New Films ' new film ...
Carl Pope and Van Jones ( episode 1 ) In any other profession , Carl Pope might be considered a " company man . "
He has worked loyally and tirelessly in the name of the Sierra Club for thirty years , running the organization – the largest of its kind in the country – since 1992 .
Van Jones has founded several organizations within the last decade , including The Ella Baker Center for Human Rights and Green For All .
They both live in the Bay Area .
They both care intensely about saving the environment .
The thing is , they use very distinct methods , although the lines differentiating those methods are blurring as we race further into the 21st century .
From the environment to the economy , from old fashioned door - to - door fliers to streaming internet video , Pope and Jones discuss the myriad elements effecting our lives today and the many possible solutions that are nearly within reach .

I ’m Sick of Right - Wing Smears
Van Jones ' career as a social and environmental justice activist is legendary .
That 's why he became the victim of a vicious right - wing smear campaign from FOX News ' Glenn Beck , which forced him to resign from the White House over the weekend .
We know that Beck and FOX have other targets in the Administration lined up .
The question for progressives is :
What should we do to prepare for the next round ?

Phil Kerpen is now bragging about it on CBN , and , as you 'll see , CBN have followed Faux 's lead and are also enabling Americans for Prosperity 's agenda ...
COXSACKIE , N.Y .  Allen Jacobs lived hard for his 50 years , and when his liver finally shut down he faced the kind of death he did not want .
On a recent afternoon Mr. Jacobs lay in a hospital bed staring blankly at the ceiling , his eyes sunk in his skull , his skin lusterless .
A volunteer hospice worker , Wensley Roberts , ran a wet sponge over Mr. Jacobs ’s dry lips , encouraging him to drink .
“ Come on , Mr. Jacobs , ” he said .
Mr. Roberts is one of a dozen inmates at the Coxsackie Correctional Facility who volunteer to sit with fellow prisoners in the last six months of their lives .
More than 3,000 prisoners a year die of natural causes in correctional facilities .
Mr. Roberts recalled a day when Mr. Jacobs , then more coherent , had started crying .
Mr. Roberts held his patient and tried to console him .
Then their experience took a turn unique to their setting , the medical ward of a maximum security prison .
Mr. Roberts said he told Mr. Jacobs to “ man up . ”
Mr. Jacobs , serving two to four years for passing forged checks , cursed at him , telling him , “ ‘ I do n’t want to die in jail .
Do you want to die in jail ? ’ ”
I know , you are thinking soap , water , hockey mask , chain mail , and gloves right ?
Eh. there is a little more to it than that .
You see Maine Coon cats have exceedingly fine dense fur and a LOT of oil glands to go with it .
As a result , the fur is dang near impermeable to water .
Washing them adequately using just soap and water is an exercise in frustration ( not to mention death by a thousand cat scratches ) .
Therefore more extreme measures must be taken .
Here are the supplies you will need : 1 jar original Goop hand cleaner1 bottle of original ivory liquid dishwashing soap1 gallon jug of white vinegar1 bottle pet shampoo / baby shampoo1 curry comb , waterproofOptional equipment as needed : personal protective equipment as required ( gloves , chain mail , hockey mask , etc. ) sedatives ( feline and / or human ) as required .
plenty of gauze and turniquets as needed to staunch the flow of blood .
Step 1 : Using the curry comb , brush the cat thoroughly to get as much loose hair as possible off .
You may find that your cat may undergo an incomplete form of mitosis during this procedure , resulting in copious quantities of excess hair , often enough to make another whole entire cat , while not actually loosing any of her own .
This is normal and expected .
It is impossible to do this too much or too long , as the cat will continue to generate hair as long as you continue to brush .
At no point will the cat go bald .
this is a physical impossibility .
The only exception to this is if instead of brushing you shave the cat .
While doing so will certainly assist in the washing of said feline , it is rather embarrassing for the cat ( and possibly dangerous for you ) .
This certainly would fall under an alternative process category however .
Step 2 : After the excess hair is disposed of properly and the garbage trucks are on thier way to the landfill , or perhaps the clothing manufacturer , slather the cat liberally with Goop .
Rub it in thoroughly in order to help loosen and dissolve the vast quantities of oil that the cat hair has absorbed .
Scientists are currently studying means to exploit these oil deposits for use as motor fuel .
However , current extraction methods tend to be rather hard on the cat and results in oil contaminated with vast quantities of fur and crushed cat guts and blood .
And unfortunately results in a non-renewable resource as the cat gets pureed in the process .
While Goop is non-toxic , it might be best if you can prevent your cat from attempting to lick themselves while this process takes place .
Also try to keep the Goop out of thier eyes .
Step 3 : Rinse the Goop off the cat and then lather the cat up with the Ivory Dish Washing Detergent .
While the cat is lathered up , curry comb the cat again to remove as much hair as possible .
Make sure you have a strainer over the drain to prevent massive greasy furballs from hopelessly clogging the sewage system .
Your MUD district / Public Works Department will thank you as will your neighbors .
Step 4 : Rinse the cat using a 50/50 mix of white vinegar and water .
Ensure you keep the vinegar out of the cat 's eyes unless you just like the feeling of having your flesh flayed by a very irate cat .
Step 5 : Lather , Rinse , Repeat using the baby shampoo / pet shampoo .
Your feline is now soaking wet but clean .
Use several large absorbant towels to both protect you from claw marks and dry the cat .
Did I mention that Maine Coon Cats have very absorbant thick dense fur ?
Be prepared to work at this for some length of time , and even then , your cat may look like a very large and bloated drowned wharf rat , especially when your cat is as fat a mine is , ( with a furry tail ) for several hours afterwards .
good luck and godspeed ....
House and Senate conferees last week approved legislation that would preempt the Freedom of Information Act and permit the Secretary of Defense to withhold from release photographs and other visual media if he determines that their public disclosure “ would endanger citizens of the United States , members of the United States Armed Forces , or employees of the United States Government deployed outside the United States . ”
The new provision , contained in the 2010 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act , was adopted to thwart a successful FOIA lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union seeking release of certain photographs documenting the abuse of detainees held in U.S. military custody .
A federal appeals court ruled ( pdf ) last year that the unclassified photographs are not exempt from the FOIA and must be released .
The Obama Administration , prodded by Senators Lieberman and Graham and with the support of some senior military officials , petitioned ( pdf ) the Supreme Court last August to overturn the ruling .
“ The disclosure of those photographs could reasonably be expected to endanger the lives or physical safety of United States military and civilian personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan , ” the Administration argued .
But Congress acted first , and Solicitor General Elena Kagan asked the Court ( pdf ) on October 8 to suspend its consideration of the petition .
From an open government point of view , it is dismaying that Congress would intervene to alter the outcome of an ongoing Freedom of Information Act proceeding .
The move demonstrates a lack of confidence in the Act , and in the ability of the courts to correctly interpret its provisions .
The legislation elevates a speculative danger to forces who are already in battle above demands for public accountability concerning controversial government policies , while offering no alternative avenue to meet such demands .
“ The suppression of these photos will ultimately be far more damaging to our national security than their disclosure would be , ” suggested Jameel Jaffer of the ACLU .
On the other hand , legislative intervention to block release of the photos might not be the worst possible outcome .
A worse scenario would be if the Supreme Court upheld the sweeping Obama Administration argument that other courts have rejected , and ruled that the FOIA exempts these unclassified photos simply because they may pose an unspecified danger to unspecified persons .
Such a Supreme Court ruling would have left a gaping hole in the Freedom of Information Act even larger than what the Obama Administration and Congress have now created .
Meanwhile , a new military policy prohibits reporters embedded with forces in eastern Afghanistan from photographing U.S. troops killed in action , the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press revealed last week .

Since earlier this year we ’ve been talking a lot about the $ 8000 first time homebuyer tax credit that was passed as a part of the 2009 Economic Stimulus Package .
The credit has been available for first time homebuyers since January 1st , and will continue to be available until November 30th .
Now that the program is beginning to wind down , the rumblings about trying to get the program extended or modified have begun .
A few months ago there was talk about the tax credit being increased to $ 15,000 , but that never got off the ground .
Another bill that was introduced last month also never got out of committee .
So while there is interest in passing an extension , nothing has come to fruition yet .
Many Hope For An Extension Of The First Time Homebuyer Tax Credit
The National Association of Home Builders are saying that they ’re already beginning to see new home purchases starting to drop since the program will soon be gone :
In order to create hundreds of thousands of badly needed jobs and move the economy to higher ground , the National Association of Home Builders ( NAHB ) today called on Congress to extend and expand the $ 8,000 first - time home buyer tax credit set to expire at the end of next month .
Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee , NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe warned that builders are reporting that business generated by entry - level buyers is already declining because it is now too late to complete a new home sale in time to take advantage of the tax credit .
To spur job growth , help reduce foreclosures and excess housing inventories and stabilize home values , NAHB is calling on Congress to extend the home buyer tax credit for an additional year through Nov. 30 , 2010 and make it available to all purchasers of a principal residence .
The drop in business seen by home builders is real .
The number of building permits for new homes dropped significantly in September
Applications for home building permits , a gauge of future construction , fell in September by the largest amount in five months — a discouraging sign for the housing industry .
The decline , in part , reflected uncertainty about whether Congress will extend a tax credit for first - time homebuyers .
The applications for building permits fell 1.2 percent in September .
That ’s the biggest decline since a 2.5 percent drop in April and underscored worries that the fledgling housing revival could be derailed by rising unemployment , tighter bank lending standards and the expiration on Nov. 30 of the government ’s $ 8,000 tax credit for first - time homebuyers .
Is The Tax Credit A Good Idea ?
Some Think It Wo n’t Make Much Of A Difference
Many in the building and real estate industries are clamoring for an extension of the credit , while others are n’t so sure that the cost of extending the program are worth it .
Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan said at a congressional hearing Tuesday that supporting the housing market “ can be very expensive , especially at a time of significant budget deficits . ”
The administration will make a recommendation on whether to extend the credit in the coming weeks , after studying data on tax filings from the Internal Revenue Service .
While there would be some negative effects if it were allowed to expire , Donovan said , “ I do not believe that a catastrophic decline would be the result . “
Some analysts and lawmakers are skeptical about extending the credit , arguing that most homebuyers who receive it would have decided to buy anyway .
And soaring unemployment is likely to dull the impact of any extension , Mark Vitner , a senior economist with Wells Fargo Securities , wrote in a note to clients .
“ Many of the most likely buyers targeted have already taken advantage of the program , ” he wrote .
The Newest Tax Credit Bill Piggybacks On Unemployment Benefits
So there is clearly division as to whether the program should be extended .
Other bills to extend the credit and increase the amount it gives to homebuyers have already died a slow death in committee never to again see the light of day .
This week Congress is once again considering another plan that would extend the credit through June of 2010 .
Whether this new one will make it out of the committees remains to be seen .
The latest Senate proposal would drop the requirement that the credit be available only to first - time buyers , broadening the reach of the program but also adding to its cost , estimated by congressional analysts at $ 16.7 billion .
The backers of that idea , Sens. Johnny Isakson , R - Ga. , and Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , chairman of the Senate ’s banking committee , have suggested that their measure be attached to another pending bill aimed at throwing a lifeline to people hit by the recession , an extension of federal assistance to the millions in danger of exhausting unemployment insurance benefits . ….
The Isakson - Dodd proposal would extend the credit to June 30 , 2010 .
It would also remove the first - time homebuyer requirement and raise the eligibility income limit to $ 150,000 , or $ 300,000 for a couple .
That ’s double the current phase - out limits .
Provisions Of The New Proposed Homebuyer Tax Credit
So if this new bill that is piggybacking on an extension of unemployment benefits were passed , it would mean that the tax credit would be extended , and the new provisions would be :
You would not need to be a first time homebuyer – that provision would be removed .
It applies to homes purchased through June 30 , 2010 .
You must keep the home for three years .
The credit is refundable .
The credit is for $ 8,000 or 10 % of the home ’s value , whichever is less .
It phases out for incomes between $ 75,000 to $ 150,000 for single and $ 150,000 to $ 300,000 for couples .
So while it is still unsure as to whether this particular extension of the first time homebuyer tax credit will be passed , the momentum for an extension to be passed in some form is very real .
I would expect something to be passed at some point this year .
UPDATE : A new bill has been “ agreed to ” by Senators , that would extend the credit and add a $ 6500 Tax Credit for current homeowners .
Details here .
What do you think ?
Should the tax credit for homebuyers be expanded to all homebuyers , and extended until June of 2009 ?
Will the effect it has on our economy be worth it , or will it be just another large expenditure when we are already running huge deficits ?

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Miley Cyrus , one of Disney ’s hottest stars of the past three years with hit records and hit films , has been voted the worst celebrity influence of 2009 by the very people who made her a star , tweens and teens , according to an online poll on Wednesday .
Slideshow ( 10 images )
Cyrus , 16 , took 42 percent of votes in the poll for AOL ’s JSYK.com ( Just So You Know ) website aimed at 9 - 15 year - olds , pushing Britney Spears and rapper Kanye West into second and third places , respectively , in a section on worst celebrity influences of the year .
No reasons were given for the poor showing of the singer - actress and the popular star of Disney Channel ’s “ Hannah Montana ” television series .
But the ranking follows a year which has seen Cyrus controversially dating a 20 year - old model , making “ slant eyes ” in an informal snapshot criticized as mocking Asians , and being accused of pole - dancing on a teen awards show .
Cyrus also came in No. 4 in the category of favorite female artist , behind 19 - year - old country sensation Taylor Swift , “ I Kissed a Girl ” singer Katy Perry and R&B star Beyonce .
The poll attracted almost 50,000 votes .
“ I think Miley is in an interesting space where she is trying to graduate from being ‘ Hannah Montana ’ and a Disney channel celebrity and coming into her own and having a career beyond Disney , ” said Stephanie Cohen , editor of JSYK.com .
“ I think her fans still want her to be the sweet Hannah Montana and she is trying to age up ... Parents are definitely resisting it , ” Cohen told Reuters .
Cyrus has been one of the biggest teen idols in the world since 2006 , selling more than 7 million albums , starting her own fashion line , and taking $ 154 million at the worldwide box - office for “ Hannah Montana : The Movie ” in 2009 .
West , whose interruption of Swift ’s acceptance speech at a music award show in September was deemed the most shocking moment of 2009 , took 19 percent of votes in the worst celebrity influence section .
Swift , the best - selling U.S. artist of 2008 , has risen again in popularity this year .
“ I think Taylor Swift has done a great job of showing her true self and coming across as very sweet and down to earth .
A lot of her songs are about the underdog and teens can really relate to her , ” said Cohen .
Elsewhere , the stars of vampire movies “ Twilight ” and its forthcoming sequel “ New Moon ” dominated the JSYK.com poll .
Kristen Stewart was voted favorite female movie actress and Taylor Lautner surged past Robert Pattinson in both the favorite male movie star and “ cool guy you ’d like to hang out with ” categories .

I Am Back !
Had a very busy summer , so did n't have much time to write or even check other folk 's blogs .
But now that Autumn is here and much of the harvest from my garden in , I have more time .
Note that I also changed my blog format which made me lose most of my links .
If you are not here , please do n't be offended .
I will try to restore the links section .
One of the typical arguments in favor of the state is that it is necessary to organize and control a large population and territory .
Stateless societies are fine for bands of 500 people who control a hundred square kilometers or so , but beyond that you need a state .
Three other arguments for the state claim that it is needed in complex societies , that large populations without a state are unstable and the state is a natural outgrowth of the development of farming .
Theory must be tested against evidence .
Contrary evidence is found among the original inhabitants of North America .
The Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy traditionally controlled a territory encompassing the lands to the west of Lake Champlain , stretching all the way down past Lake Erie , some 160,000 square kilometers .
Consider that Ireland is 70,000 sq. km. and you can understand the size of the Haudenosaunee territory .
I can find no estimated population figures , but there were towns of 2000 or more inhabitants , ( 1 ) total population must have numbered in the hundreds of thousands .
The Haudenosaunee dates back to the 12th Century
The Huron or Wendat Confederacy encompassed an area of about 32,000 sq km between lakes Huron , Ontario and Erie .
Consider that Belgium has only 30,000 sq. km .
Huron towns were also of several thousand inhabitants and the total population , while not as large as the Haudenosaunee , would have been significant .
" Huronia " dates back at least 1200 years .
The Salish or Hwulmuhw included Nanaimo , Cowichan , Victoria , Saanich , Gulf Islands and Lower Fraser Valley peoples .
They shared an informal confederacy based upon defense against the Kwakwakawak people from the north and on the common usage of the annual salmon migration on the lower Fraser River .
Population ?
The Cowichan alone had more than 5000 people in villages ranging from 120 to 1700 people in 1850 .
This was after previous epidemics must have reduced the population by 90 % .
Archeological evidence points out a cultural continuity in this area of at least 5000 years .
All three societies were complex , involving a host of different associations and fraternities as well as a rich oral literature , sophisticated philosophy , and in the case of the Hwulmuhw , magnificent wood carvings .
The Haudenosaunee and Wendat were farmers , growing the " Three Sisters " as well as tobacco and a number of other plants , both edible and medicinal .
The Hwulmuhw were mainly fishers , but also had large fields of camas , ( a bulb like a small potato ) and practiced permaculture with berries , fruit and nut trees .
None of these three examples of populous , large territoried , complex , horticultural ( or in the case of the Hwulmuhw , semi- horticultural ) societies involved a state , even in embryionic form .
The Hwulmuhw , for example , cooperated in food gathering , labour or defense , but " they were not obliged to do so by any formal village organization .
There was no village chief and no village council .
Co-operation was ad hoc . " ( 2 )
Nor does there seem to be any evidence of any impending " evolution " toward a state .
One would think that such evidence would be present in such a large polity as the Haudenosaunee Confederacy , if the state somehow naturally evolved out of a non-statist society .
Perhaps more than an evolution , the state is more like a virus that arose in one or two areas in the world and then gradually infected the rest of the planet .

On the occasion of this wonderful op - ed on how Barack Obama 's Nobel Peace Prize is a violation of our nation 's founding document , let us examine the recent crimes of the Washington Post opinion section .
Under editor Fred Hiatt , the Post op - ed page has gone completely off the rails .
They picked up Bill Kristol after the Times dumped him for being not just wrong but boring and lazy .
They openly allow George Will to lie , to straight - up lie , without fact - checking or corrections , because we all know reality is open to different " interpretations " and if a prominent columnist writes something patently untrue the best response is to then publish a " true " column by someone else as a counterpoint , because that does n't just represent everything misleading and terrible about the moden political press .
They still publish Richard Cohen .
The regular columnists are , for the most part , interchangeable ancient " moderate " liberals who have n't written or thought anything vaguely interesting since 1974 .
Anne Applebaum was allowed to publish a blog post in support of Roman Polanski without disclosing that her husband is Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski , who opposes extradition .
Richard Cohen , again .
And on October 10 , the Post published an insane editorial on how the Nobel Prize should 've been awarded to a murdered Iranian protester .
This suggests that either the entire editorial board does n't know that Nobel Peace Prizes are never awarded posthumously or they simply do n't give a shit .
The piece is still not corrected , because presumably any " correction " would have to read " the entire premise of this editorial is bullshit , sorry . "
So how do you follow that up ?
How about by running an op - ed by a law professor and a right - wing think tank goon about how Obama 's Nobel Peace Prize was ... unconstitutional , maybe ?
Who knows !
Who cares !
They acknowledge that two other sitting presidents have received the award , but they do not even do the meaningless - but - intellectually defensible thing of arguing that those awards were also unconstitutional , they just say this time it 's different because Obama got it so therefore Congress should forbid him from accepting it , because of the House of Saud .
In conclusion , blogs are killing newspapers by being irresponsible and not caring about " the truth . "
The family of an Adelaide man detained in the United Arab Emirates for swearing at an official is frustrated that he is still waiting for a court hearing .
Former soldier Sun McKay was arrested at the Dubai airport late last month , after he was accused of swearing at an airport policeman .
Mr McKay could face a three - year jail sentence .
His father , Richard McKay , says his son is not under arrest but his passport has been confiscated and he is runnning out of money .
He says the wait is frustrating .
" We were obviously shocked and quite concerned and we still are concerned and our concern grows daily .
The due process does n't appear to be in progress , " he said .
The Department of Foreign Affairs says Mr McKay also used insulting and inappropriate language towards consular staff soon after the airport incident .
The department says Mr McKay intially refused consular help , but has since requested assistance which will be provided .
The department says travellers are bound by the laws of the countries they visit and there is a limit to what the Australian Government can do .
Ten Questions for W. Scott Poole on Satan in America : The Devil We Know
What inspired you to write Satan in America ?
What sparked your interest ?
I ’ve joked that I would n’t have had to write a book about Satan if my parents had let me go see Ozzy back in 1985 .
I ’m not sure I ’m entirely kidding since I grew up in the 1980s when , as I describe in the book , the culture was seized with what scholars call “ the satanic panic . ”
Evangelicals ’ insistence that dark powers are at work everywhere in the culture has always had a huge fascination for me , and this book gave me the opportunity to trace the background of that fascination .
What ’s the most important take - home message for readers ?
I hope readers come away with two things .
First , that American popular religion and popular culture have tended to influence one another in very strange , but very real , ways .
The 1973 film The Exorcist has had enormous influence over how everyone from Pentecostal “ deliverance ministers ” to Roman Catholic priests understand exorcism .
Billy Graham , in a famous sermon in 1974 where he insisted that demonic presences lived in the very celluloid of the film , went on to describe demonic possession in exactly the same way the film had done .
Second , I hope to point out that America ’s historic sense of its own innocence and righteousness , and the concomitant belief that its enemies represent the demonic Other , helps explain our historic obsession with Satan .
The book ’s examination of the strange byways of American belief about the Devil is really a brief filed against the whole notion of American exceptionalism , the idea that we are somehow exempt from the terror and the moral complexities of history .
Is there anything you had to leave out ?
Yes .
In fact , my original conception was a book almost twice as long .
My publisher felt , obviously , that a three - hundred - page book would be much more accessible than the almost six hundred pages I envisioned .
This means I did n’t get to spend as much time on Satan in American literature as I had hoped ( though there are long sections on important figures like Hawthorne and Twain ) .
I think that I probably would have also , in a longer book , spent even more time on folklore , especially urban legend .
I did manage to include a discussion of the Jersey Devil that connects those stories to misogynistic assumptions about women and their bodies .
Readers will also find a discussion of the Proctor and Gamble legend that still gets recycled , the bizarre rumor that an unnamed P&G executive appeared on a talk show ( at one time the claim was it was The Phil Donahue Show , later it became Oprah ) and asserted that P&G gave part of their profits to the Church of Satan .
This falsehood has circulated for a couple of decades and really has only abated in the last few years .
There are lots more of those urban legends out there and I wish I had had the space to fit them , and an analysis of them , into the book .
What are some of the biggest misconceptions about your topic ?
Darren Oldridge , a major scholar of the European witch hunts , published a book recently called Strange Histories that details some of the more peculiar beliefs held by people in the medieval and Renaissance periods and tries to explain them in their historical context .
He says at one point that the book is not to be read as a “ freakshow of misconceived opinion . ”
I feel the same way about my work .
I ’m fearful that it will be read by some educated liberals as simply a catalog of bizarriana rather than a study of a theological narrative that has shaped American religion , pop culture , and even , in some cases public policy .
The book makes the case that a significant number of Americans believe in the same Devil believed in by Puritan preachers and 19th - century evangelists .
This can not be dismissed .
Its essential to understand why this is so , what historical conditions gave rise to this phenomenon and what does it tell us about the United States .
Did you have a specific audience in mind when writing ?
I had several groups in mind , all of which I think will be interested and challenged by the book .
For example , I am fascinated by the growing number of pop culture addicts who want to examine how their interest in fantasy , science fiction , horror , and the fantastic in general connects to theology , popular religion , and the sacred more generally .
There is a real and growing audience out there for this approach as evidenced by Gary Laderman ’s book Sacred Matters , Joseph Laycock ’s very interesting study Vampires Today , and sites like John W. Morehead ’s Theofantastique that examines the borderlands between theology , horror , and the sacred .
I also aimed the book at scholars of American religion in general .
I think that they will find it useful to pair the book with some of the new cultural studies of Jesus in America by Stephen Prothero or Richard Wrightman Fox .
I think that scholars of American religion will find that looking at beliefs about the Devil opens up a new way of seeing old topics , from the Great Awakening to the twentieth - century decline of mainline churches .
Are you hoping to just inform readers ?
Give them pleasure ?
Piss them off ?
All three .
The more you learn about how the Devil has been used in American history , the more pissed off you will be .
I really try in the book to argue that beliefs about the American Devil are linked to constructions of true womanhood ; true religion and fervent patriotism have ended in hatred , oppression , marginalization and persecution .
This stuff should piss you off and if it does n’t , to paraphrase the old saying , you are not paying attention .
I do think that those who enjoy and consume vast quantities of pop culture will get a lot of pleasure out of this book ( while they are possibly getting pissed off as well ) .
Fans of everything from the blues to Buffy the Vampire Slayer will enjoy the weird angle on their favorite cultural obsessions .
What alternative title would you give the book ?
I wanted to call it American Satan : A Secret History .
I thought this conveyed the sense that this is a cultural history rather than a theological work of some kind ( its my great fear that some will think the book is the latter ) .
My publisher really pushed for the title change and I understand why — it ’s striking and conveys the sense that the Devil created by American culture is made in the image of American culture .
How do you feel about the cover ?
I do love the cover .
I hope readers note that there is a Highway 666 that runs through several western states .
Not surprisingly , hosts of urban legends have grown up around it .
Is there a book out there you wish you had written ?
Definitely Stephen Prothero ’s American Jesus : How the Son of God became a National Icon .
I obviously love this kind of national history , and it amazes me is how he manages to write not only a history of Jesus in American culture , but really a new kind of history of American religion that is challenging enough for scholars but also accessible to undergraduates and the general public .
It ’s an amazing work .
Frankly , anything Prothero has ever written would be my pick .
What ’s your next book ?
I plan to continue my collaboration with dark powers .
In fact , I am , hopefully , not yet done with Satan .
I am in very early talks with an accomplished documentary filmmaker about turning the book into a film or perhaps a documentary series .
It ’s too soon to pass along any details , but I am hopeful .
For my next book , I plan to examine the role of the monster in American history and try to consider what American beliefs about monstrosity tell us about things like American conceptions of sexuality , disease , religion , and race .
I ’ve given some thought to focusing primarily on popular culture — maybe a focus entirely on film .

For people on both sides of the health care reform war , the battle to create a public option is a ground zero .
For conservatives , a government - run insurance plan means slouching toward socialism .
For liberals , it 's the only thing that can provide affordable care for millions of Americans and bargain down costs at the same time .
( To others in the middle , the benefits of a government run plan are entirely overblown . )
Today the Senate Finance Committee will take up the public option in its markup of the health care bill .
What should we expect ?
Joshua Green has an excellent overview at the Atlantic Wire .
The main story is n't the war between Republicans and Democrats , but the civil war within the Democratic ranks .
Still , he seems to suggest , today wo n't be so much the conclusive Appomattox of the public option war , but rather the Gettysburg -- an inflection point that could boost liberal Democrats ' morale if they see the plan 's defenders standing ground in the trenches .
Sen . Jay Rockefeller , the main public option 's general , is expected to lead the charge for a couple public option amendments to Max Baucus ' bill , which currently allows for only state - by - state co-ops .
Republican Olympia
Snow could also introduce a public option " trigger " amendment .
That would allow the government to create public options within states if private insurance companies fail to provide affordable or comprehensive coverage .
But truly , nobody really expects the public option to make its way into the Baucus bill today .
One of the central struggles I see with including a public option is between ( 1 ) Congress ' instinct is to be incremental and ( 2 ) a successful public option has to be big .
The CBO estimates that by 2019 , the public plan in the House might enroll 10 million Americans if it extended to employers with 50 employees .
That 's not going to give it much leverage to push prices down .
In fact it bends the cost curve up .
It will be interesting to see how the Senate 's amendments differ .

Top down driving can be too noisy Driving a convertible car can seriously damage your ears , experts have warned .
Cruising with the top down at speeds of 50 - 70 mph ( 80 - 112 km / h ) exposes the ears to sound levels sometimes nearing those made by a pneumatic drill , they argue .
Long or repeated exposure to this noise of the engine , road , traffic and wind could cause permanent hearing loss , a US meeting of ENT experts was told .
Researchers said convertible drivers should consider wearing some form of ear protection , as motorcyclists do .
The research has been published in the journal Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery .
In the study , noise levels immediately to the left and right of the driver were measured while travelling at different speeds .
At 50 , 60 and 70 miles per hour , the noise reached between 88 and 90 decibels - higher than the generally agreed 85 decibel threshold level at which permanent hearing damage becomes a risk .
Noise levels A quiet room at night - 20 decibels
An ordinary spoken conversation - 60 decibels A busy street - 70 decibels Shouting - 80 decibels A pneumatic drill - 110 decibels Aircraft taking off - 130 decibels Source : The Royal National Institute for Deaf People
The researchers repeated the test with a range of convertibles , on the same stretch of motorway , outside of rush hour , and found the same noise levels - around 90 decibels , with a high of 99 decibels .
But they also found motorists can cut the noise by rolling up the windows when driving with the top down .
This simple measure cut the level to 82 decibels .
Experts warned that the damage to hearing builds up gradually and the effects may not be noticed until years later , when it is too late .
Dr Mark Downs , of the Royal National Institute for Deaf People , said : " Noise - induced hearing loss is frequently preventable .
" Regular exposure to noise levels of 88 - 90 decibels when driving a convertible for several hours a day can lead to permanent hearing loss over time .
" By winding up the windows or wearing basic ear protection , such as earplugs , drivers of convertibles can still enjoy driving whilst protecting their hearing . "

University of Calgary men's hockey coachannounced Tuesday that former NHLers Cory Cross and Brad Isbister will join the Dinos coaching staff for the 2009 - 10 varsity season .
Cross , who played varsity hockey with Howell at the University of Alberta in the early 1990s , will be the team 's full - time assistant this season and work primarily with the defencemen , while Isbister will work with the forwards .
“ I know our players are really excited about having these guys around , and having two former NHLers will bring credibility to our program and our players , ” said Howell .
“ Not only have they both played in the NHL , but they have both played internationally as well and so they understand what we have in front of us as far as playing on the big ice at Father David Bauer .
“ It 's not just about having former NHLers .
They 're both very sincere about this , about being around and teaching our guys , and helping our players .
” Cross and Isbister bring 23 years of National Hockey League experience between them .
After a three - year career with the Golden Bears , Cross spent three seasons with the Atlanta Knights of the International Hockey League , making his NHL debut with Tampa Bay in the 1993 - 94 season .
He stayed with the Lightning until 1999 before moving to Toronto for three seasons .
He also made stops in New York , Edmonton , and Pittsburgh before playing his final NHL season with the Detroit Red Wings in 2005 - 06 .
After a year in Hamburg , Germany , Cross retired and moved to Kelowna , where he became a partner in an oil and gas servicing company .
He worked with Howell part - time with the BJHL's Westside Warriors , which made the transition to the University of Calgary a natural one .
“ I have always wanted to get into coaching , and when Mark got the job ( in Calgary ) we spoke about the possibility of me helping out , ” said the Lloydminster , Alta. native .
“ It will definitely be different being on the Calgary side of the Battle of Alberta , but this is a great opportunity to get a foot in the coaching door .
” “ I 've known Cory for 15 years , since we played together at the U of A , ” said Howell , who was hired in June 2009 .
“ He 's very passionate about hockey , and he understands the whole university scheme and the importance of not only development but also getting a good education .
Having someone I was comfortable with was important , and having seen him work with other players I know he 's a great communicator and will do a great job with our guys .
” Brad Isbister retired after spending the 2008 - 09 season with Zug in the Swiss league .
A native of Edmonton , the 6 - foot - 4 left winger broke into the NHL with the Phoenix Coyotes in 1997 .
His longest stint came with the New York Islanders from 1999 until 2003 , when he was traded to his hometown Oilers .
After single seasons with Boston and the New York Rangers , Isbister saw his last NHL action in 2007 - 08 , playing 55 games with the Vancouver Canucks .
“ Brad kind of fell into our laps when we found out he was retiring , ” said Howell .
“ He does n't have as much coaching experience , but he has proven that he can score and play at a high level and our guys are going to respect that , for sure .
” The Dinos hit the ice at the SAIT Eyeopener tournament Sept. 25 - 26 , followed a week later by a three - game non-conference swing through Colorado , where they will take on Colorado College , Denver , and Air Force .
It all begins for real when Howell will take on his former team and alma mater , the University of Alberta Golden Bears , in a home - and - home series that opens Friday , Oct. 9 at Father David Bauer Arena .

Sainsbury 's now says there is no risk from unpasteurised cheddar A supermarket has apologised to one of its customers after she was told she could not have unpasteurised Cheddar cheese because she was pregnant .
Janet Lehain , 31 , asked for the mature cheese at the deli counter in a Sainsbury 's store in Bedford last week .
But Ms Lehain 's server told her she should have another type of Cheddar .
In a letter of complaint , she described it as " the most patronising encounter I have had the misfortune of experiencing in a long time " .
She said she only succeeded in persuading the member of staff at the Fairfield Park store to sell her the cheese by promising not to eat any of it herself .
" I was very surprised , " the mother - of - two said .
It 's the nanny state gone crazy
Janet Lehain
" She went beyond telling me it was unpasteurised and insisted I should have a different type of Cheddar . "
In her letter of complaint , Ms Lehain pointed out that the warning to pregnant women about unpasteurised cheese relates especially to the first three months of pregnancy .
She is six months pregnant .
" It 's the nanny state gone crazy .
Someone in Sainsbury 's is not a medical expert and so is not qualified to start handing out medical advice . "
Sainsbury 's said it did not have a policy of refusing sale of goods on the grounds that they might be unsuitable for pregnant women .
But it said it did ask staff to make customers aware of any safety concerns .
A spokesman said : " We apologise to the customer for any offence caused .
" In this case , our colleague made a mistake - unpasteurised Cheddar does not pose a risk to health during pregnancy . "

Click to viewWindows only : Rip and back up any DVD to your hard drive with DVD Rip , a freeware Windows application that automates the entire DVD - to - hard - drive backup process .
All you need to do is insert your DVD , run DVD Rip , and let it take care of the rest .
Why ?
A while back I explained why I 'd soured on optical media , the gist of which was the ease with with DVDs are damaged .
Sick of scratched , skippy DVDs , I put together a simple AutoHotkey script that automated DVD rips in conjunction with a freeware application called DVD Shrink .
I 've since gone back and drastically improved the original DVD Rip application complete with options and improved automation .

DVD Rip Automated DVD Backup
Advertisement
Version : 0.2
Released : February 12 , 2008
Creator : Adam Pash
License : DVD Rip is licensed under the GNU Public License .
If you 'd like to take a look at the source , you can download it here .
What it does : Automates the process of ripping and backing up DVDs to your hard drive in conjunction with the freeware application DVD Shrink .
See the video below for a better idea of how it works .
Again , DVD Shrink is the application doing the actual ripping .
DVD
Rip just makes the process completely painless .
I originally created it so that I could insert a DVD in my media center PC , run DVD Rip from the media center , and then let everything rip in the background .
DVD
Shrink normally compresses the DVD image by about half , so you retain the entire menu structure while taking much less space .
Advertisement
As I said above , the reason I rip every DVD is to avoid dealing with scratches .
Normally a rip will smooth over those unreadable section without any issue , so after DVD Rip and DVD Shrink are finished , it 's going to be a perfect , playable copy .
Installation
DVD Rip is distributed as a simple executable , which means there 's nothing to install .
Just drag the DVD Rip.exe file to wherever you want it to live ( might I recommend C: \Program Files \DVD Rip\ ) and double - click the application whenever you want to rip a new DVD .

How It Works
Advertisement
The first time you run DVD Rip , you 'll need to configure a few settings — telling it where you want to save DVDs by default , whether you want to use the default DVD title as it's displayed in your DVD drive ( like D: \THIS_DVD ) or manually set the title ( like in the video ) , and a few more .
If this is starting to sound tedious for an application that 's supposed to take all of the pain out of DVD backup , do n't worry — you only need to go through the settings the first time you run the application .
After that they wo n't show up again ( unless you hold the Shift key when you run the application , which you would do if you decided you wanted to adjust a setting ) .
Roadmap
The initial release of DVD Rip only handles ripping DVDs complete with menus to your hard drive .
That may be enough for some people ( it is for me ) , but others would like to go the next step and copy the DVD to a blank DVD .
I 'm looking into adding automation for backing up the DVD to a blank DVD with the open source application ImgBurn .
Advertisement
Also , you can play your ripped DVDs ( menus and all ) with VLC , and it works like a charm , but I 'm looking into a similar helper application for managing and playing your ripped DVDs .

The cross platform digital media Swiss Army knife VLC can play just about any filetype you throw at Read more

Lastly , I 'm looking into methods for adding DVD Rip to the Windows Autoplay menu .
I never watch DVDs on my computer before ripping them , so if I 'm putting a DVD movie in the drive , it 's to rip it .
With a DVD Rip option in the Autoplay menu , you could set your computer to automatically devour any DVD movie you inserted in your computer .
This may or may not be your cup of tea , but if you 're big on backing up DVDs and — like me — you never put a DVD in your drive with the intention of watching it then and there , it could be useful .
Changelog
Version 0.1 : Released
Version 0.2 : Added GUI options , improved reliability and portability
Bug Reports and Feature Requests
DVD Rip works like a charm on my Vista and XP computers , but that 's really the only place it 's been tested , so there may very well be a few bugs here and there that need to be worked out .
If you 've got feature requests or bug reports , I 'd love to hear them in the comments .

The < canvas > tag is the current fangled way of displaying vector graphics in a web browser .
Before , all graphics were images , Flash animations , or even thousands of one - pixel < div>s .
Finally , Internet browsers have caught up to the 1970s and will be able to draw lines and curves programmatically , and you do n't have to pay $ 699 USD for the priviledge .
At the time of this writing , Internet Explorer at version 8.0 still lacks the < canvas > tag .
But you can easily add the capability by including a short javascript file in your page .
At first glance , that 's astounding .
How do you implement an entire vector graphics API in a few lines of Javascript ?
Actually , IE has had the ability to do vector graphics for years .
For IE 5.0 , Microsoft was aware at how useful it would be , and also keenly aware of how long standardization takes , so they went ahead and implemented something called VML ( Vector Markup Language ) , after it had been submitted to the standards process .
SVG is simply VML ( combined with some competing submissions ) after it went through the process of being standardized .
For example , this code will draw an ellipse in VML .
< style > v : * { behavior:url ( #default # VML ) ; display : inline - block }</style > < xml:namespace ns=" urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml " prefix= " v " /> < v:oval style = " width :100 pt;height:50 pt " fillcolor= " red " > </v:oval >
In 2005 , Emil A Eklund created a simple translation layer in Javascript that emulates canvas .
IE does n’t support SVG natively either , it does support something called VML though , and it ’s been around since the 5.0 days , if I remember correctly .
VML does pretty much the same thing as SVG ( as far as basic drawing is concerned ) .
Using VML , in combination with behaviors , it should therefor be possible to emulate a subset of SVG or Canvas in IE .
That ’s the idea I got a few days ago when working on a basic drawing abstraction , and according to Google a few others have thought along those lines as well .
Could n’t find any actual implementation though so I decided to make my own , how hard could it be ?
If such implementation could be created it would open up the world of client side drawing to web site developers and allow all kind of neat widgets to be developed .
So there is it .
The ExplorerCanvas script is n't magic .
It inserts VML tags into your web page when you call its various drawing routines .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Roughly $ 211 billion separates what the country owes and its self - imposed credit limit .
And by Friday , after another week of massive debt sales by the Treasury Department , that gap will likely have narrowed considerably .
It is now expected that the $ 12.104 trillion debt ceiling could be breached by the end of November .
It is also expected that lawmakers will raise the ceiling , as they have done more than 90 times since 1940 -- eight of them since 2002 .
If they do n't , the government could be forced to shut down .
But that 's not the worst that could happen .
In fact , the government did shut down for a spell in 1995 and life went on .
The reason lawmakers will eventually approve an increase is because without one ultimately the value of U.S. bonds would sink , jeopardizing the portfolios of countries and investors around the world who invest in U.S. debt .
It makes life a whole lot easier for folks at Treasury if lawmakers take that vote before the ceiling is breached -- and they usually do .
But there have been times when Congress voted to raise the limit after it was pierced , according to a recent Standard & Poor 's report .
If they do n't do so before the breach , " the U.S. Treasury must engage in some legerdemain to create additional headroom , " wrote Standard & Poor 's managing director John Chambers .
The department has a few options -- but all of them are limited and very short - term .
One House Democratic leadership aide said Treasury told congressional staff the steps they can take " will only cover two weeks at most and potentially even less , depending on the timing . "
Treasury can , for instance , draw on $ 113 billion in government securities currently held in a 401 ( k ) - type plan for federal employees , according to the S&P report .
Then there 's another $ 3 billion or so that can be tapped monthly from a Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund .
Any money taken from those funds would need to be repaid with interest .
Then there 's the option of selling $ 16 billion worth of the government 's dollar holdings in a special currency stabilization fund .
And in a real pinch , S&P notes , Treasury really wanted to it could sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt , worth about $ 165 billion at the end of September .
But consider that option a non-starter .
" If the Treasury were to liquidate these fiscal assets , the sale could disrupt the very markets the original purchases had intended to calm , " Chambers wrote .
Beyond that , it 's all about saying " no " to others .
Specifically , " no " to any part of the federal government interested in , say , keeping the lights on .
While no one doubts the Senate will vote to increase the debt ceiling -- the House in effect has already done so -- it 's not clear yet when exactly lawmakers will act .
Initially the plan was to vote on the debt limit after work on health reform wrapped up .
But since that is taking longer than Democrats originally hoped , the vote may have to come before .
Whenever it comes , there will be a group of lawmakers pushing for more to be done to control the country 's debt situation than simply raising a self - imposed cap every year or two .
Noting that current policies are on track to add another $ 10 trillion to the U.S. debt load over the next decade , a group of Democratic senators wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , two weeks ago calling for a new process to be put in place to address long - term fiscal imbalances .
" We do not believe that action on these important issues will occur under the regular order in Congress . "

The number of articles and opinions on Goldman Sachs earnings , bonuses , and influence peddling over the past several days is quite stunning .
Many have pointed out the problems ; few have expressed outrage over what is happening in general , not just at Goldman Sachs .
Let 's take a look .
My take is at the end .
Letting The Dice Roll
Rolfe Winkler at Contingent Capital is writing Letting Goldman Roll The Dice .
Is Goldman really such an indispensable financial intermediary ?
One look at the firm ’s revenue breakdown shows that it ’s more casino than anything else , and some of the markets it makes still put the economy in danger .
Goldman , in other words , generates most of its revenue trading its own money and earning vigorish on customer transactions .
It ’s a hybrid hedge fund and bookie , with an investment bank and asset management business thrown in for good measure .
With that in mind , one is left to wonder whether Goldman was really worth saving last year .
What have taxpayers received for the $ 50 billion worth of cash and guarantees , for giving Goldman access to the Federal Reserve as its lender of last resort ?
Saving Goldman was largely about saving the derivatives market , which is so big and unstable that the death of one counterparty could mean the death of all .
With big commercial banks like JPMorgan Chase in deep , saving the derivatives business was as much about protecting depositors and maintaining the integrity of the payment system as it was derivatives themselves .
To Goldman ’s credit , they ’ve rebuilt their capital levels faster than anyone .
Their leverage ratio has fallen from 35 to 16 in less than two years , despite pressure from equity analysts to juice returns by deploying “ excess capital ” .
But at $ 50 billion , the bank ’s mark - to - myth , or level 3 , assets remain as high as its tangible common equity , the cushion it has to absorb losses .
Wall Street and its protectors at the Fed and Treasury tell us the bailout was necessary to protect the financial system , to protect Main Street .
That may be .
But Main Street still owns much of the risk while Wall Street gets all of the profit .
Geithner 's Appointment Book
As Treasury secretary in the aftermath of last fall ’s Wall Street meltdown , Timothy F. Geithner needs to keep in touch with the nation ’s top bankers .
But it seems that he connects with some financial chiefs much more often than others .
An analysis of Mr. Geithner ’s calendars , which the Associated Press obtained through the Freedom of Information Act , shows that Mr. Geithner had contact with top executives at Citigroup , Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase more than 80 times during his first seven months at Treasury — while the heads of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley appeared on his calendars a total of just six times .
The Associated Press describes one spring evening when Mr. Geithner had a series of particularly high - powered calls :
After one hectic week in May in which the nation faced the looming bankruptcy of General Motors and the prospect that the government would take over the automaker , Mr. Geithner wrapped up his night with a series of phone calls .
First he called Lloyd Blankfein , the chairman and C.E.O. at Goldman .
Then he called Jamie Dimon , the boss at JPMorgan .
Obama called next , and as soon as they hung up , Mr. Geithner was back on the phone with Mr. Dimon .
How Goldman Sachs Leveraged $ 70 Billion In Government Money
Guess which two Wall Street banks were acting as informal agents of the government in order to support the bond and stock markets and reinflate them ?
Two big banks that are showing record trading profits , and a small group of enablers and assistants .
Exchange Stabilization Fund - wise , its a near layup when the US fronts you the money and then works with you to take the markets higher .
Especially when it is on thin volumes based on ' news ' which you help to create and control via frequent calls to young
Tim who is your coordinator , in addition to all your other well - placed backchannel sources .
You get a heads up , you use the futures to prop the markets .
You need some good news , some can be arranged .
Just like the good old days when Timmy was riding herd on the NY Fed desk .
All for the good of the country .
And if you happen to make a billion per month in trading profits , well , that is the price of freedom for a job well done .
Max Keiser On Fraud
The Goldman Tithe
So Goldman Sachs is now concerned its company has a perception problem ?
They are even going to undertake a huge public relations offensive to turn things around ?
Well they sure have plenty of money to throw at this problem .
For sure , Goldman Sachs bankers work hard at creating value for their customers and shareholders .
And their success should be rewarded .
But a report that the firm had set aside about $ 20 billion for employee bonuses has caused a backlash .
Critics say that Goldman Sachs is just back to its old money making ways .
Sadly Goldman
Sachs does n't really care what Main Street thinks .
Rather they are concerned what Congress or the U.S. Government might do .
The projected 2009 Goldman Sachs bonus pool will be around $ 20 billion , a near record amount .
Therefore the average pay out per employee could be more than the $ 661,490 given in 2007 .
Memo to Goldman Sachs : most Americans do n't make that much in a lifetime of working .
This year Goldman Sachs should tithe .
Take 10 % right off the top of the bonus pool , or $ 2 billion , and donate it to rebuilding New Orleans and the Gulf Coast of Mississippi and Alabama .
Tap into their own brainpower to develop a plan to target the money on specific worthwhile projects so it does not get diverted to corrupt contractors and politicians .
For starters , money could be used to rebuild the 9th ward of New Orleans , and devastated sections of Biloxi and Bay St. Louis , Mississippi .
Subsequently , Goldman Sachs should donate 10 % of their bonus pool each year to a particular cause , helping injured and needy US military veterans , underwriting national after school programs designed to keep kids off the streets and out of trouble , curing diseases and the list goes on .
The US taxpayers supported the financial community when its collapse was imminent .
Now it is time for financial institutions to help their country in its time of need .
Goldman 's Public Relations Bind
Goldman executives are perplexed by the resentment directed at their bank and contend the criticism is unjustified .
But they find themselves in the uncomfortable position of defending Goldman ’s blowout profits and the outsize paydays that are the hallmark of its success .
For Goldman employees , it is almost as if the financial crisis never happened .
Only months after paying back billions of taxpayer dollars , Goldman Sachs is on pace to pay annual bonuses that will rival the record payouts that it made in 2007 , at the height of the bubble .
In the last nine months , the bank set aside about $ 16.7 billion for compensation — on track to pay each of its 31,700 employees close to $ 700,000 this year .
Top producers are expecting multimillion - dollar paydays .
Goldman employees reaped rewards that most people can only dream about .
Goldman paid out $ 4.82 billion in bonuses last year , awarding 953 employees at least $ 1 million each and 78 executives $ 5 million or more .
The rewards for 2009 will be far greater .
Goldman executives know they have a public opinion problem , and they are trying to figure out what to do about it — as long as it does not involve actually cutting pay .
Another Goldman Executive Named To Key Government Post
Apparently , the U.S. government did n't have enough Goldman Sachs executives in key financial and regulatory positions so Goldman Exec Named First COO of SEC Enforcement .
In October of last year , a Goldman Sachs Vice President , Neel Kashkari , was named by former Goldman CEO and then - Treasury Secretary Hank Pauslon to oversee the $ 700 billion TARP bailout .
In January of this year , Tim Geithner hired a former Goldman Sachs lobbyist , Mark Patterson , to be his top aide and Chief of Staff .
In March , President Obama nominated Goldman Sachs executive Gary Gensler to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which regulates futures markets , even though ( or " because " )
Gensler confessed to lax regulation during the Clinton administration over the very derivative instruments that caused the financial crisis .
In April , Goldman hired as its top lobbyist Michael Paese , the top aide to Rep. Barney Frank on the House Financial Services Committee which Frank chairs .
According to ABC News in October , 2008 , Goldman " spent more than $ 43 million dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions to cultivate friends and buy influence in Washington , D.C. since 1989 " and their " bankers have been the country 's top political campaign contributors this year . "
" They are almost in a class by themselves , " said Sheila Krumholz , the executive director for the Center for Responsive Politics .
As Michael Moore has been pointing out , Goldman was the number one source of funding for the Obama 2008 presidential campaign .
The bailout of AIG -- which resulted in massive federal government monies to Goldman -- was engineered at a meeting between Paulson , Geithner and Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein .
Last year , Goldman paid top Obama economics adviser Larry Summers $ 135,000 for a one - day visit to Goldman .
That the administration continues , so brazenly , to place Goldman Sachs executives in the very government positions with the greatest power over the financial industry illustrates how little effort is devoted to hiding what is really taking place .
Adam Storch COO of the SEC
Storch graduated from SUNY Buffalo .
During college he did a stint as a summer intern at Neuberger Berman and worked at Deloitte & Touche for two years after graduating .
Storch then went to NYU 's Stern School of Business .
This lead to a job at Goldman , where he worked for the last five years .
Derivatives Bill ’s Loophole May Exempt Most Firms
Legislation by Representative Barney Frank to tighten derivatives regulation contains an exemption that may let most financial firms escape new collateral and disclosure rules , the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said .
A plan offered by the Obama administration would subject all swaps dealers and “ major market participants ” to new regulations for capital , business conduct , record - keeping and reporting .
Frank ’s version would exempt corporations from that definition if they use derivatives for “ risk management ” purposes .
“ It is clearly the weakest of all the proposals I ’ve seen to date , ” said Christopher Whalen , managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics in Torrance , California , in an interview before the hearing .
Whalen , who has testified before Congress on derivatives regulation , is an independent bank analyst .
“ Frank ’s committee seems to be intent on gutting any meaningful reform . ”
The draft would ease trading and clearing requirements for derivatives dealers such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , compared with the administration ’s proposal .
The Rich Have Stolen the Economy
Bloomberg reports that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’s closest aides earned millions of dollars a year working for Goldman Sachs , Citigroup and other Wall Street firms .
Bloomberg adds that none of these aides faced Senate confirmation .
Yet , they are overseeing the handout of hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer funds to their former employers .
The gifts of billions of dollars of taxpayers ’ money provided the banks with an abundance of low cost capital that has boosted the banks ’ profits , while the taxpayers who provided the capital are increasingly unemployed and homeless .
Except for the banksters and the offshoring CEOs , there is no source of consumer demand to drive the US economy .
The political system is unresponsive to the American people .
It is monopolized by a few powerful interest groups that control campaign contributions .
Interest groups have exercised their power to monopolize the economy for the benefit of themselves , the American people be damned .

Tenacious Goldman
On the weekend of September 12 , 2008 , as the financial system shuddered and appeared to be on the verge of lurching to a halt , two Goldman Sachs men , former CEO Hank Paulson and current CEO Lloyd Blankfein , huddled with other banking heads at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to consider how to stave off disaster .
Bear Stearns was dead .
Merrill Lynch , run by another former Goldman man , John Thain , was in desperate need of a savior .
And now Lehman Brothers was on the brink .
As secretary of the Treasury , Paulson asked the banks to come up with a private - funding solution for Lehman before it imploded from lack of cash .
But all the banks had been scrambling for cash reserves or strategic mergers to buffer against a rapid freeze in lending .
No one was able , or willing , to help .
And Paulson , a free - market purist , had made one thing clear up front :
The government would not bail out the firm .
Lehman Brothers , a longtime Goldman rival , prepared to declare bankruptcy , ending its 158 - year run on Wall Street .
By Sunday night , Paulson realized he had an even bigger problem : the insurance giant AIG .
AIG had sold billions in credit - default swaps to several major banks , what amounted to unregulated insurance on risky subprime - mortgage investments , the very ones that were bringing down the economy .
Hank Paulson and then–New York Fed chief Tim Geithner called an emergency meeting for the following Monday morning at the Federal Reserve Bank , ostensibly to discuss whether a private banking syndicate could be established to save AIG — one in which Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase , two of the ailing insurance giant ’s clients , would play prominent roles .
At the meeting , it was hard to discern where concerns over AIG ’s collapse ended and concern for Goldman Sachs began :
Among the 40 or so people in attendance , Goldman Sachs was on every side of the large conference table , with “ triple ” the number of representatives as other banks , says another person who was there .
The entourage was led by the bank ’s top brass : CEO Blankfein , co-chief operating officer Jon Winkelried , investment - banking head David Solomon , and its top merchant - banking executive Richard Friedman — all of whom had worked closely with Hank Paulson two years prior .
By contrast , JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon did not attend .
The Goldman domination of the meetings might not have raised eyebrows if a private solution had been forthcoming .
But on Tuesday , Paulson reversed course and announced that the government would step in and save AIG , spending $ 85 billion in government money to buy a majority stake .
Of the $ 52 billion paid to AIG ’s counterparties , Goldman Sachs was the biggest recipient : $ 13 billion , the entire balance of its claim .
The amount was surprising : Banks like Merrill Lynch that had bought credit - default swaps from failed insurers other than AIG were paid 13 cents on the dollar in deals moderated by New York ’s insurance regulator .
Eric Dinallo , the former New York State insurance commissioner , who was at the AIG meetings , characterizes the decision this way : AIG ’s counterparties , Goldman being the most prominent , “ got to collect on an insurance policy without having the loss . ”
Somehow not recognizing ( or perhaps not caring about ) the brewing backlash , Paulson continued to appoint Goldman Sachs alumni to positions of power after the AIG decision — he named Edward C. Forst , a former head of Goldman ’s investment - management division , to help draft the $ 700 billion Toxic Asset Relief Program ( of which $ 10 billion went to Goldman Sachs ) , and then Neel Kashkari , a former Goldman V.P. , as the TARP manager .
And of course Edward Liddy , former Goldman board member , was already serving as the new CEO of AIG .
Suddenly , everywhere you looked , men who had passed through the Goldman gauntlet of loyalty and rewards were now in key positions overseeing the rescue of the financial system .
The company was earning its nickname : “ Government Sachs . ”
Both Rogers and Paulson ( who ’s publishing a book this fall that will presumably attempt to justify his decisions and save his damaged legacy ) have argued that the AIG decision was about saving the system as a whole , not Goldman in particular .
Similarly , they say , when it came to AIG , the firm was “ prudent ” in hedging its bets , buying credit - default swaps from Bank of America , JPMorgan , Société Générale and other banks in case AIG failed to pay the money it owed Goldman — in effect , hedging its hedge against the mortgage market .
Goldman Sachs had no “ material exposure ” to AIG , they argue .
One senior executive goes so far as to suggest the firm might even have benefited from AIG ’s demise .
“ We might have done very well , ” he says , “ but I would n’t be so presumptuous as to say that .
Who knows ? ”
Not a single Wall Street executive I spoke with , including several Goldman Sachs alumni , believe those hedges would have survived an overall collapse of the financial system .
A large loss would have been inevitable as lending evaporated , and Goldman Sachs would have struggled to shrink the company to a fraction of its size overnight .
But the most glaring argument against Goldman is Goldman ’s own :
If AIG ’s biggest and most important bank customer was hedged against losses in AIG , as it claims , why did the government need to pay Goldman Sachs the full $ 13 billion ?
Lost in the haze of Goldman ’s recent record profits is the fact that the firm nearly went under even after the AIG bailout last fall .
As the market continued to plunge and Goldman ’s stock price nose - dived , people inside the firm “ were freaking out , ” says a former Goldman executive who maintains close ties to the company .
Salvation came on November 25 , a few days after Goldman ’s stock price plunged to $ 52 a share , down from the year ’s high of $ 200 and the lowest price the company had seen since it went public .
Again , the white knight was the government .
It turned out that Goldman ’s conversion to a garden - variety bank - holding company offered an amazing advantage : Goldman now had access to incredibly cheap money .
Exploiting its new status , Goldman became the first financial institution to sell $ 5 billion in government - backed bonds through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which allowed Goldman to start doing deals when the markets were at a near standstill .
Those FDIC notes they got were lifesaving because they could n’t issue any debt .
If it had gone on another week or two , Goldman would have failed , they would have gone the way of Lehman , and you ’d be talking about Lloyd the way you talk about [ Lehman CEO ] Dick Fuld . ”
Even Goldman alumni were struck by the company ’s shameless posture in ramping up the leverage again so soon after the government bailouts .
“ It ’s a statement of arrogance , ” says one former executive .
Goldman claims that there is a Chinese Wall between the advisory business and the trading business .
“ There are rules and laws regarding information sharing , and we scrupulously follow them , ” says a company spokesman .
But two former clients told me they had observed firsthand how Goldman traded against their interests to improve its own bottom line — one who did n’t like it , the other accepting it with a shrug and saying , admiringly , that Goldman ’s ability to convince the world that it is a “ client - oriented ” business was its most masterful PR coup .
Goldman ’s profiting from this ethical gray area was exemplified by the real - estate market and the subprime - mortgage collapse : Goldman Sachs sold subprime - mortgage investments to its clients for years , but then in 2006 began trading against subprime on its own balance sheet without informing its clients , a hedge that ultimately let it profit when the real - estate market cratered .
For some , this was a prescient call ; for others , a glaring conflict of interest and inherently dishonest , since the firm let its clients take the fall .
Earlier this month , Goldman had an ex-employee arrested for allegedly stealing computer codes that could be used , as the prosecutor noted , “ to manipulate markets in unfair ways . ”
Some hedge - fund traders and financial bloggers have speculated that Goldman itself could have been using the codes for the same purpose .
Now attention is turning to Goldman ’s dominance of trading on the New York Stock Exchange — as the exchange ’s biggest high - speed program trader as well as a provider of liquidity to other traders — and whether that ubiquity has afforded the firm undue advantage .
If Goldman ’s database knows nearly every trade that is about to be made , sophisticated computer codes could , theoretically , instantly execute fail - safe trades on Goldman ’s behalf milliseconds beforehand .
This , some are insisting , is where the company is manipulating the markets and making hundreds of millions of dollars a day .

Where 's The Outrage ?
A year after the crisis struck , many of the industry ’s behemoths  those institutions deemed too big to fail  are , in fact , getting bigger , not smaller .
For many of them , it is business as usual .
Over the last decade the financial sector was the fastest - growing part of the economy , with two - thirds of growth in gross domestic product attributable to incomes of workers in finance .
Now , the industry has new tools at its disposal , courtesy of the government .
With interest rates so low , banks can borrow money cheaply and put those funds to work in lucrative ways , whether using the money to make loans to companies at higher rates , or to speculate in the markets .
Fixed - income trading  an area that includes bonds and currencies  has been particularly profitable .
“ Robust trading results led the way , ” said Howard Chen , a banking analyst at Credit Suisse , describing the latest profits .
To prevent a catastrophic financial collapse that would have sent shock waves through the economy , the government injected billions of dollars into banks .
Some large institutions , like Goldman and Morgan , have since repaid their bailout money .
But most of the industry still enjoys other forms of government support , which is helping to stoke profits .
Goldman Sachs and its perennial rival Morgan Stanley were allowed to transform themselves into old - fashioned bank holding companies .
That switch gave them access to cheap funding from the Federal Reserve , which had been unavailable to them .
Those two banks and others like JPMorgan were also allowed to issue tens of billions of dollars of bonds that are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which insures bank deposits .
With the F.D.I.C. standing behind them , the banks could borrow the money on highly advantageous terms .
While some have since issued bonds on their own , they nonetheless enjoy the benefits of their cheap financing .
Granted , banks are also benefiting from a stabilizing economy .
The fear that gripped the markets earlier this year , when doomsayers predicted a second Great Depression , has largely dissipated .
Stocks , corporate bonds , even risky corporate i.o.u.’s  have all rallied from their bear market lows , some spectacularly so .
The Dow Jones industrial average has soared 50 percent this year , and touched 10,000 this week for the first time since the crisis .
Can Christians can be card - carrying , evolution - believing , " Old Earth " scientists , too ?
Yes , say two such people , Karl Giberson and Darrel Falk , in a piece on our editorial page On Religion Forum today that tells believers and scientists alike , " Fear not . "
And Giberson is available for a live chat today at 2 p.m. ET to answer questions about faith and evolution .
( Submit your questions at onreligion.usatoday.com .
We are trained scientists who believe in God , but we also believe that science provides reliable information about nature .
We do n;t view evolution as sinister and atheistic .
We think it is simply God ’s way of creating .
Yet we can still sleep soundly at night , with Bibles on our nightstands , resting atop the latest copy of Scientific American .
Are we crazy ?
Giberson is a professor at Eastern Nazarene College , co-president of the BioLogos Foundation and author of Saving Darwin : How to be a Christian and Believe in Evolution .
Darrel Falk is a professor at Point Loma Nazarene University , co-president of the BioLogos Foundation and author of Coming to Peace with Science : Bridging the Worlds Between Faith and Biology .
BioLogos is the foundation created and named by geneticist Francis Collins after he retired from leading the Human Genome Project .
Last month , however , Collins left BioLogos when he was nominated -- and last week confirmed -- to lead the National Institutes of Health .
Like Collins , Giberson and Falk seem to say that God expects humankind to use the brains
He gave them .
They write : :
What we learn from science cannot threaten our belief in God as the creator .
If God created the universe in a Big Bang 15 billion years ago , guided its development with elegant mathematical laws so that eventually there would be big - brained mammals exploring things like such as beauty , morality , and truth , then let us celebrate that idea , not reject it .
Where that conversation leads , however , is not only to examine how one understands science but also , I think , to how one reads the Bible .
The Scientist / Christians diverge from the Scripture - plain - on - its - face approach of traditionalists and fit better with those who say Scripture is always read and understood in the light of times and culture .
Is Giberson saying that although we know more facts about the world now but the essential concepts are eternal ?
You could ask him that -- or your own question on how he melds the two realms or , as they say , " Are we crazy ? "

Tuesday , 01 September 2009 18:23
My first encounter with the ongoing crises of the Middle East was when I was given , in my capacity as an architect , the task of designing the square and culture centre situated in front of the Nativity Church in Bethlehem and funded by the Swedes .
A commission I won in a competition , it was completed in time for the Millennium celebrations in 2000 .
This meeting with the Palestinians and their harsh reality inspired me , after retirement , to become involved in the solidarity movement .
I have , among other things , initiated a study circle in Stockholm concerning the Palestinian issue .
The occupation of Iraq made me realise that this was predominantly where key events would take place �
The Iraqi resistance would splinter the positions of power held by the US and Israel .
This lead to my involvement in the Iraqi issue .
I started a new study circle about the war in Iraq , compiled and wrote a compendium and organised talks with well - informed speakers .
It was here I got to know Eftikhar Hashem .
I worked together with her to update the version of her booklet " Iraqi Resistance " , 2006 .
In 2008 she revised and expanded the material for a book and I was honoured to be her co-writer .
Eftikhar has the knowledge about Iraq and she has collected the facts concerning the resistance against the occupation and of the collaborators .
Few outsiders have insight into the Iraqis� struggle against the mighty Goliath .
But the success of their six - year freedom fight , and that in Afghanistan , raises new hope for people worldwide who resist the US strategy to dominate the world .
Hence this overwhelming silence in the global media that is obviously governed by the same interests that engineer the wars .
World opinion is kept in the dark and focused on other things .
Thus , there is every reason to draw attention to The Association of Muslim Scholars in Iraq�s ( AMSI ) selection of a delegation of prominent Iraqis with the task of touring Europe for the first time , giving information about the resistance struggle in Iraq .
AMSI connects civil Iraqi organisations that oppose the occupation and has steadfastly resisted the " political process " put in place by the US , despite all the invective thrust at it .
Statements issued by AMSI , respectfully heard by all the resistance organisations , bear the mark of legal pathos , moderation , balance , clarity , humanity and an absence of hate .
In their work for a united front against the occupation , the representatives have acquired considerable knowledge of what is barely known to an outsider � the resistance struggle .
The delegation consisted of AMSI �s renowned spokesman , Dr. Mohammed Bashir Al - Faidhi , the general in the former army of Iraq Saifaldin Al - Okidi , the ex mayor of Falluja Mohammad Hassan Khlauf and the former politician and leader of the group " Loyalty to Iraq " , Raad Nassir Al - Adhami . [ 1 ]
The Stockholm Visit
The tour�s first stop was Stockholm where the small organisation Iraq Information Service ( IRIS ) together with the organisations ABF ( Arbetarnas Bildningsf�rbund ) and Foro Latinamerica , arranged a seminar on the 25th of April 2009 , entitled " The new face of the occupation � what is in store for Iraq ? " .
Stockholm was first thanks to the confidential telephone interviews undertaken for many years between Eftikhar Hashem Al - Husseiny of IRIS and Dr. Al - Faidhi , which will eventually comprise a book , " Iraqi Resistance " , written by her and by myself .
Suddenly here we were in Stockholm with people who know all there is to know about the resistance , a well of trustworthy and current information .
Here follows a resume of the seminar and the questions asked .
Focus is on the statements from Dr. Al - Faidhi and former general Saifaldin Al - Okidi .
Translation of all the speeches and the answers to questions will be included in a coming book .
The Overall Picture of the Resistance Dr. Al - Faidhi gave a well - informed and erudite analysis of Iraq�s resistance from an historical perspective .
He established that Iraq�s resistance is unique .
Never before has a country been confronted with such an enemy : a superpower , the only one in the world to which all other nations bow down .
Earlier on in history , resistance movements have been able to find supportive and allied states .
Vietnam for example had many .
But Iraq is completely isolated , even abandoned by the UN , which , contrary to its aims , is being used as a tool for occupation .
All Iraq�s neighbours act like enemies .
This is what the resistance has had to contend with , and is why it has presented itself as fragments of a large collection of small factions , without central leadership , working independently of one another with no obvious public presence .
This situation has , however , given the resistance strength and independence with regard to the rest of the world and enabled the groups to remain militarily active and out of reach of the enemy .
Without a doubt , the resistance has up till now been very successful and decidedly detrimental to the US army , its collaborators and coalition partners .
We are now facing a new challenge : various resistance groups have formed fronts and more or less agreed on political goals and strategies , said Dr. Al - Faidhi .
The next step is forming a definite political leadership with a known strategy and the ability to negotiate with the occupying power .
The biggest obstacle is isolation � the absence of international sympathy and regional support .
This is why AMSI is now turning to the rest of the world , and the tour of Europe is the first step down this new road .
While the struggle for liberation , and hopefully awakening world opinion , grind down the obstacles , the resistance continues a long undercover struggle .
Another obstacle that must be overcome is the untrue picture of the resistance struggle that is drummed into the rest of the world , said Dr. Al - Faidhi .
At the beginning , the occupying power tried to hide the existence of the resistance .
The image of an Iraq that had returned to normality and quiet was projected .
Journalists who reported on reality and resistance were pursued and killed .
However , covering up the existence of the resistance was unsuccessful , and the criminal character of the American war - project was revealed for the entire world to see .
Whereupon the US army allowed rumours to be spread to the ever - willing western media ; namely that what appeared to be a legitimate human - rights struggle against an occupying power was in fact the work of foreigners in Al - Qaida , an organisation on the UN�s list of terrorists .
Crushing them was both acceptable and admirable .
The True Picture of the Resistance Today there are , according to Dr. Al - Faidhi , about 100.000 men in the actual armed resistance , who kill no civilians and fight solely against the occupying power , its allies and collaborators .
There are roughly only 1000 Al Qaida fighters , this being one percent of the entire resistance which has no contact with them whatsoever .
If we are to believe the western media , and even many leftwing writers , the armed resistance has more or less come to a halt at this stage ; now it is Al Qaida , suicide bombers and violence against innocent civilians that dominate Iraq .
Almost daily there are reports of a few cruel massacres that interrupt the otherwise relative calm .
According to Dr. Al - Faidhi this is a completely distorted picture , spread by the occupying power to neutralise potential solidarity in the rest of the world .
" Al - Qaida accepts responsibility for some of the atrocities , others are undertaken by surveillance organisations from the neighbouring countries and their interests ( meaning Iran and Israel , my comment ) �. I can assure you , Iraq�s resistance has never faltered or weakened not for a second .
However sometimes there are fewer operations due to political circumstances , but then they increase and are stronger than before .
In 2007 , the resistance movement lost momentum because of Al - Sahwa ( Awakening Councils ) .
It has now returned stronger than ever "
The US administration focuses on Al - Qaida and sectarian violence , making sure that the media report the lies , in order to hide this fact .
During the whole of 2008 and up till now year 2009 , the occupying powers have been attacked continually , about 100 times a day .
This was sensationally confirmed in a worried statement from the American general Lloyd Austin on the 20th March , 2009 , where he also said that the road to success for the US army is very long .
At the moment the resistance is " booming " said Dr. Al - Faidhi .
He confirmed the number of attacks and predicted that there were still more to come during the rest of year 2009 .
A United Organisation for the Resistance Dr. Al - Faidhi had some good news .
There is a new resistance organisation , " The General Command of Armed Forces � The Iraqi Army " , which will be the framework for the future free army of Iraq and which has already won respect .
It has no definite political or religious aims , but wishes to appeal to all Iraqis and to bring together resistance fighters of various religious beliefs , political convictions and ethnic groups , to comprise one united resistance movement .
Many militaries from Iraq�s old army are part of it and commanders - in - chief from the same army are included in the leadership .
AMSI supports it and hopes that it will attract all other fronts under the same umbrella .
In this case , the organisation will have the power needed to root out all foreign troops , security forces and the Quisling regime�s army .
This can not be achieved alone by just one or other front or faction .
Initially , however , it has not the military power of the other factions , the Al - Rashedeen army among the foremost of these .
It attracts many Shia Muslims as opposed to the otherwise Sunni dominated resistance .
American Losses
The US army�s reports on losses of less than 5000 are ridiculous said Saifaladin Al - Okidi , the former general in the delegation that visited Sweden .
They are lying : our resistance movements � operations are documented on video .
There is video evidence of more than ten deaths when the Americans have reported only one or two at the same attack .
There were 1200 American deaths in Falluja alone .
The Association of War Veterans of America has reported 73.000 killed in action from 1991 till the end of 2007 and if you take from this number the few who where presumed dead from 1991 till 2003 you get numbers that are closer to the ones we consider to be true .
The American researcher and Nobel laureate in economy , Joseph Stiglitz , has estimated the total cost of the US war in Iraq and Afghanistan to 3000 billion dollars if all the follow - up and hidden expenses are included .
In the long run , such expenditure will ruin a country like the US with all its astronomical debts .
The reasons why the Americans are presently thinking through the occupation of Iraq are the following , said Saifalidin Al - Okidi : a ) the large number of dead , injured and mentally handicapped Americans and b ) the heavy economic losses sustained .
The Al - Sahwa Movement Before this movement was formed , according to Saidaldin Okidi , there was a series of frightening " false flag " attacks against civilians undertaken by specially trained American death squadrons , " Special Forces " .
These bloody crimes were of course despicable and when the occupying power saw to it that the finger was pointed at " Al - Qaida of Mesopotamia ( AQM ) " , which hardly is a blameless movement , the situation became volatile .
Getting rid of AQM became first priority for many people , and the struggle against the source of all the terror � the occupation � came second .
The Islamic Party with seats in the Quisling parliament was instrumental in spreading US propaganda amongst the Sunnis .
This party likes to think of itself as the Sunnis� counterbalance to the growing power of Iran in Iraq and because there is a considerable fear of this development , many listened respectfully when the party argued for a diversion of the resistance .
The fight against the US army would cease and be replaced by the hunt for AQM .
This caused quite a tumult and tendencies to split the resistance movement .
Many Sunni resistance fighters let themselves be lured into joining Al - Sahwa ( Awakening Councils , Sons of Iraq ) , a corps created by the US .
Its directives were to help destroy AQM and maintain order in the cities .
There were those who broke away from the resistance factions and created new ones , Iraq�s Hamas and Jaami , and started to fight AQM while continuing to fight the occupying power .
The Islamic Army , a faction formerly so dreaded by the US , also became involved and is now a mere shadow of its former self .
AQM , the organisation that , according to AMSI , had severely damaged the US army and its collaborators , was now weakened .
This is how , after a year , the " relative calm " in Baghdad and the Anbar province managed to mislead foreign opinion .
Thus Al - Sahwa has served its purpose for the occupying power .
" The US has abandoned Al - Sahwa .
It is now in the hands of its enemies , Mailiki�s government forces .
( Most of them were formerly part of the resistance and are Sunnis , my comment ) Maliki and the US army have done a deal .
Maliki has eliminated his rival , the Shiite Mehdi army , loyal to Iran and enemy of the US , and is now free to destroy Sunni Al Sahwa , formerly supported by the US .
The US allows Maliki kill Al - Sahwa�s leader and has handed over the movement�s documents , maps and list of members�� .
Al - Sahwa caused resistance in the Anbar province to weaken , but at the same time it became stronger in Mosul and the Diyalah province .
Now that the US has betrayed Al - Sahwa , opposition is growing everywhere .
We believe it will become even stronger in the next six months or so . "
( Dr M B Al - Faidhi ) Al Qaida in Mesopotamia Dr Al - Faidhi treated this issue with great care as it has such impact on western opinion .
He gave the following balanced picture : " Their behaviour towards ordinary civilians is intimidating and shocking and quite unacceptable .
They are being used by the US � and the media are permitted to aggravate the situation .
AQM has committed horrible crimes , which they occasionally take responsibility for .
One example is the massacre in the bazaars of the town Hillah .
We say the AQM has lost face .
This is an organisation with contradictions , some of its factions fight only the US , others fight the resistance �at the beginning , AQM was seen as a protector of people , now it is seen as a threat .
The various factions and fronts that make up the resistance no longer look on AQM as merely a brother - in - arms .
Some accept it , others like the Al Rashedeen army , say nothing , and still others look upon it as a saboteur of the resistance "
The Kurds in Iraq
This issue too , is controversial to western opinion due partly to the support given to the Kurds � struggle for greater independence , and partly to the fact that the Kurdish leaders collaborate with Israel .
Dr Al - Faidhi took the view that their demands are justified : " We Iraqis are prepared to solve these issues .
They are not very complicated �
�The Kurdish people have never harboured any bad feelings against any of the nationalities that surround them�� .
The contradiction Arabs / Kurds is a fabrication �it is used by certain leaders .
These collaborate with countries outside Iraq ( meaning above all US , Iran and Israel , my comment ) that strive to impose their policies on Iraq for their own gain ; they wish to tear Iraq apart .
Note that conflicts have arisen just when the country was having difficulties [ 2 ] "
The Kurdish people who live in extreme poverty are obliged to watch while the riches from Iraq�s oil pass to the leaders and their clans and cronies and the needs of the masses are neglected .
An example of this is that nothing has been done to repair the supply of electricity despite the fact that the province government has received 30 billion dollars from the central government for this purpose .
93 % of Kurds disagree with their leaders � demands for a federal Iraq according to The Washington Post .
This is a signal to the leaders that the Kurds are turning their backs on them and it makes them nervous .
Iran�s Involvement Iran�s involvement in Iraq is probably the one issue that has put international solidarity with Iraq�s resistance on hold .
Many who are critical of Israel and support the Palestinians look to Iran as the only country in the world that consistently opposes Zionism in favour of the Palestinians .
Because of this , the solidarity movement does not criticise Iran�s involvement in Iraq .
This is not advantageous either for the people of Iraq or the Palestinians .
As long as Iran opposes the resistance struggle against the occupation of Iraq , there is less credibility for its support of the Palestinians .
" Iran�s involvement is considerable ��� �a catastrophe that adds to the already difficult situation in Iraq �we have been thrown into a deep sand pit and Iran does not lend us a hand to clamber out .
Indeed , Iran helps the Americans to shovel more sand over us��.. Iran is very dangerous for us ��. but we have chosen to focus on the struggle against the US , our major enemy .
The US started the invasion of Iraq , and allowed Iran to become involved �.. the Americans treat Iran as an associate in Iraq .
It was the US that saw too it that Iran�s collaborators attained government positions .
Militaries and death squadrons trained in Iran have , with the help of the US , established themselves in Iraq�s police force and army "
These statements by Dr Al - Faidhi must be judged against a backdrop of considerable and bloody campaigns to exterminate Sunnis , Christians and secular intellectuals in Baghdad and southern Iraq , together with the ongoing " Persification process " .
Iran�s government holds most of the responsibility for the fact that a fifth of Iraqis are now refugees .
Regarding the sectarian conflict , Dr Al - Faidhi had this to say , as a " private person and scientist " : " There are two branches of Shiite Islam in Iraq : 1 ) a popular people�s branch that manages to peacefully cohabit with Sunnis , secular people and other religions , and 2 ) The Iranian theocracy�s ideal that demands slavish obedience to the priests in Tehran and which is covertly or openly opposed to Sunni Islam , secularity and other religions "
After appealing to Europeans to support the struggle for a Free Iraq , Dr A - Faihidi ended his main talk by telling this amazing story from Iraq of today : " The people of Iraq are steadfast in their conviction that Iraq�s territory and civil society will be kept intact even after the liberation .
Let me prove this by telling a true story that has been confirmed and documented in words and pictures , and that underlines the truth about US crimes in Iraq .
( He was referring to a video about American deeds in Iraq that had been shown at the seminar , my comment . )
There was a football match on the 26th of August last year at the People�s Stadium in Baghdad , between two Iraqi clubs , Zawra�a and Erbil , the latter from the Kurdish region in the north of Iraq .
For the first time since the occupation there were 50.000 football fans at the match .
The Americans saw themselves as benefactors , having guaranteed security during the match and made it possible for all these people to attend .
So they marched onto the pitch , officers and men , and started to wave to the public .
But they had never counted on what happened next .
On the spur of the moment , completely spontaneous with no preparation , people started throwing shoes , water bottles and anything else they were holding at the Americans , while shouting angry slogans .
The whole thing looked like a tsunami .
Among the slogans were " America be damned , America be damned " and " Out Bush , out " , " We Iraqis are brothers , Sunni and Shia together and we will not sell our country to the Americans " Ladies and gentlemen .
This is Iraq and this is the general mood of the country and the challenges that face the Iraqi resistance " .

The Kurd leader Jalal Talabani ( president of the Quisling regime ) and Massoud Barzani ( prime minister of the province government ) work together with the US .
Their instruments of power are the infamous Peshmergas , trained by Israel�s Mossad .
They played a leading part in the destruction of Falluja and now fight to throw out the Arabs , Turkmen and Christians from the Mosul and Kirkuk regions where the huge oil wells are .

Like a lot of people , I do n’t listen to “ A Prairie Home Companion ” very much any more .
I do n’t have to ; I already know what ’s going to happen — or not happen .
After 35 years on the airwaves , PHC holds few surprises for anyone .
Clarence and Clint Bunsen are still working out their complex sibling rivalry ; Bertha ’s Kitty Boutique is still meeting every cat lover ’s needs ; conversations in the Chatterbox Café and the Sidetrack Tap still fall into the monosyllabic Upper Midwestern mold ; Pastor David Ingqvist and parishioner Val Tollefson still agree to disagree about how long a sermon needs to be .
And the sometimes acerbic host who peoples this imaginary world still keeps his listeners guessing about what he really thinks of small - town America , with its risk aversion and its pinched moralism .
Gary Edward “ Garrison ” Keillor is no rube .
He got his start writing for The New Yorker , after all , and he continues to nail the claustrophobia of Lake Wobegon and all the other flyspeck burgs from Texas on up to Maine .
Keillor himself was raised in suburban Anoka , Minnesota , but he still struggled to escape his parents ’
Plymouth Brethren austerity .
One can imagine ( and he often hints at this ) what it was like for him to breathe the bracing heterodox air of the University of Minnesota when he arrived there in 1962 .
I am thus interested to know why the cosmopolitan Keillor can’t quite let go of his Lutherans .
No simple sentimentalist , he strikes me as a rather complex elegist .
That is , he sees this solid but limited small - town world fading fast ; and he sees that for all of its faults and limitations it deserves a last loving look before we all plunge into the unsettling social and psychological space that , following sociologist Zygmunt Bauman , we might call “ liquid modernity . ”
Liquid modernity is a post - Enlightenment space in several key respects : solid Newtonian physics has been supplanted by unknown fields of force ; Kantian philosophical rigor has given way to a Babel of contending discourses ; and ( most significantly for Bauman ) the relatively stable meanings that we used to be able to give to work , wealth , and personal identity have all been colonized by powerful economic forces that we can barely comprehend .
Even our most intimate thoughts are about to be absorbed into the “ cloud ” that Google has prepared for us .
In Bauman ’s critique of post - Berlin Wall modernity , freedom is everywhere legally victorious but is imperiled at every turn by powerful compulsions to choose a “ lifestyle ” of private consumption and to choose “ success ” by working faster and living harder in ways that keep us from seeing the spiritual death entailed in such hard living .
What Bauman sees collapsing in consequence of this ( literally ) idiotic individualism is any deep sense of personal agency or any wondering sense of one ’s own immortality .
We work continuously but we form few worthy bonds or partnerships through our work , in part because work itself is no longer about producing anything .
Producers in the vanishing real economy cooperate , but the virtuosos of monetized hyperspace have no real need to cooperate : they can and do often fly solo .
Thus the master image for the emerging society ( if it can even be called that any longer ) has once again become the menacing labyrinth .
I doubt that Garrison Keillor has read much Zygmunt Bauman , but I will wager that he would instantly recognize the existential crisis that Bauman evokes so well : the weightlessness of living in a world in which we struggle heroically to stay in the race — though we ’re not exactly sure why .
Of living in a world in which some people grow unbelievably rich ( and render others progressively more wretched ) by using proprietary algorithms and by creating invisible “ black pools ” rather than public markets in which to trade exotic financial “ instruments ” that only they understand .
Frank Rich wrote recently in the Times about the mind - numbing extent to which we live in a world that Goldman Sachs owns and operates , whereas we merely rent our little enclaves within it .
Rich quotes Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi memorably describing Goldman as a “ great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity , relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money . ”
Rich ’s point was that thanks to Goldman ’s many friends inside the Obama administration , the chances are nil that our government will do anything at all to shut down the casino economy or will even bother to find out who was really to blame for the financial trauma we ’ve been living through .
The government will certainly not force big banks that took in all of that taxpayer money to do anything to support the real economy or the millions of jobless and downsized workers who are hurting so badly .
‘ Labyrinth ’ is as good a word as any for our emerging dystopia .
Only the people whom Lewis Lapham calls “ achievatrons ” seem to be getting ahead , though one also has to wonder what they ’re really getting for their efforts .
That thing we should all want from society , at least from a good - enough society — namely , an easy and cooperative sociability — seems to have gone missing .
Whatever social networking means , it definitely does not mean hanging out with your friends at the Chatterbox Café .
And we do n’t know when or if it will ever end .
For this reason smalltown values and smalltown verities can begin to look kind of sweet as we plunge farther into the great unknown .
Or more precisely , sweet smalltown verities minus the racism and the homophobia : some significant markers that Keillor has so far left unexplored , to our loss and to his .
I grew up about a mile away from a real - life Lake Wobegon in rural Wisconsin .
People living in our nearby hamlet were nosy and narrow and only getting more so .
Even as a very young boy I knew that I needed to get out of there as soon as I possibly could .
But looking back , and even despite the mostly unconscious racism , I can see that it was n’t all bad .
People did real work , and when their work was done they rested .
They got to know each other .
Their employers had roots in the local community and felt some degree of accountability .
It was an imperfect world in many , many respects but it was at least a solid world .
The same on the religious side .
It could not be clearer that there is no going back to the simple faith of another time .
Even David Ingqvist understands this .
Indeed , Pastor Ingqvist ’s witty creator has migrated from the stringent Plymouth Brethen to the latitudinarian life of an Episcopalian .
Yet his deep hunger and his need for something more solid remains .
Why else would he always be inviting his live audience to join him in singing all those old - time hymns and gospel tunes ?
So yes , tell me the story of Jesus — write on my heart every word !
And while you are at it , tell me that I do n’t have to join Facebook , that I will be able to retire in something more than a threadbare condition , and that Goldman Sachs has not totally taken over the management of the last best hope of Earth .
Tell me !

In House of Numbers : Anatomy of an Epidemic , an AIDS film like no other , the HIV / AIDS story is being rewritten .
This is the first film to present the uncensored POVs of virtually all the major players ; in their own settings , in their own words .
It rocks the foundation upon which all conventional wisdom regarding HIV / AIDS is based .
House of Numbers could well be the opening volley in a battle to bring sanity and clarity to an epidemic gone awry .
" Leung manages to present a barrage of intriguing theories debunking our generally accepted beliefs ...
There 's no denying , however , the value of exploring such game - changing topics as how HIV - infection numbers are cooked for monetary and political gain ; how the effects of global poverty may have led to so many AIDS - related deaths ; how such widely used AIDS drugs as AZT have , themselves , often proved fatal ; and whether HIV really exists .

Picture a Hot Russian Woman who is sexy , beautiful and exotic , assembling and loading an AK - 47 in under 15 seconds .
Four years ago , in order to increase morale and boost recruitment among young men , the Russian Military held the first ever Miss Russian Army beauty contest .
In June 2005 , before a live national television audience , 19 female soldiers and sailors from the Russian Military participated in the competition held at the Russian Army Theatre in Moscow .
Highlights of the competition included the women walking down the catwalk in uniform and singing songs that featured top charting lyrics like , " Since we 're soldiers , our first concern is automatic weapons ; boys come second " .
Other highlights included contestants competing in drills , shoot contests , crawling in combat uniforms , entering tanks and armored personal carriers , and running in full combat gear .
Alas , the Defense Ministry prohibited a swimsuit competition which they considered too risqué .
To thunderous applause and to the delight of her comrades in uniform , judges crowned Lieutenant Ksenya Agarkova , an engineer with the Russian Navy , as the first Miss Russian Army .
Perhaps if all the world ’s armies had contests like Miss Russian Army , then we would be one step closer to world peace .
Until then , enjoy our Russian Women with Weapons photo gallery .

Feature trailer for Avatar .
In the epic action adventure Avatar , James Cameron , the director of " Titanic , " takes us to a spectacular new world beyond our imagination .
On the distant moon Pandora , a reluctant hero embarks on a journey of redemption and discovery as he leads a heroic battle to save a civilization .
Two key figures in the conviction of the Lockerbie bomber were secretly given rewards of up to $ 3 m ( £ 1.9 m ) in a deal discussed by Scottish detectives and the US government , according to legal papers released today .
The claims about the payments were revealed in a dossier of evidence that was intended to be used in an appeal by Abdelbaset al - Megrahi , the Libyan convicted of murdering 270 people in the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 .
Megrahi abandoned his appeal last month after the Libyan and Scottish governments struck a deal to free him on compassionate grounds because he is terminally ill with prostate cancer .
Now in hospital in Tripoli , Megrahi said he wanted the public to see the evidence which he claims would have cleared him .
" I continue to protest my innocence – how could I fail to do so ? , " he said .
" I have no desire to add to the upset of many people I know are profoundly affected by what happened in Lockerbie .
My intention is only for the truth to be made known . "
The documents published online by Megrahi 's lawyers today show that the US Department of Justice ( DoJ ) was asked to pay $ 2 m to Tony Gauci , the Maltese shopkeeper who gave crucial evidence at the trial suggesting that Megrahi had bought clothes later used in the suitcase that allegedly held the Lockerbie bomb .
The DoJ was also asked to pay a further $ 1 m to his brother , Paul Gauci , who did not give evidence but played a major role in identifying the clothing and in " maintaining the resolve of his brother " .
The DoJ said their rewards could be increased and that the brothers were also eligible for the US witness protection programme , according to the documents .
The previously secret payments were uncovered by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission ( SCCRC ) , which returned Megrahi 's conviction to the court of appeal in 2007 as a suspected miscarriage of justice .
Many references were in private diaries kept by the detectives involved , Megrahi 's lawyers said , but not their official notebooks .
The SCCRC was unable to establish exactly how much the brothers received under the DoJ's " reward - for - justice " programme but found it was after Megrahi 's trial and his first appeal in 1992 was thrown out .
A memo written by " DI Dalgleish " to " ACC Graham " in 2007 confirms the men received " substantial payments from the American authorities " .
The inspector claims the rewards were " engineered " after Megrahi 's trial and appeal were over , but said there was " a real danger that if [ the ] SCCRC 's statement of reasons is leaked to the media , Anthony Gauci could be portrayed as having given flawed evidence for financial reward . "
Instead , he claimed , the reward was intended to ensure the Gaucis could afford to leave Malta and start new lives " to avoid media and other unwanted attention " .
However , the documents disclose that in 1989 the FBI told Dumfries and Galloway police that they wanted to offer Gauci " unlimited money " and $ 10,000 immediately .
Gauci began talking of a possible reward in meetings with Dumfries and Galloway detectives in 1991 , when a reward application was first made to the DoJ .
The evidence , which was due to be heard by the appeal court next month , also discloses that Gauci was visited 50 times by Scottish detectives before the trial and new testimony contradicting the prosecution 's claims that Megrahi bought the clothes on 7 December 1988 – the only day he was in Malta during the critical period .
In 23 police interviews , Gauci gave contradictory evidence about who he believed bought the clothes , the person 's age , appearance and the date of purchase .
Two identification experts hired by Megrahi 's appeal team said the police and prosecution breached the rules on witness interviews , using " suggestive " lines of questioning and allowing " irregular " identification line - ups .
Two new witnesses also disproved the prosecution claim that Megrahi was in Gauci 's shop on 7 December , his lawyers said .
Gauci said the area 's Christmas lights were not on when the clothes were bought .
The current Maltese high commissioner to the UK , Michael Rufalo , then the local MP , told the SCCRC the lights were switched on on 6 December , raising further inconsistencies in the prosecution case .
It has also emerged that Scottish police did not tell Megrahi 's lawyers that another witness , David Wright , had seen two different Libyan men buying very similar clothes on a different day ; evidence that psychologists believe may have confused Gauci and again clouded the prosecution case .
Dumfries and Galloway police said only a court could properly consider this material , and supported previous criticism of Megrahi 's decision to release his appeal papers by Elish Angiolini , the lord advocate .
" We will not be taking part in any discussion or debate concerning the selective publications made by Mr Megrahi , " a statement said .
" We have nothing more to add other than to echo the lord advocate 's recent comments pointing out that Mr Megrahi was convicted unanimously by three senior judges and his conviction was upheld unanimously by five judges , in an appeal court presided over by the lord justice general , Scotland 's most senior judge .
Mr Megrahi remains convicted of the worst terrorist atrocity in UK history . "
A spokesman for the US Department of Justice also refused to comment , since Megrahi had voluntarily withdrawn his appeal .
He said : " None of the allegations in the SCCRC referral , or the grounds of appeal filed by Megrahi , were finally adjudicated by the Scottish High Court of Justiary ( the appropriate judicial forum ) because Megrahi withdrew his appeal before the court could rule .
Consequently , the U.S. Department of Justice will not comment further on his aborted appeal . "
Benicio Del Toro Urges Halt To Monkey - Breeding Facility In Puerto Rico
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
A monkey - breeding factory , something itself out of a nightmare , has been given the green light for construction in the city of Guayama , Puerto Rico .
Obviously , this is n’t sitting well with PETA and they ’ve enlisted the help of Benicio Del Toro to write a letter to Puerto Rico Governor Luis Fortuno urging for a halt to the facility .
“ I am disappointed to learn from my friends at PETA that a company called Bioculture is proposing to build a large monkey facility in Guayama , where it plans to breed thousands of these intelligent animals and lock them in cages before sending them off to laboratories around the world to be used in painful , deadly experiments , ” the actor writes .
“ Wo n’t you please use your influence as governor and stop this from happening on our beautiful island ? ”
As Del Toro notes , even the Mayor of Guayama is opposed to the construction — and willing to join her citizens in civil disobedience should it come to that .
To read his full letter , hit the fold below .
Dear Governor Fortuno ,
I am disappointed to learn from my friends at PETA that a company called Bioculture is proposing to build a large monkey facility in Guayama , where it plans to breed thousands of these intelligent animals and lock them in cages before sending them off to laboratories around the world to be used in painful , deadly experiments .
Wo n’t you please use your influence as governor and stop this from happening on our beautiful island ?
I have been informed that an international coalition of groups –including PETA , the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine , the Humane Society of the United States , the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection , and the International Primate Protection League –has formed to oppose the construction .
Public opinion polls have also shown that most Puerto Ricans are strongly opposed to Bioculture ’s plans .
Even the mayor of Guayama , Glorimari Jaime , has expressed her concern : “ If my people do civil disobedience against this [ Bioculture ] project , I will be there to support them . …
I want you to know that I have never given a sign to endorse this project .
Everything was done by the previous administration .
Please do n’t allow Puerto Rico to be associated with a facility that profits from extreme animal abuse . ”
Thank you for your time and attention .
I look forward to your decision .
Sincerely ,
Benicio del Toro
The favorite rhetorical fallback of politicians of every stripe is “ it ’s for the children ” .
Anything can be justified in terms of making things better for children if you frame it right .
Lately I ’ve begun to think that the word “ simple ” is the programmer ’s version of “ for the children ” .
We use it to justify all manner of decisions .
I ’m not excepting myself , either .
I see myself doing this all the time .
“ It ’ll make things simple ” , I say .
Which by a strict interpretation is true .
Whatever direction I ’m advocating , it usually makes [ some ] things simple .
It usually also makes other things more complicated .
Let ’s look at an example of two opposing kinds of simplicity .
My old boss Chris Strom recently wrote about some common Ruby newbie mistakes ( it ’s a great article , you should read the whole thing ) .
Here is an example he gave of code written by someone new to the Ruby language :
sum = 0 i = 0 while i < times . length time = times [ i ] # parse / manipulate the time sum = sum + time i = i + 1 end
After several iterations of successively introducing Ruby idioms and features , the code looked like this :
def average_time_of_day( times ) sum = times.map(&:to_time ).inject (&:+)
end
Which example is simpler ?
Well , that depends on what you mean by “ simple ” .
As Chris points out , the latter example is much closer to the domain .
The line sum = times.map( &:to_time ).inject (&:+) neatly expresses the intent of the code without getting bogged down too much in implementation .
It ’s also more concise .
On the other hand , the first example uses language constructs that are familiar to almost all programmers , not just Ruby programmers .
It is simpler in the sense that even someone who has only basic programming skills could probably work their way through it , without needing to understand concepts like #inject and symbol - to - proc .
What do we mean when we say the word “ simple ” ?
I ’ve realised that we programmers use “ simple ” to mean a lot of different things .
Some of the ways we use the word “ simple ” include :
Minimizing unnecessary effort .
Characterised by the classic admonition to “ Keep It Simple , Stupid ” .
Or as the XP folks say , “ do the simplest thing that could possibly work “ .
Of course , sometimes when you choose to do less you force someone else to do more .
And sometimes that someone else is you , two weeks down the road .
Hiding complexity .
Ruby on Rails made web development simple , relative to tools that came before it .
It accomplished this feat by embracing “ convention over configuration ” .
In order to do this , it had to incorporate a great deal of extra complexity in the form of algorithms which guess the intent of the programmer instead of forcing her to specify her wishes explicitly .
Anyone using it eventually has to become familiar with these hidden rules in order to understand why Rails behaves the way it does .
Avoiding difficult - to - understand features .
In the name of simplicity , some programmers advocate avoiding “ magic ” language features they see as complicated and difficult , such as generics , recursion , or metaprogramming .
Other coders say there is no such thing as magic if you have an adequate understanding of the language , and that arbitrarily naming certain features “ magical ” is superstitious nonsense .
Avoiding formal architecture .
There are programmers who feel that complexity is the inevitable result of spending too much time thinking about design , and that simple code is code that does it ’s job without being fastidiously decoupled and thoughtfully abstracted .
Others say that this kind of thinking leads to an unmaintainable “ big ball of mud “ , the antithesis of simplicity .
Elegance of design .
Some insist that elegant orthoganality is what defines simplicity .
Simple components which do one thing well , which have few interdependencies and can be composed into various configurations .
Others retort that all abstractions are leaky and that trying to abstract the leaks away only complicates the job of solving real problems .
Staying close to the domain .
To some , simplicity is ability to write code which looks like a plain - English explanation of the problem .
But the underlying scaffolding which makes the code so understandable to a domain expert may be baroque and brittle in it ’s implementation .
Clearly , simplicity is not a simple subject .
I think the reason for this is the nature of complexity .
Complexity is like an air pocket trapped under a layer of airtight plastic .
If you push it down it just pops up somewhere else .
Most of our attempts to “ simplify ” software really amount to pushing the complexity somewhere ( or some - when ) else .
And our disagreements about what is meant by simplicity are really about where we think the complexity belongs .
As a result , the goal of simplicity can be used to justify just about any course of action .
I challenge myself and anyone who reads this , next time you use the word “ simple ” , to stop and think about what you mean by it .
As an exercise , try to rephrase it in terms of where you are pushing the complexity .
Let me know if you gain any insight from looking at it in this way .

I rarely understand modern art , but I appreciate whenever traditional views are challenged , and this will certainly do the trick .
Paul Fryer ‘s newest work brings together race , religion , and a gorilla … on a crucifix :
[ Fryer ] insists he wants to highlight the plight of the Western Lowland Gorillas , and to challenge the Christian notion that animals do not have souls .
But he does not want to cause offence .
Right …
I ’m sure no one will take any offense at all .
( Artists know damn well when their work will offend somebody , so they need to stop saying otherwise .
It ’d be more honest if they said they wanted to challenge peoples ’ mindsets and get them to think differently . )
Just to be clear , Fryer is not calling Jesus a gorilla .
( Though , from an evolutionary perspective , using that image to say we share a common ancestor would be very interesting … )
For his next piece of work , Fryer crucifies Jesus in slightly more modern times .
There ’s no cross .
Instead , we see Jesus in an electric chair .
Oh .
And Jesus is black .
In his contemporary version of a Pieta , a life - like black Christ is depicted in an electric chair .
An earlier version , featuring a white Christ , provoked protests in the French town of Gap earlier this year . …
“ If they had had the chair in Christ ’s time , people would be wearing little electric chairs now , ” Fryer said .
That ’s a Lenny Bruce line , by the way .
It ’s all not - so - surprisingly controversial .
You expect Bill Donohue will flip his shit in 5 … 4 … 3 …
I never understand why people get offended by things like this .
It does n’t change or diminish what you believe happened .
It ’s not inciting violence nor is it directly or indirectly hurting anyone .
It ’s just one person ’s reworking of several well - known themes .
If you ’re offended , then criticize the supposed artistry .
Do n’t get offended because you dislike the interpretation .
Just because you find something sacred does n’t mean the rest of us have to follow in step .
What does Fryer say about his perceived “ attacks ” on religion ?
… The symbols and iconography belong to me as much as anyone else .
They are mine to do with as I see fit .
I mean , what the fuck does anything have to do with anything ?
Why does everything have to be explained ?
Okay … I ’ll try .
The figure of Christ is n’t just in the electric chair he ’s starved and he ’s black .
Hundreds more black people have been executed in the chair than white people .
More black people starve to death than white people by what you could call a significant margin too .
We still execute people 2,000 years after Christ ’s death .
And he was black too .
Back then the guy must have thought he was wasting his breath .
God only knows what he would think if he saw the world today .
It ’s just as well he was resurrected because if he was in the grave he ’d be turning in it .
As for the apes , at the rate we ’re killing them all the lowland gorillas will be dead by the year 2020 .
Do animals have souls ?
What a question .
We should be asking the same question of ourselves .
The exhibit featuring these works and several more is called The Age of the Marvellous and it can be seen at Holy Trinity Church , 1 Marylebone Rd , London , NW1 4DU through Thursday .

Martin Vaughan reports on health overhaul legislation .
Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah has an idea to improve the tax on “ Cadillac ” insurance plans proposed by Democratic Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus of Montana : exempt such policies in states whose names begin with the letter “ U . ”
Or at least give states that begin with “ U , ” ( OK , it ’s only one ) the same treatment as the 17 states with the highest health care costs .
Under Baucus ’s approach , those high - cost states would see a slower phase - in of the excise tax .
In the description of his amendment , Hatch called the that phase - in “ arbitrary and unfair . ”
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation , Massachusetts , Maine and New York topped the list of for health care expenditures per capita in 2004 .
Utah was dead last .
The Hatch amendment is one of 564 filed with the Finance Committee as it begins considering the Baucus bill Tuesday .
All of those amendments , of course , wo n’t get separate votes .
The latest report of the UN population division of March 11 , 2009 shows that the world 's population is 6.8 billion , and is expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050 .
When I was born in 1930 , there were only 2 billion people on Earth .
What has happened to cause this staggering increase , and for how long can it continue ?
Back in 1972 , the Club of Rome pointed out that there are indeed limits to growth , as exemplified by the finite limits to our reserves of fossil fuels .
But we failed to realise that we are living under a glass ceiling that traps our carbon emissions and causes the Earth to warm up .
It is an ill bird that fowls its own nest , but that is exactly what we are doing to our environment .
We always used to think that the future was boundless ; the sky 's the limit .
But it is slowly beginning to dawn on us that the phrase has acquired a sinister new meaning ; today , the sky is the limit .
It is human activities , whether it be the farts of our domestic cattle and sheep , or the burning of our forests , or the emissions of our power stations , or the exhausts of our cars , or the production of cement , or the cremation of our bodies at the end of our days , that are all are contributing to global warming .
What can we do about it ?
Unfortunately , natural selection has ensured that we are well - endowed with selfish genes .
We will always put self before family , family before community , community before country .
Hence efforts to get international agreement on controlling global carbon emissions will always be bedevilled by the " after you " syndrome .
With the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference set for December , can we expect any breakthroughs in this potential stalemate ?
Inside this white building , piles of sorghum are broken down into acids .
The acids they produce can be used to make gasoline .
A company that has developed a process for converting organic waste and other biomass into gasoline –Terrabon , based in Houston –recently announced a partnership with Waste Management , the giant garbage - collection and - disposal company based in Houston .
The partnership could help Terrabon bring its technology to market .
Amid a profusion of new biofuels technologies , this one stands out because it will be relatively easy to scale up for producing millions of gallons of fuel , says James McMillan , the biochemical process R&D group manager at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden , CO , who is not connected to the company .
Most biofuels companies fall into one of two categories .
Some use enzymes to break down biomass into simple sugars and a single organism to convert sugars into fuel , such as yeast .
Others use high temperatures and pressure to break biomass down into basic chemical building blocks–carbon monoxide and hydrogen–which are then chemically processed into fuels .
Terrabon has developed a process that combines the two .
It uses a naturally occurring mixture of organisms to convert biomass , not into fuels , but into carboxylic acids .
These can be converted into fuel and other chemicals using well - known chemical processes .
Gary Luce , the company ’s CEO , says Terrabon ’s fuels can compete with petroleum - based fuels if prices are above $ 75 a barrel .
( The price of oil is currently about $ 70 a barrel . )
The approach has an advantage over single - organism - based methods because the mixture of organisms used , collected from salt marshes , are adapted to survive in the wild .
They do n’t require the special sterile environments needed to prevent single - organism cultures from being contaminated , which brings down the cost of equipment .
These organisms naturally break down biomass into carboxylic acids , such as acetic acid , the key component of vinegar .
These acids can serve as chemical precursors for a wide variety of chemicals and fuels , including gasoline and diesel , via processing steps that convert the acids into ketones and alcohols .
The acids can be made without the expensive equipment required for high - pressure and - temperature processes .
They can also then be processed into fuels using equipment at existing refineries , helping keep costs down .
Because the organisms do n’t require special treatment and because the acids they produce can be converted to fuels at existing refineries , it should be relatively easy to ramp up production , McMillan says .
Terrabon ’s partnership with Waste Management should help , he says , since one of the biggest challenges with advanced biofuels is collecting the large amounts of biomass needed .
Waste Management already has trucks and other equipment for collecting garbage and separating the organic waste .
Terrabon ’s composting centers , where biomass is converted into acids , can be located near sources of biomass–such as municipal landfills or farms .
The acids–or solid salts made from these acids –would then be shipped to a refinery for conversion to biofuels .
Terrabon also has a partnership with Valero , the major oil refiner based in San Antonio , which will help in this stage of the process .
One potential disadvantage of Terrabon ’s method is that it would be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to improve the organisms via the powerful genetic engineering tools other biofuels companies are using .
That ’s because it uses a complex mix of organisms , rather than a single organism , each of which plays a role in breaking biomass down into sugar and converting the sugar to acids .
Cesar Granda , Terrabon ’s chief technology officer , calls the mix a “ black box , ” because the company does n’t understand exactly how it works .
McMillan says the success of the company will depend in part on the costs and energy required for transporting raw materials and converting acids into fuels .
He also says the carbon - dioxide emissions from the chemical process could be higher than with other advanced biofuels .
One step in particular , hydrogenation , requires hydrogen , which is typically derived from fossil fuels .
Depending on the source of the hydrogen , and the energy required in other steps , it may be difficult for Terrabon ’s fuels to qualify as advanced biofuels and so qualify for key federal incentives .
Terrabon , which has been operating a pilot - scale plant in Bryan , TX , plans to begin building a 55 - ton - per - day facility in Port Arthur , TX , starting early next year .
With the help of Valero ’s Port Arthur refinery , that facility is expected to produce about 1.3 million gallons of biofuel a year when finished in 2011 .

Civil liberty campaigners claimed a victory today after the government announced it is dropping current proposals to retain the DNA profiles of innocent people on the national database .
The Home Office has announced that its plan to keep the DNA profiles of those arrested – but never convicted of a crime – for between six and 12 years depending on the seriousness of the offence has been dropped from the policing and crime bill that is going through parliament .
A European court ruling in December found it was unlawful to keep the DNA details of 850,000 innocent people indefinitely on the national database .
The authors of the research on which Home Office ministers based their plan had disowned the proposals .
The Jill Dando Institute for Crime Science said its work should not have been used to decide the six - to 12 - year time limits because the work was unfinished .
A Home Office spokesman said they hoped to bring forward " further provisions " on DNA retention in the next policing and crime bill earmarked for the next session of parliament , which opens on 18 November .
" We have now completed a public consultation on proposals to ensure the right people are on the database as well as considering when people should come off .
Those proposals were grounded in the research and allowed us to respond to the judgment of the European court of human rights both swiftly and effectively .
" The government will take the most expedient route to address the issue as soon as possible in order to comply with the European court 's judgment . "
It is thought that the government would have faced defeat in the House of Lords this week over its DNA retention package if it had pressed on regardless .
Ministers need to get the current policing and crime bill on the statute book before next month 's Queen 's speech and have started making concessions on the most contentious areas of the legislation in order to do so .
Last week proposals to introduce " gasbos " – special injunctions to tackle inner city gang membership – were watered down to get them through the Lords .
Chief constables have already been warned by the Home Office to ignore the European court ruling and carry on adding the DNA profiles of the tens of thousands of people they arrest to the national database .
But the further delay in clarifying the legal situation is likely to increase the possibility of a high court legal challenge from individuals who feel their DNA has been unlawfully kept .
Isabella Sankey , Liberty 's policy director , said : " Better late than never , the government wakes up to concerns about personal privacy .
Its current discredited proposals of stockpiling innocents ' intimate details for years on end would have breached article 8 of the human rights convention all over again .
Whoever thought that this kind of policy could be dealt with via backdoor regulations needs their head rather than their DNA tested . "
Commenting on the government dropping its current plan , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , Chris Huhne said : " It is not surprising that the government has ditched its ill thought out DNA proposals after their savaging by statistical experts .
" It was scandalous to attempt to respond to the European court ruling by circumventing parliament .
The government must take this opportunity to end their fudge on DNA .
The innocent should be removed from the database immediately – no ifs , no buts . "
The announcement comes as the police have won an appeal against an information tribunal ruling that data on old , minor convictions must be deleted from police computers .
The ruling by the court of appeal came in a test case relating to the convictions of five people .
Had it gone against the police about 1 m convictions probably would have been deleted .
Three judges ruled that retaining information for police operational needs in the fight against crime was far easier to justify than actually disclosing the information to others .

When it comes to writing the pen apparently is mightier than the computer keyboard .
Second , fourth and sixth grade children with and without handwriting disabilities were able to write more and faster when using a pen than a keyboard to compose essays , according to new research .
The study , headed by Virginia Berninger , a University of Washington professor of educational psychology who studies normal writing development and writing disabilities , looked at children 's ability to write the alphabet , sentences and essays using a pen and a keyboard .
" Children consistently did better writing with a pen when they wrote essays .
They wrote more and they wrote faster . " said Berninger .
Only for writing the alphabet was the keyboard better than the pen .
For sentences results were mixed .
But when using a pen , the children in all three grade levels produced longer essays and composed them at a faster pace .
In addition , fourth and sixth graders wrote more complete sentences when they used a pen .
The ability to write complete sentences was not affected by the children 's spelling skills .
The research also showed that many children do n't have a reliable idea of what a sentence is until the third or fourth grade .
" Children first have to understand what a sentence or a complete thought is before they can write one , " Berninger said .
" Talking is very different from writing .
We do n't talk in complete sentence .
In conversation we produce units smaller and larger than sentences . "
The study was designed to compare methods of transcription , a basic cognitive process involved in writing that enables a writer to translate thoughts or ideas into written language .
Both handwriting and spelling are transcription processes .
Previous research by Berninger 's group showed that transcription predicts composition length and quality in developing writers .
Transcription by both pen and keyboard involves the hands .
Researchers , she said , are trying to understand why units of language are affected differently when hands write by pen and by keyboard .
" People think language is a single thing .
But it 's not , " said Berninger .
" It has multiple levels like a tall building with a different floor plan for each story .
In written language there are letters , words , sentences and paragraphs , which are different levels of language .
It turns out that they are related , but not in a simple way .
Spelling is at the word level , but sentences are at the syntax level .
Words and syntax ( patterns for organizing the order of words ) are semi-independent .
Organizing sentences to create text is yet another level .
That 's why some children need spelling help while others need help in constructing sentences and others in composing text with many sentences . "
Berninger and her colleagues recruited more than 200 normally developing children for the study .
When the children were in the second , fourth and sixth grades they were given three tasks .
For one task they were told to print all lower case letters in alphabetic order with a pen .
They were also asked to select each letter of the alphabet in order on a keyboard .
In both cases they were told to work as quickly and accurately as possible .
In the second task they were asked to write one sentence that began with the word " writing " while using a pen and to write one sentence that began with " reading " while using the keyboard .
Finally , the children were asked to write essays on provided topics for 10 minutes both by pen and by keyboard .
Although most children in the study developed transcriptions skills in an age - appropriate way , a small number showed signs of a specific learning disability - transcription disability .
Both the normally developing and those with the disability wrote extended text better by pen than keyboard .
" Federal accommodations for disabilities now mean that schools often allow children to use laptops to bypass handwriting or spelling problems .
Just giving them a laptop may not be enough , " Berninger said .
" Children with this disability also need appropriate education in the form of explicit transcription and composition instruction .
" We need to learn more about the process of writing with a computer , and even though schools have computers they have n't integrated them in teaching at the early grades .
We need to help children become bilingual writers so they can write by both the pen and the computer .
So do n't throw away your pen or your keyboard .
We need them both .
" But we do n't want to lose sight of the fact that it is important for developing writers and children with transcription disability to be able to form letters by hand .
A keyboard does n't allow a child to have the same opportunity to engage the hand while forming letters - on a keyboard a letter is selected by pressing a key and is not formed .
Brain imaging studies with adults have shown an advantage for forming letters over selecting or viewing letters .
A brain imaging study at the University of Washington with children showed that sequencing fingers may engage thinking .
We need more research to figure out how forming letters by a pen and selecting them by pressing a key may engage our thinking brains differently , " she said .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A series of photographic exhibitions have been organized in Europe and North America this autumn to highlight a campaign by Britain 's Prince Charles to combat tropical deforestation .
An aerial of Jambi Province , Indonesia showing the destruction of the tropical rainforest .

The photographs were taken by world - renowned environment photographer Daniel Beltra who was this year 's winner of the Prince 's Rainforest Project Award at the Sony World Photography Awards earlier this year .
The images graphically depict the effects of climate change on the rainforests in the South America , Africa and Indonesia .
Beltra compiled a library of around 40,000 images during month long trips to the Amazon Basin , the Congolese Forest and Borneo and Sumatra in Southeast Asia .
When he returned home Beltra produced a shortlist of around 1000 images from which the final exhibition photos were selected .
" I shoot a lot when I'm in the air , " Beltra told CNN .
" Trying to concentrate on a small detail on the ground when your flying at a speed of 150 knots is difficult . "
And that 's not the only problem Beltra encountered .
The very acts of destruction he was documenting often got in the way of his work .
Click here to see a selection of images from the exhibition »
" When you are photographing deforestation , you are taking a lot of pictures of logging and fires and the smoke can make it very difficult to shoot . "
Beltra was born in Spain but is now based in the United States .
His work , which includes freelancing for the international environmental group Greenpeace , has taken him to over 50 countries and he is a fellow of the International League of Conservation Photographers .
HRH Prince Charles has long been a passionate defender of the environment and he founded the Prince 's Rainforest Project ( PRP ) in 2007 .

The PRP works alongside governments , international businesses , non-profit organizations and rainforest nations to find a solution to the deforestation and degradation of the rainforests .
Speaking at the Sony Awards in Cannes , France earlier this year the Prince said : " Photographic images can tell a compelling story about the truth of the situation , and the truth is that if we lose the fight against tropical deforestation , then we lose the fight against climate change . "
Beltra hopes that his pictures will raise further awareness of the perils that humans face in the wake of continued rainforest destruction .
" I think we are all getting more aware but we really need to get our act together because at the moment we are destroying more than we are protecting , " he said .
The multimedia exhibitions organized by Sony are taking place at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew in London , the Hotel de Ville , Paris , the Alexa Center , Berlin and the Mercy Corps Action Center , New York .

Yesterday , a spokesman for Galvin declined to comment specifically about the newly discovered hard drive , but said the secretary of state is still waiting for more information from the city .
After the Globe reported Sept. 13 that Kineavy routinely double - deleted his messages - dragged them to the trash and then emptied them from the trash , in a way that they were not saved by city backup servers - Secretary of State William F. Galvin ordered the city to seize Kineavy ’s computer and hire a forensics firm to try to retrieve his deleted e-mails .
The newspaper also had reported that city officials produced only 18 e-mails in response to a public records request for electronic correspondence sent or received by Kineavy between Oct. 1 , 2008 , and April 1 .
City officials blamed the low number on Kineavy ’s double deletion .
The discovery of another hard drive marks the latest twist in an ongoing effort to recover e-mails that Kineavy deleted in potential violation of the state public records law .
The law requires city employees to save e-mails for at least two years , even if they have “ no informational or evidential value . ’’
The subpoena , issued in a public corruption case against former state senator Dianne Wilkerson and Councilor Chuck Turner , demanded copies of any messages Kineavy exchanged with Wilkerson , Turner , or their aides between March 2007 and February 2008 , according to two public officials briefed on the subpoena who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation .
The city ’s chief of information technology , William Oates , whose department found Kineavy ’s old computer , said that the machine has not been used by anyone since it was replaced and that the city has now turned it over to a computer forensics firm .
The firm will try to retrieve e-mails requested by the Globe , as well as e-mails subpoenaed by a federal grand jury last fall .
“ There ’s been nothing to indicate he has n’t been up front , ’’ Sinnott said .
City corporation counsel William F. Sinnott said in an interview yesterday that he had been relying on what Kineavy had told him and that Kineavy , the mayor ’s chief policy aide and key political strategist , still does not remember getting a new computer .
The computer , the officials said , was on Kineavy ’s desk until it was replaced in April , after Kineavy complained it had been operating too slowly .
The discovery directly contradicts prior assertions by the city that Kineavy ’s computer had not been replaced in more than two years .
Boston officials acknowledged yesterday that they have discovered a second computer used by chief mayoral aide Michael J. Kineavy , a hard drive tucked away in a sixth - floor office that may contain the bulk of the e-mail subpoenaed by federal authorities and formally requested by the Globe .
“ We ’re still expecting more information from them in addition to what has been provided so far , ’’ said the spokesman , Brian McNiff .
“ Whatever it comes from and whatever the parameters of the request were , we ’re expecting to hear more , more information and more e-mails . ’’
The Globe submitted its first request for copies of Kineavy ’s e-mails on April 1 .
On April 6 , Kineavy reported that his computer was running slowly , and after three exchanges with city computer technicians , Kineavy received his new computer on April 24 .
City officials said there was no link between the public records request and the computer repair job .
But Pamela H. Wilmot - executive director of Common Cause of Massachusetts , a nonprofit watchdog organization - was skeptical .
“ It certainly raises questions when the timing between the records request and the request for a new computer follow each other so closely , especially in light of the lack of disclosure of receipt of a new computer , ’’ Wilmot said .
“ Getting a new computer is n’t something one easily forgets . ’’
The computer forensics firm hired by the city , StoneTurn Group , which spoke with the Globe only after receiving permission to do so from the city , said it received the newly discovered hard drive Friday afternoon .
Simon D. Platt , a partner at the firm , said questions about whether Kineavy had changed computers were provoked by a search of his most recent hard drive , which turned up e-mails by a law department employee .
When Kineavy went through them , city officials said , he asked Oates why they included e-mails that did not belong to him .
Oates then determined that Kineavy ’s computer had been replaced earlier this year , and he took steps to retrieve the old computer and the backed - up files and turn them over to StoneTurn .
Platt said the company has already started examining the older hard drive , but does n’t expect results for a few days .
He said the firm ’s work on the first computer so far has cost roughly $ 25,000 , and exhaustive searches of either drive could cost up to $ 250,000 , because no automated tool can pick out individual e-mail messages from the vast amount of scrambled data that remain on the drives .
Platt said his investigators found 40,000 instances of Kineavy ’s name on the older hard drive , but that the only way to determine whether those instances were e-mails was to have human beings examine each mention .
It ’s a slow process , and a costly one , since StoneTurn charges between $ 150 and $ 300 an hour .
Platt said he doubted that the information obtained from such a search could justify the cost .
“ I have a reasonable basis to say you ’re not going to get much benefit , ’’ he said .
Records show Kineavy sent or received an average of 614 e-mails per week since the city instituted a program in August that saves copies of every e-mail sent or received by every city employee .
At that rate , he would have sent or received and then deleted 15,964 e-mails during a six - month period .
So far the city has released 5,018 e-mails Kineavy exchanged with other city employees that were saved in their e-mail boxes .
Messages he exchanged solely with anyone outside City Hall were not included because city officials have said retrieving them would be too costly .

A couple weeks ago we told you about a victory in our long - running Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) litigation for documents detailing telecommunications carriers ' lobbying efforts to get off the hook for their role in the government 's warrantless electronic surveillance of millions of ordinary Americans .
On September 24 , a federal judge ordered the Director of National Intelligence and Department of Justice to turn over many of the records we requested by Friday , October 9 , 2009 .
EFF began working to force the release of the records in 2007 after media reports revealed an extensive lobbying campaign seeking immunity for telecoms that participated in the government 's unlawful surveillance program .
As Judge Jeffrey White noted , his decision " is consistent with " President Obama 's directive on FOIA , issued on his first full day in office , which adopted a presumption in favor of disclosure and promised “ a new era of open government . ”
Nevertheless , after Judge White ordered disclosure of the documents , the agencies asked him to postpone his order for 60 days while the government ruminated over the pros and cons of appealing to the Ninth Circuit , which EFF opposed .
The agencies also asked the court to reconsider the decision .
Yesterday , Judge
White denied both of the government 's motions , clearing the way for the government to release the documents tomorrow , as originally ordered .
So far , the government has n't appealed , and the clock is ticking .
We look forward to receiving the documents tomorrow so that they can be part of the active congressional debate over repealing telecom immunity .
Assuming the government does n't attempt further delay tactics , we intend to post the files here as soon as we get them .
Stay tuned ...
UPDATE : Late Thursday , the DOJ and ODNI filed an emergency motion asking for a 30 - day stay while the agencies consider an appeal .
EFF opposed the motion Friday morning , and the government filed a reply around noon PT .
We 'll post any additional updates here as soon as they become available .
Most of the economists and pundits who could not see an $ 8tn housing bubble are telling us that the United States desperately needs the Chinese government to keep buying its debt .
This crew of failed analysts argues that without the support of the Chinese government , interest rates in the US will rise , choking off the recovery .
In reality , the decision by China to stop buying US government debt might not harm the economy 's recovery , but it could be devastating to the recovery efforts at Citigroup and other basket - case banks .
The basic logic is simple .
China 's central bank has been buying up huge amounts of dollar - based assets for the last decade .
Their purchases include short - and long - term government debt , mortgage - backed securities and , to a lesser extent , private assets .
The Chinese central bank 's purchases have two effects .
First , they help to keep interest rates low .
This supports economic growth by keeping down the interest rates on mortgages , car loans and other borrowing that boosts demand .
The other effect of China 's purchase of dollar - based assets is that it keeps down the value of its currency against the dollar .
This is the famed currency " manipulation " , that draws frequent complaints from politicians .
Of course , it is not exactly manipulation .
China has an explicit policy of keeping down the value of its currency against the dollar .
It is not buying up hundreds of billions of dollars of US assets in the dark of night .
It does it in broad daylight in order to keep its currency at the targeted rate .
Suppose China stopped buying up US government debt .
Interest rates in the US would rise , which would have some negative impact on growth .
Of course , the Fed could try to offset this rise in rates by simply buying more debt itself .
It has already been buying debt , and it could simply buy enough to replace the lost demand from China .
This would leave interest rates largely unchanged .
Suppose that the Fed does n't intervene and lets interest rates rise .
This will have some negative impact on growth , but there will also be a very positive side from China 's decision to stop buying dollars .
The dollar would fall in value against China 's currency .
This would make Chinese goods more expensive in the United States , leading US consumers to purchases fewer imports from China and more domestically produced goods .
A lower - valued dollar would also make our exports cheaper in China .
That would allow us to export more to China .
The net effect would be an improvement in our trade balance , bringing back some of the 5.5 million jobs that we 've lost in manufacturing over the last decade .
In fact , since nearly all economists agree that the current trade deficit can't persist for long , China would be helping the country bring about a necessary adjustment if it stopped buying up dollars .
Even the rise in interest rates would have a positive effect since it would allow for the completion of the deflation of the housing bubble , with house prices finally settling back to their trend levels .
This drop in house prices will be a painful adjustment , but there is no way to avoid it .
Bubbles cannot be sustained indefinitely , and we are better off allowing the housing market to return to normal so we can get back to a path of sustainable growth .
While decision of the Chinese to stop buying dollars might be good for the economy , it is likely to be disastrous for Citigroup and the rest of the basket - case banks .
If interest rates rose , then the value of the government bonds the banks hold would plummet .
If the interest rate on 10 - year Treasury bonds goes from the current 3.5 % to a still low 4.5 % , then the banks will have lost 8 % on their holdings .
At a 5.5 % interest rate , a rate that would still be far below the average for the 1990s , the loss would be 15 % .
Citi and the other basket cases could not endure these losses in their current financial state .
This could be why we see shrill pronouncements from the likes of Washington Post columnists and other " experts " who could n't see an $ 8tn housing bubble that we need the Chinese government to keep buying up our debt .
We absolutely do not need the Chinese government to keep buying US debt and would almost certainly be better off if it stopped tomorrow .
Citigroup and the other big banks do need the Chinese government to keep the money flowing if they are to have a chance of getting back on their feet .
And , we know where the sympathies of the Washington Post 's editors and other " experts " lie .
Consider : for any Applicative f and Num a , we could make ( f a ) a Num , using the declaration
> instance ( Applicative f , Num a ) =>
Num ( f a ) where > (+ ) = lift A2 (+ ) > (*) = lift A2 ( * ) > ...
However , we never actually want to declare such a general instance as the one above , because it rules out instances which are n’t implemented via Applicative .
Instead , a better approach is for some library to define
> applicativePlus = lift A2 (+ ) > applicativeTimes = lift A2 ( * ) > ...
and then have everyone who wants the Applicative instance for their particular type ( say , Foo ) write
> instance Num ( Foo a ) where > (+ ) = applicativePlus > (*) = applicativeTimes > ...
Unfortunately , each instance we declare still needs to mention all 6 functions in the Num class .
What I would like to do is to say to Haskell , “ use the Applicative instance for Num ” , and say it just once .
Here is a language extension that could allow you to do that .
For want of a better name , I will refer to it as “ Instance Datatypes ” ( ID ) .
The extension For each class declaration > class cxt => C a1 ... an where > v1 :: ty1 > ... > vn :: tyn we implicitly declare the following datatype : > data @ C a 1 ... an = > @ C { > @ v1 :: ty1 , > ... > @ vn :: tyn > }
Note that superclasses are irrelevant as far as the datatype is concerned .
A new syntactic form for instance declarations is added : > instance cxt => C ty1 ... tyn = expr which is semantically equivalent to > d :: cxt => @ C ty1 ... tyn > d = expr > instance cxt => C ty1 ... tyn where > v1 = @ v1 d > ... > vn = @ vn d where d is some unused variable name .
The @C values can be constructed and deconstructed just as ordinary record datatypes .
So , for example , we could build an @ Eq value : > buildEq :: ( a -> a -> Bool ) -> @ Eq a > build Eq eq = @ Eq { > ( @== ) = eq , > ( @ /= ) = \ a b -> not ( a `eq` b ) > }
Some more details of the extension are discussed later , but first I give some examples .
Examples
The “ Applicative instance for Num ” problem
We solve the original problem : > -- in some library : > applicativeNum :: ( Applicative f , Num a ) => @ Num ( f a ) > applicativeNum = @ Num { > ( @+ ) = lift A2 (+ ) , > ( @* ) = lift A2 ( * ) , > ... > } > > -- when you actually want to declare an instance > instance Num ( MyApplicative Double ) = applicativeNum Generalized Newtype Deriving
There is an intersection between Instance Datatypes and Generalized Newtype Deriving ( GND ) .
When it works , GND requires no additional code on the class designer ’s part , and requires only a “ deriving ” clause on the class instantiator ’s part .
To support something like GND using ID , something like the following code would be required : > -- in some library : > type Converter a b = ( a -> b , b -> a ) > > -- in the class designer 's library : > class C a where ... > liftC :: C a =>
Converter a b -> @ C b > liftC = ... > > -- in the class instantiator 's library : > newtype MyType = Wrap { unwrap :: SomeOtherType } > instance C MyType = liftC ( Wrap , unwrap )
So , both the class designer , and the class instantiator would need to write more code than in GND : the class designer actually has to implement the lifter , and the class user has to write slightly more .
However , ID also has a few advantages over GND : more flexibility is afforded in the converter .
For example , the type need not actually be a / newtype / ; it could be convertible by some other mechanism .
For example , we could use a Converter ( Complex a ) ( a , a ) .
. more flexibility is afforded in the lifting .
For example , the library designer can still make a lifter even if “ the eta-reduction property does not hold ” , which would cause GHC to give up .
It ’s not broken , unlike GND .
Default class methods ID would partly obsolete default class methods .
Instead of providing default class methods , the class designer could just provide a function which creates the instance value given the minimal complete definition .
For example : > class
Eq a where ... > fromEquality :: ( a -> a -> Bool ) -> @ Eq a > fromEquality ( == ) = ...
This has the advantage of moving the “ minimal complete definition ” statement from documentation to being patently obvious , and compiler - checkable .
Extra sharing
In some cases , polymorphic instances can cause an unavoidable loss of sharing in Haskell98 .
For example , if we have : > {-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-} > class C a where > f :: a > g :: a > h :: Num a => a > h = 5 ^ 100 -- an " expensive " computatio > instance Num a =>
C a where > f = ... h ... > g = ... h ...
Since h is polymorphic , its result will not be cached , and f and g will not share the result of h .
I know of no way to allow f and g to share the computation of h if the instance of C is to be polymorphic .
However , with instance datatypes , we might write > mkC :: Num a => @ C a > mkC = let h = 5 ^ 100 in @ C { @ f = ... h ... , @ g = ... h ... } > instance Num a =>
C a = mkC
In this case , the h in the let expression is monomorphic , so f and g should in fact share the computation .
Although the desugaring given earlier will lose this sharing , a direct translation into GHC Core should keep it .
Details Special scoping rules
For this extension to be useful , we need to have access to the Prelude typeclasses , so we can build , for example , @ Num values .
However , the Prelude of course does n’t ( explicitly ) export the @Num datatype .
So , I propose the following rule to govern when the @Num datatype and its internals are in scope : @v is in scope if and only v is in scope .
Furthermore , @v may not be mentioned in any import or export lists .
Collisions with current identifier names
If v is a textual identifier ( rather than a symbol ) , then @v is currently not a valid identifier .
However , if v is symbol , then @v /is / a valid identifier , and may collide with an existing identifier .
Associated types
If a class has associated datatypes or type synonyms , they ca n’t be declared in the datatype .
As far as I can see , they must be declared at the actual instance declaration , so the syntax should perhaps be extended to > instance cxt => C ty1 ... tyn = expr where > type TyFam1 ty1 ... tyn = tty1 > ... > type TyFamk ty 1 ... tyn = ttyk
At this point , the two instance declaration forms look very similar , and one wonders if they should in fact be merged .
I believe not , because this could potentially make unclear how a class member is being defined : is it defined ( a ) by the declaration in the where , ( b ) by the @C data structure of the =expr , or ( c ) by the default class method ?

IN a recent speech in London , Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , the top United States commander in Afghanistan , was blunt .
Calling the military situation there “ deteriorating , ” he warned that the United States was going to have to “ do things dramatically and even uncomfortably differently . ”
General McChrystal had already submitted a report , somehow leaked , requesting an additional 40,000 American troops .
He acknowledged in his speech that in so speaking out while the issue was still under debate in the White House , he might have difficulties with his superiors .
Comparisons have been made between this situation and the unfortunate instance in 2003 when the Army chief of staff , Gen. Eric K. Shinseki , was punished for advising Congress of the enormous effort it would take to defeat and pacify Iraq in any meaningful way .
General Shinseki was not removed outright , but he was treated shabbily by the Bush administration in more subtle ways until his retirement later that year .
But the two cases were different .
General Shinseki was testifying under oath before Congress ; General McChrystal was speaking voluntarily , on his own .
As a former Army officer , I tend to be sympathetic to the generals who are placed in impossible situations , created partly by the framers of the Constitution in 1787 .
They designated the president as the commander in chief , but at the same time they gave Congress the power to raise and support armies and navies .
This division of authority between two branches of government puts the head of a military service in an untenable position .
Officers owe their loyalty to the president and have an obligation to resign if they are unable to carry out the commander in chief ’s policies .
At the same time , they must sometimes testify under oath to the Congress .
Trapped in this way , most officers elect wisely to keep their public opinions vague .

[ This piece originally appeared in PC Gamer six months ago .
It ’s the result of about four months of investigation into the connections between PC gaming and addiction .
I interviewed some of those leading the field in treatment for what they believe to be gaming addiction ( including Keith Bakker , head of the Smith And Jones Center in Holland , famous for being the first to offer treatment for gaming addicts ) , and those arguing that there is no such thing , as well as speaking to people who have suffered as a result of gaming , and those looking to offer simply research ( including the team behind Project Massive ) .
The aim was to write a non-sensational piece that approached the subject objectively , without an agenda to prove things one way or the other .
A big credit and huge thanks must go to PC Gamer ’s deputy editor , Tim Edwards , and editor , Ross Atherton , both of whom provided huge amounts of help , support and direction for compiling this enormous lump of work into something readable . ]
“ Ready for this ? ” he asks , his voice speeding up .
“ I believe gaming is currently the greatest threat to our society . ”
Keith Bakker is the man behind the Smith & Jones Centre for addiction , the clinic at the centre of the current controversy over gaming addiction .
It all began in July last year when the centre caught the attention of the world ’s press , opening the first dedicated gaming addiction clinic , both as an out - patient programme , and then later , a residential treatment programme .
Having noticed that an increasing number of their chemically addicted clients seemed to be compulsively playing games , the staff began to recognise many of the traits that indicate addiction : an inability to regulate how much time was spent playing them , continuing to play despite the negative effects on their lives , and a progressive worsening of their relationship with games .
They believed it was something very serious , and soon the clinic was taking in clients purely for their gaming habit .
“ A typical client would be in his late teens , he ’s probably from a broken home , ” says Bakker .
“ He does n’t socialise , and he ’s probably stopped going to school .
He plays games for around 15 hours a day , and cannot regulate himself . ”
So why does Britain ’s industry representative , ELSPA , say there ’s no such thing as gaming addiction ?
And why does Dr Richard Wood of the International Gaming Research Unit at Nottingham Trent University describe it as a “ myth ” ?
Is gaming an innocent pastime , or about to bring down civilisation as we know it ?
What are the responsibilities for the gaming industry ?
How is gaming affecting us ?
What is the truth about gaming addiction ?
The Argument For
There are tragic stories out there .
21 year old Shawn Woolley killed himself in 2002 after prolonged stints playing EverQuest for 12 hours a day .
In 2004 , Zhang Xiaoyi threw himself out of a 24th floor window after 36 hours playing World of Warcraft .
And the Daily Mail exploded last year with the tales of Leo Barbero , a 17 year old whose muscles had atrophied after spending 18 hours a day , once more , with WoW .
These are horrific tales , inextricably linked with playing games , but are they caused by games ?
Were these people addicted in such a way that their fates were sealed ?
In other words , could we be in trouble ?
“ There ’s a lot of press that would love for me to become the anti-gaming guy , ” explains Keith Bakker , director of the Dutch Smith & Jones clinic .
“ But I ’m not going to do that .
As crazy as it sounds , I ’m not even against drugs .
I mean , if you can take drugs safely , go ahead .
What I am against is addiction . ”
A former addict himself , Bakker was working in the music industry when he faced his own alcoholism and heroin addiction .
Based in the Netherlands , he could find no abstinence - based ( Twelve Step ) centres in the country , and sought treatment in the UK .
Determined to prevent others from having to do the same , he established the Smith & Jones Centre in Holland to offer the services he had required .
He is in no doubt that gaming is addictive .
It ’s about an inability to self - regulate , he claims .
“ I ’m an alcoholic , you might not be , ” says Bakker .
“ We could agree to go to a bar for a couple of drinks until 9 pm .
Come 9 pm , you ’d go home .
I ’d go to Mexico . ”
It ’s this lack of self - control that he says first shows problem behaviours in the gamer .
“ A gaming addict may sit down to play for an hour , but they wo n’t be able to stop .
They ’ll play for sixteen hours , and miss school or work .
But then the next time they believe they ’ll be able to control themselves , and they repeat it again . ”
He adds Einstein ’s words , “ The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results . ”
Bakker is of the school of addictionologists who believe that twenty percent of people are born with a genetic predisposition to addiction .
The US National Institute of Heath backs this up , their paper , “ Drugs , Brains , and Behavior – The Science of Addiction , ” stating ,
“ genetic factors account for between 40 and 60 percent of a person ’s vulnerability to addiction , including the effects of environment on gene expression and function . ”
But it should n’t be forgotten that trauma can lead to addiction as well , points out games researcher , and self - diagnosed gaming addict , Neils Clark .
“ We can develop an addiction through a severe enough disturbance in our everyday lives , ” he goes on .
“ If we play in a healthy manner , and experience something along those lines , it can cause us to let our gaming fall out of balance . ”
It ’s striking to talk to Clark .
As someone who cannot regulate himself when gaming , and someone who struggles as a consequence of this , it brings the subject home .
People seem to be suffering .
“ In high school I went to this group therapy , ” says Neils .
“ My sister had gone to rehab for heavy drug use , so I went into the therapy in order to see what she was dealing with .
A lot of the people there were 50 , alcoholics , meth users , previously convicts , you know .
When it came time I talk about my problems , I said , ‘ Gee , I do n’t know , I think I just play games too much . ’
They laughed , naturally . ”
Now he is off games , having managed to successfully play sensibly for a couple of months , until a recent collapse with a nineteen hour Civilisation binge .
Clark wants people to pin down an understanding of gaming addiction .
“ We do need some baseline , so that we can start to help people who are flipping BMWs and jumping from buildings .
We need that right now . ”
In his essay , Are Games Addictive : The State of Science , Clark explains , “ A normal personality usually has a number of activities that they regularly use to feel excited , relaxed , or what have you .
Yet people are drawn to some things over others .
A huge gambling win is more attractive than cleaning a toilet .
For most people .
When the soon - to - be addict finds that special activity , they can have [ an ] ‘ aha ’ moment …
At its most extreme , such a behavioural addiction dominates a person ’s life .
They need the activity , and they ’ll sacrifice nearly anything – long term plans , the company of people , even work in order to have it . ”
The argument goes : someone who continues to play games despite these negative consequences directly affecting their life and relationships , is showing signs of addiction .
Bakker , perhaps unsurprisingly , takes it one stage further .
He says the addiction is a chemical one .
This is thanks to dopamine , the naturally occurring neurohormone released in the brain , used to fire up the pleasure and reward areas .
Gaming , as anyone who has hunched over their keyboard , breath held , heart racing , will know , is stimulating .
This gets our glands churning out dopamine , our neurons get wired , and we feel that rush of reward and pleasure .
The argument made by both Bakker and Clark is that repeating this process enough causes our brain to become accustomed to it , which means we need to work harder to get the same level of stimulation .
This , it is claimed , gives us the progressive behaviour needed for addiction .
And Clark ’s essay observes , “ When the dopamine producing behaviour is finally stopped , the brain is n’t used to the lowered dopamine levels .
At this point , craving and addiction enter the picture . ”
The Argument Against
“ There is no such clinical criteria as ‘ video game addiction ’ , ” states Dr Richard Wood .
His forthcoming paper , The Myth of Video Game “ Addiction ” argues , “ It has not been acknowledged by any reputable organisation responsible for defining disorders of the mind or body ( e.g. , The American Psychiatric Association , The World Health Organisation etc. ) . ”
( It should be noted that the APA are currently investigating the topic to consider whether they will recognise it ) .
His analysis of the cases of claimed gaming addiction have lead him to conclude four main considerations necessary for the debate :
1 . That some people are being mislabeled “ addicts ” by concerned parents , partners or others , when they have no problems with their game playing behaviour .
2 . That some people who have other underlying problems may choose to play games to avoid dealing with those problems .
3 . That some people who are concerned about their own behaviour because of either 1 or 2 above end up labeling themselves as video game “ addicts . ”
4 . That some people are not very good at managing how much time they spend playing video games .
It ’s by these same criteria that ELSPA , the industry representative for British gaming , deny the existence of gaming addiction .
Their website , Ask About Games , was set up to answer key questions for a non-gaming audience , and at the top of its FAQ appears , “ Is it possible for my child to become addicted to games ? ”
Their answer in full :
“ People play games because they enjoy them ; and some people enjoy them more than others .
A casual book reader will read books as part of their daily activities , and may well exercise or socialise .
A person who absolutely loves books may be blinkered to everything else that goes on around them ( the same goes for people who watch too many movies , or too much TV ) .
Games playing is simply another daily activity that gives people pleasure .
If they do n’t enjoy the games , they wo n’t play them .
If they do , they may play them occasionally , or as much as possible .
Playing computer and video games is not a physical addiction . ”
But how does ELSPA respond to the rapidly increasing belief in gaming addiction ?
While no one at ELSPA was available for an interview , director general , Paul Jackson , sent us this quote :
“ The primary enjoyment of computer and video games is entertainment and engagement .
As with any enjoyable pastime there is an argument that you can over indulge , perhaps play too much .
However , again with any enjoyable pastime , it goes without saying that those who play computer and video games – and parents who supervise their children ’s play – need to draw the line between healthy enjoyment and playing too much .
Put simply , it is important to play for a sensible amount of time .
Games as a part of a healthy lifestyle , if you like . ”
Once again , it comes down to self control – the very behaviour that those advocating addiction claim to be impossible for the addict .
Dr Wood points out a distinction .
“ A young child may find it hard not to suck their thumb , many people find it difficult not to eat snacks between meals , limit the amount of coffee that they drink or the salt they put on meals . ”
The confusion between simple negative behaviour , and that of an addict , blurs the issue claims Wood .
“ Some people do not want to limit or stop playing video games , even though friends or relatives are expressing concerns .
Some people may also feel personally neglected as a result of a loved one ’s game playing .
Media hype about video game ‘ addiction ’ may lead some concerned relatives to define perfectly ‘ normal ’ behaviour as problematic . ”
So what is “ perfectly normal behaviour ” ?
Is excessive play simply a result of irresponsibility , or poor time management .
Or can it be put down to a more serious factor ?
While acknowledging that people may turn to excessive play as a means to deal with their problems , Wood believes that this simply a symptom of their problems , and not the cause .
“ Of course some people play video games excessively , ” Clark explains , “ but defining the point at which the behaviour becomes problematic is far from clear .
If people cannot deal with their problems , and choose instead to immerse themselves in a game , then surely their gaming behaviour is actually a symptom and not the cause of their problem ? ”
The argument is certainly not that games are bad , from either side .
Keith Bakker is quick to stress the positive sides of gaming .
He explains that as a part of his programme , clients are taken paintballing .
“ These gamers just destroy them .
We have the kids that are chemically dependent , and we have the gamers , and we put them in two teams .
And at the end of the game , the chemically dependent kids – they end up looking like Rembrandt .
There ’s so much to be said about how these kids think , so if you can take that stuff and turn it in a positive direction , you ’ve got incredible young people .
It ’s great fun to see these kids when they get it , when they say , ‘ OK , the game is killing me .
And I ’m not going to do it any more . ’
And all of a sudden they blossom , and that ’s fun . ”
Bakker ’s position is not entirely helped by his lapsing into the hyperbolic .
Statements like his claim of gaming ’s danger to our society do n’t do anything to get those who disagree with him to listen , or take him seriously .
But he ’s passionately convinced that gaming addiction is only treatable through complete abstinence , via a twelve - step programme ; and in amongst his tendency to opt for media hype , he does have a serious point that he believes is n’t being heard .
“ Gamers have a unique problem .
With substance addicts , they tend to develop their addiction in their late teens or early twenties .
They have developed socially beforehand .
With gamers , their addiction can develop as young as ten or twelve years old , meaning they never develop socially in the real world .
When they are freed from their addiction , they ’re still not ready to reintegrate with society .
When we treat them , we need a programme where we teach them new real - world ways to socialise . ”
In other words , they are n’t able to develop this self - regulation that Wood , ELSPA and others state we require .
Is this the extreme of the “ geek ” label ?
Are we , in fact , quickly dismissing those with a problem , laughingly calling them a name and leaving them to it ?
Or indeed laughingly calling ourselves a name , and ignoring our own situation ?
New Findings
Surveys and papers are appearing increasingly rapidly , attempting to identify common factors among those who excessively game .
Part of this is driven by our love of finding something to worry about , and since there ’s been no indication that games can give us cancer , addiction might be the next best stick to hit them with .
Part of it is the fear that we might be damaging ourselves unwittingly .
But despite the field being extremely new , at last some research is appearing that takes a balanced and reasoned perspective .
If we ’re to understand where we stand with games , and whether we need to be protecting ourselves , this seems the ideal approach .
Project Massive is one of the biggest studies into online gaming and its social effects to have been carried out .
The work of Ph.D. researchers A Fleming Seay and Robert E Kraut , it has followed nearly five thousand gamers over a five years , exploring their play patterns , commitment to their guilds , and changes in their personality traits such as sociability , extraversion and depression .
Their [ recently ] published paper collating the results , Project Massive : Self - Regulation and the Problematic Use of Online Gaming , presents conclusions that , if anything , find the common ground between the opposing sides of the addiction debate .
Choosing to avoid the word “ addiction ” in order to escape semantic frustrations , the project uses the term “ problematic use ” to define a player ’s negative relationship with gaming , and the consequences it may have on their lives .
( It is continuing despite these negative consequences that many identify as addiction ) .
The phrase means , “ the state of powerlessness a person experiences when , despite attempts to stop or reduce their usage , they are unable to walk away from a game ( or substance , or behaviour ) even in the face of persistent and deleterious effects on their life . ”
The paper starts off stating their position on online gaming .
“ One reason for the popularity of online games is that they meld the fun and challenge of video games with the social rewards of an online community .
Participation in online communities allows us to stay in touch with old friends , meet new people , learn , and share information .
It also enables self - exploration and discovery as users extend and idealize their existing personalities or try out new ways of relating to one another that can positively affect real life relationships . ”
[ Project Massive : Self - Regulation and the Problematic Use of Online Gaming page 1 ]
These are recognisable reasons why the MMO has become so very popular .
The social side is often ignored when counting the numbers of hours people spend within a game .
However , this is something else in which Bakker recognises problems .
He goes so far as to compare the guilds of MMOs with cults , arguing that they share a number of similar behaviour patterns .
Promotion based on increased devotion , and peer pressure to keep playing , and moreso against leaving , ensnare people , argues the maverick .
( “ Do n’t drink the Azerothian Koolaid , ” grins Neils Clark ) .
Seay and Kraut , staying far more moderate than Bakker , note ( from the same paper ) ,
“ Some fear that virtual communities detract from social activity and involvement in the real world , replacing real social relationships with less robust online substitutes and causing users to turn away from more traditional media . ”
The team were looking to see what caused problematic use , and who was most prone to struggle with it , believing that an inability to self - regulate would be the most likely indicator of those who would develop further problems .
And this proved to be very much the case .
People who found that they were bad at controlling the amount they played , or the appropriateness of when they played , showed , “ significantly higher levels of future problematic use . ”
From this it was concluded that ,
“ Clearly , the self - regulatory processes are essential in allowing online gaming to remain a benign and enjoyable pass - time rather than an obstructive pre-occupation .
Active self - regulation appears to be a player ’s best defense . ”
Seay says of the results , “ It is clear from my perspective that online games are intrinsically no more ‘ dangerous ’ than any other recreational activity that may require a substantial commitment of resources ( e.g. time , money , attention ) .
It is always incumbent upon the individual to manage the resources they direct toward a given pursuit , and this is no more or less true of online gaming than it is of gardening or stamp collecting . ”
However , this does n’t make problematic use go away , and it does n’t remove responsibility from developers , she states .
“ Absolutely not .
No one is in a better position to help people with problematic usage issues than the developers .
Successful self - regulation is based on monitoring one ’s own behavior and comparing that behavior to internal and external standards .
If , in addition to experience points and kill counts , games made a point of reporting usage information to the player in a lightweight , non-invasive , and value neutral way , the players who most need the help would be better able to manage their own behavior .
Supplying an arcane and rarely used “ / played ” command is not enough . ”
The study ’s conclusion appears to indicate two things :
Firstly , gaming itself is not a likely cause of addiction , but rather that those who are pre-disposed to addiction are far more likely to develop problems with gaming .
Secondly , that we as gamers need to be a lot more self - aware than we perhaps currently are .
But in the end , “ It seems safe to say that the data provide no indication that online gaming is a broadly negative activity , ” the paper reports .
“ On the contrary , the overwhelming majority of those surveyed indicate no elevation in loneliness , depression , or problematic use .
This seems to indicate that , for most , online gaming is an adaptive and enjoyable , or at least benign , activity . ”
Conclusion
Project Massive ’s report finishes by identifying the importance of self - regulation .
And it seems that this is the point that all come to from whichever side of the debate they may start .
Gaming , whether it ’s biologically addictive , a severe catalyst for problematic behaviour , or a pastime capable of inspiring dangerous levels of irresponsibility , is still hurting people .
By no means everyone – Bakker notes , “ Yes , there are millions of people who could really be in deep shit with this .
Most are n’t. ” – but enough for us to start taking notice .
Self - regulation – being in control of ourselves – is something that ’s easy to ignore , and yet appears to be something with potentially serious consequences .
It ’s important to remember that being carried away by a game is not the same as being out of control – a game should have us lose track of time if it ’s doing its job right .
But when our lost time begins to hurt us , damage our lives , we owe it to ourselves to take that seriously .
Project Massive ’s Seay believes that responsibility can lie with those around the compulsive gamer .
“ I am often asked for advice by frustrated parents in regard to children who are ‘ only interested in games ’ and ‘ spend hours playing like a zombie ’ .
When asked what they should do I always give them the same answer , ‘ Pick up the controller . ’
When a parent plays video games with a child , three important things happen ; the activity suddenly becomes a social one , the parent is able to model self - regulating behavior for the child , and finally , the parent is able to monitor the content of the game .
All this for the low cost of spending some time with your kid doing something they are interested in . ”
And the same goes for adults too .
“ If more girlfriends and husbands would simply engage in the activity with their loved ones it could become a unifying forum for relational exchange rather than a divisive wedge between them .
If you are interested enough in the person playing the game , it seems to me you can overcome your lack of interest in the game itself . ”
These same ideas are echoed by ELSPA ’s Paul Jackson .
“ Parents who supervise their children ’s play must do so in a responsible way and act as a modifier , as they would in any other circumstance . ”
When asked where he thinks responsibility lies within the gaming industry , Keith Bakker simply says , “ What I appreciate is people looking at this and saying , what this can be is a problem , and if it is , you ’d better get some help .
But if it ’s not , go ahead and enjoy your game recreationally .
I believe there is a responsibility to call it what it is . ”
He is , in effect , asking the games industry to complete the first step of the Alcoholics Anonymous Twelve Step programme : admit that it has a problem .
And the same responsibility falls to us as gamers .

After squashing Darwin deniers and God-botherers with bestselling tomes including The God Delusion and The Greatest Show on Earth , Richard Dawkins is set to tackle what might be his hardest audience yet : teenagers .
The well - known scientist and atheist has struck a book deal for his first title for young adults , which will look to explode myths and legends about the natural world with science .
Due out in autumn 2011 , What is a Rainbow , Really ?
will take on topics including who the first man and first woman were , why there are seasons , what the sun is , how old the world is and why there are so many animals , first answering the questions with myth and legend , and then with " lucid scientific explanations " .
" Richard has always been incredibly keen to reach children from the whole point of view of individual critical thinking and not to just toe the party line , " said Sally Gaminara , who bought the book for Transworld , part of the Random House Group .
" He will explore certain myths people are brought up with – he's very keen to do that , to make people look at things and not be accepting , to question more ...
He will tell myths for what they are but will also delight in their poetic beauty . "
The book will be illustrated by Dave McKean , who has previously worked on books by David Almond and Neil Gaiman .
" It 's for young adults of 12 and upwards but it will also appeal to the curious child and to adults as well , " said Gaminara .
" It will be a really rich and rewarding and inspirational sort of book . "
Dawkins 's previous books , including The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker , have sold more than 1.2 m copies to date , according to book sales monitor Nielsen BookScan .
His diatribe against religion , The God Delusion – which describes the God of the Old Testament as " a misogynistic , homophobic , racist , infanticidal , genocidal , filicidal , pestilential , megalomaniacal , sadomasochistic , capriciously malevolent bully " – is by far the most popular , with more than 700,000 copies sold since it was first published in 2006 .
His latest , The Greatest Show on Earth ( which lays out the evidence for evolution ) has already sold almost 45,000 copies little more than a month after it was published .

Some 2,000 police officers patrolled the streets of Rio de Janeiro Sunday after a bloody confrontation between rival drug gangs and authorities that killed 14 over the weekend , including two police officers .
A policeman advances through an alley of Rio on March 25 , 2009 , during an anti-drug operation .
Two suspected drug traffickers were killed and four were arrested in Sunday 's operations by Rio de Janeiro 's military police , the official news agency Agencia Brasil reported .
But the atmosphere in general appeared calm in the slum known Morro dos Macacos in northern Rio , where the day before crossfire between two gangs left 12 dead , including two police officers who died when their helicopter was shot out of the sky .
Residents had also set eight buses on fire during the clashes in an attempt to divert the attention of police .
" This was truly one of the worst incidents of this type , " one local resident told CNN en Español , who declined to give his name for fear of his safety .
" It was like a scene from a real war .
It was like the world would end , lots of bullets , lots of noise . "
The violence comes two weeks after Rio , Brazil 's second largest city , celebrated winning the 2016 Olympic Games .
The slain officers , Ednei Canavarro and Marcos Stader were buried Sunday , Agencia Brasil reported .
Rio's secretary of public security , Jose Mariano Beltrame , said the helicopter was likely brought down by .30 - and .50 - caliber machine gunfire , the news agency said .
Four other police officers onboard were injured .
Beltrame on Sunday said that despite the city 's crime , there is no reason for people to doubt the government 's ability to host the Olympics .
" What I say to the ( International Olympic Committee ) and the public is this : we have historic problems .
But we also have projects and proposals .
We have security policies both to fight and to pacify , " he said .
Last year , a wave of violence in Rio led to protests in December by a group called Rio de Paz .
The group said 9,000 people had been slain since January 2007 .
Many of the deaths were caused by clashes among drug traffickers fighting for territory in Rio 's slums and poor neighborhoods , said the group 's president , Antonio Carlos Costa .
Journalist Fabiana Frayssinet in Rio de Janeiro contributed to this report .
All About Brazil • Rio de Janeiro
Arnold Schwarzenegger , the hubristic Governator of California , appears to have a puerile streak in him because it has been discovered that he sent San Francisco Assemblyman Tom Ammiano a letter in which a profanity was expressed in a cryptic and surreptitious fashion along the left margin of the letter .
If one extracts just the first letter of each line , you would spell out a rather juvenile insult that read " F*ck You . "
A copy of the letter is reproduced below with the offending letters highlighted in yellow .
Schwarzenegger typically attaches a message to bills he signs or vetoes telling assemblymen why he took the action .
It is assumed that Arnold 's profane missive is in response to Ammiano 's request that the Governator " kiss my gay ass " during a local Democratic Party fundraiser earlier this month in San Francisco .
Schwarzenegger , who is a Republican , was invited to the normally Democrat only event by former San Francisco mayor and Assembly speaker Willie Brown , also a Democrat .
Arnold gave a brief speech at the event , during which Ammiano and other Dems booed and heckled him , shouting " You lie . "
After Schwarzenegger left , Ammiano gave a speech criticizing Schwarzenegger for a wide variety of real or imagined offenses .
Aaron McLear , a spokesperson for Schwarzenegger explained to reporters ' queries about the letter : " My goodness .
What a coincidence .
I suppose when you do so many vetoes , something like this is bound to happen .
" Ammiano 's spokesperson , Quintin Mecke 's response was that the assemblyman wants to move on .
" We will call it even and start with a clean slate with the governor from here on out .
" One might quip that golden state pols have sunken to a social level on parr with junior high school boys , but junior high school boys would probably be insulted by the comparison .

Reis reports the strip mall vacancy rate hit 10.3 % in Q3 2009 ; the highest vacancy rate since 1992 .
And rents are cliff diving ...
From Reuters : Shopping center vacancy rate hits 17 - year high : report
" Our outlook for retail properties as a whole is bleak , " Victor Calanog , Reis director of research , said .
" Until we see stabilization and recovery take root in both consumer spending and business spending and hiring , we do not foresee a recovery in the retail sector until late 2012 at the earliest . "
...
The third - quarter vacancy rate at U.S. strip malls , which include local shopping and big - box centers , rose 0.3 percentage points from the second quarter to 10.3 percent , the highest since 1992 , Reis said .
...
Factoring in months of free rent and other perks , effective rent fell 0.8 percent from the second quarter to $ 16.89 per square foot or down 3.8 percent from the third quarter 2008 .
Rents were the lowest since mid-2007
...
" Since asking and effective rent growth only turned negative about one year ago , it is daunting to observe this acceleration in decline in what has traditionally been regarded as a stable property type , " Calanog said .
A grim outlook : no recovery seen in the retail CRE sector " until late 2012 at the earliest " .
Malls .
Offices .
Apartments .
The story is the same : rising vacancies and falling rents .
Here are the earlier reports this week on offices and apartments :
IL fidanzato : « Il padre non accettava la differenza di religione e di mentalità »
La madre di Sanaa : « Perdono
mio marito , forse ha sbagliato lei »
L'imam di Pordenone : « Si sente delusa e tradita dal gesto del marito » .
Il pm chiede convalida del fermo
PORDENONE - « Perdono mio marito : ha commesso un gesto orrendo , ma è mio marito , il padre di altre mie due figlie .
Forse ha sbagliato Sanaa » : lo ha detto la mamma di Sanaa , la ragazza marocchina di 18 anni , uccisa marted ì sera a Montereale Valcellina ( Pordenone ) .
« DELUSA E TRADITA » - A riferire le parole della donna è l'imam di Pordenone , Mohamed Ovatiq , che gioved ì mattina ha accompagnato la donna per il riconoscimento ufficiale della salma della figlia , nell ' obitorio dell ' ospedale della città friulana .
« La madre - ha riferito l'imam - condanna il gesto , orrendo , compiuto dal marito ma lo perdona perché l'uomo si è sempre comportato bene , ha provveduto alla famiglia , e ci sono le due sorelline da crescere » .
« La madre è sconvolta - ha detto Ovatiq - si sente delusa e tradita dal gesto del marito , che è giunto inaspettato » .
IL FIDANZATO - Quello che El Ketawi Dafani non accettava del rapporto della figlia , Sanaa , con il fidanzato , Massimo De Biasio , non era la differenza d'età , ma quella di religione e di mentalità : lo ha detto lo stesso De Biasio in un'intervista esclusiva al Tg2 .
« La religione - ha detto De Biasio - la loro mentalità : è solo stata per la religione .
L'età non c'entra assolutamente niente .
Lui - ha aggiunto - non mi conosceva .
Lui mi ha conosciuto solo l'ultimo giorno .
Non aveva neanche idea di chi ero o cosa » .
De Biasio ha raccontato che El Ketawi Dafani « l ' aveva anche scritto sui messaggi » , che se avesse visto insieme lui e la figlia li avrebbe uccisi .
« Questo era scritto sui messaggi del telefonino - ha riferito de Biasio - però non si va mai a pensare una cosa del genere » .
« Delle persone così integraliste - ha aggiunto De Biasio - devono stare a casa » loro « perché non possono pensare di venire in Italia con i figli , farli girare , diciamo con persone italiane » , mandarle « a scuola o al lavoro e non pensare che magari possa nascere qualcosa con un italiano .
È impossibile .
Se qualcuno ha una mentalità così ristretta - ha aggiunto - è meglio che stia a casa sua e basta » .
De Biasio ha detto di aver « cercato di fare di tutto » per difendere Sanaa , ma « l ' ira del padre - ha aggiunto - era talmente cruenta che non ce l'ho fatta a difenderla più di così » .
Ha detto che avevano dei progetti di vita e che pensavano di dire ai genitori che si sarebbero sposati .
« Si pensava magari di alleviare un attimino il dolore che potevamo creare loro » .
Massimo De Biasio ha detto di avere di Sanaa il ricordo di una « ragazza stupenda , sempre col sorriso , sempre molto tenera .
Gli ultimi tre mesi che ha fatto con me , che ci vedevamo - ha concluso - sono stati i tre mesi più belli della sua vita , mi ha detto » .
LE INDAGINI - Ne frattempo sono in corso da parte dei carabinieri della Compagnia di Sacile ( Pordenone ) le ricerche del coltello che ha ucciso la giovane di 18 anni di origine marocchina accoltellata due sere fa per il cui delitto è stato fermato il padre .
I carabinieri hanno circoscritto una zona di circa un chilometro quadrato .
E dalla sera del delitto che sono state attivate le ricerche del coltello che ha ucciso , ricerche sospese mercoled ì pomeriggio a causa di una pioggia battente .
Intanto l'autopsia ha evidenziato che Sanaa è morta per l'emorragia causata dalle coltellate alla gola .
Sul corpo della ragazza sono state rilevate altre lesioni giudicate « assolutamente irrilevanti » .
I primi risultati dell ' autopsia sono quindi « reciprocamente puntuali » con le ricostruzioni che sono state fatte finora da testimoni e investigatori secondo i quali la ragazza è stata uccisa con colpi di coltello alla gola .
L'autopsia è stata eseguita dall ' anatomopatologo Giovanni Del Ben , Direttore del Cro ( Centro di Riferimento Oncologico ) di Aviano ( Pordenone ) , su ordine del pm Mariagrazia Zaina .
CONVALIDA DEL FERMO - Intanto la Procura di Pordenone ha chiesto al Gip la convalida del fermo di El Ketawi Dafani quali indiziato dell ' omicidio della figlia .
La richiesta è stata fatta dal pm Zaina , che coordina le indagini .
I reati ipotizzati sono quelli di omicidio pluriaggravato ( per il rapporto di parentela e la premeditazione ) , tentativo di omicidio , detenzione e porto di coltello .
L'udienza di convalida è stata fissata per venerd ì mattina nel carcere di Pordenone dove El Ketawi Dafani si trova rinchiuso , in isolamento , nella sezione « protetti » .
El Ketawi Dafani è difeso dall ' avvocato Leone Bellio di Pordenone , che oggi l'ha incontrato in carcere per un primo esame della vicenda processuale .
Sulla base dell ' andamento del procedimento e delle iniziative finora prese sia dagli investigatori , sia dalla Procura della Repubblica , è ipotizzabile che nell ' udienza di venerd ì
El Ketawi Dafani si avvarrà della facoltà di non rispondere .
This year ’s Nobel Prize for Physics has been awarded , with the inventors of the CCD getting recognition for the invention which enabled modern digital photography .
It has taken a while :
Whilst the invention took just one hour , the prize took 40 years to arrive .
The true fathers of digital photography , Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith , invented the CCD , or Charge - Coupled Device , while working at Bell Laboratories , New Jersey .
What will surprise you is that this invention was made way back in 1969 , when everybody else was looking Moon - ward .
The CCD was the first practical way to let a light - sensitive silicon chip store an image and then digitize it .
In short , it is the basis of today 's digital camera .
The CCD was based on “ charge bubbles ” , an idea inspired by another project going on in Bell Laboratories at the same time .
The sensor is made up of pixels , each of which is a MOS ( metal - oxide semiconductor ) capacitor .
As the light falls on each pixel , the photons become electrons due to the photoelectric effect ( the same thing that permits solar power ) .
The photoelectric effect happens when photons of light hit the silicon of the pixel and knock electrons out of place .
On a CCD , these electrons are stored in a “ bucket ” : the pixel ’s capacitor .
At this stage , the “ image ” is still in analog form , with the charge , or amount of electron in the bucket , on each pixel directly corresponding to the amount of light that has hit it .
The genius of Boyle and Smith ’s CCD was the reading of the information stored .
Essentially , the charge in each row is moved from one site to the next , a step at a time .
This has been likened to a “ bucket row ” or human chain , passing buckets of water down a line .
As these buckets of electrons reach the end of the line they are dumped out and measured , and this analog measurement is then turned into a digital value .
Thus , a digital grid is made which describes the image .
The image from a CCD is black and white , but by placing a red , green or blue colored filter over the top of each pixel , color information can be read directly from each pixel – but only for one primary color per pixel .
Subsequently , software can also extrapolate the color of adjacent pixels based on their brightness , so that each pixel winds up with its own red , green and blue values .
If you ever wondered just what a RAW file was , it is the “ raw ” color data from the chip before any of the post - processing extrapolation has been done .
Cameras usually do all of this processing for you and spit out the result as a JPEG .
With the RAW file you actually have all the original sensor data , which is much more information - rich .
As an interesting aside , early , primitive patterns for the color filters over the pixels soon gave way to the Bayer pattern still found in almost all sensors today , and developed by Kodak back in 1975 .
Today , the CMOS ( Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor ) sensor is becoming more popular , as it reads information directly from each photo - site instead of row by row .
It also uses less power , making it better suited to the multi-megapixel chips popular in modern cameras .
CMOS sensors have also been around since the 60s , but their complex design , physically larger chips , higher noise and lower sensitivity meant that Boyle and Smith ’s CCD triumphed , at least until recently .
But the most amazing thing about the invention is that Boyle and Smith came up with the design so quickly .
With Bell Labs threatening to take the funds from their department and transfer the money to bubble memory research , Boyle had to come up with a competing semiconductor design .
He got together with Smith and they came up with the idea and sketched it all out on a blackboard in just one hour .
Instant photography indeed .

Photographing Your Models Part One By Brett Green
The Illusion -
A 1/48 Scale Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-6
built by Chris Wauchop
This article offers a introduction to some of the basics of photography and its application to getting good pictures of your models .
For a more detailed discussion of model photography , see Robert Pounds ' Part Two .
B a c k g r o u n d
IPMS New South Wales is fortunate to have a resident professional photographer .
The work of Pieter Stroethoff will already be familiar to HyperScale regulars .
His photographs are the source of the images in many of our earlier Feature Articles and Gallery Entries .
Pieters photographs are always a great source of inspiration for me .
He has a good quality SLR camera using multiple synchronised flashes , and a " light box " with interchangeable painted backgrounds .
The results are consistently impressive .
Although Pieter was always happy to take photos of members models either completed or under construction , the downside was that there was only one IPMS meeting per month to get these photos taken !
I began taking my own model photographs a few years ago when I was editing the local club magazine ( IPMS News and Views ) , and contributing armour articles to Track - Link .
Early results with flash photography were poor , so I looked for alternatives that would give me reliably acceptable pictures .
This article outlines the techniques that have worked for me .
This does not imply that it is the only way to take photographs of models - the key is to keep practicing and experimenting until you come up with a technique that works for you .
E s s e n t i a l E q u i p m e n t
Essential equipment required is a 35 mm SLR camera with either manual or aperture - priority automatic settings and a tripod .
It is also desirable to have a zoom lens in the range of approximately 35 - 70 mm and that the camera is equipped with a self - timer .
T h e P h o t o S t u d i o ... and the reality - a small folding table with cardboard , railway grass and a clump of plastic trees !
My " photo studio " is a shady section of my back verandah .
When I want to take model photographs I erect a small table and attach a sheet of plain blue to the top of the table .
I tape this cardboard down at the front and the centre , and prop up the back to create an artificial sky .
Recently I have laid a sheet of " railway grass " to represent groundwork .
Chris Wauchop has also built a miniature forest of pine trees to help break up the horizon , although a similar effect might be achieved with a large scenic poster or calendar page
The studio is completed with the tripod and camera set at close to table - top level to give a " spectators " perspective to the subject .
C a m e r a S e t t i n g s
The three keys to a technically successful model photograph are good depth of field ; appropriate exposure giving bright , even lighting ; and focal length .
Many modern cameras have " programme " settings that select both shutter speed and aperture .
You should not select this option when photographing your models .
Optimising Depth of Field " Depth of field " refers to how much of the picture is in focus .
The ultimate aim is normally for the whole subject to be in focus .
To achieve this , the aperture should be set as small as possible .
The aperture setting simply indicates the size of the opening in the lens .
The smaller the aperture , the larger the " f stop " number .
So to select the smallest aperture , set the lens at its highest f- stop setting - probably f.32 or f.22 .
To maximise the depth of field , focus approximately one third back from the nose of the model .
Setting Exposure Image 1 - Photograph taken at f.32 using " automatic " shutter speed and scanned with no further manipulation
The aperture setting has been selected as above .
The very small aperture means that not much light will get to the film , so a longer exposure will be necessary .
This wont be a problem if you are using a tripod .
If you have an automatic setting on the camera , the shutter speed will automatically be selected for you .
If you are using a camera on manual mode , set the shutter speed now .
Image 2 - The same subject , the same angle , the same aperture but at one stop slower .
Image has been optimised using gamma adjustment and manipulated with a " sharpen " tool before being saved as a *. jpeg file .
Scanning will tend to darken and increase the contrast of images .
Photographs taken for the Web should therefore be slightly lighter than standard snapshots .
I " bracket " my photos to ensure that I get the most appropriate exposure for the Web. " Bracketing " means taking the same photograph at different exposures .
I usually take one photo at the shutter speed recommended by the meter , plus one more photo at one stop slower .
" One stop slower " means double the recommended shutter speed ( i.e. if the meter recommends 1 / 2 second , set 1 second manually ) .
For detail shots in shadowy areas such as cockpits or vehicle interiors , I will sometimes take a third shot at two stops slower ( i.e. four times the recommended shutter speed ) .
Focal Length
In general terms , a wide - angle lens ( e.g. 28 mm ) will distort an image , and a long telephoto lens ( e.g. 200 m m ) will tend to compress the same image .
Either effect may detract from the realism of a model photograph .
I prefer a focal length of between 50 mm and 70 mm .
In other words , if you have a zoom lens , try to keep the zoom between 50 mm and 70 mm .
Taking the Photo
Once the camera is set up for the shot , it is time to take the photo .
Camera shake can be a problem effecting the sharpness of a photograph .
This is a particular problem when shutter speeds are slower than 1/30 second - and with photos taken in shady locations at such small apertures the shutter speeds will certainly be this slow .
My photos are often taken at exposures of one or even two seconds .
At these shutter speeds , the use of a tripod will be essential .
To further reduce the risk of camera shake during long exposures , I use the self - timer function on the camera .
An alternative would be to use a remote shutter - release cable .
S c a n n i n g a n d P r o c e s s i n g I m a g e s f o r t h e W e b
The cost of a flatbed scanner has fallen dramatically over recent years so that it is now within the financial reach of many PC owners .
However , the scanner is only one part of the web - processing equation .
Image processing software plays , if anything , an even more important role in determining the " look " of your model photos on the Internet .
Until recently I used an Optic Pro 4800P scanner which cost me less than A$ 200 ( US$ 140 ) .
This scanner has now been replaced with a Umax Astra 610P .
I scan most of my photos at 100 dpi .
Any higher resolution results in a wastefully large image that will not fit on a screen .
I find that lower resolutions ( e.g. 75 dpi ) limits flexibility to crop or resize the image .
Before saving the image I will determine if further processing is required .
Very often , the raw scanned image will be too dark .
I use a software package called " Picturama " that allows me to improve the overall density of the image with a tool called " auto - density " .
I can then fine tune the " gamma " , brightness , contrast and sharpness of the overall image .
When I am satisfied with the result , I will crop or shrink the image depending on the plan for its ultimate destination .
Finally , I save the image as a .JPG file .
C o n c l u s i o n
As mentioned before , this is not intended to be a strict guide to model photography .
Hopefully it will provide some ideas or answer some questions that may help get you started .
After that it is just a matter of practice and experimentation .
And when you re happy with the results , why not send in some of your scanned images ( or even hard copy photos by snail - mail ) for inclusion in a HyperScale gallery ?
Happy snapping !

I only watch a handful of the 200 + DirecTV channels I pay for .
To see whether I could survive without the pricey service , I simply went without it .
I soon wondered why we all do n't just turn off traditional TV .

As illustrated in a few of our surveys , many of you have already made the jump , catching fresh TV via broadband instead of actual channels or even DVR .
But the vast majority of us are still watching TV the old fashioned way — paying for packages from cable or satellite providers .
But from what I 've seen in my own house lately , I suspect that it wo n't be long before this practice is as archaic as owning a landline .
Many of you refuse to pay for a phone twice , so why are you paying for two or three different ways to see your favorite TV shows ?

There are , of course , drawbacks to a life without a broadcaster - friendly set - top box , so I spent a month trying to find out whether or not these drawbacks were significant enough to justify the huge additional cost .
The Experiment
Since this is Prof.
Dealzmodo , you already know the impetus for this experiment was money .
In particular my 12 - month introductory package runs out soon , and the same channels will soon cost me nearly $ 80 per month .
But why ?
The channel lineups are bloated and padded with filler — a veritable hot dog of entertainment where the real meat is mixed in with a lot of hooves and snouts .
I mean , 70 music channels ?
Really ?
Is n't that what services like Pandora — and about 100 others — are for ?
Speaking of services , I decided to play it straight .
I did n't get shows via BitTorrent .
For a month , I simply used easily accessible , generally legal alternatives like Netflix , Hulu Desktop and network websites , plus Windows Media Center , which comes " free " with most PCs these days .
The idea here is to prove that you do n't need to spend tons of money , use complicated software or go to extreme measures to watch what you want .

Hardware
First let 's talk about hardware .
I do n't see the point in spending money on niche players like Apple TV , Vudu , and Roku to get internet content onto your television .
These players only handle a fraction of what any home theater PC can deliver .
Also , sticking with a computer makes it easier to roll with new services and software platforms as they 're released .
( Hulu is n't on any set - top box yet , but it 's available to every Mac and PC , in several ways . )

You do n't need something elaborate here — an HTPC 's main purpose is to browse the web and stream video .
Just about any computer will do — including the old laptop you 're thinking about replacing anyway .
Back in the day , I used to attach my laptop to the TV with a simple S - video connection , but a lot of today 's laptops and home - theater PCs make things extremely easy with an HDMI port .
If you do n't have an HDMI port , there are simple workarounds .
For older computers in general , there are DVI - to - HDMI ( video only ) and VGA - to - component cables are also doable for older PCs , and if you already have some video cables , there are adapters out there that might do the trick for less money .
Owners of new Macs have to fudge a bit with Mini Display Port - to - HDMI converters , but even those , from Monoprice and others , are getting better .

There are plenty of products out there designed for the home - theater market that cost less than $ 500 — including the Asus ' EEEBox line and the Lenovo IdeaCenter Q700 .
Plus , there is always the option of buying refurbished or upgrading a cheap PC yourself to control costs .

If you want to cheat and record broadcast shows , you still do n't have to pay for cable — you can get an over - the - air HD TV tuner .
Generally , a USB dongle TV tuner or PCI card like those from Hauppage will cost $ 100 or so , and they work reasonably well , though you may need an external antenna for best results .
You do n't have to pay for service , and you can be assured of local news and other local programming , if that 's important to you .
Just do n't come crying to us if you can't get your rabbit ears into just the right position .
No matter what computer and accessories you use , the added cost will probably pay for itself pretty quickly when you start canceling all those expensive subscriptions .
As I mentioned earlier , going broadband - only will save me about $ 80 a month in satellite fees — in 8 months , I will have recouped my $ 600 home - theater PC investment .

In the end , my entire monthly TV entertainment budget runs about $ 60 — that 's $ 50 for basic broadband plus $ 10 for Netflix .
Compare that to the $ 140 I would have paid starting in February for the combination of all that plus DirecTV .
( As a sports fan , there are online programs that I do pay extra for , but you get what you pay for — as you 'll see below . )

How To Manage and Control Your TV Content
You will have to sacrifice the basic ( if not exactly pretty ) UI you are used to .
Fortunately , things are getting better .
Hulu Desktop looks more like what you would find with a broadcast set - top box , and with Windows Media Center , having Netflix and other plug-ins makes finding and watching on - demand shows a whole lot easier .
And there 's at least one new website , Clicker that is taking a crack at organizing internet content into an easy - to - use programming guide .

Fortunately , I managed to keep the number of remotes on my coffee table to a minimum .
I have a Windows Media Center remote to handle Netflix , DVDs , Hulu Desktop and downloads .
Mac users have their own little white remote which handles much of this functionality , too .
( A wireless keyboard and mouse are essential for more intricate navigation and many PC functions , but those can stay out of sight for the most part . )
i Phone / iPod Touch apps like Air Mouse and iTunes Remote have made my iPhone an all - in - one solution for controlling my computer and its software .

Watching Your Favorite Shows
I 'm not a TV addict by a long shot , but there are shows that I watch religiously .
These shows include 30 Rock , Lost , Family Guy , Californication and Dexter .
The following graph illustrates the pluses and minuses of viewing a handful of different shows — not just my favorites — from popular networks .
Advertisement
The newest episodes of many of these shows are on Hulu , which mostly hosts fresh content — there is n't a huge back catalog of shows .
The catch with new shows , on Hulu or on network websites , is that you usually have to wait a day to see them .
( For many DVR devotees , that 's not a big deal anyway . )
Advertisement
It 's also important to point out that certain networks tease their new seasons in many locations online — NBC has been offering free HD downloads of many new shows on iTunes , in hopes you 'll buy the season pass for $ 40 or more .
Netflix is another place where networks promote new shows : I was able to see the first episode of Californication and Dexter on Netflix during their limited time Watch Instantly preview .
Speaking of that , Showtime shows , if available at all , do tend to appear on Netflix , but mostly only in re-runs .
Advertisement
As you can see , not everything streams in HD quality , although this appears to be changing .
ABC is already streaming in HD , and others like Hulu and Netflix are dabbling , so it 's only a matter of time before HD content is widely available for streaming online .
What 's Not Online
CBS , HBO and Discovery : I 'm talkin ' to you .
I could n't care less about CBS programming — though it's the # 1 rated network , so clearly somebody does .
CBS.com ( and TV.com ) offers a handful of full episodes ( CSI and NCIS ) , and some of those show up in Netflix too , but until CBS decides their agenda , you may have to wait for new seasons of Big Bang Theory to show up on DVD , or try to record over - the - air broadcasts ( see above ) .

I love History Channel and Discovery Channel , and these guys are also reluctant to accept reality , move away from old revenue models and look towards the future .
Nonetheless , I still get my fix though Netflix .
Early seasons of some of my favorite shows ( Deadlest Catch , Man vs Wild ) are available for streaming via Watch Instantly , and more recent seasons are available for rental .
I have the patience to wait for some of my favorite shows to arrive on DVD or Blu- ray — it 's a virtue that could save you lots of money .

Let 's Talk Live Sports
Traditionally , one of the major drawbacks of internet TV is a lack of live sports .
Again , I do n't know what sports and teams you are interested in , but for me it is all about football .
For example , a few days ago I checked out the Steelers / Chargers game on NBC Sunday Night Football online .
The streaming content is " HD " quality ( at least it 's in the realm of HD ) and the service offers a viewing experience that is actually deeper than a standard broadcast .
Users have access to DVR style controls , four separate camera angles , highlights and live analysis .
Advertisement
I also have the privilege of access to my beloved out - of - market NY Giants games each week with DirecTV 's online Supercast service .
It broadcasts all of the Sunday Ticket NFL games over the internet , but access to the online content requires DirecTV service and the full SuperFan package that runs a ridiculous $ 400 per year ( Manhattan residents can access Supercast without DirecTV service ) .
However , if you know someone with a Supercast account , you can piggyback .
If baseball is your thing , MLB.com offers a service similar to Supercast for around $ 100 per year depending on the package — although it only includes out - of - market games .
Live golf can be viewed for free on PGATour.com ; college sports , baseball , tennis , soccer and more is free on ESPN360 ( if you are affiliated with an ESPN - approved broadband provider ) and streaming sites like Justin.tv offer plenty of free sports viewing options , including live ESPN .
Windows Media Center owners can also get SportsLounge , with Fox Sports .

The Future ?
This is still the wild west , and things are apt to keep changing .
I already mentioned services like DirecTV's Supercast and streaming games from MLB.com .
Little by little , you will start to see primetime shows or packages offered a la carte online too .
I hope we do n't get to a point where we are paying more for access to online content than we now pay for cable content , but there has been serious talk by executives from Time Warner ( HBO ) , CBS and Hulu ( Fox , NBC , Disney ) about that very thing :
Either charge subscribers for premium content on demand , or simply verify that they are already paying customers of cable and satellite , and grant them access to stuff others can't see .
Advertisement
If the broadcasters have their way , you 'll pay for it one way , or you 'll pay for it another .
Still , technology has a way of keeping pace with the dreams of media execs , and the experiments conducted by YouTube and Hulu and others with advertising may lead to some kind of compromise , too .
It is really all up in the air , but for now ...
What You Should Think About
When all was said and done , I found my experience without standard cable television to be more liberating than anything else .
Sure , streaming video is n't always HD quality , not all of my favorite shows are readily available , and I have to search around a bit more for the things I want to watch — but I did n't suffer and I did n't feel like I was missing out .
The added expense was not justifiable — especially when I was paying for a bunch of things I never watched .
The best part is that I was able to get pretty much everything I needed with a basic set of tools that anyone with a computer can take advantage of right away .

Not everyone shares my taste in television but , at the very least , you should take a good look at your cable or satellite bill and ask yourself if it 's really worth all that money .
Roma -
I risultati in termini di share sono buoni , ma i contenuti ( come da cliché ) hanno scatenato una polemica infinita .
Di questo , però , Santoro non si cura ed esulta : " Abbiamo lavorato in condizioni di assoluta emergenza e siamo andati in onda a regola d’arte da un altro studio con una squadra nuova " .
Tuttavia , gli attacchi al premier Berlusconi e al Giornale non passeranno inosservati .
Il ministro dello sviluppo economico , Claudio Scajola , non ci sta e si preopara a convocare i vertici di viale Mazzini : " E ' l'ennesima puntata di una campagna mediatica basata sull ’ infamia " .
Scajola convocherà i vertici Rai Che Santoro abbia superato i limiti era già chiaro ieri sera .
Nonostante la debole difesa di qualche esponente del centrosinistra , il Pdl e la Lega Nord ha duramente deprecato Annozero .
Ma a prendere una decisione definitiva è stato Scajola che convocherà " i vertici della Rai per verificare se trasmissioni come Annozero rispettino l'impegno , assunto dalla Rai nel contratto di servizio , a garantire un' informazione completa e imparziale " .
In una nota , il ministro allo Sviluppo economico ha fatto sapere che " è ora di finirla " .
" E' l'ennesima puntata di una campagna mediatica basata sui pruriti , sulla spazzatura , sulla vergogna , sull ' infamia , sulle porcherie - ha puntualizzato Scajola - la televisione non può sostituire le aule dei tribunali , soprattutto quando la magistratura non ha rilevato alcun elemento per aprire inchieste sul presidente del Consiglio .
Stiamo attraversando una stagione di veleni che sconcerta i cittadini .
Queste aggressioni sono la risposta disperata alla politica del fare del Governo Berlusconi , nell`illusione di sovvertire il risultato elettorale .
La politica non può arrendersi a questa logica " .
Zavoli : " Evitare invasioni di campo "
Il presidente della Commissione di Vigilanza Rai Zavoli stigmatizza l’intervento di Scajola ammonendolo dal fare invasioni di campo .
" La sua iniziativa di convocare i vertici Rai sorprende , non corrispondendo ad alcuna prassi istituzionale e stabilendo un pericoloso precedente " , osserva Zavoli , ricordando che " gli organismi propri di controllo della televisione pubblica sono la Commissione parlamentare di vigilanza e Agcom .
Invasioni di campo inasprirebbero ancor più le polemiche politiche " .
I dati di ascolto Su Raiuno Don Matteo è stato seguito nella prima parte da 6 milioni 603 mila spettatori ( 23,56 % di share ) e nella seconda da 5 milioni 734 spettatori ( 24,02 per cento di share ) .
E ' alto anche il dato della trasmissione di Santoro , ma non sufficiente per riuscire a vincere la sfida .
La prima puntata della nuova stagione di Annozero ha , infatti , segnato il 22,88 per cento di share , pari a 5 milioni 502 mila spettatori .
Sempre in prima serata , su Canale 5 , il film di Ale e Franz è stato seguito da 3 milioni 268 milioni di ascoltatori , pari al 13,24 per cento di share .
L'esultanza di Santoro Secondo Santoro il risultato ottenuto " premia un prodotto interamente Rai e non è soltanto frutto delle polemiche " .
" Oltre il 36 % di permanenza indica che un fetta molto importante di opinione pubblica ha voluto segnalare al governo che una cosa sono le scelte elettorali e un’altra le scelte informative - ha spiegato il conduttore di Annozero - insomma per il pubblico l’informazione deve essere considerata un contrappeso per chi esercita il potere " .
" Questo vuol dire che il pubblico ha espresso una sfiducia nei confronti del governo ?
- si è , quindi , chiesto Santoro - Assolutamente no .
Ma sicuramente vuol dire che il pubblico chiede una informazione più libera da qualunque tipo di condizionamento politico e soprattutto chiede di avere più informazione .
Adesso mi auguro che prevalgano gli interessi della Rai e il senso di responsabilità " .
Garimberti ridimensiona il risultato " Sulla puntata di esordio l’attesa era grande , il buon risultato di ascolti è frutto anche di questo " .
Garimberti ridimensiona la performance di Santoro : " E ' stata una trasmissione alla Santoro , nel suo stile classico .
Comunque non do giudizi , non faccio il critico televisivo " .
E anche sull ’intervento di Travaglio il presidente della Rai dice : " E ' stato un Travaglio doc , è il suo stile , il suo modo di fare giornalismo .
Si può amare o no , ma è opportuno che ci siano vari generi e che uno possa scegliere se guardarli o meno " .
Un’esigenza , sostiene Garimberti , di cui è consapevole lo stesso direttore generale Mauro Masi : " Non è che il direttore generale non capisca che ci devono essere vari generi , non dipingetelo diverso da com’è .
Quello che ha sempre caratterizzato la Rai è la presenza di più voci : c’è il Tg1 , il Tg2 , il Tg3 e alla fine il pubblico può scegliere , c’è il telecomando che è uno strumento di democrazia " .

A consortium backed by the Malaysian government is pushing hard for Lotus to beat BMW Sauber to the final slot in next year 's Formula 1 world championship , AUTOSPORT has learned .
BMW Sauber chiefs have been looking for a buyer to secure the team 's future , and there has been speculation that the outfit 's Malaysian backers could support a buyout bid .
However , AUTOSPORT understands that the sponsors are instead close to throwing their support behind the totally new team that will use the Lotus name .
AUTOSPORT understands that the Malaysian government is keen to continue the promotion of its oil company Petronas in F1 , but also start delivering a higher profile for the Lotus company name - which is owned by Malaysia 's national car maker Proton .
The push for the Lotus name in F1 could also be boosted by the arrival of former Ferrari brand guru Dany Bahar as the company 's new CEO , although it is believed his appointment at the current time is coincidental and not linked to the F1 plans .
Lotus 's ambitions are being spearheaded by respected technical chief Mike Gascoyne , whose original Lotus team linked with the Litespeed operation were widely talked about earlier this year .
Malaysia's Sports Minister Datuk Ahmad Shabery
Cheek refused to deny talk that the government is looking at its involvement in the team when speaking to local media yesterday .
" Nothing has been finalised and there 's nothing to comment , " he told the Malay Mail .
" I 'm not confirming , neither am I saying otherwise . "
Shabery also did not rule out that an announcement about the team 's plans was scheduled to be made after the Singapore Grand Prix later this month by Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak .
He said : " Let 's wait for the PM to make the announcement .
Who knows what will happen after the Singapore GP . "
The FIA is currently evaluating the entries for the 13th team in F1 , with an announcement expected in the next few weeks .
It was the fall of 2007 , financial markets were collapsing , and Wall Street firms were losing massive amounts of money , as if they were trying to give back a decade 's worth of profits in a few brutal months .
An investor named John Paulson somehow was scoring huge profits .
His winnings were so enormous they seemed unreal , even cartoonish .
His firm , Paulson & Co. , would make $ 15 billion in 2007 .
Mr. Paulson 's personal cut would amount to nearly $ 4 billion , or more than $ 10 million a day .
That was more than the 2007 earnings ...

I was making rounds at the hospital and , for some strange reason , I was being asked about influenza .
No , this is not going to be an entry on influenza .
But I was asked if there was anything besides the vaccines that can prevent influenza .
Masks and good hand washing will help , I said .
Anything else ?
A nurse suggested colloidal silver .
I said there was nothing to colloidal silver .
With what I would describe as a withering look , she opined that not only had she never had the flu because she took colloidal silver , but that she has a friend whose tumor has been in remission for 6 years because of colloidal silver .
She had to respond to an alarm and I had to move on to the next patient , so we yet had an opportunity to converse further on the topic .
Which is good because it occurred to be I did not know much about colloidal silver beyond the fact it can turn you blue .
So this entry in my attempt to prepare for my next discussion with a colloidal silver proponent .
Silver is an antiseptic , not an antibiotic .
It has the advantage of most antiseptics in that organisms do not easily become resistant .
It does kill a large number of pathogens and is used clinically .
Silver is impregnated into catheters to prevent infections .
Silver nitrate has been put in the eyes of newborns to prevent gonorrhea .
Various formulations of silver have been tried to aid wound healing , with little effect and Silvadene , silver sulfadiazine , has long been used to treat burns , although its efficacy , when compared to everything from honey to aloe , is often found wanting .
So there is variable clinical data to perhaps supporting use of some forms of silver to treat or prevent some infections .
I will admit to an affinity to suggesting honey and or sugar for chronic wounds ; that should be a topic for another post .
There are also uses of silver for water purification .
So there are legitimate reasons to use silver as an antiseptic .
Ancient wisdom is always a guide for therapy .
Cupping .
Bleeding .
Purging .
Popular therapies back in the day .
Silver containers was used by ancients to keep water and other fluids fresh .
I cannot find independent verification of this fact , perhaps they kept water in silver because silver is pretty and rare and good for demonstrating wealth , and we are attributing its antiseptic properties retroactively .
Nor can I find independent verification that Royals were called blue bloods due to chronic silver exposure from their eating utensils .
Odd that colloidal silver sites would mention this , since it is evidence of toxicities they deny occurs in other sections of the same websites .
The use of apocryphal information appears to be standard in the colloidal silver ‘ literature ’ .
It is rare to have so little verifiable information about a treatment .
As I have discussed before , users of alternative therapies are not comfortable with nuance and subtlety , and , I think , prefer black and white binary approaches .
Mercury in one form is toxic , so all forms of mercury are toxic .
Some forms of silver are beneficial , so all forms of silver of benefit , including colloidal silver .
The inability to deal with shades of gray is a hallmark of many forms of alternative therapy .
As best I can tell , silver was used as a medicine for years by grinding it up and suspending it in water .
The problem is that the silver is not dissolved but is a suspension and it rapidly settles out of solution .
What people were looking for at the turn of the century was a way to keep the silver in suspension .
Colloids occur when one substance is evenly distributed in another without being dissolved , like antibodies or albumin in blood .
Or fat in milk .
Proteins like albumin have the advantage of binding metals like silver and allow them to stay in suspension for long periods of time .
“ The broader commercial definition of “ colloidal silver ” includes products that contain various concentrations of ionic silver , silver colloids , ionic silver compounds or bound proteins in purified water .
Colloidal silver with concentrations of 30 parts per million ( ppm ) or less are typically manufactured using an electrolysis process , whereas colloidal silver with higher concentrations of 50 ppm or more are usually silver compounds that have been bound with a protein . ”
In the form of colloidal silver it is ingested for various alleged health benefits , especially to treat infections .
How many infections ?
“ Colloidal Silver safely kills over 650 disease - causing bacteria , viruses , fungi , parasites , and molds , has no negative side - effects . ”
650 ! Wow !
Where does that number come from ?
It , evidently was pulled out of thin air in a 1976 Science Digest article entitled “ Our mightiest germ fighter ”
which was a discussion of of of not colloidal silver , but silver sulfadiazine , aka silvadene and other topical uses of silver .
And nowhere in the article is 650 validated .
It was a number that appears to have been invented by the headline writer .
Not that Science Digest is peer reviewed journal and has to reference their headline .
But that 650 has taken on a life of its own .
Like 98.6 being normal body temperature .
Many of the colloidal silver sites trumpet this on their websites ( 43,000 Google hits for “ Colloidal Silver kills over 650 ″ as a search term . ” 650 is so sciency , even if made up .
Could silver kill 650 various and sundry organisms ?
I would not be surprised if it were the right concentration .
Silver is toxic to cells , so it should kill germs .
And it does .
Like mercury or gold .
In its elemental form they are toxic and will kill living things at the right concentration .
As will isopropal alcohol ; ingestion may not be such a good idea .
Many chemicals can kill a wide variety of bacteria in the test tube .
The question is whether they have the same effects in humans and or animals .
If you look on Pubmed for the antimicrobial effects of colloidal silver , I find nothing .
No test tube studies , no animal models , no case reports , no clinical trials .
As far as the medical industrial complex is concerned there is , outside of toxicities , no supporting data of any kind for the use of colloidal silver .
The interwebs does allow access to susceptibility tests of colloidal silver that are published by the companies that make colloidal silver products .
However , conflict of interest is not part of the alt med world , so we do not need to worry about their validity .
Sarcasm aside , the studies are growth of bacteria in various concentrations of colloidal silver products and as the concentrations increase , the bacteria die more rapidly .
That ’s the usual dose - effect of a poison .
They also tout that bacteria ca n’t become resistant to silver .
Always a mistake , for to misquote the Borg , resistance is inevitable as E. coli has demonstrated .
So there is no data to support silver to treat infections .
What about cancer ?
It is suggested , with often identical wording on website after website , that “ Dr. Bjorn Nordstrom , of the Karolinska Institute , Sweden , has used Silver in his cancer cure method , for many years .
This brought rapid remission in patients given up on by other doctors . ”
I do not know who was first with this sentence so I am uncertain whom to credit with the first use of this phrase .
But here is the weird thing .
Although Dr. Nordstom is credited with the same breakthrough with exactly the same sentence in site after site , I can find no English language reference that confirms there is a Bjorn Nordstrom or any details as to how he uses silver for a cancer cure .
Dr Nordstum has not published on Pubmed .
The only reference on the interwebs to a Dr Nordstom is in Swedish .
If someone can translate http://www.cancerochallergifonden.se/priset1998.html we may find out more .
The Swedish word for silver , silvret , is not on the page .
I suspect , from reading the Swedish , he may be married to Betty Crocker .
So for what diseases is there evidence for which colloidal silver is efficacious ?
Well , nothing .
Pubmed is silent on taking colloidal silver to benefit any disease , infection or otherwise .
There are no clinical trials to show efficacy .
Nothing .
There is , however , little to suspect that colloidal silver , taken orally , would be of benefit .
There are not even basic pharmacokinetic studies to show how much of a given colloidal silver preparation is absorbed .
Nothing .
We know it is absorbed , as there are multiple cases of argyria reported in the literature .
Argyria is where the silver gets irreversibly into the skin and you turn not silver but blue or blue gray .
It is an unusual side effect , but the only documented effect of prolonged ingestion colloidal silver .
If you Google colloidal silver , you will find multiple sites where you can purchase various formulations of colloidal silver with variable concentrations of silver .
All of the purveyors of these substances agree that theirs is the one true formulation for silver and that the others are flawed with the wrong size of silver molecule or the wrong preparation .
Which one is truly the true silver colloid ?
All .
Or none I would suppose .
One seller ( many of these people really need a web designer ) sells increasing concentrations of colloidal sliver , with the higher concentrations for the most cost ( 1500 dollars for 6 bottles ) to treat ” Severe Infections and Life and Death Infections Ebola , Dengue Fever , Malaria , SARS , West Nile at a dose of 1 - 3 tablespoon ( 15 - 45 cc ) every 4 hours ” .
There appears to be as many silver formulations as there are silver sellers , and if you are a do it yourself kind of person , you can make your own colloidal silver .
What perpetuates the use of colloidal silver are testimonials , like the nurse who suggested silver to prevent H1N1 .
The interwebs are filled with unsubstantiated testimonials , for common infections and unusual infections , with one gentleman crediting colloidal silver , rather than the vancomycin and gentamyin , for the cure of his subdural empyema ( pus between the brain and skull ) .
The FDA , with little effect to judge from the interwebs , has declared that colloidal silver is neither safe nor effective and , as an unclassified drug , can not be sold for medical reasons .
Even the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine , who rarely finds anything alternative therapy without some caveat to support its use , says . :
“* Silver has no known function in the body * Silver is not an essential mineral supplement or a cure - all and should not be promoted as such * Claims that there can be a “ deficiency ” of silver in the body and that such a deficiency can lead to disease are unfounded * Claims made about the effectiveness of colloidal silver products for numerous diseases are unsupported scientifically * Colloidal silver products can have serious side effects * Laboratory analysis has shown that the amounts of silver in supplements vary greatly , which can pose risks to the consumer . ”
Of course , this review leaves me with blanks in my SBM gun .
I have no data to say there is no reason to use colloidal silver .
To combat the testimonials I have , well , nothing .
No science and no substance .
It is the Oakland of alternative medicine .
Except for toxicity , all the supporting data I can find , history , 650 germs killed , Dr. Bjorn Nordstrom , the testimonials , and the formulations of colloidal silver are based on unverifiable information or apparently made up .
It is a house of silver cards .
However , if the Blue Man Group is looking for members , I know a potential source that will save on makeup costs .
AT&T lobbyist asks employees , their families and friends to protest net neutrality rules
AT&T's top lobbyist , Jim Cicconi , sent a letter to all of the telecom giant 's 300,000 employees on Sunday , urging them to express their concerns over a net neutrality proposal under consideration by the Federal Communications Commission .
Check out his letter and comments on the Actuarian Outpost Web site .
The letter was the latest move in a lobbying frenzy days before the FCC votes on a proposal to create new net neutrality regulations .
High - tech giants wrote to the agency to support the rules , while dozens of lawmakers from both parties have protested the rules as potentially dangerout to economic growth .
" We encourage you , your family and friends to join the voices telling the FCC not to regulate the Internet , " Cicconi wrote in his letter .
The company verified the letter .
Cicconi explained how employees could use a personal e-mail account to post comments on the FCC 's net neutrality Web site to about the rules .
He said the comment period had been extended until Thursday , when the agency 's five commissioners are scheduled to vote on a proposal that would begin the formalization of rules .
" Those who seek to impose extreme regulations on the network are flooding the site to influence the FCC , " he wrote .
" It 's now time for you to voice your opinion . "
Cicconi has criticized FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski's push to strengthen and broaden rules for how Internet service providers treat content on their networks .
Cicconi said such rules should not apply to wireless networks , which have less capacity than fixed wireline networks like cable .
He has said that AT&T Mobility and other mobile broadband providers should not be strapped by new rules when it comes to managing broadband traffic congestion .
In the letter , he offered several talking points .
1.Wireless consumers enjoy a many options for mobile services ;
2. Competition in the wireless industry is strong ;
3. AT&T and other carriers need flexibility to manage their networks ;
4 . Net neutrality rules could hamper a goal of the White House to bring broadband to every U.S. household ;
5 . If the FCC passes the new regulations , the rules should apply to more than just network operators and should also include Web content companies like search engines .
I ’m often asked where I got the name “ Southern Avenger . ”
For starters , it was a rip - off of a popular ’90s conservative talk radio host named Ken Hamblin , who called himself the “ Black Avenger . ”
In a Jim Beam - induced haze , a friend convinced me it was catchy , and it just sort of stuck .
But that ’s only half the story .
In my early 20s , I was a full - blown , right - wing radical .
As a member of the Southern secessionist group the League of the South , I argued seriously for the states of the old Confederacy to break away from the rest of the Union .
I differed little in temperament from most left - wing college radicals , but instead of wearing a Che Guevara T - shirt , I would sport Southern revolutionaries like Thomas Jefferson .
After I left college ( dropped out , actually ) , I began working in radio and writing on a weekly basis .
By the time I graduated from rock radio to talk radio and began writing for the Charleston City Paper , I thought it might be better to tone down the radicalism and at least try to appear more respectable .
But when I came across an old column of mine last week , I realized that I never really changed .
I ’m still just as radical or crazy , depending on your perspective .
In fact , I might be getting worse .
Almost a decade before I became a regular columnist here , my first contribution to the City Paper was in 1999 as a spokesman for the League of the South .
In a cover story entitled “ Heritage or Hate ? ” I defended the Confederate flag as a symbol of states ’ rights :
“ What is significant about the Confederacy is not the racial attitudes it shared with the rest of the Western world , but its resistance to the centralization of power …
What does this symbol of a bygone era mean for us today ?
The last I checked , the government is bigger than ever and shows no signs of reduction .
The only difference between the Republicans and Democrats is in what way they are going to use the most powerful government in the history of the world for their own political and economic gain . ”
Though my personal feelings on what the Confederate flag stands for have not changed , as I ’ve become older I do realize that the South ’s most famous symbol has different meanings to different people — and not all of them positive .
I also realize that the political point I was trying to make in 1999 is even more true today — that the Republican Party of George W. Bush and the Democratic Party of Barack Obama both represent the massive expansion of centralized power at the expense of constitutional government and individual freedom .
Bush oversaw drastic deficits , dramatically increased our domestic and foreign policy budgets , and damaged constitutional liberties with the Patriot Act and other police state measures .
Obama has kept virtually all of Bush ’s outrageously expensive and heavy - handed policies intact and is now intent on laying down an even heavier bureaucratic hand .
The angry reaction by significant segments of the American people to Obama ’s statist agenda has become so widespread , that something as innocent as the president giving a Nancy Reagan - style speech to kids about staying in school and away from drugs is a cause for controversy .
But what does this say about the very concept of an “ American people ? ”
Is there still a national identity that truly binds us despite our many deep and glaring differences ?
Much of the current , bitter political divide is just partisan politics , but there is also principle at stake .
There exist many , perhaps even a majority of Americans , who simply do not share the Obama administration ’s national vision .
There is not merely a difference of opinion , but a stark , night - and - day clash .
We ’re used to old disagreements over issues like abortion , gay marriage , and religion in the public square , but that long - standing social divide has now broadened thanks to a debate over the very role of the state , as evidenced by the intense discussion about national healthcare .
In 1999 , I already thought Americans were too different : “ America is becoming more diverse and multicultural which means the multiplicity of ideas and values will increase .
Only states ’ rights , the heart of the Confederate cause , can meet this challenge . ”
If divorce is considered preferable to a marriage that ca n’t be fixed , might not divorce also be preferable to a political union that has failed as well ?
The Jeffersonian , decentralist philosophy and all - American radicalism I embraced fully in my youth makes even more sense today than in 1999 .
Whether revisiting states ’ rights or going the route of full - blown secession , it would be far more logical to allow the many , very different parts of this country to pursue their own visions than to keep pretending we are all looking through the same lens .
And looking back on my own past , I am reminded that any future South worth avenging would do well to revisit its own radical heritage — so that the principles of limited government might rise again .

Anyone who cares about the survival of our planet should start praying that Barack Obama gets his way on reforming US healthcare .
That probably sounds hyperbolic , if not mildly deranged : even those who are adamant that 45 million uninsured Americans deserve basic medical cover would not claim that the future of the earth depends on it .
But think again .
Next week , world leaders will attend the first UN summit dedicated entirely to climate change .
Their aim will be to plunge a shot of adrenaline into stuttering efforts to draw up a new global agreement on carbon emissions .
The plan is to replace the Kyoto treaty with a new one , to be agreed in Copenhagen in December .
Trouble is , the prospects of getting a deal worthy of the name get bleaker every day .
Few deny that the world needs a new agreement .
In the 12 years since Kyoto , we 've emitted a whole lot more carbon – and gained a whole lot more knowledge of its dangers .
The science is now clear that if we do not manage to keep the increase in the earth 's temperature below 2C , we risk facing the effects of catastrophic climate change – with all the flooding , drought , mass migration and human suffering that it would entail .
The experts tell us that the only way to stay below that 2C limit is for global emissions to peak in 2015 – and then start falling .
In other words , we have set ourselves up at a nice corner table in the last chance saloon .
Copenhagen is that last chance .
If successful , it could see rich countries promise not only to cut their emissions but to stump up cash for poor nations to pay for the changes they 'll need to protect their towns and villages from those effects of climate change already under way and too late to reverse ( think houses on stilts on easily flooded sandbanks in Bangladesh ) .
Developing countries would not have to cut their own emissions right away , but they would have to plan now for a low - carbon future , one consistent with keeping the planet below that two - degree mark .
A new Copenhagen treaty would lead us to the day when our worldwide emissions peak – and then start coming down .
We would at last be reversing the tide that threatens to engulf our planet .
If that 's the prize , there are the most enormous obstacles in its path .
A single text would have to be acceptable to rich and poor nations , democratic and not , left and right , binding them not just for now but for decades hence .
As the Guardian reports today , even the developed countries of the west cannot agree among themselves how carbon emissions should be counted , let alone reduced .
What 's more , elected leaders will have to be sure that whatever they sign at Copenhagen will be accepted back home .
Which brings us to Obama .
Last November , the sigh of relief among greens and diplomats could be heard around the world .
While George Bush had ripped up Kyoto , Obama would surely lead the way to Copenhagen .
Now that early confidence is fading .
Those same diplomats and negotiators have seen the president struggle to make what , to outsiders , look like pretty reasonable changes to US healthcare .
They have seen a summer campaign demonise him as an amalgam of Stalin , Hitler and Big Brother , bent on sending America 's frail grannies to their deaths in the name of a new socialism .
If that 's the response he gets when he suggests Americans should be covered even when they change jobs or get sick , imagine the monstering coming his way if he tells his compatriots they have to start cutting back on the 19 tonnes of CO 2 each one of them emits per year ( more than twice the amount belched out by the average Brit ) .
Even if he was prepared to defy US public opinion , Congress would n't let him .
Remember , it was not Bush who killed the Kyoto treaty in the US .
The Senate rejected it before the text had even been finalised , by a margin of 95 votes to none .
Once again , if Obama cannot even get his healthcare reform through a Democratic - controlled senate , what chance a climate change treaty that goes beyond Kyoto ?
One European diplomat closely involved with the talks despairs at the " Republican headbangers who cannot resist a chance to damage Obama , believe global warming is based on junk science and regard action on climate change as ungodly because it will delay the second coming " .
Unsurprisingly , this is having an immediate effect on the morale of everyone else involved in Copenhagen .
Some negotiators worry that the urgency is being drained from the process : why bust a gut to make a December deadline for a document that 's only going to end up either diluted or in the Capitol Hill shredder ?
Others worry that those countries already looking to delay the moment of truth will be only too happy to use Obama as their excuse .
Bush may have gone , but the United States still makes a handy scapegoat in plenty of European capitals .
The greatest concern is over the Chinese .
They start out sceptical , wondering why developing countries should do anything to clear up a mess created by the rich ones .
Wave the stats that say 90 % of the growth in future emissions will be from the developing world , and their response is direct : they will do nothing that will slow down their own economic growth .
Add to that the prospect that the US might not , after all , be ready to pull its weight and the Chinese enthusiasm for sacrifice shrinks still further .
" After you , " they seem to be saying to the west .
Their current position is that their emissions will not start falling until 2030 : the science suggests that , for the world to have a hope , that date is just too late .
So is the world about to blow its last chance to avoid catastrophe ?
Yesterday I visited the Department of Energy and Climate Change – where a Countdown to Copenhagen clock greets visitors in the lobby – to talk to Ed Miliband .
If he is feeling pessimistic , he did his best to hide it .
He concedes that the current talks are " hanging in the balance " but argues that even if some omens are troubling , the stars will never again be in such favourable alignment .
A first - term US president who believes global warming is real is matched by a Chinese leadership that , whatever its wariness of international agreements , does now believe climate change is a real threat to its own safety .
Miliband is confident that , so long as the Chinese come to see low carbon as an opportunity – to make green - tech products they can then sell to the world – and so long as US opinion can be brought around , a deal is within reach .
But these are enormous ifs , especially the latter one .
It 's good to hear that Al Gore and John Kerry are hard at work , organising outside and inside the Senate , but as the healthcare debacle shows , shifting US attitudes is a daunting task .
What 's needed is for US campaigners to step up their efforts , starting now , and not letting up for three months : no sleep till Copenhagen .
Their mission must be to build the public support for action on climate change that might act as a counterweight to those " Republican headbangers " and give Obama the space to act .
Not for the first time , the fate of the world rests in the hands of US domestic politics .
As it did a year ago , autumn begins with the world watching the Americans , holding its breath that they will do the right thing .
It seems not uncommon for gourmands to be bibliophiles and , for those of who combine these interests , it 's not unusual to find the odd trace of someone else 's snack sandwiched between the pages of an old volume .
Most of us , curled in our favourite reading chair with a steamy mug of something reassuring will have come across a previous reader 's biscuit trail , crushed into the page gutter .
There 's something lovely about the connection with others who have loved the same book , sitting in their own chairs with their own mug , who knows how many years ago .
In terms of acceptability I realise this ranks alongside an admission that I pick my nose and eat it , but I can never resist tasting the crumbs .
I know , I know : it 's vile and unhygienic but I 've got books here going back to the 17th century .
I 'm not going to miss the opportunity to taste a Jacobean hobnob .
But according to The Argus newspaper , a Worthing librarian has gone one better than mere biscuitry , discovering a rasher of bacon in a returned library book .
Unfortunately , the Argus report goes on to list other things found in library books rather than pursuing the obvious and far more exciting culinary angle .
Was it smoked ?
Was it streaky or back ?
Did the reader place it raw into a heavy hardback , perhaps flattening it to wrap a tiny terrine ; or was it cooked and sandwiched between the absorbent pages of a pulp work on bodily self - improvement in an attempt to soak up unhealthy fats ?
We need to know .
The bacon bookmark has , however , got us wondering .
What 's the weirdest and most inappropriate use you 've encountered for a food ?
Welcome to the OpenEEG project About the project Many people are interested in what is called neurofeedback or EEG biofeedback training , a generic mental training method which makes the trainee consciously aware of the general activity in the brain .
This method shows great potential for improving many mental capabilities and exploring consciousness .
Other people want to do experiments with brain - computer interfaces or just want to have a look at their brain at work .
Unfortunately , commercial EEG devices are generally too expensive to become a hobbyist tool or toy .
The OpenEEG project is about making plans and software for do - it - yourself EEG devices available for free ( as in GPL ) .
It is aimed toward amateurs who would like to experiment with EEG .
However , if you are a pro in any of the fields of electronics , neurofeedback , software development etc. , you are of course welcome to join the mailing - list and share your wisdom .
Right now , this site is mostly about the hardware ; schematics , part lists , building instructions etc .
However , a few members have developed some useful software which is hosted on their own websites .
You can find these through the software pages .
Some regulatory business Commercial and clinical EEG devices must live up to certain standards .
This is good , since it provides a measure of protection for a user or patient .
Obviously , we cannot provide such guarantees , as the OpenEEG project consists of a loosely knit group of people from all over the world .
Thus , it is not an organization in the legal sense ( especially since we do not have any money ) .
Some people are not even American , so you can't really sue them and hope to win a million dollars in damages either .
The designers have done their best to create a safe device , but knowing whether the effort is good enough is a completely different matter ( an $ 8000 matter actually ) .

ATLANTA -- A poll says that 67 percent of Americans do n't understand Obama 's healthcare plan .
I 'm one of them .
It 's not because I do n't pay attention .
I 'm a news junkie .
Could it be that I 'm an idiot ?
If my insurer offered psychiatric coverage I could afford to find out .
I 'm pretty sure , though , that my friends are smart .
I asked my publisher , who runs the oldest publisher of graphic novels in the U.S. , whether he understood what Obama 's " public option " was .
He did n't .
I asked a teacher , who earned a masters from an Ivy League school .
She did n't either .
I asked a bunch of political cartoonists .
Neither did they .
Obama 's attempt to reform healthcare is all but dead ; his polls are dropping .
How did Obama turn lemonade into battery acid ?
Obama PR flack David Alexrod tries to explain that " to make choices is to make some unhappy . "
GOP strategist Charles Black counters that the president 's popularity and " good will " does n't equate to support for " liberal policies . "
I think they 're both wrong .
The collapse of ObamaCare is rooted in the problem described by the cognitive linguist George Lakoff : liberals do a crappy job of communicating to the public .
Speaking of which : what is / was this mysterious " public option " ?
On the left , The Nation magazine says it 's " designed around not making people change their healthcare if they like what they have . "
OK , so that 's what it 's not .
What is it ?
" Instead , there will be rules that insurance companies have to follow to provide better care , and a health insurance exchange , including a public option , for people who do n't have employer - provided care . "

A public option is a public option is a public option .
How helpful .
I rely on words to make a living .
I 've published 14 books .
Some have even sold well .
" Health insurance exchange " ?
WTF ?
You know what I think ?
I think this is like that fairy tale about the emperor 's new clothes .
I think The Nation does n't know what the " public option " is any more than the rest of us .
They 're just afraid to admit it .
On the right , The National Review says it 's " a government - run insurance plan that will compete with private insurers . "
Compete how ?
For a guy reputed to have a way with words , Obama is n't adding any clarity .
Huh ?
Dems say the " trigger " is n't a death panel .
Instead , private insurance companies would have to make their services cheaper within a certain number of years ( say , five ) .
If costs stayed high , the U.S. government would then create a ... public option .
( Unless Congress , feeding at the trough of insurance company lobbyist money , was persuaded to amend the law between now and then . )
" This is the best shot we 've got for getting a public option , " a House Democratic adviser told UPI .
" It 's better than nothing . "
Actually , it 's exactly the same as nothing .
Except that nothing sounds better .
I understand " nothing . "

Gordon Brown must feel he can't win on MPs ' expenses .
His first attempt to clean up the system , pre-empting the review by the Kelly Committee on Standards in Public Life by issuing his own proposals , is remembered only for his infamous YouTube video .
Yesterday , another well - intentioned move – the independent audit of all claims by MPs over four years that Mr Brown announced in May – also boomeranged and left the Prime Minister with the biggest headache so far .
He will repay £ 12,415 after Sir Thomas Legg , the former mandarin conducting the investigation , judged that he claimed too much for cleaning bills .
Although he did not breach the rules that existed at the time , it is a large sum that can only make his battered public image even worse .
Mr Brown had hoped the Legg inquiry would complete its work by July but it dragged on .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The final element of the clean - up would be this month when Sir Christopher Kelly 's anti-sleaze committee proposed a new expenses regime for the future , drawing a line under the damaging affair before the general election .
Sir Thomas has clearly been more forensic and tougher than ministers bargained for ; they expected a few bad apples would be asked to pay back money , with the rest given a clean bill of health .
Now the Legg and Kelly reviews are overlapping , prolonging the agony .
Detailed claims by all MPs over the past 18 months will also be published this autumn – without the blanked - out pages which turned the previous instalment covering 2004 - 08 into a farce .
Not for the first time , a Brown initiative has not gone according to plan .
Although David Cameron and Nick Clegg are also implicated in the Legg review , MPs in all parties believe the two main opposition party leaders have been quicker on their feet in the expenses saga than Mr Brown .
Even when he takes decisive action , he gets little credit for it .
As the governing party , Labour was always likely to take a bigger hit on expenses than its rivals .
It is true that some of the most embarrassing claims ( such as for duck houses and moat cleaning ) were from Tory MPs .
Quick action by Mr Cameron – and some rough justice against old guard MPs – limited some of the damage .
When Mr Brown followed suit and cracked down on individual Labour MPs , it rebounded .
The Norwich North MP Ian Gibson resigned when he was deselected as a Labour candidate , provoking a by - election won by the Tories .
Yesterday , the atmosphere in the Commons was tense , as if MPs had been dispatched to a new , unfamiliar school for the new term , and anxiously awaited an instant disciplinary report from draconian Headmaster Legg .
The expenses issue , barely mentioned during the party conference season , now tops the political agenda again , drowning out Mr Brown 's attempts to turn Labour 's fire on the Tories .
Cabinet ministers fear its long shadow will not lift by the general election .
And that is bad news for Labour .
Last night on Jay Leno's new show , Chris Rock put on blast some of the attitudes surrounding director Roman Polanski , ripping into the rhetorical dances being done around what Polanski actually did - which was rape a thirteen year old .
The conversation around Roman Polanski has been a hard one to follow .
Part of it is annoyance - it is unnerving to see how certain celebrities fall under scrutiny for consorting with minors and others can make it seem like an unfortunate lapse in judgment .

Lauren over at Feministe brings her experience into the narratives around Polanski , noting :
Rape is not the only assault .
Around rape is a large segment of the population that questions the victim , a culture that looks down on victims for allowing themselves to be victimized , or keep them victimized , questions about the victim 's credibility , questions about the legacy of rape and how bad it is , because how bad is rape really ?
Rape , because various levels and forms of sexual assault are systemic and pervasive across all societies , exists alongside one 's experiences of unwanted touching , wanted touching , sexual objectification , sexual desire , sexual harassment , incest , love , leering eyes , cat calls , roaming hands , consent , confusion , tits , vagina , rectum , penis , mouth , rape and not - rape , all of it loaded , all of it veering at rape 's ugly legacy , co-mingling , the legacy that tells us to be more careful , to dress more conservatively , to BE BETTER AT BEING VULNERABLE , or BE MORE POWERFUL , or BE MORE FEARFUL , or GET OVER IT ALREADY .
Rape leaks into healthy , consensual experiences .
It lingers .
It pervades .

Roman Polanski initiated sexual contact with someone he knew to be underage , persisted after she said no , pled guilty to unlawful intercourse with a minor , and fled the country when he feared he would go to prison anyway .
What 's so disturbing about the articles is n't that people are claiming our legal system is flawed .
It 's that people - be they in Hollywood or your average citizen - are grasping for all kinds of ways to twist this back on the victim and to exonerate Polanski by denying this crime ever happened .
So you want him to walk on a technicality ?
Fine .
Admit that !
But why are we denying that the rape ever happened ?
Advertisement
It did happen .
Polanski admitted as such .
So are people so invested in the idea that if we pretend it is n't " rape - rape " then the matter will be resolved ?

As Rock says at the end of the clip : " The United States , we want to capture Osama Bin Laden , and murder him .
We do n't want to rape him - that would be barbaric ! "
Rape is a barbaric act .
And I 'm amazed it took a comedian to say it outright .

Boehner has n't met " anyone " who backs public option
House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) has just more or less dared proponents of a public option to bombard his office with their expressions of support of the plan .
Boehner claimed , with a semi- straight face , that he has yet to meet a regular " American " who favors the option -- despite polls showing that a majority of voters support to the idea of having the choice of a government plan .
" I 'm still trying to find the first American to talk to who 's in favor of the public option , other than a member of Congress or the administration " said Boehner , whose sole recent foray into a public discussion of health care reform was a tea - party - style event in Ohio a few weeks back .
" I 've not talked to one and I get to a lot of places , " he told reporters at his weekly press availability .
" I 've not had anyone come up to me -- I know I 'm inviting them -- and lobby for the public option .
" This is about as unpopular as a garlic milkshake . "
I then asked him : " Is n't a garlic milkshake healthy ? " to which he replied , " I do n't know I have n't tried it . "
The polls are actually pretty divided on the issue , with a SurveyUSA poll showing three - quarters of Americans backing a public option choice .
But that number dropped to 43 percent when the option was portrayed as a mandatory component of the plan in an NBC / WSJ survey .
A Saudi Arabian man who boasted about his sex life on a TV talk show has been jailed for five years , his lawyer says .
Mazen Abdul Jawad was also sentenced to 1,000 lashes by a Saudi court on charges relating to immoral behaviour .
His lawyer says he will appeal .
The Saudi offices of LBC , the Lebanon - based Arabic channel which broadcast the show in July , were shut last month .
On the show , filmed in his Jeddah home , Abdul Jawad spoke about picking up women and displayed sex toys on camera .
Extra -marital sex is illegal in Saudi Arabia , one of the most conservative societies in the Arab world .
The 32 - year - old father - of - four 's interview prompted around 200 complaints from Saudi viewers and calls for him to be punished .
Abdul Jawad later apologised , saying producers at the TV station had tricked him into some of his accounts .
' Scapegoat '
Abdul Jawad 's lawyer , Sulaiman Jumaie , said three friends who appeared on the show with his client had been given two - year terms .
Mr Jumaie said the conviction was wrong because the men should have been tried in a court that specialised in media issues , not criminal cases .
" My client has been presented to the people as a scapegoat to cover up the real culprit LBC , " Mr Jumaie said in a statement obtained by AFP news agency .
Saudi Arabia uses a strict Islamic law code .
People who break the rules face punishment - lashes or imprisonment - for drinking or non-marital sex .
Correspondents say the rules are flouted by locals as well as expatriates , but almost everyone keeps quiet about it and hopes they will not be found out .
Summary :
The arrangement between the Australian Government and Microsoft is revealed and the already - exposed BECTA does ‘ damage control ’
A few days ago we wrote about the good work of OpenAustralia , which helped expose how the government had been working with Microsoft .
Around the same time comes this report from an author who is consistently supportive of Free software .
Microsoft controlling Govt 2.0 funds
The Government 2.0 Taskforce yesterday released a draft contract for those receiving money from its Project Fund , which revealed that any funding contracts will be between successful bidders and Microsoft , not the Commonwealth .
The Project Fund was used by the Taskforce to fund initiatives that will provide input into its final report and building up government agency “ web 2.0 capabilities ” .
The Taskforce has already asked for two rounds of project submissions .
Yet the government has only now revealed that the funding arrangements must be made via Microsoft .
It needed to be so because the taskforce was not a legal entity and money was pulled from the Project Fund , according to the government — a partnership with Microsoft that used funds from a special Service Provision Fund .
This is a major scandal and hopefully it ’s just the beginning of it .
This shows how a foreign commercial entity essentially runs the government rather than the people who elect their officials controlling the government or at least being served by it .
The remainder of this article is also eye opening .
Over in the UK , a similar scandal is happening with BECTA , which seems to have turned into some kind of a Microsoft front that helps train ( indoctrinate ) children for a career in Windows and Office [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] .
The heat has apparently gone up so much that BECTA now throws a little token to “ open source ” .
Schools can now get help from a new community website to help them decide whether open source software might offer benefits for them . [...]
The website is part of a project supported by Becta which aims to raise the awareness of open source software .
Too little , too late .
They merely build a sandbox for people to play in , pretending that they paid more than just lip service to interests other than Microsoft’s .
A proper action would actually bring Free software into classrooms , not create a goalless portal ( crowdsourcing ) . █

US executions are meant to be clinical and humane , but for some they end up resembling medieval torture , complete with the smell of burning flesh , screams , and scenes so gruesome that witnesses faint .
“ We put animals to death more humanely , ” reporter Carla McClain said of a 1992 execution she witnessed , in which Donald Eugene Harding writhed and thrashed in an Arizona gas chamber for over 10 minutes before dying .
ADVERTISEMENT
Last month , Romell Brown became only the second man to leave a US execution chamber alive , after 18 failed attempts to administer the lethal injection .
Authorities in Ohio decided to halt his execution after officials spent two hours trying to inject him with lethal chemicals .
Many of those executed in the United States in the last 25 years were not so lucky , suffering through executions in which flesh caught on fire , blood saturated shirts , and witnesses watched and listened as the condemned convulsed and screamed with pain .
In 1999 , Florida Supreme Court Justice Leander Shaw reacted with horror to pictures of Allen Lee Davis , who was put to death by electric chair .
“ The color photos of Davis depict a man who — for all appearances — was brutally tortured to death by the citizens of Florida , ” Shaw wrote .
ADVERTISEMENT
Davis had been strapped into an electric chair especially designed to fit his 350 - pound frame .
As he was electrocuted , but before he was pronounced dead , blood poured from his mouth , soaking his white shirt and oozing through the buckle holes of the strap holding him down .
Michael Radelet , a professor at the University of Colorado , worked with the Death Penalty Information Center to collect testimony on more than 40 botched instances from the witnesses required to be present at executions .
Horror stories have emerged about all the execution methods commonly used in the United States , including the electric chair , lethal injection and gas chamber , with most of the disasters due to human error .

In 1983 in Alabama , a first jolt of electricity caused the electrode attached to John Evans ’ leg to catch fire .
Smoke and sparks also came from under the hood placed over his head , near where an electrode was strapped to his left temple .
A second jolt was administered , but despite the smoke and smell of burning flesh , doctors discovered Evans ’ heart was still beating and applied a third jolt that finally killed him after 14 minutes .
ADVERTISEMENT
Two years later , in Indiana , William Vandiver received five separate jolts of electricity over the course of 17 minutes before his heart stopped .
Jesse Joseph Tafero was sentenced to death by electric chair in Florida in 1990 , but a synthetic sponge that was used during his execution caught fire , causing six - inch flames to erupt from his head .
Sentenced to death by gas chamber in Mississippi in 1983 , Jimmy Lee Gray had the misfortune to be put to death by an executioner who later admitted he was drunk .
Gray ’s gasps and moans so horrified observers that the witness room was cleared by officials .
ADVERTISEMENT
In recent years , several lawsuits have challenged the lethal injection as “ cruel , ” but it continues to be used by most US states practicing the death penalty and the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality in 2008 .
But for Bennie Demps , who spent 33 minutes of agony as execution technicians tried to find a back - up vein that could support an alternate intravenous drip in case the first one failed , the pain was excruciating .
“ They butchered me back there .
I was in a lot of pain .
They cut me in the groin , they cut me in the leg .
I was bleeding profusely .
This is not an execution , it is murder , ” he said in his final statement .
In Angel Diaz ’s case , in Florida in 2006 , a single dose of the lethal cocktails that anesthetize , paralyze and then stop the recipient ’s heart was not enough .
The first injection went through his vein and out the other side , dispersing the chemicals into his muscles , forcing a second dose to be given .
ADVERTISEMENT
At times , the scenes have been gruesome enough to physically affect observers .
In 1989 , in Texas , which holds the record for the most US executions , a male witness fainted after watching Stephen McCoy ’s violent writhing .
Some of the most recent horror stories come from Ohio , where Broom ’s execution was halted .
“ It do n’t work !
It do n’t work , ” yelled a sobbing Joseph Clark in May 2006 , as the vein that executioners had worked 22 minutes to find collapsed while the chemicals were being administered .
A year later , Ohio authorities took two hours to successfully find veins and administer Christopher Newton the lethal injection .
The process took so long , he was authorized to take a bathroom break .

The only other person to have survived execution in the United States was young black man named Willie Francis who survived a Louisiana electric chair in the 1940s .
He was later put to death on a second attempt .
When I read that a new spider species was named Heteropoda davidbowie in honor of David Bowie , it reminded me of several other celebrities whose names were enshrined in taxonomy because there are so many new spiders being discovered as distinct species .
With a little digging , even more star spiders turned up !
1. David Bowie
German arachnologist Peter Jaeger has discovered 200 species of spiders in the past decade , and has now named one of his finds after singer David Bowie .
The new species , a large yellow spider in Malaysia , is called Heteropoda davidbowie .
Jaeger said he named the spider to draw attention to the discovery , and to raise awareness of the endangered status of many spiders .
Bowie had a 1972 album entitled The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars , and his 1987 tour was named the Glass Spider Tour .
2. Neil Young
Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi is a trapdoor spider first discovered in Alabama in 2007 .
It was described by taxonomist and spider systematist Jason E. Bond and Norman I. Platnick of the American Museum of Natural History .
Bond named the creature for Neil Young because he enjoyed his music and respected his work as an activist .
3. Orson Welles
An entire genus of giant Hawaiian linyphiid spiders are named after filmmaker Orson Welles .
There are several species in the genus Orsonwelles , including Orsonwelles othello , Orsonwelles macbeth , Orsonwelles falstaffius , Orsonwelles bellum , Orsonwelles toledus , and Orsonwelles ambersonorum .
These names can be linked to roles he played or movies he made .
You can thank biologist Gustavo Hormiga for naming these spiders .
4. Stephen Colbert
Aptostichus stephencolberti was named for political satiristÂ Stephen Colbert after he pretty much demanded the honor upon hearing that Neil Young had a spider named after him .
Colbert 's is a California trapdoor spider first described by East Carolina University biologist Jason E. Bond , who was also responsible for naming Neil Young 's spider .
5. Nelson Mandela
Stasimopus mandelai is a trapdoor spider found in South Africa .
The species was named in 2004 by zoologists Brent E. Hendrixson and Jason E. Bond in honor of the former South African president .
6. Harrison Ford
The spider Calponia harrisonfordi was named for the star of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars in thanks after Ford narrated a documentary for the London Museum of Natural History in 1994 .
Arachnologist Norman I. Platnick discovered the spider in 1993 .
It is tiny , only around 5 millimeters in length , and lives in California .
7. Angelina Jolie
Aptostichus angelinajoleae is another species named by Jason E. Bond , this time in collaboration with Amy Stockman .
It is a California trapdoor spider that is closely related to Stephen Colbert 's spider .
In fact , there is some doubt about whether the two species are different .
8. Dizzy Dean
Mastophora dizzydeani is a bolas spider .
It makes a sticky ball on a short thread from its silk .
The spider swings the ball at its insect prey to trap them .
This particular species was discovered by William G. Eberhard and named for baseball player Dizzy Dean .
Since this spider 's livelihood depends on throwing a ball fast and accurately , it seems appropriate to name it in honor of one of the greatest baseball pitchers of all time , Jerome " Dizzy " Dean .
Dean threw for the Chicago Cubs and the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1930s and ' 40s and is a Hall of Famer .
9. Frank Zappa
The orb weaver spider Pachygnatha zappa was discovered by Robert Bosmans and Jan Bosselaers during expeditions to Mount Cameroon in 1981 and 1983 .
They presented the species in 1994 .
They noticed markings under the spider 's abdomen that reminded them of musician Frank Zappa .
His moustache in particular .
" Etymology .
Zappa is a noun in apposition .
This species epithet is given in honor of the twentieth century composer Frank Zappa ( 1941 - 1993 ) , well known for both his serious and commercial music .
The dark grey mark on the ventral side of the abdomen of the female of this species strikingly resembles the artist 's legendary moustache ( Fig. 69 ) "
Frank Zappa also had a jellyfish ( Phialella zappai ) and a fish genus ( Zappa , a genus of Gobiidae ) named in his honor , but the spider is the only one of the three that resembled him .
If you think a spider should be named after you , there are several scientific departments you can contact to try your luck .

Johns Hopkins Medicine Greider
MGH Szostak
This year 's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine shines the spotlight on the ends of chromosomes and the essential cell biology that takes place there .
The three researchers sharing the prize have demonstrated that these ends , called telomeres , and the enzyme that makes them , known as telomerase , protect chromosomes and ensure that they 're faithfully copied each time a cell divides .
The discovery has launched major research efforts in areas where cell division takes center stage , including aging and cancer .
It also " has stimulated the development of new therapeutic strategies , " the Nobel committee said in its citation .
Three U.S. - based researchers will share the prize , the one hundredth medicine prize to be awarded .
Elizabeth H. Blackburn , 60 , a professor of biology and physiology at the University of California , San Francisco ; Carol W. Greider , 48 , a professor of molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine ; and Jack W. Szostak , 56 , a professor of molecular biology at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School , each have been awarded one third of the $ 1.4 million prize .
Blackburn , who holds both U.S. and Australian citizenship , and London - born Szostak joined forces in the early 1980s to demonstrate that a repeating DNA sequence , CCCCAA , from the ends of chromosomes in a single - celled organism called Tetrahymena , could protect chromosomes in a completely different organism , yeast , from degradation .
It later came to light that telomere DNA does this job in nearly all the branches of the tree of life , from paramecia to people .
Greider , then Blackburn 's graduate student , set about uncovering how telomeres are made .
They found telomerase , an enzyme that contains an RNA component that includes the repeating CCCCAA sequence , which acts as a template to build the telomere .
Telomerase 's RNA component acts as a platform that supports DNA polymerases as they copy an entire chromosome , ensuring that those polymerases do n't miss the chromosome 's ends .
Szostak and Blackburn went on to show that defects in telomeres can lead to early aging in cells , whereas intact telomeres put off aging .
Meanwhile , Greider showed that the telomerase enzyme also delays the aging process .
Although scientists have since found that telomere biology is just one component of the complex process of aging , researchers still hold out hope that turning telomerase on and off might offer a way to control aging .
Abnormal telomerase activity has also been found to play a role in cancer and some inherited diseases , such as a specific form of anemia , though the specifics are still being worked out .
The newly - minted Nobelists have shared other awards for their work in telomere biology , most notably the 2006 Lasker Award , among the most prestigious U.S. awards for biomedical research .
Despite these and other awards the three have netted , " you ca n't really ever expect something - - I had no expectations , " Greider said regarding the prize announcement in a phone interview with the Nobel Foundation .
Thomas H. Lane , president of the American Chemical Society , congratulated Szostak , a long - standing ACS member , in a statement .
" Dr. Szostak 's selection is a wonderful illustration of chemistry 's connections to other sciences , especially medicine , " Lane said .
As if we needed yet another example of how the taxpayer should have been better protected when bailing out Wall Street last fall ...
If CIT goes bust , Goldman Sachs will get a $ 1 billion " make - whole " payment for an earlier emergency capital infusion .
The U.S. taxpayer , meanwhile , who should have been entitled to the usual last - in - first - out protection any private investor would have demanded ( as Goldman did ) , will lose $ 2.3 billion .
Henny Sender and Saskia Scholtes , FT : Goldman
Sachs stands to receive a payment of $ 1bn – while US taxpayers would lose $ 2.3 bn – if embattled commercial lender CIT files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , people familiar with the matter said .
The payment stems from the structure of a $ 3bn rescue finance package that Goldman extended to CIT on June 6 2008 , about five months before the Treasury bought $ 2.3 bn in CIT preferred shares to prop it up at the height of the crisis .
The potential loss for taxpayers would be the biggest to crystalise so far from the government ’s capital injection plan for banks .
The agreement with Goldman states that if CIT defaults or goes bankrupt , it “ would be required to pay a make - whole amount ” that totals $ 1bn , the people familiar with the matter said .
While Goldman is entitled to demand the full amount , it is likely to agree to postpone payment on a part of that sum , these people added .
A CIT filing last week said that it was in negotiations with Goldman “ concerning an amendment to this facility ” .

Today 's article is a follow up to The Aftermath of the Great Recession , Part I .
I am covering the material I will present at ASPO - USA 's Denver conference on October 11 - 13 , 2009 .
I am making this presentation available before the conference in part because there is more material here than I will be able to cover during my introductory talk on the economics panel .
The outlook for consumption growth in the over - leveraged United States is bleak .
Economists Menzie Chinn and Jeffrey Frieden discussed the origins of the financial crisis , the debt situation in the U.S. and the global outlook in Reflections on the Causes and Consequences of the Debt Crisis of 2008 .
This text broadly describes the origin of the crisis .
The United States has borrowed and spent itself into a foreign debt crisis .
Between 2001 and 2007 , Americans borrowed trillions of dollars from abroad .
The federal government borrowed to finance its budget deficit ; private individuals and companies borrowed so they could consume and invest beyond their means .
While some spending went for physical commodities , including imports , much of the spending was for local goods and services , especially financial services and real estate .
The result was a broad - based , but ultimately unsustainable , economic expansion that drove up the relative price of goods not involved in foreign trade — things like haircuts , taxi rides , and , most important , housing .
The key “ nontradable ” good was housing ; that boom eventually became a bubble ...
This disaster is , in our view , merely the most recent example of a “ capital flow cycle , ” in which foreign capital floods a country , stimulates an economic boom , encourages financial leveraging and risk taking , and eventually culminates in a crash .
In broad outlines , the cycle describes the developing - country debt crisis of the early 1980s , the Mexican crisis of 1994 , the East Asian crisis of 1997 - 1998 , the Russian and Brazilian and Turkish and Argentine crises of the late 1990s and into 2000 - 2001 — not to speak of the German crisis of the early 1930s or the American crisis of the early 1890s .
[ My note :
This is an economist 's view of the causes of the meltdown .
The oil price shock of 2007 - 2008 contributed significantly to the downfall , as James Hamilton has documented .
Menzie Chinn is Hamilton 's writing partner at their blog Econbrowser . ]
Of course , a prolonged debt crisis in the United States has much larger global effects than a crisis in Mexico or Argentina .
You will recall from last week that —
Massive debt - fueled consumption in the United States drove the global economic boom of recent years , and thus the oil demand shock of 2002 - 2007 .
In thinking about where we stand right now , this summary from Chinn and Frieden is helpful .
We are now witnessing the unwinding of this process of debt accumulation .
Households and firms are busily trying to reduce their debt loads , in the face of dimmer prospects for income and profits .
For households , savings rates are rising , but at the cost of stagnant consumption .
For firms , the reduction of debt load is consistent with a reduced rate of investment in plant and equipment .
In some sense , this process of retrenchment is necessary .
For many years , the United States consumed more than it produced .
We borrowed and for a while thought that the old rules had been suspended .
But now it turns out that we do have to pay back what we have borrowed .
The attendant higher saving rate and lower investment rate will lead to a substantial improvement in the current account balance , or in other words , the paying off of our debt .
More broadly , though , this also means that the United States cannot rely upon the driver of growth that has sustained it over the past three decades — namely consumption .
But the consequences extend beyond the nation ’s border .
The world can no longer rely upon the American consumer .
Who will take up this role remains to the next big question .
The world can no longer depend on the American consumer .
What country will fill the consumption gap ?
Many have pinned their hopes on China , to which I now turn .
A Resurgence in China ?
Figure 11 — China 's balance of trade , 2007 - August , 2009 .
China 's exports were down 23.4 % year - over - year in August , 2009 .
This is a disaster for an export - oriented economy .
The decoupling theory , wherein China could escape relatively unscathed from an economic crash in the United States and the Eurozone , is dead .
( See this bullish article from the WSJ which attempts to resuscitate this view based on recent bubbly economic growth in China . )
I highly recommend this video about China 's export economy , which features a tour of some of their empty factories .
China has a huge over - capacity problem .
They built a manufacturing base to service ( via exports ) large & growing consumption in the United States ( and elsewhere ) that no longer exists as it did prior to the crash .
( See remarks by financial adviser Hugh Hendry in my A Resurgence in China ?
He compares China to an investor in a Bernie Madoff - like Ponzi Scheme in America . )
Figure 12 — U.S. Trade Balance ( in billion dollars per month ) from 1994 through July , 2009
The other side of the Chimerica coin .
The U.S. trade imbalance reached it 's highest point in the first half of 2008 after widening steadily since 2002 .
Between 2001 and 2007 , the American current account ( trade ) deficit averaged between $ 500 billion and $ 1 trillion every year , resulting in a deficit equal to an unprecedented 6 % of GDP in 2006 .
In other words , the U.S. effectively " borrowed " this much money every year .
Much of that money went toward purchases of residential real estate causing the Housing Bubble .
The exports - imports gap has narrowed considerably as the U.S. imports much less stuff generally and particularly from China .
There has been a small uptick in both exports & imports in the last few months .
Exports - Imports is a ( negative ) term in calculating GDP ( see Part I ) .
So , a narrower gap between the two boosts GDP even if exports are down year - over - year .
Figure 13 — China's GDP growth , 2006 - 2009:Q2
2nd quarter growth reflects the massive Chinese stimulus ( 4 trillion RMB , $ 586 billion , ~ 14 % of GDP , Ren Min Bi , or the People 's Money ) .
This explains growing oil demand since March , 2009 .
August came in at 7.71 million barrels - per-day , down from the peak in July .
Is this growth for real ?
The problem arises with how China figures GDP growth .
See China : Bogus Boom ?
" China 's 8 % output growth target will be met because [ their ] economic statistics are based on recorded production activity ( spending ) , rather than being a measure of expenditure [ final demand ] growth . "
The mere dispersal of stimulus funds [ e.g. to provincial governments ] are counted as GDP growth , whether that money is used or not .
Most of this Chinese investment goes to fixed assets ( e.g. infrastructure ) , not manufacturing where there is so much overcapacity .
My favorite example involves tearing down and then rebuilding perfectly good structures .
" A 2.9 - kilometer elevated highway in Hunan [ was ] demolished when it was meant to last for 36 more years .
A " bridge of strength , " nicknamed as such because it was unscathed by last year 's devastating earthquake , [ was ] dynamited in Sichuan . "
The Chinese will rebuild these structures and thus boost GDP .
All this explains why the Financial Times ' Martin Wolf has suggested that " China should forget having a GDP target , instead of having an 8 % growth GDP target , it should have a real domestic demand target .
It should think of its policy in terms of generating real domestic demand , [ and ] GDP will follow . "
It 's hard to imagine that this craziness is sustainable , and thus will drive China 's future oil demand up and up .
Figure 14 — China is blowing bubbles in their economy as stimulus money floods into assets ( equities , housing ) or bogus fixed investment instead of into over - built manufacturing capacity
China 's growing bubbles are just where you would think they would be —the stock market ( e.g. the Shanghai Composite ) and urban residential housing .
From Bank of China 's Zhu Sees ' Bubbles ' in Asset Values ( Bloomberg , September 10 , 2009 ) —
Bank of China , Ltd. led the nation ’s $ 1.1 trillion lending spree in the first half of 2009 , said ample liquidity has caused “ bubbles ” in stocks , commodities and real estate ...
“ There ’s no way for the real economy to absorb so much liquidity , ” said Liu Yuhui , a Beijing - based economist at Chinese Academy of Social Science .
” Policymakers in China and around the world are well aware of the harm that could do , but they are unwilling to sacrifice short - term growth and wean the economy from addiction to the stimulus policies . ”
The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index has gained 61 percent this year , compared with a 20 percent increase in the MSCI World Index of 1,659 companies .
House prices in China ’s 70 biggest cities rose at the fastest pace in 11 months on record lending and climbing confidence , according to a National Bureau of Statistics report today .
China 's bubbles are a direct result of the Chinese massive stimulus program and Bank of China 's lending , but Premier Wen Jiabao is keeping the pedal to the metal , just as Tim Geithner and " Helicopter " Ben Bernanke are in the United States ( see below ) .
Similar bubbles are inflating all over Asia .
Singapore recently moved to curb speculation in its real estate market , putting the lie to Dr. Alan Greenspan 's ( and Bernanke 's ) peculiar view that speculative inflation of assets can not be detected or managed in advance .
The Chinese leadership presses on with the stimulus because they are running scared politically .
China must have very high growth rates to provide work for the many millions of young people entering the job market each year .
But in trying to forestall an economic crisis that threatens their power , they are risking an even worse collapse of their economy .
China expert Andy Xie makes an apt comparison between China in 2009 and Japan in 1989 .
China can learn a lot from Japan 's experience as well .
Its bubble formed when companies began focusing on financial investments rather than core business .
In the 1980s , Japan 's corporate sector tapped the corporate bond market and raised massive amounts of capital for asset purchases .
Recently , Chinese enterprises borrowed money and pumped it into asset markets .
They essentially provided leverage for asset markets .
When leverage was rising , asset inflation occurred , letting companies book profits that were many times greater than operating profits from core businesses .
That gave them greater incentive to pursue asset appreciation rather than operating profitability .
The corporate sector became a shadow banking system for financing asset speculation .
Thus , China 's corporate sector is now behaving in a way similar to what was seen in Japan two decades ago .
China will not provide the consumption engine the global economy requires for sustained growth — their economy ( domestic demand ) is too small .
provide the consumption engine the global economy requires for sustained growth — their economy ( domestic demand ) is too small .
China 's corporate sector is focused on profiting from inflated assets instead of their core businesses .
Little growth is possible for core businesses because exports have been shrinking rapidly and internal demand is not growing significantly .
The Chinese , traditionally a nation of savers , needs to build up that their domestic demand .
This requires steady " organic " growth over the next decade or longer .
Otherwise , the economy overheats and you get mis-allocation of resources ( capital ) and bubbles ( like now ) .
Here 's my China summary —
Let 's return to stimulus , deficits and indebtedness in the United States .
After that , I 'll sum up .
Figure 15 — Total U.S. debt by sector ( households , non-finance business , finance , government )
All debt is approximately 350 % of nominal GDP ( ~ $ 14 trillion ) .
Government debt has remained at a relatively consistent percentage of GDP for the past 50 years , but the debt of companies , consumers , and financial businesses has soared .
The government is now making up for pass lack of excess ( see Figure 16 below ) .
Figure 16 — Federal revenues and non-interest spending from the Congressional Budget Office
This is fiscal debt ( e.g. the current $ 787 billion stimulus shown as a bump in the graph ) as opposed the Fed 's monetary stimulus .
See my The Incredible Shrinking Boomer Economy for details .
The CBO 's " Alternative Fiscal Scenario " is the one considered most realistic given past political decisions and current realities .
Health care spending ( Medicare & Medicaid ) increases the debt as the Boomers retire .
The Obama administration recently raised its 10 - year budget deficit projection to $ 9 trillion ( from $ 7.1 trillion ) .
This graph does not reflect interest payments that must be made on the debt .
reflect that must be made on the debt .
If the U.S. does not have steady GDP growth , future revenues will fall below trend unless taxes are raised .
Figure 17 — The Federal Reserves assets ( uses of funds ) since December , 2007 .
A short history of printing money .
Assets were $ 2.119 trillion as of September 2 , 2009 .
The sizable declines in short - term lending to financials and non-bank credit markets have largely been offset by increases in holdings of Treasury securities , agency mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) , and agency debt ( Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac ) .
( Only fixed - rate agency MBS securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae are eligible assets for the program . )
Treasury purchases monetize some of the U.S. debt .
Quantitative easing refers to a series of steps to flood financial markets with liquidity , including the purchase of mortgage backed securities , to help keep long term ( mortgage ) rates low .
The Federal Open Market Committee has held the fed - funds rate at a lowest - ever range of 0 % to 0.25 % since December 2008 .
( Technical note : Open market operations — purchases and sales of U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities — are the Federal Reserve 's principal tool for implementing monetary policy ...
The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions lend balances at the Federal Reserve to other depository institutions overnight . )
The value of the Fed 's agency MBS purchases depends on a shaky real estate market ( see Figure 9 , part I )
Some expect QE — monetary and rate stimulus — to continue right through 2010 and perhaps into 2011 !
Summary And Outlook
Factors Affecting Recovery
There is an Alphabet Soup describing the shape of the recovery for the short to medium term ( next few quarters out to 2013 ) or long term ( out to 2020 ) : V ( rapid , sustained recovery ) , U ( longer , slower recovery ) , W ( double - dip recession ) or L ( long - term depression ) .
The shape of the recovery determines future oil demand , and thus the timing of The Next Oil Shock .
The Fed 's exit strategy presents a fundamental dilemma : ( 1 ) if interest rates are tightened too fast , the risk is that any economic " expansion " will be nipped in the bud ; ( 2 ) if rates stay too low for too long , the risk is for new bubbles as described next .
The longer that QE and fiscal stimulus go on unabated in the United States , China and elsewhere , the more certain it becomes that new destructive bubbles will develop in world markets .
This is already occurring in China .
Excess liquidity looking places to invest drives unwarranted asset price inflation .
The S&P 500 is looking very bubbly already as money flows into equities .
There have been no reforms of Big Finance , so highly - leveraged risk - taking proceeds apace .
There is no check on risky bets because losses have been " socialized " ( put on the shoulders of current or future tax payers ) .
See Peter Boone and Simon Johnson 's The Next Financial Crisis .
Only government spending is driving GDP growth in the United States and China .
None of the other factors — consumption expenditures outside health care , fixed investment , or the trade balance — will significantly contribute to GDP for some time to come .
Consumption will remain depressed in the United States for a long time as households repair balance sheets .
The loss of wealth ( in housing , stocks ) and the threat of unemployment also curtail spending .
Retiring Boomers make the situation much worse in the long term .
Unemployment will remain high in the United States for a long time as weak banks repair balance sheets ( limiting credit ) and businesses limit investment until such time as renewed consumption warrants expansion .
The real estate markets ( residential , commercial ) in the United States will remain weak for many years .
Prices will remain depressed in the medium to long term and excess inventory must be worked off in the short to medium term .
China will not lead the world out of recovery as described above .
If China and the United States do not lead a global recovery , then who will ?
Thus , in considering the shape of the global economic recovery ( as measured by GDP ) in the short to medium term , it seems highly unlikely that we will get a V - shaped recovery .
I agree with William White , who is quoted in the Financial Times ' Leading Economist Fears Double - Dip Recession —
The world has not tackled the problems at the heart of the economic downturn and is likely to slip back into recession , says one of the few mainstream economists who predicted the crisis .
Speaking at the Sibos conference in Hong Kong yesterday , William White , the former chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements , also warned that government actions to help the economy in the short run might be sowing the seeds for future crises .
" Are we going into a W [ - shaped recession ] ?
Almost certainly .
Are we going into an L ?
I would not be in the slightest bit surprised , " he said , referring to the risks of a so - called - double - dip recession or a protracted stagnation such as Japan suffered in the 1990s .
" The only thing that would really surprise me is a rapid and sustainable recovery from the position we 're in . "
Nouriel Roubini has noted the heightened risks for a W - shaped double - dip recession .
The majority of economists still see a U - shaped recovery .
In either case , we can not expect a sharp rebound in global economic growth , and thus oil demand , in 2010 and perhaps 2011 as well .
In The Next Oil Shock , I predicted that the next oil price shock would occur around 2012 as shown in Figure 18 .
This forecast was consistent with a U - shaped global recovery .
Figure 18 — Another oil price shock in 2012 +/- 1 year .
Whenever it occurs , the next oil shock will have a severe impact on a fragile world economy .
That 's my story and I 'm sticking to it .
But it could be wrong for any number of reasons .
We could have a prolonged L - shaped depression .
Or the Fed 's exit strategy could be botched and we will end up with another severe recession .
And then there are the inflation / deflation issues — Eric Janszen will talk about those at the conference .
A global economy that depended so heavily on Chimerica is unsound .
There is great danger all around us .
No one knows what the next shoe to drop will be .
Or when that will happen .

The U.S. military is providing intelligence and surveillance video from unmanned aircraft to the Pakistani army to assist in its week - old offensive in South Waziristan , marking the deepest American involvement yet in a Pakistani military campaign , officials said .
The assistance includes imagery from armed Predator drones that Defense officials say are being used exclusively for intelligence gathering in the offensive .
Providing such information fills gaps in the Islamabad government ’s spying arsenal , officials said , and helps show how the Obama administration intends to intensify pressure on insurgents in Pakistan as the administration overhauls the U.S. military strategy in neighboring Afghanistan .
The cooperation also reflects a significant shift for Pakistan , which had previously resisted U.S. offers to deploy Predators in support of its military operations .

Recent militant attacks have shaken the Pakistani government , convincing officials of the need for help in taking on militants .
Early today , police said , a suicide bomber killed six people in an attack near a military complex in northern Pakistan .
On Thursday , gunmen opened fire on a Pakistani army jeep in Islamabad , the capital , killing a senior officer and his driver .
The current offensive , marked by heavy fighting , is seen as crucial for both the U.S. and Pakistan .
South Waziristan is the base for Pakistani militants who have mounted a string of attacks across the country , and it is an important refuge for Al Qaeda .
Advertisement
“ We are coordinating with the Pakistanis , ” said a senior U.S. military official , one of several who confirmed the operations on condition of anonymity .
“ And we do provide Predator support when requested . ”
For months the United States and Pakistan have been sharing information from Predator flights in the volatile border regions , but until now the Pakistanis had not accepted help for their major military operations .
Islamabad turned down American surveillance and targeting aid during the offensive in the Swat district that began in May .
The use of military drones for intelligence gathering in Pakistan is separate from the ongoing Predator attack campaign being carried out in that country by the CIA .
Over the last 18 months , missile strikes from CIA - operated drones have killed at least 13 senior Al Qaeda or Taliban operatives in Pakistan ’s tribal zone .
U.S. assistance is deeply controversial in Pakistan , which wants to avoid the appearance that it is dependent on the American government or military .
Advertisement
The two governments have had difficulty in sharing some information in the past .
American officers have accused Pakistani officials of tipping off targets about upcoming strikes .
But a senior U.S. Defense official said that in the Waziristan offensive , U.S. and Pakistani interests are closely intertwined .
“ The Pakistanis are getting more and more serious about the militant threat , ” said the official .
“ You are going to see more sharing as trust develops and assurance develops that they are using the information for effective operations against Al Qaeda and the Taliban . ”
A Pakistani military official acknowledged the intelligence cooperation , saying the U.S. was helping to provide a “ composite picture ” of the enemy and the terrain in which it is embedded .

The Pakistani official and a senior U.S. official both said that the offensive followed high - level talks between the two nations ’ military leaders .
Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan , had flown to Islamabad to work out coordination on the border and intelligence - sharing issues before the Pakistani military campaign began , the Pakistani official said .
Similarly , Pakistani officers , including the commander of the nation ’s air force , have held meetings with Navy Adm .
Michael G. Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and other U.S. officials in Washington in recent weeks .
White House deliberations over McChrystal ’s recommendation to send reportedly 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan have received heavy attention in recent weeks , but the Obama administration also has examined how to provide more effective assistance to Pakistan .
Advertisement
The administration is moving toward rebalancing its focus between Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Vice President Joe Biden and other key civilian and military leaders have argued that Pakistan receives insufficient U.S. attention and resources .
The Pakistani offensive is principally aimed at a militant group that has carried out the recent series of deadly attacks in the country , and was formerly led by Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mahsud , killed by a CIA drone airstrike in August .
U.S. officials have pressed Pakistan to expand its military campaign to other Taliban groups and hope the Pakistanis will next take aim at North Waziristan , used as a haven by Afghanistan ’s Taliban factions .
The Pakistani military official said there was “ no discrimination ” when it comes to which Taliban groups to pursue .
Advertisement
Still , U.S. officials said they have seen no indication that the latest campaign has targeted , or will target , militants linked to Afghan Taliban leaders such as Mullah Mohammed Omar and Jalaluddin Haqqani .
Some defense analysts said it was crucial for the Pakistanis to consolidate their gains in South Waziristan before moving on to other territory .
“ We would like them to extend the offensive , ” said Stephen Biddle , a military historian and defense analyst .
“ But we would also like them to hold what they clear .
It might or might not be a good call for them to add territorial goals , when it is most important for them to hold what they take . ”
Frederick Kagan , a defense analyst at the American Enterprise Institute , argued that helping the Pakistanis retake South Waziristan is vital both to the stability of Pakistan and to the U.S. campaign against Al Qaeda .
Advertisement
“ It is conceivable that we could look back at this South Waziristan operation as a turning point in the war against Al Qaeda , ” Kagan said .
“ This has been the safe haven for these guys . ”
American officials said the new cooperation has developed partly because the U.S. has broadened its outreach to Pakistani officials beyond Ashfaq Kayani , the Pakistani army chief of staff .
The U.S. believes that if it can get Islamabad to accept more help , the Pakistani offensive will be more effective .
Right after the Swat operation , Pakistani leaders talked of an offensive in Waziristan , but it did not happen then .
The military ’s munitions needed replenishing , analysts said .
Advertisement
Previous offensives by the military against insurgents in Waziristan did not last .
After operations in 2003 and 2004 came cease - fires that allowed Taliban forces to regroup .
Pakistani leaders have been accused of downplaying the militant threat , but the Pakistani official described a new level of resolve .
“ There is a national urgency to do away with this militancy once and for all , ” the official said .
Pakistan has superior human intelligence on the ground , where its powerful Inter - Services Intelligence has cultivated networks of informants among militant groups .
But the government has a limited ability to intercept cellphone calls and other transmissions .
“ Any type of imagery would be of use to the Pakistanis , either from Predator or other means , ” said another senior U.S. Defense official .

In particular , the official said , Pakistan has sought intelligence “ on locations of the enemy , resupply routes , resupply activity . . . in real time . ”
Military experts said the Predator surveillance video could help ground units target militants and gain better awareness of the threats around them .
“ The drones are not wonder weapons , ” said Biddle , the military historian .
“ But in this situation , a relatively conventional ground offensive , the Pakistanis want the ability to see over the hill , and in that , U.S. drones can be a lot of help . ”

This blog post is not for the faint - hearted !
Some people will strongly disagree with me and some others will probably want to kill me at the upcoming Zend Conference .
And if starting an argument in the comments can help you feel better , please feel free to do so .
If you want to have a more advanced discussion on this topic , vote for my talk at the Zend UnConference .
So , you think PHP is a templating engine ?
So did I ... for a very long time .
But recently , I changed my mind .
Even if PHP can be used as a templating engine , the syntax is just plain ugly as a template language .
For several years now , I have been promoting web development best practices , and one of them is the separation of concerns .
Of course , as the lead developer of symfony , all the projects we work on at Sensio are modeled after the MVC architecture .
It certainly helps when we have big projects where many people need to work together .
The developers work on the code ( the Controllers and the Model ) and the web designers work on the design .
And templates are sometimes written by developers , but more often than not , they need to be written by web designers or by the webmasters themselves .
And a template language is something that helps you to write templates that respects this separation of concerns .
A template language should find a good balance between giving enough features to ease implementing the presentation logic , and restricting the advanced features to avoid the business logic to cripple your templates .
So , when I asked a few days ago about the best and popular templating engines in PHP on Twitter , some people naturally answered " PHP " itself .
I was not even surprised as that would probably have been my answer some weeks ago too .
Why PHP is not ( anymore ) a good template language ?#
Why do people still think PHP is a templating engine ?
Sure enough , PHP started its life as a template language , but it did not evolve like one in the recent years .
If you think PHP is still a template language , can you give me just one recent change in the PHP language which enhanced PHP as a template language ?
I can not think of one .
Template languages evolved a lot since 1995 and the initial release of PHP / FI :
<!-- include /text/header.html-->
<!--getenv HTTP_USER_AGENT-->
<!-- ifsubstr $ exec_result Mozilla -->
Hey , you are using Netscape ! < p> <!--endif--> <!-- sql database select * from table where user= ' $ username ' -->
<!-- ifless $ numentries 1-->
Sorry , that record does not exist < p > <!--endif exit-->
Welcome <!--$user -->!<p>
You have <!--$ index:0--> credits left in your account .
< p > <!-- include /text/footer.html-->
And as a matter of fact , PHP does n't support many features modern template languages should have nowadays .
I will take Django as an example of a modern template language in my examples for reasons you will understand later on , and mainly because I think Django template language hits that sweet spot I talked about above .
The following sections describes the main features I want to find in a modern template language :
The PHP language is verbose .
You need no less than 14 characters just to output a simple variable ( and no , using the more compact <?= shortcut is not an option ) :
<? php echo $var ?>
And PHP becomes ridiculously verbose when it comes to output escaping ( and yes , escaping variables coming from an unsafe source is mandatory nowadays ) :
<? php echo htmlspecialchars ($var , ENT_QUOTES , ' UTF - 8 ' ) ?>
Compare with the same examples written with the Django template language :
{{ var }} {{ var|escape }}
Template oriented syntax #
This one is mostly a matter of taste , but modern template language have nice idioms to express common needs .
For instance , let 's say you want to iterate over an array and want to display a default text when the array is empty .
That 's very common , but the PHP version is not very readable :
<? php if ( $items ) : ?> <? php foreach ( $items as $ item ) : ?> * <? php echo $ item ?> <? php endforeach ; ?> <? php else : ?>
No item has been found .
<? php endif ; ?>
The Django version is much better thanks to the use of an else clause for the for tag :
{ % for item in items %} * {{ item }} { % else %} No item has been found .
{ % endfor %}
PHP has greatly evolved over the years as far as reusability is concerned .
Since PHP5 , the object implementation is much better , and when traits will be supported in the next version of the language , we will have a solid general purpose language at our disposal .
I 'm really happy with all these changes as it helps me write better programs , but these enhancements are irrelevant when what you want to do is to mainly write templates .
Django introduced template inheritance some years ago , as a way to mimic classes but for templates :
<!-- base.html --> < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xml:lang= " en " lang= " en " > < head > { % block head %} < link rel= " stylesheet " href= " main.css " /> { % endblock %} </ head > < body > { % block content % }{ % endblock %} </ body > </html > <!-- index.html --> { % extends " base.html " %} { % block head %} {{ block .
super }} < link rel=" stylesheet " href= " main.css " /> { % endblock %} { % block content %} Index content { % endblock %}
It 's elegant , easy to understand , and really powerful .
It 's so powerful that many template engines now support this feature out of the box .
I 'm not saying PHP is not a secure language , far from it .
But needless to say that escaping a variable in a template is just a nightmare as I have showed you previously :
<? php echo htmlspecialchars ($var , ENT_QUOTES , ' UTF - 8 ' ) ?>
Of course , you can create your own function to make it shorter , but that 's not my point :
<? php echo e( $var ) ?>
For me , security should be enabled by default , especially for templates written by non-developers who are not necessarily aware of the common web threats like XSS or CSRF .
As far as I know , symfony was one of the very first web frameworks to have automatic output escaping for variables used in templates ( 2006 ) ; and in the recent years , major frameworks followed the same path : Django has automatic output escaping enabled since 1.0 , and Ruby on Rails will also have it in the upcoming version 3 .
Having output escaping enabled by default also means that auditing an application is much easier .
Just have a look at templates where escaping has been disabled :
{ % autoescape off %} {{ object .
as_html }} { % endautoescape %} {{ object.as_html|safe }}
Of course , I 'm well aware of the automatic output escaping problems .
You still need to take care of escaping variables in JavaScript tags correctly , but that 's much easier to remember than just having to escape everything by hand .
Sandbox mode #
This one is a must - have when you allow users to edit templates ( when webmasters are allowed to edit some templates from a web backend for instance ) .
That 's not a universal need , but one that needs to be addressed anyway .
Evaluating a template in a sandbox means being able to restrict what can be done in it .
For instance , you should be able to restrict the methods / functions that can be called , the tags that can be used , ...
Neither PHP nor Django have a sandbox mode , so keep reading this article to learn more about this topic .
Alternative template languages in PHP #
So , I started looking for a template engine that has all the features I mentioned above .
I found many different template engines but none satisfied all my needs .
The next sections talk about some of them and some others people suggested in reply to my tweet .
As PHP have a million template engines , I have only tested and benchmarked the more " popular " ones .
And as I do n't use these libraries , the following sections can contain wrong information .
In such a case , please correct me in the comments and I will then fix this post accordingly .
Smarty and Smarty 3 #
That 's the first one that comes to mind .
And Django template language itself was inspired by Smarty .
Smarty is the de-facto PHP standard template engine .
Hello {$name|escape} {section name=item loop=$items} { $items [item ] |escape} {/ section}
But Smarty suffers from several problems :
Not object oriented
No template inheritance
No sandbox mode
No automatic escaping
As far I understand , Smarty 3 is just around the corner and will improve the library quite a lot :
Object oriented architecture
Auto escaping of variables
Template inheritance
I tested the two versions , but the performance of both are quite bad ( see at the end of this post for more information on the benchmark I did ) .
PHPTAL is a very nice project that implements the Zope Page Templates syntax .
It is very well designed , supports lots of features , but is unable to render templates besides HTML ones , which can be a problem if you want to use the same language for emails , RSS feeds , and so on .
<?xml version = " 1.0 " ?> < html > < body > Hello < span tal : content = " name " /> < ul tal : repeat = " item items " > < li tal : content = " item " ></ li > </ul > </ body > </html >
Also , I think the syntax is not web designer friendly , especially when you use advanced features like template inheritance :
< html metal:use-macro=" layout.xml/main " > < body metal: fill - slot= " content " >
Hello < span tal : content = " name " /> < ul tal : repeat= " a array " > < li tal : content= " a " ></ li > </ul > </ body > </html >
< html metal : define-macro= " main " > < metal : block define - slot= " content " /> </html >
One of the biggest selling point of PHPTAL is the autocompletion you can have in IDEs , and a guarantee that your HTML is well - formed .
eZ Components Templates #
eZ Components Template Component is also a very nice implementation of a template language .
It 's probably the one which have the most features ... perhaps too many of them if you ask me :
{use $ name} {use $ items} Hello {$name} {foreach $items as $ item} * { $item} {/ foreach}
It does not support template inheritance , and my main concern is the performance .
This it is the slowest library I have tested , and by great margin .
Dwoo is an interesting project .
It is positioned as an alternative to Smarty .
And they did a great job :
< html > < body > {block " content " }{ / block} </body > </html >
{extends " layout.tpl " } {block " content " } {include ( " basic.tpl " ) } {/ block}
Dwoo mimics Smarty but with some interesting new features like template inheritance , and with much better performance than Smarty .
Unfortunately , Dwoo has no sandbox feature and its core is not flexible enough .
Calypso is an implementation of the Django Template Language in PHP .
I mention it because it's a clone of Django and because some people mentioned it on Twitter .
But , the author himself acknowledge that the implementation is flawed .
When I started looking for a PHP template language , I focused on libraries trying to mimic the Django template language features .
After many hours of Googling , I found Twig .
Twig was written by Armin Ronacher of Jinja fame .
Needless to say I have the uttermost respect for Armin as he does a wonderful job with Jinja .
As a matter of fact , Twig is more similar to Jinja than Django as far as the implementation is concerned .
He wrote Twig back in 2008 for Chypr , a blogging platform .
But he never really developed it further as he mostly work with Python .
When I had a look at the code , I was immediately sure it was what I was looking for .
The main difference with Calypso being the fact that Twig compiles the templates down to plain PHP code .
I started to use it a bit and at the end of last week , I asked Armin if he would n't mind letting the project starts a new life .
His answer was enthusiastic , and so I began hacking the code .
My version is much different from that of Armin , but the lexer and parser are mostly the original ones .
I have just hacked the code for a few days , but I 'm already quite proud of it , and I think it 's time to open it to the public .
So , yesterday I wrote some documentation for it and put up a simple website .
There is still a lot of work to do like finishing the documentation , adding more unit tests , and PHPdoc , but the code is already quite solid and feature - full with :
Native template inheritance ( templates are compiled as classes ) ;
Solid automatic auto - escaping ( with no associated runtime overhead as everything is done during compilation ) ;
Very secure sandbox mode ( white - list the tags , filters , and methods that can be used in templates ) ;
Great extensibility : you override everything , even the core features , by bundling your own tags and filters as an extension ; but you can also manipulate the AST ( Abstract Syntax Tree ) before compilation .
By leveraging this possibilities , you can even create your own DSL ( Domain Specific Language ) , targeted at your application .
Despite being one the most full - featured PHP templating engines , Twig is also the fastest one :
Library Time ( sec ) Memory ( Ko ) Templates rendered per second Twig 3 1,190 3,333 PHPTAL 3.8 2,100 2,632 Dwoo 6.9 1,870 1,449 Smarty 2 12.9 2,350 775 Smarty 3 14.9 3,230 671 Calypso 34.3 620 292 eZ
Templates 53 5,850 189
I benchmarked a template that includes a simple template ( one output and a for loop on three items ) and decorated with a simple layout .
The times are for the average of ten runs ; a run consisting of one compilation of the template and 10,000 rendering of it .
For engines that do not support inheritance , I have used a header and a footer instead , and for engines that do not support automatic output escaping , escaping has been done by hand .
When the templates are already compiled , the memory consumption is of course much better for all template engines , and Twig is the one which uses the less memory :
Library Memory without compilation ( Ko ) Twig 383 PHPTAL 598 Dwoo 1,645 Smarty 2 1,634 Smarty 3 1,790 Calypso 614 eZ Templates 2,783
If you want to learn more , please visit the Twig website , and start discussing Twig on its dedicated mailing - list .
If you want to join the team , subscribe to the developer mailing - list
I have also planned to talk about Twig at the Zend UnConference .
Vote for this talk and see you there for an interesting discussion about templating engines .
The CEO of Russia 's No. 1 anti-virus package has said that the internet 's biggest security vulnerability is anonymity , calling for mandatory internet passports that would work much like driver licenses do in the offline world .
The comments by Eugene Kaspersky , who is also the founder of Kaspersky Lab , came during an interview this week with Vivian Yeo of ZDNet Asia .
In it , he proposed the formation of an internet police body that would require users everywhere to be uniquely identified .
" Everyone should and must have an identification , or internet passport , " he was quoted as saying .
" The internet was designed not for public use , but for American scientists and the US military .
Then it was introduced to the public and it was wrong ... to introduce it in the same way . "
Kaspersky , whose comments are raising the eyebrows of some civil liberties advocates , went on to say such a system should n't be voluntary .
" I 'd like to change the design of the internet by introducing regulation - internet passports , internet police and international agreement - about following internet standards , " he continued .
" And if some countries do n't agree with or do n't pay attention to the agreement , just cut them off . "
He rejected the notion that internet protocol numbers were sufficient for tracking a user , arguing they are too easy to come by .
" You 're not sure who exactly has the connection , " he explained .
" Even if the IP address is traced to an internet cafe , they will not know who the customer or person is behind the attacks .
Think about cars - you have plates on cars , but you also have driver licenses . "
Kaspersky was traveling on Friday and not available to be interviewed for this article .
A company spokeswoman declined to comment .
Kaspersky admitted such a system would be hard to put in place because of the cost and difficulty of reaching international agreements .
But remarkably , his interview transcript spends no time contemplating the inevitable downsides that would come in a world where internet anonymity is a thing of the past .
" You could make the same argument about the offline world , " said Matt Zimmerman , a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" You know , every purchase you make should be tracked , we should ban the use of cash , we should put cameras up everywhere because in that massive data collection something might be collected to help someone .
But we think privacy is an important enough countervailing value that we should prevent that . "
In Kaspersky 's world , services such as Psiphon and The Onion Router ( Tor ) - which are legitimately used by Chinese dissidents and Google users alike to shield personally identifiable information - would no longer be legal .
Or at least they'd have to be redesigned from the ground up to give police the ability to surveil them .
That 's not the kind of world many law - abiding citizens would feel comfortable inhabiting .
And aside from the disturbing big - brother scenario , there are the problematic logistics of requiring every internet user anywhere in the world to connect using an internationally approved device that authenticates his unique identity .
There 's no telling how many innovations might be squashed under a system like that .
No doubt , the cybercriminals that Kaspersky has valiantly fought for more than a decade are only getting better at finding ways to exploit weaknesses in internet technologies increasingly at the heart of the way we shop , socialize and work .
But to paraphrase Benjamin Franklin , those who sacrifice net liberty for incremental increases in security no doubt will get neither . ®

There 's unusual lunchtime chatter at ACE Charter School in East San Jose : Students are actually raving about lunch .
School lunch .
And so are some teachers .
Just ask Arallana Sanchez , 11 , in between her munches on a chicken barbecue sandwich and sips of organic , hormone - free milk .
" At my old school everyone always drank chocolate milk because the regular milk tasted like it had expired . "
Serving healthful meals at school is tougher than ever - most campuses do n't even have kitchens anymore .
And the federal government 's low reimbursement rate - $ 2.68 for each poor child who qualifies for free lunch - makes it tough to buy high - quality produce .
As school budgets get squeezed , many districts are going with the vendors offering the best bargain , not the best food .
But now a national push is under way to improve students ' midday meal .
Schools like ACE Charter are contracting with companies that provide organic lunches .
" Farm to School " programs that connect schools with local farms - like the relationship between Full Circle Farm in Sunnyvale and Santa Clara Unified School District - are popping up nationwide .
And Slow Food USA is organizing " Time for Lunch , " a campaign designed to " get real food in schools . "
The effort kicks off on Labor Day with more than 300 " Eat-ins , " or community pot lucks , planned across the nation .
Advocates hope the momentum will lead to an overhaul of the Child Nutrition Act , the bill that governs the National School Lunch Program and is up for reauthorization in Congress this fall .
" It 's the right time for this campaign , " said Gordon Jenkins of Slow Food USA .
" People are more food conscious overall .
We have Michelle Obama planting a garden in the White House lawn .
Now the burden is on us to show that there 's a political will for this . "
Most local school districts contract with large food service companies that prepare food off - site , often in other states , then freeze it and ship it to school districts .
The food is then heated in microwaves or warmers .
Corn dogs , pizza , and nachos - meals that are high in fats and cholesterol - are standard fare .
" Schools do n't have kitchens anymore , " Jenkins said .
" If we really want healthy food , the food needs to be prepared at the schools . "
But cost is an enormous barrier .
Advocates such as Slow Food , which was founded in opposition to fast food and emphasizes eating locally grown food , are urging Congress to raise the reimbursement rate so schools can buy fresher ingredients .
On Monday , Eat - Ins are scheduled in Hollister , Mountain View , San Jose , Sunnyvale , Santa Cruz and several other locations statewide .
But it 's not just California : organizers are thrilled that Eat - Ins have sprouted up in Iowa , Georgia and Wisconsin .
The Sunnyvale Eat - In takes place at Full Circle Farm .
At the potluck lunch , open to the public , people will discuss the farm 's efforts to promote healthful eating at local schools .
Kids and parents will be encouraged to write letters to President Barack Obama asking for better school lunches and sign a " Time for Lunch " petition to Congress .

" If kids can see a green bean on the vine , and meet the farmer who grows it , versus watching it defrost or slosh out of a can , they are more apt to try it and make it a part of their diet , " said Emma Mae Hoag of the Community Alliance with Family Farmers .
But as the school year gets under way , some students are already eating better .
Revolution Foods , which operates out of a vast kitchen near the Oakland airport , is rapidly expanding .
It has contracts with ACE and other charter schools , the Santa Cruz City Schools and is expanding to other cities .
The meals are not exotic : spaghetti and meatballs with steamed zucchini ; burritos with brown rice ; honey - glazed chicken with roasted potatoes and garlic braised collard greens .
The food is never frozen , and it is shipped within 24 hours of preparation ; there is no high fructose corn syrup or trans fats .
Vanessa Sifuentes principal of ACE Charter School in the Mayfair neighborhood of East San Jose , said " Rev Foods " makes an enormous difference in the lives of her 217 middle school students .
" Food absolutely affects their learning , " said Sifuentes , who took the additional step of banning soda , candy , chips and fast food from the campus .
" Usually kids eat lunch and get a sugar high ; they 're bouncy and can't concentrate .
Then they crash from the sugar and have headaches .
Now they 're eating balanced meals , and they can focus .
Some of our students are actually losing weight . "
Revolution Foods sells high - end snack items through a partnership with Whole Foods .
A percentage from the snack sales allows the company to charge school districts a sliding scale .
Prices are less than $ 3 a meal for low - income schools - close to the federal reimbursement rate .
Kirsten Tobey , one of the company 's co-founders , says there are a lot of misconceptions around what kids will and wo n't eat .
" Kids love fruit , " said Tobey , who has a 2 - year - old daughter .
" But they want high quality fruit , not old fruit that 's been bashed and bruised .
They love food that is well prepared , and fresh .
They respond to quality . "
So far , the meals appear to be a hit .
Though most teachers bring lunch from home , several ACE teachers say they regularly buy Revolution Food lunches , which cost $ 4.50 at full fare .
Dan Martinez , 11 , was first in line for lunch earlier this week , and he knows the company 's menu by heart .
" Yesterday we had my favorite : spaghetti , " Martinez said .
" Now if I eat too much junk food , I feel like I want to burst . "
The issue of copyright has dogged YouTube since its launch YouTube has lifted a block on users viewing official music videos after the website reached an agreement with songwriters ' group PRS for Music .
In March , the service blocked thousands of music videos to UK users after failing to reach agreement over fees .
YouTube , owned by Google , is paying an undisclosed lump sum to PRS , backdated until January and lasting until 2012 .
Adam Shaw from PRS for Music told the BBC that he was pleased that an agreement had finally been reached .
" We have 60,000 song - writer and composer members and many of them do n't earn very much money at all - 90 % of them earn less than £ 5,000 a year , " he said .
" The money we receive is really their living . "
Sanctioned YouTube 's decision in March theoretically blocked all premium music video content - owned by record labels - in the UK .
However , many fan videos and official videos continued to be available on the site , including some sanctioned by the record labels themselves .
If content owners start to see the video site as just another useful platform rather than a threat , then everyone can start making money
Rory Cellan- Jones
BBC 's technology correspondent
Read Rory 's thoughts in full For example , EMI - owned Parlophone recently became the site 's most popular UK channel of the year , with 240 million hits , despite the ban .
However , YouTube said the " tens of thousands " of videos which had disappeared " will come back over the next few days " .
" The music videos are an extremely popular part of YouTube and this deal does n't only cover the music videos but also music included in TV programmes like the X Factor and also for the inclusion of music in user videos as well , " YouTube 's Patrick Walker told the BBC .
The deal will also mean that new material will appear on YouTube as the site signs partnerships with other record labels and guest editors introduce their favourite videos .

' Outraged '
In the UK , PRS for Music acts on behalf of member publishers as a collecting society for licensing fees relating to the use of music .
At the start of the row Mr Walker told the BBC that PRS was seeking a rise in fees " many , many factors " higher than the previous agreement .
He said the two were " so far apart " that YouTube had no choice but to remove content while negotiations continued .
HAVE YOUR SAY
If the public can access videos for free , and the artist still gets paid then it sounds like everyone 's a winner Richard Hill , Birmingham
At the time , Steve Porter , head of PRS , said he was " outraged ... shocked and disappointed " by the decision .
He said the move " punishes British consumers and the songwriters whose interests we protect and represent " .
The Music Publishers Association ( MPA ) joined PRS in urging Google to rethink , while Lord Carter , who was the UK 's minister for communications , technology and broadcasting , also waded into the debate .
Giving evidence before the Business Select Committee , the minister said he suspected a degree of " commercial posturing on the part of both parties " but said the row was indicative of a wider issue .
YouTube is the world 's most popular online video site but has been under increased pressure to generate more revenue since its purchase by Google for $ 1.65 bn ( then £ 875 m ) in 2006 .
Services such as Pandora.com , MySpace UK and Imeem have also had issues securing licensing deals in the UK in the past 12 months .

Should doctors be allowed to deny a birth control prescription for moral , not medical , reasons ?
WASHINGTON  Faced with a request to give an unmarried female patient a prescription for birth control pills , Dr. Michele Phillips looked to her conscience for the answer .
" I 'm not going to give any kind of medication I see as harmful , " said Phillips of San Antonio .
The drugs would not protect her patient from " emotional trauma from multiple partners , " Phillips reasoned , or sexually transmitted diseases .
" I could not ethically give that type of medication to a single woman . "
After the evangelical Christian refused to write the prescription , she resigned her position .
She now does contract work at a faith - based practice that permits her to " prescribe according to my ethical values . "
Medical technology has surged forward in recent years , leading to many life - saving and life - giving procedures .
At the same time , legal and ethical remedies have n't kept pace , and officials at the state and federal level are still working out how to address the sometimes competing needs and values of doctors and patients .
For example , the Obama administration announced last February that it plans to rescind regulations enacted at the end of President Bush 's term that permit health care workers to abstain from performing procedures they oppose for moral or religious reasons .
Eight months later , the administration has still not announced new rules .
FAITH & REASON : Do you want the last word on medical care in your last days ?
Often , experts say , the debate boils down to a question of convenience versus conscience , of personal choices affected by medical personnel .
"
Do we really want co-workers deciding if our religious motivations and reasons are correct ? " asked Joan Henriksen Hellyer , a postdoctoral research fellow at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn .
For example , at the annual meeting of the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities here this month , a panel including Hellyer discussed the disparate dilemmas facing health care workers today , such as : • A housekeeper who refuses to clean an embryonic stem cell lab .
•
An ultrasound technologist who does n't want to work on Saturday . •
A respiratory tech who refuses to turn off a ventilator .
Bioethicist Holly Fernandez Lynch said consistency is crucial to prevent patients from facing discrimination based on race , religion or sexual orientation .
" A consistent objection to a service , I think , is totally appropriate as long as there is someone available to provide that service at a reasonable distance , " said Lynch , author of Conflicts of Conscience in Health Care : An Institutional Compromise .
But , she acknowledged , " the phrase ' reasonable distance ' is really a difficult one to figure out . "
While larger communities and hospitals have the luxury of a range of practitioners , conscience quandaries are trickier in smaller communities , said Leslie LeBlanc , managing editor of The Journal of Clinical Ethics .
" It 's a very difficult question because you can't compel someone to do something they think is morally wrong and , by the same token , clinicians make a promise to help people in need , " said LeBlanc , who attended the bioethicists ' meeting .
State legislatures have passed a plethora of legislation on the issue , with most permitting health care providers to shun abortion services , the Washington - based Guttmacher Institute reports .
Some states , including Louisiana , have passed broader laws that protect health care workers who object to procedures such as cloning , stem cell research , euthanasia and physician - assisted suicide .
Rob Vischer , associate professor of law at the University of St. Thomas School of Law , argues for letting the free market determine access to all health care services .
" I think people want to have a space to live what they believe , " said Vischer , author of the forthcoming Conscience and the Common Good : Reclaiming the Space Between Person and State .
" I think that 's more consistent with the common good than everybody grabbing for the reins of state power . "
Luke Vander Bleek , a Morrison , Ill. , pharmacist is fighting in court against an Illinois regulation that requires him to dispense Plan B and other emergency contraception .
" I wanted to be able to practice pharmacy in this small town that I live in where I raised my family and I wanted to be able to do it with a good , clear conscience and sleep well at night , " said Vander Bleek , a Roman Catholic .
He said other pharmacies within 12 miles could provide those services instead .
Elizabeth Nash , a public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute , counters that patients should be able to access drugs if they are legal .
" Putting barriers in their way to access those medications only hurts public health , " she said .
As the arguments continue , Dr. David Stevens , CEO of the Christian Medical Association , said physicians like Phillips are " a growing reality " and he worries that other physicians might quit permanently .
In an April poll , his organization found that an overwhelming percentage of faith - based physicians preferred ending their medical practice to violating their conscience .
" This is the most urgent issue for our membership , " he said .
" Because they realize that if they lose this battle , they will no longer be practicing medicine . "

A questo punto è evidente che quelli del Pd lo fanno apposta .
Restano da capire le ragioni oscure .
Io propongo qualche ipotesi , chi vuole ne aggiunga altre .
1. E ' un'idea di Franceschini per far credere a quelli del Pdl che possono stare tranquilli e poi - zac !
- la prossima volta entrare tutti a sorpresa in aula dopo essersi nascosti per ore nei nei bagni .
2. E ' una strategia geniale studiata da D'Alema per mandare in vacca il Pd al più presto .
E avere quindi la scusa pronta per fare subito dopo il Grande Centro con Fini e Casini , più Montezemolo che ogni tanto gli fa fare un giro in Ferrari .
3. E ' un riflesso condizionato .
Visto che da vent ' anni imitano Berlusconi , adesso fanno esattamente come il Milan : allenatore incapace , giocatori decotti , schemi che saltano .
Ci sarebbe una quarta ipotesi , ma naturalmente è di pura fantasia , non come le altre .
E cioè che qualche fondazione abbia dei bei soldi da far rientrare , su in Nord Europa .
Ma è uno scherzo , per carità .
IN the last issue of The Economist we were able to carry the chronicle of great events up to the German 16 - point " offer " broadcast to the world on Thursday night .
It was suggested at the time that the " offer " was a piece of propaganda , since it had only been communicated to Poland two hours before it was declared by Berlin to have been rejected . *
What could not be known when this comment was penned in the small hours of Friday morning was that even the British Government itself had had no knowledge of the " terms " save such as could be gathered by the Ambassador from a gabbled recital in German by the excited Ribbentrop .
Nor was there then any possibility of knowing that Hitler had given his army and his air force orders to attack Poland at dawn , without further excuse or formal declaration of war .
For the first time in his career , we may feel grateful to Hitler .
Since a war was quite inevitable ( and knowing what we now do of his state of mind , we can clearly see that it was ) , we could hardly have hoped for a straighter moral issue on which to fight it .
The major principles involved have , of course , been established for some time ; they are wrapped up in the old antagonism to the doctrine that Might is Right .
But the precise occasion of the outbreak might have been confusing ;
Hitler obliged by making it clear .
The famous " offer " was so obviously a piece of clumsy propaganda that nobody outside the borders of Germany ( and few , we may suspect , inside ) was taken in for more than an hour or two .
The Poles were not challenged to fire the first shot by a German coup d'etat in Danzig , for though there was such a coup , it came after the Germans had invaded Poland itself .
The British White Paper , of which the salient features are summarised on page 480 , makes it plain that until the very last Britain and France were urging , and Poland accepting , proposals for negotiations , provided only that they were on a basis of equality .
It is difficult to see how the most finicky historian of the future will find the slightest reason for doubting that Hitler deliberately and wantonly provoked the new war .
After the first breach of the peace the rest followed automatically .
There was a last - minute proposal by Signor Mussolini for a five - Power conference " for the purpose of revising the clauses of the Treaty of Versailles which are the actual cause of the trouble in the European situation . "
Throughout Friday and Saturday this proposal had the effect of delaying French and British action ; but it also had the merit of demonstrating once again the democracies ' desire not to neglect any possibility of a peaceful and honourable solution .
But the Italian initiative broke down because Germany would not accept the Franco - British stipulation that the invading troops must be withdrawn .
As it was , the House of Commons had shown in unmistakable fashion on Saturday afternoon that there was no shadow of desire to depart from Britain 's obligations to Poland , which had been solemnly invoked .
The collapse of the Italian initiative led immediately to the last diplomatic steps .
The British and French Ambassadors in Berlin each delivered an ultimatum on Sunday and , satisfactory replies not being given , a state of war between Great Britain and Germany existed from 11 a.m. and between France and Germany from 5 p.m. on Sunday , September 3 , 1939 .
This was the beginning .
What the end will be no man can tell .
But if we cannot yet say where the road on which we have entered is leading us , we can at least record where we hope to go .
What are the objects so essential to our national existence and well - being that we are prepared , as a nation and as individuals , to go through the valley of the shadow of death to reach them ?
What are we fighting for ?
The question can be answered , and truthfully answered , with abstractions , as it was admirably done by the Prime Minister on Sunday .
" It is the evil things that we shall be fighting against — brute force , bad faith , injustice , oppression and persecution . "
But the ordinary man does not easily think in abstractions .
His grim determination is based on concrete realities .
He wants to live free to hold his own opinions , free to indulge in the luxury of argument and disagreement , free to spend his leisure hours at his own fireside or at his own pursuits , free to devote his productive powers to meeting the material wants of himself and his fellows , free to build up a higher standard of living instead of a higher standard of aggressive power , free to bring up a family without the haunting menace of insecurity .
In the last few years , even the most thoughtless man in the street has realised that Hitlerism makes all these elements of civilised living impossible .
It suppresses opinion ; it monopolises leisure for the countless drills and displays necessary to the generation of " spontaneous enthusiasm ; " it drains off for military purposes all production above the minimum necessary to keep the people alive ; it propagates the nauseous doctrine that children are born for the cannon .
Hitlerism has done these things to Germany for more than six years , and it has built up on this fundamental iniquity a superstructure of added brutality and senseless racial persecution .
But in the last three years it has started doing these things to us too .
It has started compelling us to devote our energies to rearmament , our leisure to drilling , our income to taxes ; it has cast over our lives the shadow of doom .
Hitler has proved that we cannot be indifferent to the ways in which other people govern themselves .
He has convinced the easy - going , tolerant British democracy that it must go through another bout of agony if ever again Englishmen are to live in peace and wealth and contentment .
To say that we are fighting to make the world safe for democracy would be to invite derisive comment .
But we are fighting , in the most literal sense , to safeguard democracy in those countries of Western Europe and overseas where it has taken root .
And democracy in Britain and France will not be safe if they are faced with brutal dictatorships in any Great Power .
Democracy and dictatorship cannot long exist side by side ; if they do , the bad will drive out the good , either through a military conquest of the democracies or by forcing them , in self - defence , as we have been forced in recent years , not indeed to abandon democracy , but to divert it to evil purposes of organising for strength instead of for wealth .
Many people have asked in these past years of straits what good a war would do .
The answer is , of course , that a war does no good ; but it has become the only way of preventing infinitely greater harm .
And why has it become the only way ?
That is a question that only history can finally answer .
But one moral can be drawn now which history will not upset .
We have had many chances of strangling in their infancy the forces of aggression and brutality which have now engulfed the world in war .
As each issue has arisen , we have refused to meet the risks attached to the suppression of brute force .
And , as issue has followed issue , we have seen the price of security rise , in a steady Sibylline progress , until now it has reached the most awful height that a nation ever had to face .
Before we plunge into war , this lesson must be drawn from twenty - one years of uneasy peace : security cannot be attained by avoiding risks ; a policy of limited commitments leads inevitably to the unlimited commitment of war ; safety cannot be found without courage .
Let us never again make the mistake of being involved in the maintenance of peace without being committed to its enforcement .
These considerations provide two of the pillars of the eventual peace settlement : it must bring the end of armed dictatorship ; and it must provide for a world - wide system of enforcing peace .
A third pillar must , of course , be the restoration of their independence to those people who have lost it , primarily the Czechs .
But these three aims achieved , the fourth must be an avoidance of any merely vengeful or repressive provisions against Germany , which would provide genuine grievances for a new Hitler .
If she is democratic , if she cooperates in the new international order , if she restores her unjust conquests , it will be to our interests at the end of this war ( as we can now see that it was to our interest in 1918 ) to help her to unity , equality , wealth and self - respect .
The only alternative policy would be one of permanent partition and garrisoning of a defeated Germany , for which the democracies have neither the strength nor the moral mandate .
These , then , are the four principles of peace : Democracy , an International Order , Restitution and Generosity .
Their translation into precise details is a matter which can not now be undertaken .
But there are certain points to which it is essential that we should all now commit ourselves as publicly as we can , while our visions are still unclouded .
There must be no annexations of German territory and no indemnities .
There must be disarmament , but no expectation that Germany will remain disarmed while other nations are armed .
There must be a genuine sharing of colonial benefits and responsibilities through the widest extension of the mandatory principle .
There must be a new League of Nations , with the hesitations and half - commitments of the old removed .
There must be an end of the more senseless forms of economic nationalism .
In the madness and the agony that is to come , we must cling fast to these principles .
Only so can we be quite sure that , in defending democracy , we shall not betray it , and that the freedom for which we fight is that freedom for all men on which alone permanent peace can be built .
* For the sake of historical accuracy , a misprint in last week 's issue should be corrected .
As published , a sentence beginning in the 18th line of page 434 read “ They [ the 16 points ] were not revealed to the Press until 8 p.m. on the 31st , two hours before the broadcast statement that , after waiting for two days for an answer , the German Government considered that the proposals had been rejected . ”
This should have read “ They were not revealed to the Poles until 8 p.m. on the 31st ... ”

Presenter , Radio 4's Money Box
The Dutch deposit guarantee scheme pays up to  100,000 Customers of the Dutch bank DSB have forced it into bankruptcy by withdrawing £ 550 m of their savings in just 12 days .
They were encouraged by campaigner Pieter Lakeman who runs the Mortgage Grievances Foundation .
He appeared on Dutch television on Thursday , 1 October and told customers it was " in their personal and collective interest to take their money out " .
Professor Jacob de Haan , of Groningen University , said Mr Lakeman was protesting about the way the bank lent money .
He told Radio 4's Money Box programme : " The bank was under attack and being criticised for being aggressive .
Many people borrowed much more than they could afford and as a consequence some were in severe financial troubles . "
He added that Pieter Lakeman believed it to be in the interest of those borrowers if the bank went bust .
Failed rescue Within hours of the broadcast the bank 's website collapsed , the bank blamed hackers and money was draining out .
By the weekend the bank was discussing a possible rescue by a consortium of five other Dutch banks .
Before this bank run occurred , although the bank was not in the best of all possible positions , it was not near bankruptcy .
Professor Jacob de Haan , Groningen University
Those talks failed and after leaks in the press customers began withdrawing their money en masse .
Reports in the Dutch press said that 600 m euros ( £ 550 m ) , about a quarter of the bank 's assets , had been taken out .
On Monday afternoon the court placed the bank into receivership .
Professor de Haan says that those mass customer withdrawals ruined the bank .
" Before this bank run occurred , although the bank was not in the best of all possible positions , it was not near bankruptcy .
A few weeks before this bank run , the central bank issued a statement saying DSB had sufficient capital and sufficient liquidity . "
Further attempts were made to save the bank and the court gave owner Dirk Scheringa until noon on Friday , 16 October , to find a solution .
Despite an extension of that deadline , further talks with the bank consortium failed and at midnight they concluded there was no hope .
But Dirk Scheringa told the court he had a credible enquiry from a Texas bidder and the deadline was extended until Monday morning .
That deal came to nothing and on Monday , 19 October , the court declared DSB bank bankrupt .
Compensation
That did no favours to the majority of savers who had not taken their money out .
The Dutch deposit guarantee scheme pays up to 100,000 euros .
The cost - estimated at 3.25 bn euros - falls on other Dutch banks .
Up to  100 k euros is guaranteed so they will get their money back , at least after some time .
Professor Jacob de Haan , Groningen University
An initial payment of 3,000 euros per depositor has been agreed .
But it could take a while for the balance to be paid .
And there is no guarantee for those with more than 100,000 euros , as Professor de Haan explained .
" Up to 100,000 euros is guaranteed so they will get their money back , at least after some time .
People with more than 100,000 on deposit might get more after the administration process . "
Despite Pieter Lakeman 's appeal to depositors bringing down the bank , Professor de Haan says it could not happen again .
" No , I do n't think so .
This is a very special case and not representative of any other Dutch bank . "
Dirk Scheringa claimed his bank had been destroyed and called for a parliamentary inquiry .
ABN Amro Bank has seized 130 paintings from the Scheringa Museum of Realist Art , claiming it had lent Mr Scheringa $ 48 m .
The Alkmaar football club AZ , which is owned by Dirk Scheringa , will have to find a new sponsor after the bankruptcy of DSB .
Dutch News reports the Midreth construction company has asked the court to sequester its ground , the DSB Stadium , over unpaid bills on other Scheringa projects .
And the American US Speedskating team is trying to replace $ 300,000 sponsorship currently provided by DSB , before it competes in the Vancouver winter Olympics in February 2010 .
Pieter Lakeman refused to give the BBC an interview .

Every Thursday the PlayStation Store updates across the globe , bringing specific content to individual regions as well as demos , trailers and downloadable content for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable .
This week ’s European Store update was rather mundane , with an NBA 2K10 demo , some special offers , videos and two dynamic themes .
However , Mike Kebby , SCEE PlayStation Store Team member , has promised that next week ’s update will be far bigger .
In the comments section of the European PlayStation Blog , Kebby teased :
“ Well next week is going to be a mammoth update in comparison – I can tell you all that much . ”
As to what will be in the update remains to be seen , but Kebby did let out that the Ratchet and Clank : ACIT demo will be out “ next week ” and that the Dragonball Z Raging Blast Demo will “ be here next week ” .
He also told users that The Beatles : Rock Band Abbey Road DLC “ is on the schedule for next week ” .
However , Kebby also admitted that he did n’t “ have a date ” for Final Fantasy VIII and that he was “ afraid ” that he had no information to “ share ” about Hustle Kings .

EDITOR'S NOTE : Sometime Wednesday night , the video was removed from YouTube .
No word on who 's responsible for putting it there in the first place , or taking it down .
Here ’s an ominous posting on YouTube from the “ Patriot ” crowd .
It advises President Obama and other prominent people ( “ Our Dear Leader and co. ” ) to “ leave now and give us our country back ” and to do so by next week .
“ If you stay , ” the silent video message continues , “ ‘ We , The People ’ will systematically dismantle you , destroy you and reclaim what is rightfully ours . …
“ We are angry and we are ready to take back the rights of the people .
We will fight and We will win . …
“ Dead line [ sic ] for your national response : October 15 , 2009
“ Thank you to all patriots who support our cause . …
Be prepared for when the fateful day of the declaration of war is nationally announced . ”
In August , The Southern Poverty Law Center issued a special report , “ Return of the Militias , ” documenting a resurgence of Patriot and extreme - right militia activity around the country .
President Barack Obama 's environmental adviser Van Jones , who became embroiled in a controversy over past inflammatory statements , has resigned his White House job after what he calls a " vicious smear campaign against me . "
Jones , an administration official specializing in environmentally friendly " green jobs " with the White House Council on Environmental Quality was linked to efforts suggesting a government role in the 2001 terror attacks and to derogatory comments about Republicans .
* * *
The matter surfaced after news reports of a derogatory comment Jones made in the past about Republicans , and separately , of Jones 's name appearing on a petition connected to the events surrounding the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks .
That 2004 petition had asked for congressional hearings and other investigations into whether high - level government officials had allowed the attacks to occur .
Ever question the veracity of the government 's official explanation for 9/11 ?
Ever sign a petition demanding a new investigation of the 9/11 attacks ?
Ever consider the possibility ( likelihood ) that some of the highest people in government were behind the attacks on 9/11 ?( yes , yes , and hell yes )
If like me your answer to any of the above is ' yes ' you can forget about ever having a role in your own government ...
It 's time for bloggers to remind our entrenched government officials that Jones is not alone - the majority of Americans do n't believe the official story about 19 hijackers with box - cutters - and we never will .9/11 sychopants are the fringe minority - not the other way around .
And their days in office are numbered .

WASHINGTON — A House intelligence committee meeting was abruptly terminated when Justice Department officials refused to be sworn in before briefing the lawmakers .
The officials had been expected to brief the committee Wednesday on the department ’s review of an internal CIA report on the 2001 shootdown of a plane over Peru that was carrying American missionaries .
Two of the passengers were killed .

Officials are routinely sworn in before giving testimony at formal congressional hearings , but the meeting was billed as an informal briefing — which normally does not require taking an oath .
Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler said Justice employees “ have previously briefed committee staff on this matter and were prepared to provide a similar informal briefing to committee members . ”
“ We are unaware of any precedent for Department officials providing informal briefings to be placed under oath , ” she said .
Rep. Peter Hoekstra , R - Mich. , the top Republican on the committee , questioned Wednesday why the Justice officials refused to be sworn in .
“ Why is Attorney General Eric Holder afraid of having Justice Department employees be required to tell the truth ? ” Hoekstra said .
Hoekstra said Justice ’s refusal to brief under oath is part of a “ disturbing pattern that has emerged of the Obama administration refusing or finding reasons to refuse to share information with Congress . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Both the House and the Senate intelligence committees have advanced legislation that would require more intelligence disclosures to Congress , though the details of the bills differ .
The Obama administration has threatened to veto the House legislation if it is passed .
Hoekstra has raised concerns about the CIA ’s handling of the Peru incident , saying the classified CIA report identified the names of personnel who misled Congress and obstructed a Justice Department investigation into whether criminal charges should have been filed in the case .
The Justice Department in 2005 decided against filing charges .

Real business cycle theory is alive and kicking .
If we write Y=a * F ( K , L ) and call “ a ” technology then an RBC theory is mostly about how fluctuations in “ a ” change output .
Amusingly , Brad DeLong calls this the great forgetting theory of recessions and indeed it is hard to see how we could forget about technology , thus reducing output in some periods .
But this view takes the term technology too literally .
I am in my office every day ( L=1 ) , my computer is here every day ( K=1 ) but my output and thus my productivity fluctuates .
Why ?
It ’s not that I forget how to use STATA .
Some days , however , a reporter calls and distracts , another day I need to tidy my office , on other days creativity just does n’t strike .
In short , everyone recognizes that at a micro-economic level productivity fluctuates a lot so why should macro productivity follow a smooth process ?
In fact , there is a standard answer to that question which is the law of large numbers –spread idiosyncratic productivity shocks across many firms and in the aggregate volatility will be low .
In an important paper , The Granular Origins of Aggregate Fluctuations , Xavier Gabaix takes on this answer with a simple but important point : large firms matter .
In the United States , for example , sales of the top 100 firms account for about 30 % of GDP .
( The share is even larger in most other developed economies . )
In fact , we know from my GMU colleague , Robert Axtell , that firm size follows Zipf ’s law .
As a result , large firms get larger in larger economies so that firm - level productivity shocks do not disappear in the aggregate even in large economies .
Gabaix shows theoretically that combining idiosyncratic shocks and Zipf ’s law for firm size can produce significant fluctuations in GDP .
Empirically the difficulty is to distinguish aggregate shocks from firm - specific or sectoral shocks .
Using one plausible , but no doubt debatable decomposition , Gabaix shows that idiosyncratic shocks to the top 100 firms can explain about one - third of aggregate volatility .
The bottom line is that Gabaix has opened the way for a much richer real business cycle theory in which real shocks can be identified and tied to specific firms and through transmission mechanisms these real shocks can affect the aggregate economy .

This post is a follow - up of my first “ 100 things ” attempt , 100 Ways To Live A Better Life , which was absolutely a blast .
This time , for your convenience , I grouped the tips into several areas : content , layout , plugins , promotion , networking and money .
And if you ’re into big lists , you may be interested in this one too 77 Tips For Starting An Online Business .
Content
Your blog content is the cornerstone of your activity .
You ca n’t have a blog without producing good , constant , quality content .
Of all the other activities related to blogging , like promotion or networking , I consider content production to be by far the most important .
1. Keep An Idea Incubator
Do n’t take it easy , take it as it comes .
Find a place where you store your ideas .
Writing only from instant inspiration is totally unproductive .
Besides , chances are that your most valuables ideas will come when you ’re not able to blog them .
So , create an incubator and let them grow .
2. Make A Mindmap Of Your Blog
Keep a bird - eye of your articles .
Putting your blog into a mind - map , with posts , categories , promotion and income sources proved to be an enlightening exercise for me .
Not only it offered a totally different image of my blog but gave me a lot of ideas for overall improving .
3. Write Timeless Content
Do n’t be caught in the “ right now ” trap .
Writing about hot topics will last as much as the hot topics last .
And we all know what ’s hot is short .
Try to write content that will be easily read in several months or years from now .
Even if it ’s about a hot topic , put something timeless in it .
4. Use Explicit Headlines
Headlines are the first thing your users are seeing .
They are like a bait .
If the bait is good , they ’ll eventually bite the blog post too , if the headline is boring , common , predictable or not intriguing , they will most likely skip the whole paragraph .
5. Be Specific
Do n’t go too far from the specific of your blog .
If you do have different skills try to accommodate them on a tight topic .
Widening your blog in an uncontrolled way will eventually dissolve your brand and even if you ’ll have readers interested in different topics , you ’ll be harder to recognize as a monolithic brand .
6. Be Constant
Be there constantly .
Create a habit not only for you , but for your readers .
Once you establish a connection with them , they will expect you to be there .
Whenever you feel the need to give up , remember you will going to disappoint more then yourself .
7. Create And Maintain A Posting Routine
This will need a lot of self - discipline but it ’s the cornerstone of your blog .
If you wo n’t update it constantly , there will be no blog .
Experiment until you find your pace .
Some bloggers are posting 2 - 3 articles per day , some one per week .
I find it easily to do around 2 - 3 posts per week .
8. Find Your Own Size
Find a post size which fits your habits and skills .
Do n’t do it like other successful bloggers , do n’t copy , do it by trial and error .
Seth Godin writes about 6-700 words pe entry , Steve Pavlina does more than 2-3000 .
My own ballpark is in the 1000 - 1200 words per post .
Find your own .
9. Write From Your Own Experience
Show openly what you know and what you can say about something , without being afraid that you ’re wrong .
It ’s much worse to blindly copy the experts than to assume your own mistakes and publicly learn from them .
Your own experience is the most valuable blogging asset you have .
10 . Be Authentic
Do n’t play the mister know it all , dare to be personal and transparent .
Always .
A blog is the ultimate expression of an individual .
Do n’t waste time trying to be perfect , just be better .
If you ’re wrong , so be it .
Remember , you ’re unique .
Nobody can be you .
11 . Write For Your Readers
A blog is a personal matter , but if you want to have more than 2 visitors ( including your mom ) do yourself a service and write for your readers too .
Think how your readers will benefit from what your write .
If you want to be the only beneficiary of this process , you can safely start a private journal .
12 . Create A Blogging Setup
You do n’t just write .
You must have a strategy , goals , evaluations .
You need to have a place in which you can focus on the main goal .
Since I created my blogging setup , GTD style , the whole idea of blogging has changed for me .
Pick your own specific type of setup , even pen and paper , but do make one .
13 . Ask The Readers
Interact .
Do n’t just assume you know what the readers want from your blog , go ahead and ask them .
You can do that in comments , via email , on twitter .
Or you can use online communities .
Or you can write a specific post in which you ask them .
There are ways .
Just go ahead and ask .
14 . Post In Advance
Do n’t be shy about that , or think that it will ruin your authenticity .
As long as you ’re the author and you do write timeless content , there will be no problem .
Posting in advance is a very good strategy exercise , not to mention the relief of always being covered .
15 . Your Blog Post Is A Traveler
Once you hit publish , your blog post will live a life of its own .
Your blog post will be a traveler .
Be sure to give it the needed equipment to survive in harsh conditions and also enough instructions to find his way in this world .
Take of him properly .
16 . Your Blog Is Beyond Your Blog
Your blog is far more than your posts .
You think it ’s just a collection of articles , but it is n’t .
In order to be successful , your blog must be a presence .
It ’s made by your posts , comments , your comments on other blogs , your tweets , your stumbles .
Make a presence out of your blog , not just a list of topics .
17 . Break Your Post Into Edible Chunks
One of the easiest yet most ignored practices in the blogging business .
Do n’t write like you ’re running a marathon .
Break the posts in smaller chunks .
It will not only help your SEO , but it will create a much more clear writing approach .
You ’ll actually think better .
18 . Link To Yourself
Do n’t be shy about what you write and do n’t wait for ever that your posts will be discovered by others .
Link to yourself as often as you can .
This practice , also known as interlinking , is also good for SEO , but its main advantage will be to create a greater awareness of your content .
Even for you .
19 . Do Writing Challenges
Push yourself into writing exercises .
Establish a number of words per each post .
Write personal stories .
Write a how to .
Write a 100 list , like this one .
Try to write a specific number of posts in a specific period of time .
Try to expand your skills beyond what you already have .
20 . Engage In Group Projects
Try to do collaborative writing challenges .
I participated in several collaborative projects , for blogs or ebooks , and it was a very productive experience .
It will be extremely good for promotion , of course , but it will primarily help you try different writing styles .
21 . Use A Dictionary
There are a lot of online or desktop based dictionaries .
I find this extremely useful when I search for synonyms or related words .
Yes , English is not my primary language , but I think a dictionary would benefit even if you ’re born as an English speaker .
22 . Create A Publishing Filter
Do n’t just let the blog posts flow away .
Create a publishing filter and apply it every time your write .
I have my own filter made up by 7 questions to answer before publishing and so far it worked great .
Find your own , based on why and what you are writing .
It ’s a good thing , trust me .
23 . Create Alternative Content
Your blog can contain so much more than just text .
Create podcasts , video content , or just apply alternative ways to your creativity , like mind maps , PDF based booklets or templates .
A while ago I added Downloads page to my blog and I must tell you this page is pretty busy with clicks .
24 . Link To Authorities
If there are authorities in your blog niche , link to them .
That will help your readers understand your preferences and orientation , it will help them identify you better .
Linking to somebody else it ’s a statement in itself .
As always , be constant and specific .
25 . Openly Present Yourself
Write an About Me page with whatever type of information you want in it , as long as you feel it represents you .
Subsequently , write About Me pages for any other media you are active on .
For instance , I created an About Me page for my Twitter presence .
26 . Keep It Simple
Blogging is not philosophy .
Even if you are trying to explain complicated concepts , do your best to keep them simple .
Your blog is competing with a gazillion other information sources , so be sure you ’re giving something at least easy to understand .
27 . Read Your Own Blog
Too often ignored .
You must be your first reader .
Whenever I have some free time I read some of my older posts .
There ’s nothing narcissistic in it , on the contrary , most of the time I dislike what I wrote , and think I could have done it so much better .
28 . Balance Your Category Distribution
This is one of the 4 important metric I follow and which is tracked by the blog audit plugin .
Keeping a balanced category will help not only in writing but it will improve your rankings in search engine .
Too much content under one category will end up with a lot of duplicate content in your blog archives .
29 . Create A Mailing List
This was n’t yet applied to this blog , at the moment of writing this article , because I think it ’s a little bit too early .
But I successfully created and used mailing lists before , on niche websites , with tens of thousands of users .
I mean it , tens of thousands .
I know it ’s doable .
30 . Use Brainstorming Techniques
One of the most simplest – although pretty scary at the first sight – is this very blog exercise : a list of 100 .
If you are hit by the writer ’s block , just sit down and try to find 100 ways to solve that problem .
If you think it ’s not possible , you ’re completely wrong .
You ’re actually reading the result of such an exercise .
31 . Do n’t Quit
The most important tip of all .
Do n’t quit .
Breaking through gets harder and harder , and in the first 6 months you can barely scratch the surface .
Stay there and do your daily job even the results are so slow to show .
At some point , you ’ll be successful .
But if you quit , you wo n’t .
That ’s for sure .
Layout
The way your content is perceived is fundamental .
You may create good and engaging content , but if you do n’t lay it out in a pleasant way , it will not be read .
People like to see beautiful things first , and then read beautiful blog posts .
32 . Buy A Professional
Theme
I cannot stress enough on this one .
The theme I ’m using for some time now , not only for this blog , but for other projects as well , is called Total .
And it ’s not just a theme , it ’s a complete framework .
Check it out .
33 . Create A Different Home Page For Your Blog
If you use an out of the box setup from a vanilla wordpress installation , you end up with a home page made by your latest blog posts .
Replacing this list with a home page is usually a good idea , especially since your posts will be visited most of the time directly from search engines or other links .
A home page can tell a completely different story .
34 . Use Excerpts Or Features On The Blog Home Page
If you created a different home page for your site , does n’t mean you wo n’t have a list of posts .
That ’s what I call a “ blog home page ” .
Using just one or two full posts in that list is a good thing : usually , it keeps the reader focused .
For the other posts I suggest using excerpts to declutter .
35 . Enable Threaded Comments
Latest WordPress version have this cool option in the setting : enable threaded comments .
You can even chose the depth of the threaded comments , standard ( and what I recommend ) is 5 .
In the old days , you had to look for a plugin to make that happen .
Threaded comments are a great visual enhancement , not to mention the conversation boost .
36 . Identify Your Blog Hotspots
Hotspots are places on your blog more visible than others .
Depending on the reader ’s habits and your own layout , you can use those places for various incentives , from subscribing reminders to advertising or premium content .
The following 4 tips are examples of hotspots in my blog .
37 . Use A Greeting Before The Content
Based on their referrer .
Just before the content I have this sentence which welcome my users , based on their referrer and give them specific incentives .
I created a thesis hook for those of you who are running thesis , but I ’m sure you can find a plugin for that , if you do n’t .
38 . Keep Them Reading Your Articles After They Finished Your Post
After the post area I set up a retention zone .
It features related posts ( there is a plugin for that ) and link for some strategic posts .
After they finish your post , keeping them around is a very good idea , and that hotspot seems the best place to do it .
39 . Put Short But Relevant Content Near The Linkbar
Another hotspot is at the link bar level .
I chose to put there the total number of subscriber I get via FeedBurner .
For my experience , link bar is not as hot as the beginning or the end of the post , so I just use it as an overall subscribing incentive .
40 . Use A Tabbed Zone For Recommended Articles
The last important hotspot is just before the sidebars .
I used it for a custom tabbed zone holding the most important articles in the most relevant categories .
It gives a bird - eye on what it can be found and it dramatically increase the click rate for the selected articles .
41 . Your Blog Header Is Your Identity
Pay attention to your header , that ’s where the title is usually placed .
People will remember your blog by visually recreating that zone .
If it ’s too crowded it will be hard to memorize .
I Always recommend to keep your header as clean as possible , in order to be easily remembered .
42 . Add A Top Posts Page To Your Menu
And subsequently create a top posts page .
I do n’t recommend to have it automatically generated based on the popularity of your articles .
Tweaking it according to your own perspective of what ’s good is much better .
43 . Add A Downloads Page
If you followed tips number 23 , Create Alternative Content , having a separate Downloads page for that is compulsory .
If properly promoted , many people will land to that page directly , without seeing your home page or any of your posts .
44 . Use Full Feeds
People have the freedom to chose which way they are going to read you : via web or via an RSS reader .
Keeping partial feeds on the RSS part used to be a common tip for making people visit your site for the full content .
I do n’t buy it .
I have full feeds : as long as they read me , it ’s their choice how they do it .
45 . Mix Your Twitter Timeline Into Your Blog
Put your latest 5 - 7 tweets in the sidebar or even in the footer , but do let them know that you have a twitter timeline .
Will talk about how Twitter can enhance your presence from a promotion point of view a little later , but from a layout perspective , publicizing your current tweets will make your blog feel much more alive .
46 . Focus On The Content
Whatever you do or add to your general layout , keep in mind this simple question : will this help my content to reach my users faster ?
If you answer “ no ” , or “ maybe ” to this question , usually the add - on does n’t worth the time .
47 . Use Excerpts On Archives Pages
First of all , make sure you add or enable the standard archives pages in every wordpress theme .
And then , be sure to make the archives displaying only excerpts of your posts , this will create a better user experience and possibly increase the time you readers are spending on your articles .
Plugins
Plugins are for your blogging what chip tuning is for a street car .
The right combination is hard to find , but once you find it , not only it will make your work much easier , but it will also make you look awesome !
Or at least it will make your blog look awesome , which is what are we talking about in this post .
48 . Akismet Spam Protection
You ca n’t really do it without this one .
Or , you can blog but you would have to completely turn off your comments .
Which is not blogging anymore , right ?
Activating akismet requires a key , but you can easily generate one in seconds .
Once you install it , you ’ll forget about it .
That ’s how a decent plugin should behave , anyway .
49 . Google Sitemap
Another must have and also a quiet one .
Once you install it , you do n’t know it exists anymore , but it does work heavily in the background .
The plugin does exactly what it says , it creates a sitemap of your blog in XML format and automatically submit it to Google every time you post .
Pretty convenient , huh ?
( download here )
50 . Recent Comments
A very useful addition and one that your commenters will heavily appreciate it .
The plugin is easy to install , comes as a widget and is also quite configurable .
Highlighting comments usually enhance the conversation , or at least this is what happened to me .
( download here )
51 . WordPress Download Monitor
If you ’re going to have alternative content , like mindmaps , free or paid ebooks , templates or audio / video material , you should consider using this .
It will help you organize your downloadables by category , show number of downloads and you can even create new posts inspired by those results , like my most downloaded mindmaps .
52 . Blog Audit
This is a shameless self promotion .
Blog Audit is a simple plugin I wrote , which lets you etablish blogging goals and measure your progress .
You can set a posting routine , a comment density , even a pingback volume and then watch live how you ’re doing with it .
Download it here Blog Audit Wordpress Plugin ( 2635 downloads ) .
53 . CommentLuv
This will also make your commenters shine with happiness .
If your commenters enter a web address in the designated field , CommentLuv will go there and extract your latest post link .
If you sign up for CommentLuv at their site , you can even customize which post you will want featured .
Neat !
54 . Recent Posts
Great way to showcase your latest articles in the sidebar .
Readers are curious , they want to know what ’s on your mind lately and if they are really interested in what you write , they will always want to be updated .
It ’s simple and good blog real estate use .
Download here .
55 . Similar Posts
I use this plugin to show a list of ( possibly ) related posts after each article .
It ’s not always matching the main idea and sometimes it gives weird results , but even that is much better than manually compiling a list of links each time I publish .
Great time saver and good retention tool .
Download here .
56 . Woopra
Woopra is a new analytics tool and I ’m kinda fond to it .
Tracking your website is done by installing a simple wordpress plugin , which , a part from helping Woopra gather all sort of data , does n’t do much .
But will talk about Woopra as ana analytics service a little bit later .
Download here .
57 . WordPress Automatic Upgrade
Saves me the trouble of doing it manually .
I reckon I struggled for years with manual upgrades of WordPress , and even if I got really skilled at some point , I ca n’t avoid the fact that this is just plain boring .
Not to mention is time consuming .
Better automate the process .
Download here .
58 . Twitter Tools
Twitter Tools can do a lot of nice tricks for you .
It shows your latest tweets in the sidebar , automatically tweet when you publish a new post and can even let you tweet from your own public interface ( do n’t know who uses this , but it ’s kinda cool ) .
Download here .
59 . Avoid The Plugin Hysteria
No plugin can write content in your place .
No plugin can make you authentic .
Spending too much time hunting , installing and testing new plugins will shift your focus from your most important task : to produce and maintain a constant flow of quality content .
That would make you famous , not the plugins .
Promotion
You will have to make yourself known .
You will have to get out and let the world you ’re there and you are writing something important .
Not promoting your work would be like projecting fabulously creative commercials in Sahara .
The ads may be fantastic , but if there ’s nobody to see them , it ’s useless .
60 . Do n’t Be Shy About Your Blog
If you really know you wrote good stuff , go out and spread the word .
Unless you hired a PR company to handle this you gotta take care of your own promotion , at least until it takes off .
And even after .
Accept the idea and make time for it in your schedule .
61 . Tweet Your Blog
Sign up for Twitter and start to promote your posts there .
Already mentioned a plugin which will automatically do most of the hard work for you , but you can also do it manually .
Used properly , Twitter can bring in hundreds or thousands of visitors per day .
As in every other social media space , the thumb rule is to be constantly there .
Somehow .
62 . Stumble Upon
That would be the StumbleUpon website , a community which aims to make the internet content relevant , by using a human powered algorithm .
That sounds far more complicated than it really is .
In StumbleUpon you must first contribute a lot of new discoveries until you really get the benefits of the game .
63 . Reddit Your Posts
Go on and try Reddit , one of the simplest , yet most crowded user generated content places on the net .
Usually , Reddit users are in the geeky zone of the internet specter , but if you carefully chose your subreddits ( that would be special communities inside the main Reddit ) you can have pretty good results .
64 . Digg It !
Although I have n’t been very successful with Digg , I recommend it .
I personally know bloggers who benefited enormously from it .
Digg traffic seems to be the most volatile among all the communities I mentioned so far .
Maybe you can help me change my luck on Digg by pushing this post on the front page . 🙂
65 . Facebook
It ’s all over so you must be there .
I do n’t know any specific technique on how to use Facebook to promote your work other than just being there .
Put your blog feed on the wall , so your friends can see it and just wait .
At some point , you will be surprised by how many hits you receive just by being there .
66 . Follow Your Trackbacks
Constantly keep en eye on who ’s linking to you .
Visit them and let a comment .
If the number is too high and you ca n’t physically leave a comment on every site which is linking to you ( do n’t smile , it WILL happen at some point ) just be sure to constantly verify that list .
You ’ll learn a lot about your audience and possible followers .
67 . Comment On Other Blogs
Find at least 10 - 15 blogs you really like and make a habit out of commenting on them .
Not only you will get to know a lot of interesting and potentially useful players in this area , but you will generate a lot of links and buzz .
Do n’t brutally say : “ Hi , check out this great article I just wrote ” , say something meaningful and they will eventually want to know more about you .
68 . Respond To The Comments
Keep an eye on the conversation you generate , if any .
Be there for it , support it and make it a normal part of your routine .
Behind your posts lies another exceptional line of content , and that ’s your comment repository .
Respect your commenters , as they are voluntarily creating content for YOU .
69 . Establish A Slug Structure And Stick With It
A slug is the link part of your post , the one that shows in the browser .
You can tweak what is shown there just with a vanilla wordpress setup .
For instance , I chose to have the post title right before the domain name .
Other approaches are to put the date between them , to add an “ archives ” or even a custom one made entirely by yourself .
70 . Participate In Blog Carnivals
Kinda slow but necessary .
Submit your most interesting posts to blog carnivals in your niche .
It might be a little cumbersome to do this in the beginning but in a 3 months time frame you will gather a lot of links and awareness .
Do n’t be fooled by the somehow awkward interface of BlogCarnival.com , those carnivals are actually real and useful .
71 . Use Proper CSS For Headings
That would be , by a wide accepted standard , 2 .
Make sure your paragraph titles , also known as headings , are styled with H2 .
This is extremely important for layout ( if you change your theme and did n’t use h2 , you will lose the formatting ) but for search engine optimization also .
A different CSS style weights differently in most of the search engines .
72 . Select Your Keywords In Headlines
If you used a different CSS selector for headlines , do n’t forget to chose specific words for it .
If you want your post to be found by specific keywords , putting them in the headings will significantly increase your chances .
It ’s one of the cheapest promotion technique I know .
73 . Use Proper Keywords
In Your Slugs
In the same league as headings come slugs .
Although WordPress can automatically create your slug , it ’s always a good idea to double check for common words or / and for keywords you want to be highlighted .
Also an easy one , but often overlooked .
74 . Use Title Tag Appropriately
The title of your post can or cannot match the < title > tag .
The thumb rule is : the tag is seen by search engines and the title in the post is seen by search engines + your readers .
It ’s useful to play a little with the title tag , but do n’t go too far , do n’t chose completely different words for the post title and the tag title , you can get penalized for that .
75 . Use Metatags Appropriately
There is a long debate on the internet about how useful metatags really are .
And the real answer is that nobody really knows , so it ’s better to get yourself covered .
Thesis theme has this awesome feature which lets me control per each post metatags like title , keywords and so on .
76 . Look For Small Or Emerging Communities
Once you ’ve done your job with the giants ( twitter , reddit or digg ) start looking for small / emerging communities in your niche .
At this time , both Ycombinator or BizSugar are still young and emerging communities , but judging on how fast they ’re moving , they may become mainstream pretty soon .
77 . Use A Cluster Of Analytics Services
Observe your traffic statistics .
You can use any service you want , from Google Analytics , to a server based log analyzer like webalizer .
I use Woopra lately with fairly good results .
One good strategy is to group 2 - 3 analytics services together , because usually they have different algorithms and you can have a better idea about your real traffic if you check at least 2 - 3 sources .
78 . Establish ( and strictly follow ) A Statistics Checking Routine
Do n’t go to your statistics page every 5 minutes .
I know the feeling , and it ’s not good .
In the beginning , weekly it .s ok .
Once you get to be linked or retweeted , 2 - 3 times a day is enough .
And you will do that mainly to get in touch with who interacted with your content .
79 . Identify Forums In Your Niche
Forums are still very popular and they can be a very good traffic generator .
Just be sure to keep a fair balance between your regular contribution to that forum and your self - promotion , forums users are typically a little bit more sensitive .
80 . Watch Your Comments Density
That ’s another blog metrics which I consider extremely important and which plays a big role in shaping your overall visibility .
By watching the number of comments per post .
per day , per week and their variations from one month to another you can draw extremely valuable conclusions .
81 . Watch Your Pingback Volume
If comments density is a measure of your popularity , pingback volume is a measure of your visibility among other competitors .
Identify posts with the higher pingback volume and see what you can learn from them .
Pingbacks are like a volume switch for your work , the higher the volume , the most popular the article .
82 . Talk About It With Your Friends
Like the friends you have in the real world ( if you ’re fortunate enough to still have some ) .
Let them know who you really are and what do you do .
Do n’t put your work under the carpet .
Make it as visible as you can .
Word of mouth is much more powerful than any promotion strategy I know .
83 . Make Your RSS Subscriber Number Public
Surprisingly enough , many of the bloggers I met are shy about these numbers , most of the time thinking they do n’t have enough followers to show off .
In fact , making the number of subscribers public will encourage your potential readers to join .
People are attracted to meaning , not numbers .
Networking
Blogging is about connecting .
Do n’t stay in the same place , you ’ll get dusty .
Go out , meet new people , contribute or help in different ways .
Networking is so often forgot and I think this is a big mistake .
Networking is much more than promotion , being able to connect you with people in the real world .
84 . Write Guest Posts
Go out and find blogs in your niche .
Contact the authors and ask if they accept guest posts .
Most of the time , they will .
The main benefit of guest posting is not , as they largely promote it , the traffic you get , but the relationship you establish with the host .
85 . Write Massive Guest Posts
Massive guest posting is something a little bit different than guest posting ( and , as far as I know , is something that was n’t done so far ) .
Basically , you write an article with several possible developments and then continue those developments as guest posts on other blogs .
See massive guest posting .
86 . Create And Maintain A Close Group
Identify bloggers with a similar background ( they can or can not be in the same niche , as long as you can get along ) and openly propose a cross-promotion .
Be careful when you chose them and be sure they are persons you can rely on .
You will be in that group for quite some time .
87 . Promote The Members Of Your Close Group
Just like any other friendship relationship this must go two - ways .
Whenever you see the opportunity to promote them , do it .
Retweet , stumble , digg or reddit their articles .
Remember , they have to be people you trust and admire .
What you promote tells a lot about yourself .
88 . Participate In Internet Blogging Challenges
One of the most famous internet blogging challenges is Darren Rowse ’s 31 Days To Build A Better Blog .
I personally attended ( virtually , of course ) the last edition and I must tell you it was a really nice experience .
This is as good as participating in collaborative projects , only you benefit from the exposure of a blogging icon .
89 . Go Out And Meet Bloggers
In Flesh And Blood
If you have a hugely diverse audience this may be a little difficult .
But even so , you can try it .
I did it too and that helped me understand that other bloggers are for real , just like you , they ’re not just some numbers in your analytics tool , under the “ referrers ” tab .
Meet them , maybe you wo n’t become close friends , but you may learn a lot form this interaction .
90 . Attend Specific Blogging Events
Like in real world specific blogging events , this time .
One of the most famous is Blog World Expo , but there are many other established conferences , not to mention the local ones .
Do your best to participate in real events as often as you can .
91 . Speak Out
Once you ’re at a real life event , do n’t be shy .
I saw too often bloggers attending to interesting events but keeping an unexplainable low profile .
Stand out , speak , give feed - back and let the people know who you are .
People are more curious than you think to actually meet the real presence behind a blog .
Even yours .
Money
At some point , you will want to make some money out of your blog .
It ’s natural .
It ’s your work and there must be some sort of payment for it .
Only in this business , you have to take care personally about this problem .
And that is the good news , because if you ’re careful , the sky is the limit .
Literally .
92 . Accept Donations
Do n’t make a loan and vouch it with your blog donations , it will never be like that .
Donations are n’t predictable .
But having them displayed is a nice way to let people know that you accept their gratitude .
If you really write valuable content , you will receive donations .
I know I did .
93 . You Sell Authority , Not Goods
Always remember that what you are really selling would be your authority , your expertise , your credibility or your lifestyle .
Be very careful when you chose to make money and how you do it .
Blogging is not about selling , blogging is about building partnerships .
You ’re responsible .
94 . Promote Only What You Use
Once you ’ll become well known , there will be more and more requests for promoting different products or services .
One of the rules I followed so far was to promote only what I directly used .
People have this tendency to associate your person with what you are promoting and if the promoted product is a mess , that could be really awkward .
95 . Use PPC Diligently
Do n’t overcrowd your page with ads ( and yes , by PPC I also mean AdSense ) .
Pay Per Click is such a size consuming advertising technique , it needs a lot of space and exposure to create sustainable results .
It can create a stable source of income , but its golden days are gone .
96 . If You Sell Space , Sell It Directly
If you decide it ’s time to sell display advertising , sell it your own .
Make a separate page in which you are announcing your prices and your conditions .
Selling display advertising via an advertising agency is very expensive .
Not to mention that you do n’t really control the process .
97 . Make Your Expertise Stand Out
And clearly state that you are for hire .
If it ’s consulting that you do , say it out loud , if it ’s web design , write it with big fonts .
Do n’t expect people to dig through your posts trying to find what ’s your main expertise and if you could help them .
There are a lot of people out there already doing it .
98 . Make Long Term Deals
Even if the overall payout is smaller , always go for long term deals .
Despite what TV news told you , economy is not predictable .
Go for a tinier profit but do it for longer time .
One of the best promotions I did was a year long deal with a software producer and I ’m totally happy with it .
99 . Create And Sell Your Own Products
Write an ebook .
Create an online course .
Make a suite of videos .
Go for what you can genuinely create .
Making money directly from your products is always better than advertising .
You can totally control the process and even if you use affiliate networks to promote your products , the payout is much bigger than in any other field .
100 . Use Incentives To Promote Premium Content
Create free ebooks or other free resources to create awareness .
Link to your commercial products in those free products and then spread the word .
That way , people will have the opportunity to know more about what you do before actually buying the commercial product .
101 . Add Paid Membership
I did n’t actually do it here , but I successfully did it in other projects and all I can tell you is that is really working .
But it depends a lot on your niche and audience .
As of January 2016 , there is such a community , built on top of DragosRoua.com readers .
The name is The Space and it ’s growing pretty fast .
You should check it out .
Also , as a rule of thumb remember that people are ready to pay from premium content , if that content really solve some real problem for them .
I know , there are 101 ways , not 100 , as I promised in the title .
I lied .
And I also did something that always helped me being successful : under promise and over deliver .
Ten years of case studies at a pediatric hospital and a thorough literature review have shown that it is not uncommon for children to ingest small " button " batteries , either through swallowing or inserting the batteries into their noses .
In a paper presented at the 2009 American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery Foundation ( AAO - HNSF ) Annual Meeting & OTO EXPO in San Diego , researchers revealed that a significant lack of knowledge about the dangers of button batteries exists in the lay population and in healthcare providers .
Button batteries are miniature disc batteries that are typically used to power hearing aids , watches , calculators , and many commonly used items , including small toys and musical greeting cards .
Each year , more than 3,000 people of all ages in the U.S. unintentionally swallow these batteries , according to the National Capital Poison Center in Washington , DC .
Sixty - two percent of battery ingestions involve children under the age of 5 , with a peak incidence in 1 - and 2 - year - olds .
While many children who ingest button batteries recover with few long - term health issues , some develop long - term complications that significantly deteriorate quality of life , such as tracheostomy - tube or gastrostomy - tube dependence , vocal paralysis , and septal perforation with saddle nose deformity .
The authors say expeditious identification and treatment of button battery ingestion is crucial , for which continuing education must be provided to pediatricians , primary care , urgent care , and emergency room care providers , and otolaryngologists .
The authors also concluded that increased public awareness is necessary to diminish the incidence of such ingestions .
Industry changes , including improved packaging and button battery markings , will also be fundamental to this process .
ATLANTA  For Strategic Vision L.L.C. , as for many polling companies , it was a regular practice : for five years the company sent out the results of its surveys on leading political races around the country , and they made their way into blog posts , articles and national television coverage .
But news organizations are rethinking their use of Strategic Vision ’s numbers after the company was reprimanded last week by a professional association of pollsters for failing to disclose “ essential facts ” about its methods .
The reprimand has hit a nerve among those in the political world who feed on poll numbers , prompting intense scrutiny of everything from the distribution of digits in the company ’s poll results to its claim that it is based in Atlanta .
Nate Silver , a statistical analyst who writes FiveThirty Eight , a blog on polling , has suggested in a series of posts that the company ’s data may well be fabricated , an assertion denied by David E. Johnson , the founder and chief executive of Strategic Vision .
“ We expect to be fully vindicated , ” Mr. Johnson said in a telephone interview this week .
But the controversy has also led to a critical examination of the indiscriminate use of poll numbers .
Strategic Vision ’s polls have been cited by numerous news organizations , including The Associated Press , The Washington Post , MSNBC , Fox News and , on at least three occasions , The New York Times , even though the company has repeatedly failed to provide supporting data and the methodology for its surveys .
( The Times generally avoids using national and state polls that do not meet its standards . )
San Francisco police announced Thursday that DNA evidence had linked Richard Ramirez , the Southern California serial killer known as the “ Night Stalker , ” to the 1984 slaying of a 9 - year - old girl .
Ramirez , who is on death row for a string of murders committed more than two decades ago , submitted DNA samples to detectives Wednesday morning at San Quentin State Prison , according to the San Francisco Police Department .
Authorities are also trying to determine whether Ramirez is connected to any other slayings in the San Francisco area during that time .
The unsolved case of the young girl ’s killing was reopened five years ago when Police Inspector Holly Pera recalled it from her days as a young patrol officer .

“ That ’s part of the reason why the case was relooked at , ” Pera said during a news conference .
“ It ’s the type of case -- as a new officer , a case involving a little girl -- that you ca n’t forget . ”
On April 10 , 1984 , Mei Leung was found dead in the basement of a residential hotel in the Tenderloin district , police said .
Investigators did not release details about the slaying .
Police said Mei lived at the hotel with her family .
Before her death , she and her 8 - year - old brother were seen walking home from a friend ’s house .
At the time , Ramirez was staying at two hotels in the general area , said Deputy Chief David Shinn .

Mathew Gabriel , the DNA technical leader at the crime lab , said numerous items from the scene were tested , and one resulted in a “ cold hit ” when run through a national database .
The Combined DNA Index System ( CODIS ) holds about 1.2 million profiles of convicted offenders , and arrestees from past felonies .
The DNA sample from the crime scene will now be compared to the new DNA sample from Ramirez to confirm the cold hit , Gabriel said .
In 1985 , Ramirez went on a months - long rampage of sexual assault and murder that generated widespread fear throughout Southern California .
In most of the cases , Ramirez entered homes in the early morning hours through open windows or doors .

Some of the victims were found strangled , others had their throats slashed , but most had been fatally shot .
Spray - painted pentagrams -- a distinctive Satanist symbol -- were also found on the walls of the some of victims ’ homes .
The killings led to an increase in the sale of guns , ammunition , locks and window bars throughout Los Angeles County .
Ramirez ’s killing rampage finally ended on Aug. 31 , 1985 , when he was captured and beaten by angry citizens in East Los Angeles after he tried to steal a woman ’s car .

On Sept. 20 , 1989 , Ramirez was convicted by a Los Angeles jury of 13 slayings .
The following month , the jury voted for the death penalty .
Ramirez was quoted as saying , as he left the courtroom : “ Big deal .
Death always went with the territory . ”

In recent years a number of bestselling books have forcefully argued that belief in God can no longer be defended on rational or empirical grounds , and that the scientific worldview has rendered obsolete the traditional beliefs held by Christianity , Judaism , and Islam .
The authors of these books -- Richard Dawkins , Daniel Dennett , Sam Harris , Christopher Hitchens , and Victor J. Stenger -- have come to be known as the " New Atheists . "
Predictably , their works have been controversial and attracted a good deal of critical reaction .
In THE NEW ATHEISM : TAKING A STAND FOR SCIENCE AND REASON ( Prometheus Books , $ 19 ) , Victor J. Stenger , whose God : The Failed Hypothesis hit the New York Times bestseller list in 2007 , reviews and expands upon the principles of New Atheism and answers many of its critics .
He demonstrates in detail that naturalism -- the view that all of reality is reducible to matter and nothing else -- is sufficient to explain everything we observe in the universe , from the most distant galaxies to the inner workings of the brain that result in the phenomenon of mind .
" [ The New Atheism ] is largely focused on the scientific and expands upon Stenger 's thesis that the question of God 's existence is not beyond science ... " noted Library Journal , recommending this book " for those already interested and engaged in the current discussion about God and religion , from either side of the fence . "
Stenger disputes the claim of many critics that the question of whether God exists is beyond the ken of science .
On the contrary , he argues that absence of evidence for God is , indeed , evidence of absence when the evidence should be there and is not .
Turning from scientific to historical evidence , Stenger then points out the many examples of evil perpetrated in the name of religion .
He also notes that the Bible , which is still taken to be divine revelation by millions , fails as a basis for morality and is unable to account for the problem of unnecessary suffering throughout the world .
" What is truly ' new ' about atheism is that the world , after too many centuries of giving religion a free rein , is now prepared to see and embrace the positive wisdom of doubt ....
The religious right can no longer smear atheists as ' strident , angry , aggressive , and negative . '
Victor Stenger , with his affirming , incisive and illuminating observations , shows us that there is truly grandeur in taking a stand for something precious : science and reason , " Dan Barker , co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation and author of Godless : How An Evangelical Preacher Became One of America 's Leading Atheists .
Stenger also discusses the teachings of ancient nontheist sages such as Buddha , Lao Tzu , and Confucius , whose guidelines for coping with the problems of life and death did not depend upon a supernatural metaphysics .
Stenger argues that this " way of nature " is far superior to the traditional supernatural monotheisms , which history shows can lead to a host of evils .
" The new atheism is not just another dogmatic belief system to be accepted on faith , nor does it make people immoral and miserable , " said Susan Blackmore , author and visiting Professor in Psychology at the University of Plymouth .
" Stenger 's thorough review should make both believers and atheists take seriously the harm religions can do . "

Health care has often been debated as a technical or economic issue .
That has been a mistake , I believe .
At root , universal health care is not an economic or technical question but a moral one .
We accept that life is unfair , that some people will live in cramped apartments and others in sprawling mansions .
But our existing insurance system is not simply inequitable but also lethal : a very recent , peer - reviewed article in the American Journal of Public Health finds that nearly 45,000 uninsured people die annually as a consequence of not having insurance .
That ’s one needless death every 12 minutes .
When nearly 3,000 people were killed on 9/11 , we began wars and were willing to devote more than $ 1 trillion in additional expenses .
Yet about the same number of Americans die from our failed insurance system every three weeks .
The obstacle is n’t so much money as priorities .
America made it a priority to provide tax breaks , largely to the wealthy , in the Bush years , at a 10 - year cost including interest of $ 2.4 trillion .
Allocating less than half that much to assure equal access to health care is n’t deemed an equal priority .
The plan emerging in the Senate is no panacea .
America needs to promote exercise and discourage sugary drinks to hold down the rise in obesity , diabetes and medical bills .
We need more competition among insurance companies .
And conservatives are right to call for tort reform to reduce the costs of malpractice insurance and defensive medicine .
But those steps are not a substitute for guaranteed health coverage for all Americans .
And if health reform fails this year , then hopes for universal coverage will recede again .
There was a lag of 19 years after the Nixon plan before another serious try , and a 16 - year lag after the Clinton effort of 1993 .
Another 16 - year delay would be accompanied by more than 700,000 unnecessary deaths .
That ’s more Americans than died in World War I , World War II , Korea , Vietnam and Iraq combined .
The collapse of health reform would be a political and policy failure , but it would also be a profound moral failure .
Periodically , there are political questions that are fundamentally moral , including slavery in the 19th century and civil rights battles in the 1950s and ’60s .
In the same way , allowing tens of thousands of Americans to die each year because they are uninsured is not simply unwise and unfortunate .
It is also wrong  a moral blot on a great nation .
So much of our musical landscape has changed .
Rarely do I invite someone over to listen to an album over coffee , rarely do I make a mix CD for a friend , and what used to be an exciting outing to an independent music store has increasingly become a distant memory , as these autonomous ventures continue to fold
Focus on Family
Our practice focuses mainly on legal issues that affect families , such as :
Representing children in juvenile criminal defense cases
Addressing delicate issues of abuse or neglect in cases involving children in need of care
Pursuing grandparent rights to custody or visitation
Creating guardianships and tailored estate planning instruments , such as wills and trusts
Efficiently guiding family members through the probate process
Guiding families through private and stepparent adoptions
Other family law services
As adoption lawyers , we handle mainly private and stepparent adoptions for families residing in Kansas as well as out - of - state families .
Many military personnel adopt their stepchildren in Kansas because the state allows these adoptions even for military families who are legal residents of other states .
In our family law practice , we prefer to do divorces using the collaborative method of divorce .
This is divorce without going to court .
Both parties hire their own lawyers , but the lawyers are committed to working toward a settlement .
Collaborative divorce is much faster and less expensive than traditional divorce , and the outcome is one that both spouses have agreed to , so it is easier on the children .
We also handle child support and child custody matters , including post - divorce modifications .
Many legal problems can be resolved quickly by asking the right questions and getting accurate legal advice .
To encourage this process , we offer initial legal consultations at a reduced cost .
' If some pretty girl on the pensionable side of 16 offered me a bit of pelvic refreshment , why her knickers would be hanging off a tree in Mongolia before she could change her mind '
Why is this society apparently addicted to passing stupid laws that , if enforced , can only cause misery and wreck lives , and in no way add to the sum of human happiness or wisdom ?
The entirely predictable -- and predicted -- consequences of the Criminal Law ( Sexual Offences )
Act 2006 are now coming about .
A 19 - year - old boy , who had consensual sex with a girl who was just under 17 , the lawful age of consent , is to be imprisoned .
Now , if you want to grasp the sheer magisterial folly of our law - makers , the preposterous law that was used against the boy was the Criminal Law Sexual Offences Act 2006 , as amended by Section 5 ( 1 ) of the Criminal Law ( Sexual Offences Act ) 2007 .
In other words , they did n't even manage to get the law right back in 2006 , and had to go back with their legislative spanners and screwdrivers a year later .
And still they got it wrong .
But throughout , you could see these pathetic , fumbling , nervous idiots had their eye on what the feminist - lobby would say about them if their contemptible little law failed to make women the invar - iable victims of any sexual episode .
And lobby is the right word .
Because you could fit this tiny but headline - making group of a few addled and bitter idiots into a broom cupboard : they no more represent women 's opinions than Licensed Vintners Association represents Alcoholics Anonymous .
This is the world we are now living in .
Among the under - 25s , 31 pc of men and 22 pc of women had full sex before they were 17 .
The average age of first sexual contact ( not full intercourse ) is probably closer to 14 .
But according to the Sex Offences law passed , not under the Lord Protector , Oliver Cromwell , but by the 21st century Dail Eireann ( at two bites of the cherry , so to speak ) , any 16 - year - old boy who has sex with 16 - year - old girl is a criminal , but the girl is n't .
It was a bad law , bound to make a bad case sooner or later , and by God , that 's what it has done .
We have created a legal apartheid which sees consensual neo - adult females as " victims " .
Indeed , the press coverage of the Mullingar affair referred to her throughout as such .
What makes Mullingar really special is that it hinges upon the girl 's parents ' feelings about the boy in question .
He and their daughter had previously had sex .
She agreed to have sex again ( there 's my girl ) .
But her father had since met and disliked the boy .
So , suspecting something was -- so to speak -- afoot on the evening in question , he followed his daughter and found her , well , you know what , and called in An Garda Siochana .
What an admirable fellow !
The lad is now to get a custodial sentence , even though he thought -- and the judge accepted that he thought -- that the age of consent was 16 .
Oh shag this age - of - consent mullarkey .
For I was 19 once , and by Jesus , if some pretty girl on the pensionable side of 16 offered me a bit of pelvic refreshment , why her knickers would be hanging off a tree in Mongolia before she could change her mind .
Moreover , any boy of 19 who says NO to such a girl deserves to rot in jail .
So only the weakest of legislators would indulge the cruel instincts of the few sad feminists who seek to wreak ruin on any boy simply because he surrenders to desires that are entirely natural , and are reciprocated by a girl of around the same age .
But as we all know , these country constables of the feminist movement are few in number , and are scorned by most women .
So one can only conclude that our cowardly law - makers are delighted that their moral supinity is going to cause a young man to be jailed , merely for doing what all young men are programmed by nature to do .
Moreover , you can go back 40 years and not find a prosecution as absurd as the Mullingar case .
For at least 22 pc of girls aged under 17 today have lost their virginity , which means , of course , that every male responsible is a criminal .
I know !
What we really need today is a few more sleuthing fathers , healthily spooring after their daughters at twilight , or beating through the undergrowth with their blackthorn sticks looking for sets of rutting buttocks .
Why , that way we could fill our prisons with young males who are guilty of the terrible crime of surrendering to sexual desire .
And then remember this .
The law was carefully and deliberately defined by our law - makers in 2006 .
Having made it illegal for any person under 17 to have sex with another person under - 17 , the bill then added : " A female child under the age of 17 shall not be guilty of an offence under this Act by reason only of her engaging in an act of sexual intercourse . "

Crisis pregnancy centers spread misinformation about abortion and birth control in an effort to dissuade women from exploring those options .
The Baltimore City Council wants to change that .
Imagine a
friend of yours , a pregnant woman , walks into an office seeking information
about her pregnancy .
Only , it ’s not a doctor ’s office and they ’re not going to
tell her the truth .
Unfortunately ,
this happens every day across the United States .
Everyone can
agree that women seeking information about pregnancy , birth control , abortion ,
or sexually transmitted diseases should receive timely and accurate
information , not false political propaganda .
But there are facilities out there that spread
misinformation about abortion and birth control in an effort to dissuade women
from exploring those options .
These are known as limited service
pregnancy centers or crisis pregnancy centers ( CPCs ) .
In Baltimore
and around the country , many facilities have neutral sounding names like
“ Center for Pregnancy Concerns . ”
Sounds like a place you could get
information or services for your pregnancy concerns , right ?
Wrong .
Volunteers who visited these centers were told falsehoods like abortion
increases your risk of breast cancer , that natural family planning is as
effective as the pill , and that condoms do not protect against sexually
transmitted diseases ( STDs ) .
CPCs
are concerned alright , but not about what ’s in the best interest of women’s
health .
They ’re concerned with preventing
women from exploring their full range of options to protect against unplanned
pregnancy and STDs .
CPCs do not
always disclose information about the limitations of services or their
anti-choice agendas in their advertising , particularly their beliefs about
birth control .
Low - cost birth control has been proven to be the most
effective way to decrease the need for abortion , yet CPCs give false
information about the safety and effectiveness of contraceptives .
Moreover , not a single CPC in Baltimore
City contacted by NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland Fund volunteers would provide a
referral for comprehensive birth control .

That ’s why
this week Baltimore City Council President Stephanie Rawlings - Blake introduced
the Limited - Service Pregnancy Centers Disclaimer Bill .
Co-sponsored by ten other council
members , this bill is a common sense measure that
will ensure that women visiting a Baltimore CPC are informed that they will not
receive comprehensive birth control or abortion services or referrals .
The measure does not ask CPCs to provide services they find objectionable .
It only asks them to be honest and straightforward with the women , so that they
know up front whether the facility will suit their needs .
Having a more
complete picture about the services that are and are not offered will also help
provide a context for information they do receive .
The goal of this
bill is to empower women to make decisions about their care , and decide if a
so - called “ Center for Pregnancy Concern ” is , well , concerned about the same
things as they are .
This bill is
an exciting step in Maryland .
Although Maryland introduced a statewide bill to regulate CPCs in 2008 ,
the bill , like all pro-choice bills in the last eleven years in our state , did
not move forward .
But localities
around the country have been enacting laws and policies to strengthen the
reproductive rights of women .
For
example , Pittsburgh enacted a buffer zone protecting patients entering
reproductive health care facilities .
And Madison , Wisconsin created an ordinance requiring pharmacies to let
customers know when emergency contraception is not available .
NARAL
Pro-Choice Maryland and Planned Parenthood of Maryland are committed to
ensuring that every woman has the best medical care possible – from birth
control to prenatal vitamins , from pre-conception care to labor and
delivery .
We have no objection to a center that offers women who have
decided to carry their pregnancies to term any help they like .
But lines
are crossed when a CPC is not up front about their services , or when a center misleads
women .
The Limited
Service Pregnancy Centers Disclaimers
Bill simply asks that Baltimore CPCs
disclose what is true – that they do not provide or refer for comprehensive
birth control services or abortion so that women know up front whether the
facility suits their needs .
We believe this bill to be a common
sense approach to a goal we all share – getting women the care they need .
The Washington Post front page blares today : “ Prospects for Public Option Dim in Senate . ”
Do n’t believe it .
Yes , the Senate Finance Committee did vote down two amendments that each would have added a government - run insurance plan to the committee ’s health care bill .
But two key Democrats who voted against Sen. Jay Rockefeller ’s ( D - WV ) public plan , Bill Nelson ( D - FL ) and Tom Carper ( D - DE ) , voted for Sen. Chuck Schumer ’s ( D - NY ) version .
According to an independent analysis of Senate Democrat public statements on the public option , that raises the number of Democrats on record supporting a public option from 47 to 49 .
Moreover , Sen. Tom Harkin ( D - IA ) , chairmen of the Health , Education , Labor and Pensions ( HELP ) Committee , told the liberal “ Bill Press Radio Show ” yesterday that Democrats “ comfortably ” have the remaining votes to reach 51 and pass a public plan once the debate moves to the House floor .
But what about Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus ’ ( D - MT ) claim yesterday that , “ No one has been able to show me how we can count up to 60 votes with a public option . ”
That may be true , but it is also irrelevant .
The question is not whether Democrats can muster 60 votes to pass Obamacare ; they only need 51 votes to do that .
The only time the number 60 will be relevant is when the Senate votes on whether to end debate and vote on the final bill .
This is a separate question .
We can see Senators from red states like Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) , Blanch Lincoln ( D - AR ) , and Kent Conrad ( D - ND ) voting against an amendment creating a public option .
But voting with Republicans against their party and against their President to support a Republican filibuster ?
That would take a lot of courage .
It would guarantee that these Democrats would face fierce opposition from their leftist bases back home .
Just ask the left ’s new whip for the public option , Michael Moore .
Speaking to women ’s groups and unions in Washington , DC , yesterday , Moore warned :
To the Democrats in Congress who do n’t quite get it : I want to offer a personal pledge .
I – and a lot of other people – have every intention of removing you from Congress in the next election if you stand in the way of health care legislation that the people want .
That is not a hollow or idle threat .
We will come to your district and we will work against you , first in the primary and , if we have to , in the general election .
Moore is , of course , the perfect spokesman for the public option .
He is in Washington promoting his new film “ Capitalism : A Love Story ” in which Moore argues that “ Capitalism is an evil , and you ca n’t regulate evil . ”
A more succinct summation of theory behind the public option does not exist .
While supporters of the plan , including the White House , insist that the purpose of the public option is to bring “ choice and competition ” to the health care , nothing could be further from the truth .
As Reps. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) , Jan Schakowsky ( D - IL ) , Anthony Weiner ( D - NY ) Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein , and Noble Prize winning New York Times columnist Paul Krugman have all candidly admitted , the public option is nothing more than a Trojan horse for a single - payer , government - run health care system .
Moore even told Rolling Stone magazine this summer :
If a true public option is enacted — and Obama knows this — it will eventually bring about a single payer system , because the profit - making insurance companies wo n’t be able to compete with a government run plan and make the profits they want to make .
So just how close are we to being inflicted with the Obama / Moore dream of anti-capitalist , competition - free , government - run health care ?
Closer than many realize .
Multiple sources on the Hill have told The Foundry that as early as next week , the Senate could be debating Obamacare .
Senate Majority Leader Reid has stated an intention to take the HELP Committee product and merge it with the Senate Finance Committee markup that is expected to be over by this Thursday or Friday .
Their plan is to proceed to a House passed non-health care bill to provide a shell of legislation to give Obamacare a ride to the House and then straight to the President ’s desk .

The crowd is often right except at market turns .
After the turn , the crowd tends to hold on until most previous gains vanish .
In a secular bull market , such optimism works out acceptably well .
In a secular bear market , rampant optimism is severely punished .
David Rosenberg is discussing the overly - optimistic consensus in a Special Report : A “ V ” - Shaped Recovery .
One Overvalued Market
There has been plenty of debate over whether equities are overvalued or not , and certainly we would assume that many investors know where we stand on the topic .
On an operating ( “ scrubbed ” ) basis , the trailing P/E multiple on the S&P 500 has expanded a massive 10 points from the March lows , to stand at 27.6 x .
While we will not belabour the point , when all the write - downs are included , the trailing P/E on “ reported ” earnings just widened to its highest levels in recorded history of nearly 140x , which is three times the levels prevailing during the height of the tech bubble .
PE Expansion
It is interesting to hear market bulls talk about how distorted it is to be using trailing multiples that include ‘ recession earnings ’ ( even though using ‘ forward ’ earnings means relying on consensus forecasts on the future and these are rarely , if ever , correct ) .
It is also interesting that the last time the multiple was this high was back in March 2002 , again after a huge countertrend rally that deployed ‘ recession earnings ’ from the 2001 downturn .
If memory serves us correctly , this was right around the time that the bear market rally started to roll over and in fact , six months later , the S&P 500 was hitting new lows and 34 % lower than it was when the multiple had expanded to … today ’s level !
Even On A Forward Basis , The Market Is Overvalued
Bullish analysts like to dismiss the actual earnings because they are “ depressed ” and include too many writeoffs , which , of course , will never occur again .
The consensus is usually overly - optimistic , which is why so many analysts love to do their analysis on “ forward ” earnings since the market almost always looks “ attractively priced ” on that basis .
The reality is that the forward P/E multiple is now at 16.2 x after bottoming at 11.7 x at the market lows .
The multiple has not been this high since February 2005 when the economic expansion was already nearly four - years old !
Today ’s stock market , on this basis , is now being priced as if we are late in the cycle — forget this mid-cycle valuation stuff .
At the October 2007 market highs , the forward P/E multiple was 15 x compared to 16.2 x today , so you can understand why it is that :
1 . We think investors are paying too high a price to participate , and ;
2 . We think that valuations are closer to levels more befitting an economy in its more mature stages of expansion than in its infancy .
Valuation may not be the best timing device , but it still pays to know whether you are getting into the market at acceptable prices .
If the S&P 500 was in a 700 - 750 range , de facto pricing in zero to 1 % GDP growth , we would certainly be interested in boosting our allocations towards equities .
But at 1,070 and over 4 % GDP growth effectively being discounted , we will be spectators as opposed to participants , understanding that the key to success is to NOT buy at the peaks .
So the strategy is to sit on the sidelines , be selective in our equity choices , and wait for the correction to come or for the fundamentals to catch up with this overvalued , overbought , overextended market .
Remember , the reason why the tortoise won the race was because the hare got tired .
S&P 500 Is Way Ahead Of Itself
What do we know from 60 years of historical data ?
We know that the market typically faces serious valuation constraints once it breaches the 25 x P/E multiple threshold .
The average total return a year out for the S&P 500 is - 0.3 % and the median is - 6.2 % .
The total return is negative a year later 60 % of the time , so when we say that there is too much growth and too much risk embedded in the equity market right now , we like to think that we have history on our side .

It 's not just pitchfork - wielding populists , politicians , and bloggers complaining about big Goldman Sachs ( GS ) bonuses .
Nuns are after them , too .
------------------------
BOSTON , MA . & NEW YORK CITY /// October 14 , 2009 /// Goldman
Sachs is issuing its much anticipated earnings announcement on Thursday ( October 15 , 2009 ) , and is expected to set aside up to $ 20 billion for executive bonuses .
In view of this action coming so quickly on the heels of the federal bailout money issued to the company during the height of the financial crisis last year , investors are responding by mounting major proxy initiatives .
The Nathan Cummings Foundation and the Benedictine Sisters of Mt. Angel , Oregon announced today that they have filed a shareholder resolution urging the Board to review pay disparity at the company and analyze the appropriateness of its spiraling pay packages – packages that have an unprecedented impact on Wall Street compensation in general
The resolution , which is expected to gather more co-sponsors , has been filed early to challenge Goldman Sachs as the Board makes final decisions on bonuses .
It was filed to appear in the 2010 proxy and be voted on at the stockholder ’s meeting .
Goldman Sachs had received resolutions calling for shareholders to have an Advisory Vote on executive compensation that received a 46 % vote in favor , but the Board has resisted implementing even that modest reform .
Other investors may also file resolutions calling for a “ say on pay ” or for separation of board chair and CEO positions at Goldman Sachs .
Laura Shaffer , who is director of shareholder activities of the Nathan Cummings Foundation and one of the resolution ’s sponsors , stated : “ This request is especially timely as Goldman Sachs rushes to pay huge bonuses , setting an example that many Wall Street firms will no doubt strive to emulate .
As shareholders , the ripple effects of this extraordinary compensation are especially concerning .
Executive compensation accounts for a considerable portion of aggregate earnings and as firms like Goldman hand over ever larger sums to their executives , these spiraling pay packages will have increasingly significant impacts on investors ’ returns . ”
Sister Judy Byron , who coordinates the faith - based Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment and is a longtime proponent of this resolution , said : “ Goldman Sachs ’ announcement of record bonuses is a stark reminder about how executive compensation is spiraling out of control for many firms .
It is important that citizens and shareowners both act as voices of reason .
As Fortune reminded us in 2007 , top executives earn 364 times the pay of the average worker .
CEO pay increases significantly for many executives even in rough times , while layoffs skyrocket and pay for average employees stagnate .
Laura Berry , executive director of the Interfaith Council on Corporate Responsibility , said : “ As prudent investors , we have a responsibility here to act as the conscience of Wall Street , especially when it fails to do so on its own .
How is it possible that the year after billions of taxpayer ’s dollars helped companies like Goldman Sachs return to financial health , this company shows absolutely no restraint ?
Goldman Sachs is poised to become the poster child of the company that drives income disparity in the United States . ”
FULL RESOLUTION TEXT
Recent events have increased concerns about the extraordinarily high levels of executive compensation at many U.S. corporations .
Concerns about the structure of executive compensation packages have also intensified , with some suggesting that the compensation system incentivized excessive risk - taking .
In a Forbes article on Wall Street pay , the director of the Program on Corporate Governance at Harvard Law School noted that , “ compensation policies will prove to be quite costly — excessively costly — to shareholders . ”
Another study by Glass Lewis & Co. declared that compensation packages for the most highly paid U.S. executives “ have been so over - the - top that they have skewed the standards for what ’s reasonable . ”
That study also found that CEO pay may be high even when performance is mediocre or dismal .
In 2008 , Federal Appeals Court Judge Richard Posner stated that , “ executive pay is out of control and the marketplace cannot be trusted to rein it in . ”
Legislative attempts to address executive compensation include the Excessive Pay Shareholder Approval Act , which mandates that no employee ’s compensation may exceed 100 times the average compensation paid to all employees of a given company unless at least 60 % of shareholders vote to approve such compensation .
A 2008 piece in BusinessWeek revealed that , “ Chief executive officers at companies in the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index earned more than $ 4,000 an hour each [ in 2007 ] . ”
It also noted that an S&P 500 CEO had to work , on average , approximately 3 hours in 2007 “ to earn what a minimum wage worker earned for the full year . ”
A September 2007 study of Fortune 500 firms showed that top executives ’ pay averaged $ 10.8 million the previous year , or more than 364 times the pay of the average U.S. worker .
Another study by the Economic Policy Institute found that between 1989 and 2007 , average CEO pay rose by 163 % while the wages of the average worker in the United States rose by only 10 % .
RESOLVED : shareholders request the Board ’s Compensation Committee initiate a review of our company ’s executive compensation policies and make available , upon request , a summary report of that review by October 1 , 2010 ( omitting confidential information and processed at a reasonable cost ) .
We request that the report include –
1 . A comparison of the total compensation package of senior executives and our employees ’ median wage in the United States in July 2000 , July 2004 & July 2009 .
2 . An analysis of changes in the relative size of the gap and an analysis and rationale justifying this trend .
3 . An evaluation of whether our senior executive compensation packages ( including , but not limited to , options , benefits , perks , loans and retirement agreements ) are “ excessive ” and should be modified to be kept within reasonable boundaries .
4 . An explanation of whether sizable layoffs or the level of pay of our lowest paid workers should result in an adjustment of senior executive pay to “ more reasonable and justifiable levels ” and whether Goldman Sachs should monitor this comparison going forward .

Hollywood is a town that indulges superstition .
So when Heath Ledger died in January last year during the shooting of his final film , The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus , it was said that a curse cast on its director , Terry Gilliam , had struck again .
Gilliam 's filmography , after all , is littered with as - yet - unrealised projects , budget busts and studio battles .
Parnassus , many believed , was doomed to the same fate as his Don Quixote movie , which so far has made it to the screen only as the subject of Lost in La Mancha , a documentary chronicling the production 's descent into chaos – courtesy of biblical weather , the ageing lead 's ill health and the Spanish air force conducting exercises near the set .
Yet far from proving the curse of Gilliam , the release of Parnassus on 16 October demonstrates his unique brilliance .
For what other film - maker could , through the sheer force of his imagination , take such a tragedy and turn it into a tribute to his friend and fallen star ?
And how many directors are so beloved by Hollywood 's brightest and best that they could enlist Johnny Depp , Colin Farrell and Jude Law to finish the job ?

Parnassus tells the winding tale of a travelling actors ' troupe led by the titular doctor ; they move between the banality of modern London and a mystical netherworld , picking up players along the way – including Tony , a ne'er - do - well who helps them in their quest to rescue the doctor 's daughter from the devil , as played by Tom Waits .
Tony looks like Ledger in London , and like Depp , Farrell or Law after passing through the doctor 's looking glass into the netherworld .
It is , like many a Gilliam film , a little hard to explain without the pictures .
Christopher Plummer , who plays Parnassus and worked with Gilliam on Twelve Monkeys , recently told an interviewer that the director had himself blamed the jinx that appeared to afflict his films for Ledger 's death : " [ Terry ] is a very dear soul underneath all that wacky stuff , a very emotional man , " he said .
" He 's half genius and half madman .
I 'm crazy about him . "
Gilliam 's singular imagination first corrupted popular culture in 1969 , when the 29 - year - old émigré animator became a member of Monty Python 's Flying Circus .
Born in Minnesota in 1940 and schooled in California , he moved to England in his twenties , where ( having already met John Cleese when he visited the US with the Cambridge Footlights ) he worked with Michael Palin , Terry Jones and Eric Idle on the children 's comedy series Do Not Adjust Your Set.
Life as a Python followed , and if John Cleese was the group 's comic genius , then Gilliam was behind its unforgettable visuals .
Contrary to popular perception , however , Gilliam 's visions were n't fuelled by mind - expanding substances – a notion he would also have to dispel after his drug binge road movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in 1998 .
" When Python used to be reviewed , " he says , " they all thought we were druggies .
Me , in particular . "
In his diaries , Palin recalls his friend 's disillusionment with animation as early as 1972 .
Gilliam was running out of ideas and keen to write and direct live action , so in 1975 he and Jones co-directed Monty Python and the Holy Grail .
By the time the Pythons began to disintegrate in 1979 , Gilliam had , in Palin 's words , an " almost all - consuming urge to do his own movie ...
Otherwise , he says , he will go mad " .
That movie was Time Bandits ( 1981 ) , a fantasy jaunt through time and space with an unmistakable feel that marked out Gilliam as an auteur , and gave him the opportunity to follow it with his pet project , Brazil ( 1985 ) .
Though now considered by many as his masterpiece , this oddball Orwellian dystopia sparked the first of Gilliam 's many battles with the studios .
Not for nothing are his films shot through with a hatred for bureaucracy and bland authoritarianism .
Universal , responsible for the film 's US release , insisted on re-cutting the bleak ending , and Gilliam fought the decision tooth and nail .
Eventually he had his way , but his reputation was further muddied by his next feature , The Adventures of Baron Munchausen ( 1988 ) , which made back less than a fifth of its budget at the US box office , earning its director the enduring title of troublemaker and liability .
In fact , in the years that followed , Gilliam proved himself more than able to deliver studio - financed pictures on time and on budget , with The Fisher King ( 1991 ) and Twelve Monkeys ( 1995 ) , both critical and commercial hits .

He even succeeded in filming Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas where Martin Scorsese and Oliver Stone had failed .
In the meantime , however , he was denied the opportunity to work on some larger prestige projects .
An adaptation of Watchmen , the classic graphic novel that finally made it to the screen this year directed by Zack Snyder , passed across his desk twice ; besides the difficulty of raising funds for such an ambitious film , Gilliam decided the original material would be better served by a mini-series .
Gilliam was frustrated when Warner Bros refused his bid to direct the first Harry Potter film .
As J K Rowling 's first choice of director , he was flown to LA for the requisite meetings , but even if the studio was keen , the insurance companies knew his record , and would have demanded too high a premium .
" I was so angry at myself for fooling me into getting excited about it , " he later admitted .
" There was no way I was ever going to make [ Harry Potter ] .
I knew that ...
It 's an acceptance of the reality of Hollywood . "
His most recent works are a failed attempt at a commercial hit , The Brothers Grimm ( 2005 ) , and Tideland ( 2005 ) , a wantonly dark fantasia seen by almost no one .
Thanks in part to the success of Lost in La Mancha , Gilliam has started to be talked about as a visionary who simply can't translate his genius into a coherent movie .
But , says Ian Freer , assistant editor of Empire , " If you wrote a list of all of his films , only about 10 per cent of them genuinely fail – and those are noble failures .
Compared to most film - makers , that 's a pretty good batting average .
He can sometimes let his creativity outpace his care , but I would n't want him to not do that – it would stop him being himself . "
Because of his troubled history with the studios , Gilliam – now 68 – accepts that his future lies in independent film - making , and the next project on his slate is a familiar one :
The Man Who Killed Don Quixote , for which he has re-acquired the rights and plans to finally deliver by 2011 .
Empire , meanwhile , has described Parnassus as his best work in more than a decade , not least because it returns him to the mad world of his own imagination .
Gilliam himself claims Parnassus is like his version of Bergman 's Fanny and Alexander or Fellini's Amarcord .
" Those directors reached a point in their lives where they said , ' OK , let 's just wallow in the things we enjoy . '
So this is my wallow .
I do n't have to keep proving new things and exploring all areas .
This is what I am .
This is what I do . "
Says Freer : " There 's an argument that actually Gilliam remakes Alice in Wonderland every time .
Parnassus is very much a trip through the looking glass .
And it has the visual excitement that you want from Gilliam .
I wonder how many of us are left who really want the Gilliam thing , but hopefully , given that it 's got Johnny Depp , Jude Law , Colin Farrell and Heath Ledger in it , he 'll find some new people to excite . "
As to the reworking of the film following Ledger 's death , " If it had been a different film - maker it might not work , " Freer goes on , " but in Terry Gilliam 's world , you can try things and change it .
It 's a testament to his style .
Maybe it 's something he 's learnt over the years – to endure the chaos that comes with making his films . "
A life in brief
Born : Terence Vance Gilliam , 22 November 1940 , Medicine Lake , Minnesota .
Family : One of three siblings .
His father James Hall Gilliam was a travelling salesman and carpenter .
Married the British make - up and costume designer Maggie Weston in 1973 .
They have three children who often appear in Gilliam 's films .
Career : Started his career as an animator and strip cartoonist on Help ! ( 1965 ) and animated Monty Python 's Flying Circus from the first episode ( 1969 ) .
Directed a number of films including Jabberwocky ( 1977 ) , Brazil ( 1985 ) , The Adventures of Baron Munchausen ( 1988 ) , Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ( 1998 ) , The Brothers Grimm ( 2005 ) and The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus ( 2009 ) .
He is rumoured to be working with Damon Albarn 's Gorillaz on a new film project .
Gilliam was given the Bafta Academy Fellowship Award in 2009 for his contribution to motion picture arts .
He says : " You get trapped by stories .
Though I 've got this reputation for being out of control , it 's not true .
It just happens to be a more interesting story than the truth . "
They say : " I love Terry and personally I 'd do anything the guy wants to do . "
Johnny Depp
Douglas Medin and Andrew Ortony wrote a chapter in the 1989 book Similarity and Analogical Reasoning in which they called this effect of labels psychological essentialism .
That is , when we describe something with a label , we are saying that the object is part of a particular category .
For example , if we say that Susan has depression , we are saying that she is part of the category of people who are depressed .
A consequence of placing someone in a category is that we now think that there is some set of characteristics that are shared by everyone in that category .
That is , we believe that the category has an essence .
It is not important whether that particular category really has an essence .
If we place an object in a category , people treat the object as if it has the essence of that category .
Psychologically , then , a person suffering from the symptoms of depression is different than a person who is depressed , because we believe that the person who is depressed has some essence that the person who is just suffering from the symptoms does not .
Susan Gelman and Gail Heyman documented this effect in a 1999 study in the journal Psychological Science with children .
They found that when you described someone as a carrot - eater , children thought that eating carrots was a deep part of who that person was .
When you describe someone as a person who eats carrots , then they thought that eating carrots was less a crucial part of who they are .
I have always thought that you can use this effect as an insult as well .
For example , someone might ask , " Is John a painter ? "
Dismissively , you could say , " Well , he paints ... "
Psychological essentialism may be important for behavior change .
We use labels to describe things all the time .
Often , we use these labels just to describe something in order to communicate it to someone else .
The work on psychological essentialism suggests that after we use a label , we will treat the characteristics we label as less easy to change than characteristics we have not labeled .
It seems easier to change the symptoms of depression than to change someone who is depressed .
If we say that someone is aggressive , then it seems harder to expect them to change their behavior than if we just think that they have acted aggressively .
Ecco il papello , la lista delle richieste che i corleonesi fecero allo Stato per mettere fine alle stragi , dopo Capaci e prima di Borsellino .
Lo ha consegnato ai magistrati da Massimo Ciancimino , figlio di Vito , ex sindaco della città inquisito per mafia .
Nella lista , sicuramente ispirata da Totò Riina , ma scritta da uno dei figli o dal boss Antonino Cinà , ci sono tutte le richieste dei mafiosi .
Eccole .
1 ) revisione sentenza del maxiprocesso ; 2 ) annullamento decreto legge 41 bis ; 3 ) revisione legge Rognoni - La Torre ; 4 ) Riforma legge pentiti ; 5 ) riconoscimento benefici dissociati ( Brigate rosse ) per condannati di mafia ; 6 ) arresti domiciliati dopo i 70 anni di età ; 7 ) chiusura delle supercarceri ; 8 ) carcerazioni vicino le case dei familiari ; 9 ) niente censura posta familiari ; 10 ) misure di prevenzione e sequestro : non familiari ; 11 ) arresto solo in flagranza ( nel testo fragranza ) di reato ; 12 ) levare tasse dei carburanti come Aosta .
Ieri l'espresso aveva pubblicato un lungo reportage con gli appunti , scritti da Vito Ciancimino .
Secondo il figlio di Ciancimino , il documento sarebbe stato consegnato al colonnello dei carabinieri del Ros , Mario Mori .
Che ha sempre smentito .
Sul caso , interviene anche Nicola Mancino , che al tempo della stage di Capaci era ministro dell '
Interno , ora vicepresidente del Csm .
" Se il cosiddetto ' papello ' contenente le richieste della mafia per alleggerire l'offensiva contro lo Stato è stato consegnato , tramite Vito Ciancimino , al colonnello Mori , è quest ' ultimo che deve dire a chi l'ha consegnato , sempre che sia stato consegnato a qualcuno che aveva responsabilità istituzionali politiche o dei vertici dell ' ordine pubblico o dei servizi " .
" A me di certo - prosegue Mancino - , nè Mori nè alcun altro , lo ha consegnato nè me ne ha mai parlato , come del resto ho chiarito in tutte le sedi , anche giudiziarie " .
" Nel merito - aggiunge il Vice Presidente del Csm - , al tempo della mia responsabilità di Ministro dell '
Interno nessuna - proprio nessuna - di quelle richieste è stata accolta , neppure inavvertitamente .
Si è rafforzata la scelta di contrastare la mafia , di non darle tregua : trasporto all ' Asinara e a Pianosa dei più pericolosi detenuti ; 7 mila militari a disposizione sul territorio della Sicilia ; 41 bis applicato con determinazione ; nessuna legge di contrasto alla mafia abrogata o modificata ; DIA entrata in funzione con due anni di anticipo .
Vorrei anche ricordare che il maxiprocesso potè avere una conclusione grazie a una legge sui termini di prescrizione che reca la mia prima firma come senatore ( legge n. 29 del 17.2.1987 ) " .
" Il mio nome comparirebbe in un carteggio aggiuntivo ( quasi illeggibile ) - afferma ancora Mancino - che si assume consegnato dal figlio di Ciancimino ai magistrati di Palermo .
Ma Ciancimino figlio , in una recente dichiarazione ( 25 settembre , Radio 24 ) , così precisa : ' Non ho nulla da rimangiarmi su Nicola Mancino che mi ha querelato .
Quando si voleva aprire un canale per la trattativa era stato fatto il nome suo e di un altro ministro .
Che poi mio padre non trovo ' in Mancino l'interlocutore che voleva ...' " .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Life ! ) -
The United States is the most admired country globally thanks largely to the star power of President Barack Obama and his administration , according to a new poll .

It climbed from seventh place last year , ahead of France , Germany , the United Kingdom and Japan which completed the top five nations in the Nation Brand Index ( NBI ) .
“ What ’s really remarkable is that in all my years studying national reputation , I have never seen any country experience such a dramatic change in its standing as we see for the United States for 2009 , ” said Simon Anholt , the founder of NBI , which measured the global image of 50 countries each year .
He believes that during the previous administration of George W. Bush the United States suffered in the world ranking with its unpopular foreign policies but since Obama was elected , and despite the recent economic turmoil , the country ’s status has risen globally .
“ There is no other explanation , ” Anholt said in an interview , referring to the impact of Obama .
The global survey , conducted by GFK Roper Public Affairs & Media , involved 20,000 people in 20 rich and developing countries around the globe .
They were asked to rate 50 nations in categories such as culture , governance , people , exports , tourism , landscape and education .
Canada took the biggest hit in the latest survey , falling to seventh from fourth place , while China climbed several spots to 22nd , which Anholt believes in due in part to the successful staging of the Olympics .
China has always scored low on human rights and environmental policies but high on cultural heritage .
“ It is the first time China ’s profile has risen , ” said Anholt , who has been doing the annual poll since 2005 .
“ Since the Olympics its score for tourism and its people has risen and that has helped to stem its decline , ” Anholt explained .
Italy maintained the sixth spot in the survey for the second year , while Switzerland came in eight , followed by Australia in 9th place and Spain and Sweden , which tied for 10th place .
At the opposite end of the survey Colombia and Kenya tied for 47th place .
Angola was number 49 and Iran came in last at number 50 .
MOGiS , der Verein von Mißbrauchsopfern gegen Internetsperren , bekommt keinen Wikipediaeintrag wegen angeblicher Irrelevanz .
Das ist im Fall MOGiS reichlich bizarr , zeigt aber deutlich , wie es in der deutschen Wikipedia zugeht :
Es gibt ein strenges Löschregime mit hochgradig kasuistischen und detaillierten Relevanzkriterien , die von Wikipedia - Benutzern mit besonderen Rechten exekutiert werden .
Das Löschen vorgeblich irrelevanter Artikel wird als Beitrag zur Qualitätssicherung verstanden .
Mehr Information soll weniger Qualität bedeuten .
Das glaube ich nicht : Relevanz ist irrelevant .
Wie kommt es zu den ausgeprägten Löschkreuzzügen , der Diktatur der Relevanz ?
Die einfachste Erklärung ist , vom » deutschen Wesen « zu sprechen , von Blockwarten , von Vereinsmeierei ; vergleicht man die deutsche mit der englischsprachigen Wikipedia , hat man ein weiteres Indiz ( dort gibt es sehr viel weniger strenge Relevanzkriterien ) .
Die Dynamik von Gruppenprozessen und Regelentstehung wäre interessant zu betrachten , am besten zusammen mit der Frage nach der Rechtsmentalität : Neigt » der Deutsche « zur Verregelung ?
Sind hier wieder jähzornige , aber kontrollfreudige Heiseforentrolle am Werk ?
Liegt es an der Kommunikationskultur , die entsteht , wenn 90 % der Benutzer Männer sind , besonders viele davon naturwissenschaftlich interessiert und nicht in einer Beziehung ?
– alles Spekulation .
Eine weitere Erklärung ist ein Qualitätskomplex : Der Wunsch , ernstgenommen zu werden .
Die Ausrichtung an einem vorgestellten Kanon .
Kann man ein Projekt mit enzyklopädischem ( also im besten Sinne allgemeinwissenschaftlichem ) Ansatz ernstnehmen , das Artikel zu obskuren Cocktails hat ?
Das zu größten Teilen aus Popkultur besteht ?
So wie man selbstverständlich keinen Fernseher hat und nicht BILD liest , gibt es Themen , die in einer Enzyklopädie eben nicht vorkommen .
– klingt plausibel , geht aber der Sache nicht auf den Grund .
Schließlich : Mangelnde methodische Reflexion .
Die Kriterien Relevanz und Neutralität sind selbst nicht wertfrei .
( Kleiner Exkurs zur Neutralität : Neutral sein zu wollen , ist bereits eine normative Vorentscheidung , die in sich das Problem trägt , daß die Standpunkte der Schreibenden nicht als relevant gesehen werden .
Die Annahme , daß mit Sprache etwas völlig wertfrei beschrieben werden könnte , ist nicht so sicher , wie es scheint .
( Einigen Benutzern ist das auch bewußt . )
Es besteht keine Notwendigkeit ( außer der Analogie zum gedruckten Lexikon ) , die von der Wikipedia gewählte Form eines je einzelnen , einheitlichen Artikels pro Lemma zu wählen .
Es wäre etwa möglich gewesen , mehrere Artikel mit klar ausgewiesenen Standpunkten unter einem Lemma zu sammeln .
Dann könnte die Wikipedia nicht nur die Encyclopædia Britannica ersetzen , sondern zusätzlich etwa das Historisch - kritische Wörterbuch des Marxismus . )
Relevant ist etwas immer in bezug auf etwas anderes .
Die Wikipedia hat sich für einen absoluten Relevanzbegriff entschieden :
Es ist völlig egal , ob ein Begriff , ein Sachverhalt für mich relevant ist , solange er ein absolutes Kriterium erfüllt – in einen Kanon im weitesten Sinn paßt .
Die Hüter der Relevanz legen fest , daß für mich eine chinesische Millionenstadt relevanter ist als beispielsweise das kirchliche Dekanat Warendorf , das durch das Kriterium einer absoluten Relevanz fällt .
Dazu paßt dann auch , daß es Benutzer mit Löschrecht gibt , die sich als Interpreten der einen Wahrheit fühlen .
( » Wenn Du es weißt , wieso beziehst Du Dich dann auf die Mehrheit ?
Sie hatte eben Unrecht . «)
Daß man auf die Idee kommen kann , einen einheitlichen absoluten Relevanzbegriff für mindestens 105 Millionen Menschen festzulegen , scheint mir zumindest mutig .
Die ganze Problematik offenbart sich in einem Paradox : Die Wikipedia als Web - 2.0 - Projekt ist ein postmodernes Medium .
Relevanz ist ein modernes Paradigma .
Das Problem ist schon angelegt in der Grundentscheidung : Der Selbstbezeichnung als » Enzyklopädie « – ἐγκύκλιο ς παιδεία , umfassende Bildung , scientia generalis , die Wissenschaft vom Allgemeinen .
Will man das bei der Wikipedia wirklich ?
Die fundamentale Entscheidung ist : Will man , wenn man sich als Enzyklopädie bezeichnet , umfassend das Wissen der Zeit darstellen – oder will man sagen : Das gute , alte Papierkonversationslexikon im Netz ?
Der Unterschied ist fundamental : Neues Medium löst altes Problem – oder neues Medium transferiert altes Medium mit seinem Lösungsansatz des Problems ins Netz .
Das alte Medium mußte modern konzipiert werden : Das Wissen der
Welt mußte kategorisiert werden , systematisiert , es mußte ausgewählt werden , Vorentscheidungen mußten getroffen werden .
Ordnung wird rational konstruiert .
Das versuchen auch die Relevanzkriterien der Wikipedia .
Eigentlich wären die nicht nötig : Speicher ist billig , und das Problem von zuviel Information kann es nicht geben – es kommt auf die Filter an .
Wikipedia verharrt aber im modernen lexikalischen Prinzip .
Die Chance eines postmodernen ( oder weniger belastet : Web -2.0 -)
Ansatzes wird nicht ergriffen : Die Möglichkeit , daß Quantität in Qualität umschlägt .
Ich habe nämlich möglicherweise gar kein Interesse daran , aus einem hochqualitativen , aber beschränkten Kanon Informationen abzurufen :
Oct. 20 , 2009  --
A group of Northwestern University journalism students who believe they found proof that exonerates a man held behind bars for 31 years are fighting a request from the Illinois state prosecutor 's office that they turn over their grades and course materials as part of its investigation into the possible wrongful conviction , arguing that it would jeopardize future investigations .
The university 's lawyer , Richard O'Brien , told ABCNews.com the Cook County 's prosecutor 's office is wrongly focusing its attention on the academic history of the students working for the Medill School of Journalism Innocence Project and not enough on the case of Anthony McKinney , who the students believe was convicted and incarcerated for a murder and armed robbery he did not commit .
" The prosecution is saying that maybe the grades of the students were skewed in a way to incentivize them to try and find evidence of innocence , " O'Brien told ABCNews.com .
" That 's obviously not that case , and we do n't believe it is material to the question of whether McKinney is innocent . "
The Innocence Project at Northwestern , led by journalism professor David Protess , was founded in 1999 and uses the work of undergraduate journalism students to investigate cases of people suspected of being wrongly convicted .
Since its inception , the project has freed 11 men , five of whom were sitting on death row .
The college program has had a large impact on Illinois ' use of the death penalty .
In January 2000 , during a speech in which he enacted a state moratorium on the death penalty , Illinois Gov. George Ryan referenced the Northwestern students ' efforts in helping to exonerate death row inmate Anthony Porter in 1999 .
Ryan later commuted the sentences of all 167 of Illinois ' death row prisoners , citing concerns about errors in the process and again citing the work of Protess and his students .
Now , the school worries that turning the legal microscope on the students could deter future students from participating in the Innocence Project .
" We 've uncovered 11 instances of wrong convictions -- we ought to be applauded by the state , but instead we 're constantly being put under a microscope , " O'Brien said .
Northwestern Students ' Records Subpoenaed
Students from the Innocence Project began researching McKinney 's case in 2003 on the advice of his younger brother , Michael McKinney .
Three years later and with the help of 30 students , the group was certain that it was not McKinney , then just 16 years old , but two other men who were responsible for the 1978 shooting death of a security guard .
McKinney was convicted of murder and armed robbery and sentenced to life in 1982 .
Now 49 , he has been in prison ever since .
Presented with the group 's findings in 2006 , the Center on Wrongful Convictions at the Northwestern Law School filed a post - conviction petition in October 2008 in the Cook County Circuit Court , requesting that McKinney 's prison term either be vacated or he be given a new trial .
The case was assigned to a judge later that year , and in May 2009 state prosecutors subpoenaed the students ' binders , grades , e-mails and course syllabi in what they call a " truth seeking process , " according to court documents .
The students names have not yet been released .
Specifically addressing the request for student binders and grading criteria , the prosecution said in the court documents that it wanted the materials to ensure there was " no bias " on the part of students during the investigation .
Stating that they are not " well - informed " about how the class works at Northwestern , the prosecutors claimed they want to be sure students were not told that they would get better grades if they found exculpatory evidence on McKinney 's behalf .
The prosecution also argues that the students and their professor , Protess , are not protected by the Illinois Reporter 's Privilege Act , which prevents journalists from being required to turn over sources acquired during an investigation .
Sally Daly , the spokeswoman for the Cook County state 's attorney office , did not return repeated messages left by ABCNews.com , but told the Chicago Tribune that the information being sought was " relevant to the case . "
At an appearance Monday night at the City Club of Chicago , Cook County State 's Attorney Anita Alvarez defended the state 's decision to go after the students ' records .
" If you 're going to put yourself into the role of an investigator , then you need to turn over whatever your notes are , " said Alvarez , according to the Chicago Tribune .
Student Subpoena ' Highly Unusual '
Phyllis Goldfarb , the Jacob Burns Foundation Professor of Clinical Law and George Washington University , said that this type of subpoena for student records is " highly unusual . "
" It 's hard to understand the motive for a subpoena that is this broad , " said Goldfarb , who is not associated with the Innocence Project .
" This is an investigative journalism class at a major university , " she said .
" One of the fundamental themes of any journalism class is integrity and objectivity , so the innuendo that the [ state attorney ] would find something in these documents that would say a student was offered an ' A ' if they found the man innocent is an attack on the integrity of the institution . "
" And I understand why the university would want to resist it , because if that 's their motive it discredits the educational enterprise , " said Goldfarb .
The suggestion that the students working for the Innocence Project were somehow motivated to find McKinney innocent in an effort to get good grades is " not true , " according to O'Brien .
" The witnesses are going to say what they 're going to say , and we did n't make up testimony and we did n't speak on behalf of the witnesses , " O'Brien said .
" The prosecution should focus on them , not us . "
O'Brien said that while the Project 's findings offered enough background to the prosecution to pursue their own case , witnesses would have to be re-interviewed by the state should a re-trial be granted , making the students ' binders and grades unnecessary .
" Even though they are going to do their own work they wo n't just accept what we 've published , " said O'Brien , referring to the materials that Northwestern has supplied the prosecution , which O'Brien says includes any on - the - record interviews or material that has been published .
According to the Innocence Project headquarters in New York -- the first of many worldwide branches of the organization , founded in 1992 to help prisoners who could be proven innocent through DNA testing -- there has never before been an instance in which students involved in an investigation have been asked to turn over their own records , grades or other personal information .
Northwestern Concerned About ' Dangerous Precedent '
Don Craven , the executive director of the Illinois Press Association , says he 's worried that if the prosecution succeeds in subpoenaing the students ' records the Project could fail to exist altogether in the future .
" The practice impact of what the prosecution is doing in this case is undermining the work on this particular investigation and the Project as a whole , " said Craven .
" If people are worried that a U.S. attorney could come knocking on your door to get your notes , how willing will these students be to continue doing their jobs , and how willing will people be to come talk to you about [ cases like McKinney 's ] , " said Craven .
While O'Brien awaits the Nov. 10 hearing to determine whether the subpoena will be thrown out or honored , he too says he 's worried that Protess and his students may never again be able to do the work that has so far changed so many lives .
" This is a dangerous precedent if the state is entitled to get these materials , " said O'Brien .

OTTAWA–Federal lawyers are trying to block government witnesses from testifying before a military watchdog investigating the treatment of Taliban prisoners in Afghanistan , The Canadian Press has learned .
The Justice Department has invoked national security and told the Military Police Complaints Commission that subpoenaed witnesses will be allowed to appear at the inquiry , but they will be instructed to say nothing when hearings begin next month .
The position was laid out during a meeting among inquiry lawyers on Sept. 25 , said the commission 's lead attorney , Freya Kristjanson .
Critics say it is the latest attempt by the Conservative government to shut down the investigation into claims by human rights groups that the Canadian army knowingly handed over insurgents to torture in Afghan prisons .
The order effects " every single government employee " slated to come before the commission , including military officers and senior staff from both the Defence and Foreign Affairs departments .
Kristjanson said the inquiry , which begins Oct. 5 in Ottawa , could potentially be sidetracked for months by legal wrangling , with the refusal to testify being referred to Federal Court .
Sources close to the case say federal lawyers have cited a section of the Canada Evidence
Act which allows the government to keep information secret if it's in the national interest .
Justice Department lawyers have offered to let the witnesses testify behind closed doors , as long as the commission writes out the questions ahead of time and is not present when the interviews take place .
The answers would be transcribed , censored for national security and handed to the commission .
All government witnesses have refused pre-inquiry interviews and federal lawyers filed motions on Tuesday hoping to quash commission subpoenas .
Lawyers representing both the commission , as well as complainants Amnesty International and the B.C. Civil Liberties Association , are aghast .
" I 've never seen something like that in all of my life , " said Kristjanson , who was counsel to the commission that investigated the Maher Arar deportation and torture case .
" It seems to me the government has never had any intention of co-operating . "
Paul Champ , who represents both human rights groups , said the tactic is right in line with the government 's game plan , which included a recent legal challenge that questioned the watchdog agency 's jurisdiction to investigate the complaints .
In a judgment released last week , the Federal Court gave the Justice Department a partial victory by limiting the scope of the inquiry to the actions of military police officers in Kandahar .
A spokesman for Defence Minister Peter MacKay declined comment , as did military police and the Justice Department .
Reports that the prisoners – handed over to the Afghans – may have been tortured rocked the Conservative government in the spring of 2007 .
They prompted Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's government to sign a more stringent agreement with Afghan authorities , allowing Canadian diplomats to check on the status of transferred Taliban .

The government has repeatedly said it has found no credible evidence of abuse and only uncovered one case , in November 2007 , of a prisoner being mistreated .
It has downplayed the allegations and at one point International Trade Minister Stockwell Day , who was in the public safety portfolio at the time , suggested that Taliban prisoners were trained to lie .
But the Justice Department has now confirmed to the commission for the first time that military police conducted " several " investigations in Kandahar into the alleged mistreatment of prisoners , but refused to discuss the conclusions .
It is well known that officers looked into allegations made by a University of Ottawa law professor that Canadian soldiers had mistreated prisoners in 2006 .
But the military 's National Investigative Service has been silent about whether it formally probed claims made by Afghans .
Federal lawyers hinted last spring that they possess documents related to unspecified investigations , but they 've never formally confirmed that Canadian military police investigated Afghan claims .
It is a significant and potentially explosive development .
Kristjanson said she suspected that investigations had been carried out and asked for copies of the reports almost a year ago .
But she 's now been told that the government has not had time to censor the reports and therefore wo n't provide them for the inquiry .
" The government has done everything it can to delay a meaningful hearing , " she said .
" It also indicates that despite public comments that it was co-operating , it has in fact not been co-operating . "
New Democrat foreign affairs critic Paul Dewar said he cannot believe the lengths the government has gone to in order to sabotage the commission 's investigation .
" All of this begs the question : What are they hiding ? "
Russia and France would process uranium for Iran under the deal Iran will accept a UN deal on its nuclear programme , but only if " very important changes " are made , Iranian state media have reported .
Al Alam TV quoted " informed " sources as saying Tehran would respond to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) deal within 48 hours .
Under the draft proposal , Iran would send its enriched uranium to Russia and France to be turned into fuel .
Iran missed a Friday deadline for responding to the IAEA 's proposal .
All the other parties have confirmed their support for the deal , which is seen as a way for Tehran to get the fuel it needs for an existing reactor , while giving guarantees to the West that its enriched uranium will not be used for nuclear weapons .
We will wait until we decide that enough is enough and that the process is exhausted
Bernard Kouchner
French foreign minister Al Alam said Iran would " accept the broad framework of the deal , but wants very important changes in it " .
The station gave no further details on the changes Iran was reported to have requested be made to the draft .
On Monday , Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said Iran was considering whether to send some of its uranium stock to other countries for enriching or to buy already enriched uranium .
Mr Mottaki said the decision would be announced within days .
ANALYSIS Jon Leyne , BBC News Tehran correspondent
The latest hint from Al Alam TV suggests that Iran will accept a deal to supply fuel for its Tehran research reactor .
But those countries dealing with Iran will wonder what " important changes " Tehran wants in response .
In particular , is Iran willing to ship its own enriched uranium out of the country ?
On Monday the Iranian foreign minister said maybe Iran would agree , maybe it would not .
The other question observers are asking is how much this is a case of genuine indecision by Iran , and to what extent is it just playing for time ?
The answer could be that those in power are quite content to let a genuine debate rumble on , knowing that it also buys time , staving off new sanctions , while Iran presses ahead with its nuclear programme .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said that all the other parties in the talks had shown " a great deal of patience " , and he accused Tehran of wasting time .
The AFP news agency quoted Mr Kouchner as saying that Mr Mottaki " makes declarations and more declarations " which " rarely provoke enthusiasm " and are " rarely very positive " .
" We have been waiting for light at the end of the tunnel for almost three years .
We will wait until we decide that enough is enough and that the process is exhausted , " said Mr Kouchner .
" One day it will be too late . " EU foreign ministers had hoped to have a reply from Iran by Tuesday , in time for high - level meetings in Luxembourg .
The EU's Foreign Policy Chief Javier Solana said the UN had offered " a good deal " and did not require " fundamental changes " , Reuters reports .
Inspection Opposition inside Iran to the agreement is said to be growing .
The BBC's Tehran correspondent , Jon Leyne , says that if it is approves , it would offer some evidence that negotiations with Iran can bear fruit .
But if Tehran rejects it , the wider talks process would face a bleak future and new sanctions would once again be on the agenda , he adds .
NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE
Mined uranium ore is purified and reconstituted into solid form known as yellowcake Yellowcake is converted into a gas by heating it to about 64C ( 147 F )
Gas is fed through centrifuges , where its isotopes separate and the process is repeated until uranium is enriched Low - level enriched uranium is used for nuclear fuel Highly enriched uranium can be used in nuclear weapons On Sunday , a team from the UN watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) began an inspection of an Iranian uranium plant .
The Fordo plant , built into a mountainside near the city of Qom , was previously secret .
Its existence was announced by the Iranian authorities last month , apparently because Western intelligence agencies had already discovered it , says our correspondent .
Iran agreed to open the site to monitoring at talks with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany in Geneva on 1 October .
The inspectors are not expected to report until they leave Iran , but some Iranian officials have already said the inspection shows their country 's nuclear activities are both transparent and peaceful .
Iran says its nuclear programme is for purely peaceful purposes , but the revelation of the existence of the new plant increased fears in the West about Tehran 's intentions .

TAMPA , Fla . 
As the president of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the daughter of their owner , Gay Culverhouse was the woman in the men ’s locker room .
Twenty years later , she is trying to keep her former players out of the emergency room .
Sitting at a restaurant here Friday , she reconnected with a few Buccaneers retirees .
There was Richard Wood , the fearsome linebacker known as Batman whose searing migraines and tendency to get lost while driving near his home leave him scared for his future .
Across the table was Scot Brantley , an even harder hitter through the 1980s whose short - term memory is gone .
Then there was Brandi Winans , former wife of Buccaneers lineman Jeff Winans , who slipped into such inexplicable depression , fogginess and fury several years ago that their marriage splintered .
Culverhouse looked at disability forms , listened to stories , offered counsel and expressed regret .
She has done the same via telephone for another half - dozen former Buccaneers in their 40s or 50s who have increasing cognitive problems .
Having followed story after story detailing how National Football League retirees are experiencing various forms of dementia at several times the national rate , and listening to the league and its doctors cast doubt that football played any role in their problems , she has emerged after 15 years to reconnect with players and sound an alarm .
She will testify before the House Judiciary Committee at its hearing on football brain injuries on Wednesday to , as she put it , “ tell the truth about what ’s going on while I still have the chance . ”
AT 79 , Wu Jinglian is considered China ’s most famous economist .
In the 1980s and ’90s , he was an adviser to China ’s leaders , including Deng Xiaoping .
He helped push through some of this country ’s earliest market reforms , paving the way for China ’s spectacular rise and earning him the nickname “ Market Wu . ”
Last year , China ’s state - controlled media slapped him with a new moniker : spy .
Mr. Wu has not been interrogated , charged or imprisoned .
But the fact that a state newspaper , The People ’s Daily , among others , was allowed to publish Internet rumors alleging that he had been detained on suspicions of being a spy for the United States hints that he is annoying some very important people in the government .
He denied the allegations , and soon after they were published , China ’s cabinet denied that an investigation was under way .
But in a country that often jails critics , Mr. Wu seems to be testing the limits of what Beijing deems permissible .
While many economists argue that China ’s growth model is flawed , rarely does a prominent Chinese figure , in the government or out , speak with such candor about flaws he sees in China ’s leadership .
Description
The first full - length from The Most Powerful Telescope In The Universe , recorded over two weekends in secluded woodland cabins , and pressed to 12 " vinyl in limited - edition silkscreened covers .
Their first , self - titled EP garnered comparisons to Slint , Shellac , and Ride , and ' The Moonlight 's Fair Tonight ' takes this mix of post - punk and spaced - out indie rock to the next level - it's an album of psych - pop and drone for those who discovered Pink Floyd before post - rock , rough - edged and unrehearsed .
Reviews
The Moonlight 's Fair Tonight is just a beautiful record .
The Most Powerful Telescope in the Universe blend the atmospheric feel of Death From Above with the indie -pop of Of Montreal .
The album ebbs and flows brilliantly from track to track and everything is just done perfectly .
The vocals , although a bit of an acquired taste , work for each track .
The tempos are simultaneously upbeat and calming .
The instruments and song construction are intricate and deeply layered .
Opening track " The Last of the Incas " is simply a genius song of delicate construction and sets the tone for the whole album .
The Moonlight 's Fair Tonight adds to the recent trend of records from the Pacific Northwest hinging more and more on solid fundamental construction instead of the bells and whistles the rest of the music world seems intent on placing on records .
This is just a simply stunning album .
- Verbicide .
December 2 , 2009
In the simplest terms , it 's rare to find an album this gorgeous .
And even rarer to find one so warm , so positively glowing in the moment .
A group of friends , as much as a band , The Most Powerful Telescope In The Universe recorded their full length album The Moonlight 's Fair Tonight by assembling a group of musicians and shuttling them off for two weekend - long stints at a secluded woodland cabin somewhere in the woods of the Pacific Northwest .
Nothing was written in advance .
Nothing prepared .
Just the musicians and the desire to create an album on the spot .
Obviously , the environment was conducive to feed the muse of these cats , because what they created is a breath - taking journey through Of Montreal 's indie - pop sensibilities and Explosions in the Sky sonic experiments .
Guitars weave and curl , swirling through the mix like smoke coming from that cabin 's fireplace .
Keyboards layer in , hiding underneath , floating to the top , twisting through the air like dust floating in a beam of moonlight .
Songs float and levitate across the vinyl , barely being contained by the pull of gravity 's force .
" Last of the Incas , " the lead - off song fills the air with all that these guys represent ; loads of swirling , reverb soaked psychedelic guitar that builds in subtle beauty until it takes flight .
Joy Division - esque bass adds a weighiness to the proceedings , keeping the song from become fey or too disconnected .
Keyboards float by like cosmic dust while the vocals jump on the tail of a passing comet , adding a gentle whispering beauty .
" Cops Chasing Undercover Cops , " follows without bothering to touch back down on terra firma .
So gorgeously constructed , so lushly soaked in the sweetness of some floating constellation .
Do n't let the thought of " space rock " or " psychedelia " put you off .
This is n't head lost it's own ass music that wanders endlessly searching for a melody .
It 's a testament to the strength of the musicians that each song hangs together firmly within it's own melodic structure , but loose enough to expand throughout the solar system .
Simply put , this album is scrumptious .
One listen is all it takes .
One listen to know that you also want to join that flight , leave the earth behind and reach out into the cosmos .
Or at the very least , join the musicians next time they take to that remote cabin .
Ah , what I would n't give to be there and watch it all happen .
- The Ripple Effect .
February 3 , 2010
Recording projects done in isolated cabins out in the wilderness conjure up all the wrong images of what The Moonlights Fair Tonight actually sounds like ( in fact , so does it 's title ) .
Far from Mt. Eerie , far from Bon Iver , The Most Powerful Telescope in the Universe plays atmospheric rock , somewhere between shoegaze and post -rock .
Interesting though , is the group does incorporate some of the warmth of the aforementioned artists into their own blend of genres not known for that sort emotion .
Oh , and did I mention you can download this whole album fro free on either Ionik 's or Datawaslost 's websites ?
Not much of an excuse left to sleep on this one any longer , is there ?
- Ghettoblaster Magazine .
May 2010
Once a year , five members of four different bands , namely MW Ensemble , Swissfarlo , Coltrane Motion and With Raccoon Hands , get together in a secluded cabin to write and record songs over a long weekend .
To me , this concept is genius and , quite frankly , the music is not too far off from there .
These are spacey , psychedelic pop , with delay and fuzz galore and , while early Pink Floyd is an obvious influence , I also hear the dreamy waves of The Feelies , and maybe even some Dinosaur Jr .
The instrumental , ' Bloodmilk , ' almost sounds like something Amon Duul II would have done .
None of it 's derivative , however .
Perhaps the speed of writing and recording the material , over three or four days without looking back , keeps things more pure .
Methinks so .

Essentials of Group Psychology
How groups form , conform , then warp our decision - making , productivity and creativity .
When we ’re in a group other people have an incredibly powerful effect on us .
Groups can kill our creativity , inspire us to work harder , allow us to slack off , skew our decision - making and make us clam up .
The keys to understanding human behaviour — our lives as citizens , as workers , as friends — are in the research on group psychology , which PsyBlog has been exploring over the past few months .
This post provides an overview and you can follow the links to explore the experiments that reveal the power groups hold over us .
Formation , influence and leadership
The seeds of group behaviour are sown even before its members meet .
Just knowing that some people are on ‘ our side ’ and others are not begins to shape our social identity .
Group affiliation soon grows even stronger , though , bending our behaviour further , if we undergo an initiation rite .
A rite as simple as reading rude words out loud can produce a measurable effect ( see 10 rules that govern groups , # 1 , # 2 ) .
Once we are in a group it starts to shape us through conformity , pulling our attitudes and behaviour in line with others , threatening us with ostracism if we dare to rebel and , when facing rival groups , firing our competitive spirit ( see 10 rules that govern groups , # 3 , # 4 , # 10 ) .
We try to shape the group as well , perhaps by repeating our opinions .
This helps to convince others we are voicing the majority view .
Still , people are notoriously resistant to change .
One way newcomers can influence groups is by displaying loyalty , toeing the line and by creating psychological distance from previous group affiliations .
A group takes its cue from a leader , but where do leaders come from ?
When leaders are allowed to emerge naturally from a group , they do so first by being the ultimate conformers , then later starting to lead in new directions ( see 10 rules that govern groups , # 6 ) .
Whether conforming or not , a sure sign of a leader is someone who talks first , and most often .
By the time groups are well - established chatter flows easily up and down the grapevine .
This is not just rumour and suspicion , though , as research has found that grapevines are surprisingly accurate with up to 80 % being true ( see 10 rules that govern groups , # 9 , # 6 ) .
Productivity
The amount and quality of the work we do ( or do n’t do ) is regulated by the group .
Sometimes groups have a social facilitation effect on performance , spurring us on to greater achievements .
This is most likely to happen when our own contribution is obvious and when we are judged in comparison to others .
At other times groups encourage social loafing , resulting in a drop in our productivity — sometimes by as much as 50 % , perhaps more .
This is likely to happen when it ’s easier to hide in the group , when we think the task is n’t important and when our individual performance is n’t being judged separately .
Psychologists have found that social loafing can be decreased by boosting group and task importance as well as decreasing the ‘ sucker effect ’ : the feeling that others are slacking off .
Decision - making
One of the most important functions of modern groups is decision - making .
The fates of our families , our corporations , even our nations , hang on our collective ability to make good decisions .
Unfortunately psychologists have found that groups suffer all kinds of biases and glitches that lead to poor choices .
Happily , though , experiments have revealed some straightforward remedies for these failings .
Because group members are often very similar in background and values they are quick to adopt majority decisions .
Psychologist call this groupthink .
We can combat groupthink by nurturing authentic dissent .
This is no mean feat as dissenters are often shunned because of the challenge they present .
Support for dissenters needs to come from leaders .
It seems only natural that groups will average out the preferences of its members , but psychologists have shown this often is n’t true .
In fact people are likely to display group polarization when together : initial preferences actually become exaggerated by group discussions .
We can reduce this by avoiding homogeneity in group composition .
Finally , the most baffling of our behaviours in groups is our inability to share information effectively .
Instead of revealing vital information known only to ourselves , time and again research has shown that we talk about things everyone already knows .
We can reduce this counter - productive behaviour by recalling relevant information before meetings and ensuring each is aware of others ’ expertise .
Creativity
Creativity fosters economic growth , artistic innovation and technical breakthroughs , on all of which our society thrives .
Groups , though , if badly organised , can stifle lofty ambitions .
Psychologists have long known that the practice of ‘ brainstorming ‘ is a sure road to fewer new ideas and less innovation than that produced when we work individually .
In groups we loaf , feel anxious and our own ideas are soon forgotten while we listen to others .
It turns out that groups are better at evaluating ideas than they are at their generation .
Despite its longevity , brainstorming is best avoided for its original purpose .
Even when we are physically distant from our groups they can still impede creativity through the unconscious standards they impose on their members .
What psychologists call group norms can kill creativity by redefining it as mere conformity .
It ’s no accident that some of the greatest breakthroughs in science and the arts have come from those working outside the orthodoxy .
Sometimes it really is better to go it alone .
The power of groups
Groups may impose unwritten norms on us , warp or exaggerate our decisions , even dull our creativity , but these effects are often the flip side of forces that make groups strong .
Despite the modern trend towards fractured neighbourhoods , families and workplaces , humanity cannot survive without banding together .
We draw our psychological identity and strength from belonging , and groups provide us support when times are hard ( see the research on mutual support groups ) .
We just need to be careful that leaders are chosen for the right reasons , that conformity does n’t trump reason , strangle creativity or limit our options .
We must try to understand and respect the power that groups hold over us so that we can benefit from them rather than becoming their victims .

When we first reported that Tom Waits is prepping a live LP for release this fall , many sites held off on following suit with the unofficial announcement , as our source was only a photographer involved with the project .
Well , I just finished listening to an interview by Jian Ghomeshi of CBC Radio , and we now have confirmation from Waits himself , as well as a release date and cryptic Waitsian description .
“ Okay , Glitter and Doom , that ’s the title , ” Waits confirmed .
“ Now I really feel like a huckster .
Yeah , it ’s coming out at Thanksgiving . ”
The exact release date , via Amazon , is 11 / 24 .
“ A lot of applause , followed by a song , ” Waits continued , “ and after the song there ’s more applause and then there ’s a song .
And it goes like that all the way through . ”
I do suggest you download the interview here .
Waits talks about his role as Satan , aka Mr. Nick , in Terry Gilliam ’s new film , The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus , signing up for email , and this interesting bit :
Thank God for stories , you know .
None of us tell the truth or we ’d all be dead .
There ’s no such thing as the truth .
The word “ truth ” should always have an “ S ” at the end of it ‘ cause there ’s so many of them .
Two guys watching the same thing .
The blind man describing the elephant , you know .
Ah , there ’s nothing like starting the weekend off right with a thought - provoking quote from Tom Waits .
Hey Tom , now that you have email , send some of your thoughts this way .
C'était un vendredi après-midi , la veille de son départ en vacances .
Il y a une quinzaine de jours , André ( le prénom a été modifié ) , cadre expérimenté dans une banque de la place de Genève , fêtait son dernier jour de travail avec ses collègues , quand il a glissé dans la conversation que la destination de ses deux semaines de repos mérité était les Etats - Unis .
Il est alors immédiatement convoqué par son directeur qui lui conseille avec insistance d'annuler son séjour .
La raison est simple .
Il y aurait trop de risques , pour un banquier suisse , de se faire interpeller par le fisc américain , même lors d'un voyage privé .
Entre les lignes , le directeur fait comprendre à André que s'il passe outre ces recommandations , c'est à ses risques et périls .
Le banquier obtempère .
Billets d'avion , chambre d'hôtel , location de voiture , il annule tout , prend les frais à sa charge .
La recommandation de ne plus voyager aux Etats - Unis est en fait devenue presque une règle dans de nombreuses banques suisses .
Elle a souvent été faite par une simple circulaire interne , parfois , il y a plusieurs mois .
Ces mesures font partie des dommages collatéraux du scandale UBS .
La première banque suisse se voit réclamer les données personnelles de 4 450 comptes bancaires non déclarés de ressortissants américains .
En 2007 , à la suite des révélations d'un ex-gestionnaire de fortune de l'établissement , il a été découvert que 80 banquiers se rendaient régulièrement aux Etats - Unis , parfois déguisés en touristes , pour favoriser l'évasion fiscale de riches clients américains ( Le Monde du 28 août ) .
Au printemps , le chef de la division UBS Wealth Management Business for America's , aujourd ' hui licencié , a été interpellé à l'aéroport de Miami , afin d'être auditionné comme témoin dans le cadre du litige fiscal qui oppose sa banque aux Etats - Unis .
A UBS , dès avril , il a été interdit à 1 000 conseillers clientèle de se rendre outre-Atlantique .
" Filature "
Les banquiers suisses semblent aussi prendre de plus en plus de précautions lors de leurs déplacements en France et en Allemagne .
En particulier depuis le lancement de la croisade contre les " évadés fiscaux " du ministre français du budget , Eric Woerth , qui affirme disposer d'une liste de 3 000 noms .
Selon un avocat , des contrôles ont lieu dans les hôtels parisiens où descendent les banquiers .
" Je n'exclus pas que certains gestionnaires de fortune soient pris en filature " , dit -il .
En mars , le Financial Times avait déjà indiqué que plusieurs banques privées helvétiques avaient interdit à leurs collaborateurs de voyager à l'étranger , voulant " éviter que certains d'entre eux soient harcelés par les justices française ou allemande " .
L'association des banquiers suisses , SwissBanking , assure de son côté qu'il n'existe pas de consigne générale .
" C'est du cas par cas , chaque banque prend les mesures qui lui semblent les plus appropriées par rapport à sa clientèle et ses marchés " , explique - t - on .
André , lui , n'a pas osé révéler à son entourage qu'il avait annulé ses vacances .
Avec son épouse , ils se sont contentés d'une destination moins lointaine : l'Irlande .

The proposed denial of any Social Security cost - of - living adjustment for 2010 by the Social Security Administration , for the first time in thirty - five years , represents nothing less than the betrayal of America 's elderly by the very agency charged with protecting us .
The alleged reason for that denial , the lack of any significant rise in the consumer price index , is specious at best and dishonest at worst .
The elderly are not able to spend their very limited incomes in the same way younger people do , but rather must use their funds to purchase items whose cost has been rising much faster than the general inflation rate .
For example , the average senior spends over $ 4,000 annually , out of pocket , on health care , the cost of which has been rising at double digit annual rates for decades , continuing to increase currently .
Yet , the elderly spend less than the American average on gasoline , since they drive far fewer miles -- but the major factor holding down inflation as measured by the consumer price index has been temporarily - lower energy costs .
Thus , seniors are spending considerably more of their incomes on items whose costs have in fact risen during 2009 , such as food and higher property taxes and fees in many areas of the country .
For the elderly , 2009 was one more year of inflation , continuing into 2010 .
Speaking as an economist , it is very clear that the real income and purchasing power of America 's elderly have been damaged by many aspects of the ongoing recession , such as drops in retirement plan values and payouts , loss of jobs which many seniors held , and the effects of the severe problems with housing and the housing market .
Speaking as the former operator of an old age home in Vermont , as well as board member of a Meals on Wheels program there , I have seen firsthand the struggle of so many seniors to even survive financially .
Speaking as a senior myself , I find it absolutely unconscionable and intolerable to freeze our limited social security payments while our government bails out the banks , giant corporations , and other recipients of well over a trillion dollars of government largesse .
America , as a humane nation , should not show more concern for the wealthy than it does for those who have spent their lives helping to build our country .

The 2009 - 10 NCAA basketball season is right around the corner and freshman recruits across the nation are on the verge of stepping onto the college courts for the first time .
Many of which are playing under scholarships and fulfilling their dreams .
One of those players is doing so in November against more odds than you can imagine .
The player , Kevin Laue , has only one arm .
And no i’m not referring to some sort of ‘ special ’ college league for handicapped players .
I ’m talking about the NCAA Division I that every player dreams of playing in as they grow up .
The Globe and Mail had this to say about Kevin Laue today :
Kevin Laue is n’t supposed to be here , standing on the court practising for his first season of Division I basketball in the United States .
Born without a left hand , the 6 - foot - 11 centre from Pleasanton , Calif. , is now a freshman at Manhattan College , having earned a scholarship to play for the Jaspers and a chance to live out the dream of anyone who has been told they could n’t play a sport they loved because of a physical defect .
When the Jaspers ’ season opens Nov. 14 , the question will not be whether Mr. Laue can dribble , pass , block , score or rebound , but whether his opponents will underestimate his skills .
“ It ’s to my advantage , ” said Mr. Laue , explaining what it ’s like to come onto the floor during a game and face his two - handed opponents .
“ They think they ’re going to have an easy game and just whip on some one - handed kid .
But I think I ’ve surprised a couple people out there . ”
Personally , I ca n’t wait to see the looks on his opponents faces when he rips a board over them , leaves them hung out to dry in the post , or spots up for a made jump shot right in their face .
Check out this video clip of Laue playing the game he loves :

Close your eyes - not right away , but when you 've got to the end of this sentence - and try to picture a world without you in it .
How was that ?
If you were being brutally honest , everything and everyone would probably look almost precisely the same , except someone else would be sitting at your desk at work , sleeping with your partner , or rifling through your DVD collection - which is n't even yours any more .
It 's theirs .
And look at some of the crap they 've bought .
A Director 's Cut , anniversary edition of St Elmo's Fire ?
Jesus .
Anyway , if a world minus you is depressing , a world minus everyone is worse .
Which is why it 's weird that someone 's made an entire TV series about it : Life After People ( Sun , 9 pm , History Channel ) , which details what would happen if everyone on the planet disappeared tomorrow .
Yes , disappeared .
The programme spends precisely zero time whatsoever speculating on what might have wiped us out .
We 've just buggered off somewhere .
Migrated .
Deleted ourselves from history , leaving no trace behind .
Perhaps we had to leave in a hurry before some intergalactic cops turned up and started asking difficult questions about our human rights record .
Because we 've merely scarpered there are n't billions of our bodies littering the streets , as you might expect following a more traditional apocalypse .
Fortunately , we have left an almighty mess behind , and it's this detritus the series concentrates on .
Episode one is devoted to exploring what might happen to all our previous bids at immortality : mummified bodies , cryogenically frozen corpses , timeless artworks , etc .
Turns out we 're startlingly transient .
Take the mummies .
They 've survived for over 3,000 years , but because there 's no power any more , they quickly start to decay in earnest in their plexiglass museum display cabinets .
In Moscow , the embalmed corpse of Lenin shrivels until he resembles an anorexic , tannin - stained Gollum .
In California , the cryogenically frozen bodies of movie moguls dribble into mulch .
Immortal ?
Ha !
In your face , suckers !
Upstairs , the ( abandoned ) International Space Station still pointlessly orbits the Earth .
Onboard is an Immortality Drive containing the digitised DNA sequences of an eclectic bunch of people including Stephen Hawking , Stephen Colbert , and a Playboy model called Jo Garcia ( this , astonishingly , is true ) .
A species of highly intelligent aliens might come along and replicate it , thus ensuring the survival of both the human species and The Colbert Report .
But they do n't .
Instead , after several decades , the station plummets to Earth , burning up on re-entry and presumably killing a few hundred toucans as it smashes into an overgrown Times Square .
The show goes on to explain in sobering detail just how little mark even the greatest of us can hope to make .
We see Michelangelo 's Sistine Chapel fresco crumble into bits .
We also see skyscrapers buckle , bridges tumble , ships sink , and the Houston Astrodome collapse inwards like a depressed meringue .
The remains of cities are hidden beneath a carpet of vegetation .
There 's nothing left .
Even Bruce Forsyth 's dead .
Cleverly , for a show about unremitting atrophy , they 've reframed the slow decay of everything the human race ever achieved as an exciting contest .
Apparently this is n't a depressing look at how quickly civilisation might putrefy into nothing , but a " race to see what survives " .
The answer , unfortunately , is " almost nothing " .
Apart from a few human fossils lying deep beneath the ground , waiting to entertain the viewers of a future alien episode of Time Team , about a million years after we 've gone , there 's no sign we were even here .
But do I care ?
Not much .
It 's hard to give a shit about what happens to a flat after you 've moved out , let alone a planet .
Besides , if I want to see what happens when humans fail to perform basic maintenance on a day - to - day basis , I do n't need a million - dollar CGI recreation .
I can just walk round my flat .
Now that 's a proper shithole .
The Federal Department of Transportation has issued an " urgent " warning to owners of several Toyota and Lexus models , strongly advising them to remove the floor mats on the driver 's side to prevent the accelerator pedal from sticking .
Issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) , the advisory notice urges that drivers not replace the mats with anything else .
U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood called the recall “ an urgent matter . ”
Two weeks ago , the company ordered dealers to inspect all cars for mismatched floor mats after a fatal crash in late August , in which an occupant of a runaway 2009 Lexus ES called 911 to report a stuck accelerator pedal and non-functioning brakes .
Four occupants died when that car subsequently crashed , rolled over , and burned .
The cause of that crash was suspected to be an accessory floor mats fitted at the dealership that were too large for the vehicle .
Toyota has reportedly agreed to recall up to 3.8 million vehicles to check for the problem ; it will be the biggest recall in the company 's history .
The vehicles affected are :
2007 - 2010 Toyota Camry ( sedan )
2005 - 2010 Toyota Avalon ( sedan )
2004 -2009 Toyota Prius ( hatchback )
2005 - 2010 Toyota Tacoma ( pickup truck )
2007 - 2010 Toyota Tundra ( pickup truck )
2007 - 2010 Lexus ES350 ( sedan )
2006 - 2010 Lexus IS250 and IS350 ( sedan )
[ UPDATE : On Wednesday , September 30 , Toyota spokesperson Wade Hoyt distributed the following notice : Despite widespread reporting to the contrary , this is not yet a recall , but a safety advisory to owners of affected models .
Our engineers are working with NHTSA on a potential fix beyond the retention hooks that are already in the vehicles .
A statement from the company added : Toyota considers this a critical matter and will soon launch a safety campaign on specific Toyota and Lexus vehicles .
Throughout the process of developing the details of the action plan , it will advise the NHTSA .
Until Toyota develops a remedy , it is asking owners of specific Toyota and Lexus models to take out any removable driver ’s floor mat and NOT replace it with any other floor mat . ]
Toyota has already conducted one recall for a similar problem , but limited to an accessory all - weather floor mat fitted to the 2007 and 2008 Lexus ES 350 and Toyota Camry .
The new list of cars is far more comprehensive .
“ For everyone ’s sake , " LaHood said , " we strongly urge owners of these vehicles to remove mats or other obstacles that could lead to unintended acceleration . ”
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 's Hotline is ( 888 ) 327-4236 .
Toyota owners can reach the company 's Experience Center at ( 800 ) 331-4331 ; Lexus owners can contact the Lexus Customer Assistance Center at ( 800 ) 255-3987 .
We 'll bring you more information as we get it .

Tens of thousands of fresh American troops are now on the move in Afghanistan , led by a new commander and armed with a counterinsurgency plan that builds on the lessons of Iraq .
But can U.S. forces succeed in a land long known as the “ graveyard of empires ” ?
FRONTLINE producers Martin Smith ( Beyond Baghdad , Return of the Taliban ) and Marcela Gaviria ( In Search of Al Qaeda , The War Briefing ) once again make the dangerous journey to the front lines of America ’s biggest fight .
Through interviews with the top U.S. commanders on the ground , embeds with U.S. forces and fresh reporting from Washington , Smith and Gaviria examine U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan — a fight that promises to be longer and more costly than most Americans understand .

More than 140,000 , and even then they ’re not very good at it .
For this , now acute , problem , blame the politicians
Eyevine
IT IS bad enough that Mexico 's economy is in deep recession , triggered by its close links to the ailing United States .
To make matters worse , the country 's oil industry , its fiscal cash - cow for the past three decades , is declining swiftly ( see chart ) .
As recently as 2004 Cantarell , the country 's main offshore field , produced 2.1 m barrels per day ( b/d ) of crude .
Now its output is just 600,000 b/d .
There are no obvious replacements : 23 of the 32 biggest fields are in decline .
Barring big new finds , the world 's seventh - largest oil producer is forecast to become a net importer by 2017 .
The Mexican treasury is ill - prepared for this .
Taxes and royalties from Pemex , the state - owned oil monopoly , have accounted for almost two - fifths of federal revenues in recent years , compensating for one of Latin America 's weakest tax regimes ( which collects just 11 % of GDP ) .
If oil output drops below 2 m b/d , as many industry - watchers fear , the government would be forced to cut spending by more than 10 % — or jack up taxes correspondingly , to avoid an unsustainable budget deficit .
This might threaten economic recovery .
There is no mystery behind the decline .
The constitution bans private investment in hydrocarbons .
Ever since Lázaro Cárdenas expropriated foreign oil companies in 1938 , the state oil monopoly has been seen by many politicians , especially from the formerly ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) and its offshoots , as the untouchable bone marrow of Mexican sovereignty .
To make matters worse , Pemex has been run more in the interests of its workers and their trade unions than of the Mexican people , its notional owners .
All this has curbed the country 's ability to capitalise on its geological wealth .
Since many oil - exploration projects take longer than the six - year presidential term to bear fruit , the politicians have a powerful incentive to spend oil revenues rather than reinvest them .
From 1983 to 2000 Pemex 's annual investment budget was a paltry $ 3 billion .
Until recently Cantarell 's bounty disguised this .
After the conservative National Action Party ( PAN ) broke the PRI 's seven - decade grip on power in 2000 , Pemex started to invest more .
But higher labour and equipment costs absorbed much of the increase .
Much of the new money was ploughed into Chicontepec , a project in the state of Veracruz that Pemex hoped would replace Cantarell .
But this is yielding just 29,000 b/d so far .
Opportunity beckons beneath the deeper waters of the Gulf of Mexico , where some 50 billion barrels of oil are thought to rest .
In the American part of the Gulf , 300 or so deepwater wells are drilled each year .
Last month Britain's BP found a big new field ( with perhaps 3 billion barrels ) there .
Pemex has drilled just ten deepwater wells , but found little oil .
It lacks the expertise , technology and capital it needs .
Even if Mexico allowed private companies to explore for oil , they would have to invest $ 10 billion a year to halt the decline in output , reckons David Shields , who edits a specialist magazine on Mexican oil .
Under today 's law , in which private firms can only act as service providers for Pemex , that investment would be much higher , he says .
Felipe Calderón , the president , has tried to address the problem .
A law approved last year is supposed to make Pemex more agile , by appointing independent directors and separating its contracts from government - procurement procedures .
But to gain the opposition 's votes in Congress he dropped a key proposal that would have allowed contract prices to vary according to the success or failure of exploration .
Pemex will be able to pay extra in some circumstances , but is explicitly barred from linking these incentives to production .
To implement this vaguely worded legislation , Mr Calderón last month appointed Juan José Suárez Coppel to head Pemex .
He was once its finance director , and has private - sector experience .
His job will be to pilot the negotiations with private oil - service firms .
The government has not yet published guidelines for these contracts , and no deals are expected until next year .
Few are optimistic about them .
“ Companies are used to calling things by their names , ” says Luis Miguel Labardini , an energy consultant .
“ This game of syntax , of finding a semantic formula to match ‘ productivity improvements ' or ‘ cost efficiencies ' to output , is going to be too much for them . ”
Mr Calderón last month called for a second energy reform .
Much could be done even without changing the constitution , by linking the value of service contracts to production and slimming Pemex , where the payroll of 143,000 is at least 30,000 too big .
But it is hard to see discussion on a new law before the previous one has even been implemented , and harder still to foresee its approval , since the PRI and its allies gained a majority in the lower house of Congress in a mid-term election in July .
Some PRI leaders have ties to the oil workers ' union .
And big lay - offs in the trough of recession would anyway be politically toxic .
Sooner or later fiscal reality will force change .
But by then the oil age may be over .
As you might know , we were recently invited to give a talk at GDC Austin about our PR strategy , which is essentially to be as open and transparent as possible .
As promised here are the slides from the lecture !
Below is a quick summary of the hour - long talk .
Part I : The Philosophy
PR is defined as the art of controlling information flow between a company and the outside world .
Wolfire says that when you 're a teeny tiny company trying to produce a game using your own IP in the noisy and crowded sea of the internet , the only reasonable move is to maximize this flow of information .
Swallow your pride and acknowledge that you are not EA or Activision , so you should n't think like them when it comes to PR .
Opening up makes it easier to do 3 important things :
- Making noise
The big guys tend to guard their updates carefully , rarely leaking new information about their game .
When they do , it 's very controlled and polished .
This strategy may make sense when you are so big that even a small leak of information means multiple Digg front - page stories and coverage by news sites everywhere .
For indies though , your carefully packaged press release would likely fall into obscurity .
This means that you need to get creative , experiment , and make noise often .
Since it 's hard to predict what will blow up and what wo n't , the more insights you share the better your chances are of getting people 's attention .
Some of our most popular posts were spur of the moment articles that we almost felt bad for firing .
Jeff 's " Always initialize your memory " post for example surprised us all when it became popular organically on Reddit .
Remember that the upside is huge and the downside is small .
The only thing you stand to lose is your time if you sink hours into a post that does n't earn you any recognition .
The good news is that if a PR attempt fails , no one will see it so you do n't have to feel embarrassed ( EA does n't have this luxury ) .
Since almost everything applies to games , there are lots of different things you can share .
- Making friends
An important part of open development is reaching out to other people in the industry .
Contact other indies , they are your allies not your rivals .
You also want to reach out to press contacts and distributors .
Cold emails are always tough , so do n't get discouraged .
One of the first things I did at Wolfire was spend a month collecting over 300 emails in preparation for announcing Overgrowth .
Jeff even made me a mass emailer program to facilitate the press wave .
Out of all the people we emailed , we only got about 10 responses .
Granted each of those 10 was a big deal for us , but the poor conversion ratio was a strong reminder of how small and insignificant we were in the noisy realm of the internet .
Similarly when we decided we wanted to get on Steam , I cold emailed them .
When I got no response , I emailed them again .
Several emails later we finally got a response .
Meeting people in person is extremely valuable .
No matter where you are , you should try to get involved in your local game developer scene .
Raiding conferences is also a great way to meet people .
I recommend having a box of business cards , an iPod touch with some videos of your game on it and a company shirt ( bagpipes are optional ) .
One of my favorite tactics is to follow fancy cameras on the show floor , because where there 's a camera there 's a gaming news reporter .
The press are usually very busy but they also tend to be very friendly .
To a certain extent indie games represent a chance to find out about the next big thing before it hits mainstream so do n't be bashful , say hello .
You never know who you 'll meet and meeting people in person turns cold emails into warmer ones .
- Building a community
The best way to build a community is to facilitate communication .
Create ways for you to talk to fans , for fans to talk to fans and also for fans to talk to you .
It 's easy to think that you might be overwhelmed by visitors to your site if you allow everyone to contact you directly , however this is a great problem to have and most indies that are just starting out are not lucky enough to have this problem .
There are also a few design choices you can make that can foster a community .
Jeff already pointed out in his post about supporting Mac OS X and Linux why cross platform development is such a good idea for indies .
Another design choice that will facilitate a community is the incorporation mod support .
If you give players access to the same engine tools you use yourself , you allow them to create content which can make the game more fun for everyone .
Start early .
Starting from zero is tough , so get it out of the way now .
The earlier you start the more seeds you can plant by launch .
Part II : Onsite PR implementation
- Blog
The blog is your rock and your most effective tool for sharing your development process with the world .
It is extremely versatile and all the original content you produce for your blog can be echoed out to your other pages .
Tips :
Use pictures / videos , keep it short , encourage discussion , embed Disqus , conspicuous subscriber buttons , make blog posts often
- Forums
The forums offer a place for visitors to share their thoughts .
Unlike the blog which you have to power yourself , the forums are largely fan - run .
They provide a great medium to share information and solutions to problems that may arise .
They also allow for the sharing of creative ideas and mods .
Tips :
Seed the forums with appropriate topics .
Try not to crack down to hard on anyone or you may find yourself in the middle of a flame war .
- IRC channel
Wolfire 's public IRC channel is kind of like the forums in live chat form .
Multiple devs can idle there at once and questions can be crowd sourced .
It was in our IRC channel that Silverfish first introduced us to ModDB .
Tips : Mibbit allows for IRC access through the browser , Rabbot posts new blog posts in the chat so that IRC idlers can get first crack at reading and responding to blog posts .
- Live chat
We use a Meebo live chat widget to provide an easy way for visitors to talk to us .
It 's easier than sending an email so it encourages more people to contact us .
All sorts of visitors stop by from Lugaru fans , to press contacts , to online distributors .
There are many reasons why we have a live chat widget as detailed in this blog post .
Tips :
Always be polite and helpful because there 's no way to tell for sure who is visiting , epic troll moments can turn into fun blog posts .
- Google App Engine and Amazon Cloud Front
Prepare for big traffic before it happens .
It would be sad to do everything right and have tons of people coming to your site to buy your game only to have your server down .
We use Amazon CloudFront and Google App Engine to host our site .
This basically guarantees that your website can scale , and will not fail when you need it most .
We participated in the MacHeist Giving Tree a while ago , which drew a lot of attention to Lugaru .
When the Giving Tree was unveiled , we experienced a sudden spike that generated about 30 visits / second .
While many of the websites of the other participating apps featured were immediately destroyed ( even the Giving Tree site itself at some points ) , our website kept up without breaking a sweat .
Tips :
Do it now !
Part III : Offsite PR Implementation
- ModDB
ModDB is a very indie friendly collection of all video games and their mods .
It 's a great place to add your game and keep people updated on its status .
If the ModDB staff like your news update , they will promote it to the front page .
Many people use it as a news site and keep track of gaming news .
It is a surprisingly large site and the community is awesome .
Some ModDB visitors have already started modding Overgrowth before it is even released .
Tips : Decorate your page to draw attention to it , update often with high quality content to attract people
- YouTube
YouTube is the best place to host your videos .
Originally we used Vimeo because they were the first to support HD content .
However , Vimeo kicked us out .
They are famously anti-video games and have given other people the boot as well , most notably , the lovable 2dboy .
YouTube has HD now and an absurd number of useful features these days .
The most valuable thing about YouTube is that people can easily subscribe to your channel and YouTube will funnel more viewers onto your pages by cross-pollinating your video with other related videos .
Tips :
Add a link to your YouTube channel in your videos so people can subscribe to you
- Facebook
A Facebook page gives you a secondary location to host your blog posts , pictures and HD videos .
Facebook is the biggest social network and is designed to be as viral as possible .
Whenever someone interacts with your page , the activity is splashed around to his or her friends .
This helps people spread the word organically and can cause pretty substantial chain reactions .
However , a Facebook page needs nurturing .
Originally our page was cold and sterile but overtime it has gradually grown into its own community , and now there is always a discussion going on there .
Tips :
Feed your blog onto your page 's notes , upload videos and photos individually to the wall so that they are more conspicuous
- Twitter
Twitter seemed pretty dubious at first .
However , more and more people have started following us and now its value is hard to dispute .
Twitter is unique from other pages because it offers a good medium for you to meet your peers in the industry in addition to accumulating fans .
Twitter is at worst an alternative to your blog 's RSS feed , but at best , it 's a great way to keep people up to date more rapidly and lets you communicate with tons of other game developers .
Tips :
Do n't just link to yourself like an RSS bot , use Twitter to communicate with people
- Steam Group
Your Steam group offers a great way to introduce your game to the Steam community .
Groups have amenities like screenshots and avatars that you can upload to add some flair to your page .
The Whale Man avatar was quite a hit .
However , the main asset of Steam groups is the chat room that acts like a public IRC channel tied directly to your game .
Because most people on Steam are active gamers looking to purchase games , this PR is extremely well targeted .
Tips : Idle in your Steam group 's chat room so you can meet visitors and answer their questions , offer visitors avatars , you can post important blog posts as announcements
- GamesPress
GamesPress helps us auto feed our content onto certain sites .
It has been great for getting our videos onto IGN , Gamespot , GameTrailers and G4 .
Even if you upload pictures of a pumpkin with the company logo carved in it getting set on fire with a propane torch , Games Press will get it streamed to a few sites .
Tips : just post it , you never know whose attention you 'll get
- GameTrailers
GameTrailers is the biggest game video site out there .
It 's a constant stream of videos that people watch like TV , so when they post your video , it will immediately get thousands of views .
Tips : Upload videos often , do n't get discouraged if people mistake your early work for the final product , they 'll catch on eventually as they see more videos .
Conclusion
What 's more interesting : a finished asset or an entire timelapse showing you everything from the initial strokes to the final product ?
If you can see the appeal of a timelapse , you should also be able to see the appeal of open development .
There is often a PR lull for a game between when it is announced and when it is ready for preview .
It makes sense that news sites probably can't entertain their readers with your latest plant shader updates .
However , such updates are interesting news to your community , so do n't sit on your hands , keep showing what you 've got .
Finally remember to stay agile .
The gaming industry is already moving at the speed of Moore 's law and web based PR tools seem to be moving faster than that .
As a small agile company you 'll have the chance to be a first adopter on the next big thing .
The push for new Internet surveillance capabilities – dubbed the " lawful access " initiative – dates back to 1999 , when government officials began crafting proposals to institute new surveillance technologies within Canadian networks along with additional legal powers to access surveillance and subscriber information .
Over the past decade , lawful access has stalled despite public consultations , bills that have died on the order paper , and even a promise from former public safety minister Stockwell Day to avoid mandatory disclosure of personal information without court oversight .
Last June , current Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan tabled the latest lawful access legislative package .
Much like its predecessors , the bill establishes new surveillance requirements for Internet service providers .
In an about - face from the Day commitment however , it also features mandatory disclosure of customer information , including name , address , IP address , and email address upon request and without court oversight .
My weekly technology law column ( Toronto Star version , Ottawa Citizen version , homepage version ) notes that lawful access has long faced at least two significant barriers .
The first involves ISP costs associated with installing new equipment and responding to disclosure requests .
The government has attempted to address those concerns by promising to help pay the bills .
It plans to provide some funding for new equipment and , in a little noticed provision , has opened the door to paying ISPs for providing customer name and address information to law enforcement authorities .
The second barrier involves lingering questions about the need for lawful access .
Critics have pointed to the fact that Canadian law enforcement has successfully used the Internet in hundreds of investigations , including a high - profile Toronto terrorism case .
Moreover , the law already grants ISPs the options to disclose customer name and address information .
Van Loan argues that the changes are long overdue , pointing to a kidnapping case in Vancouver earlier this year as evidence of the need for legislative change .
In several interviews , he has described witnessing an emergency situation in which Vancouver police waited 36 hours to get the information they needed in order to obtain a warrant for customer name and address information .
While that makes for a powerful example , a more detailed investigation into the specifics of the case reveals that Van Loan 's rendition leaves out some important details .
Over the summer , I launched Access to Information requests with the Ministry of Public Safety , the RCMP , and the Vancouver Police Department , seeking further information on the kidnapping case .
Both Public Safety and the RCMP responded that they had no additional information to provide other than the transcripts of the minister 's interviews .
The Vancouver Police identified the case as a February kidnapping ( not March as suggested by Van Loan ) .
The suspect was ultimately arrested and the case is currently before the courts , therefore limiting the department 's ability to provide much detailed information .
However , in an admission that goes to the heart of Van Loan 's claims , a legal adviser disclosed that no ISP records were sought during the investigation .
In other words , the case the minister of public safety has presented as evidence of the need for mandatory disclosure of ISP customer records never involved a request for such records and yielded an arrest using the current law .
Without a doubt , society needs to ensure that police have the ability to deal with serious crime .
Yet , public concern about lawful access comes directly from privacy fears and the absence of compelling evidence that the current system has created serious barriers to police investigations .
The latest reliance on a case that did not even involve ISP records should only heighten skepticism about the government 's proposed lawful access reforms .
The Angels are still alive in the American League championship series , but you would n't know it from this Yankee page on the MLB website .
The site proclaims : " Congrats New York Yankees ! 2009 American League champs "
That 's the banner ad , beneath which MLB is selling Yankees gear affixed with the World Series logo , including T - shirts for $ 24.99 , caps for $ 35.99 and fleece for $ 69.99 .
-- Bill Shaikin
The Northern Territory Parliament has passed legislation to standardise fines and penalties for more than 70 acts and regulations ranging from planning to prostitution .
The Opposition 's justice spokeswoman , Jodeen Carney , voiced concerns about one change that sees the maximum penalty for begging increased from $ 500 to $ 6500 .
The begging law comes under Section 56 of the Summary Offences Act .
It states : " Any person who ... wanders abroad , or from house to house , or places himself in any public place , street , highway , court , or passage , to beg or gather alms , or causes or procures or encourages any child so to do ... shall be guilty of an offence . "
Other parts of the Section 56 , which will also incur fines up to $ 6500 , include being in possession of a " deleterious drug " or consorting with criminals .
Ms Carney yesterday said many of the increases in fines indicated the changes were a " revenue raising exercise by Government " .
But the bill was eventually passed into law unopposed late yesterday , with the Opposition saying it gave support in the end because there is a strong need to modernise the fines system .
The Labor Government says the penalties are being increased to meet inflation and maximums are just a guide for the courts .
The Government says 14 people have been fined for begging since 1992 .
They may look friendly and loveable , but the little Maltese terrier has joined the NSW government 's list of ill - tempered dogs .
The Maltese terrier was involved in 12 attacks on people across NSW in the July - September period , according to the latest Dog Attack Register .
It is the first time the dog has featured in the " top 20 attacking list " on the register launched in January .
" This is obviously a surprising outcome , but nonetheless a reminder that any dog has the potential to attack , regardless of breed , " Minister for Local Government Barbara Perry said today .
Another unexpected inclusion was the state 's most popular dog , the Labrador retriever , which was reportedly involved in 20 attacks from July to September .

Environmentalists fear oil is heading towards an area where whales breed A second attempt to stop oil pouring into Australian waters after a rig accident in the Timor Sea has failed .
It is almost two months since oil began flowing from the West Atlas drilling platform that lies about 200 km ( 125 miles ) off the West Australian coast .
The rig 's operators have said that plugging the leak is an " extraordinarily complex " task .
Environmental groups have warned that the slick is threatening wildlife , including endangered turtles .
Conservationists have said this is Australia 's most damaging oil spill in 25 years .
Each day for almost two months , hundreds of barrels have been flowing into the Timor Sea , although officials have conceded that it is impossible to know just how much oil has been spilt .
The slick is about 160 km from the Western Australian mainland , and slightly further from the Indonesian coast .
Two attempts to plug the leak have failed .
Engineers have tried to cap a small hole 25 cm wide that lies deep beneath the seabed .
Extraordinary difficulty
They are expected to have another go towards the end of the week .
Scott Ludlam , a Senator for the Australian Greens , says it is a complex task .
" It underlines the extraordinary difficulty that they are facing in plugging the well , " he said of the latest failure .
" They are trying to hit a needle in a haystack 2.5 k m below sea level .
So , it is not surprising , I suppose , that they 've failed to plug the well on their second attempt .
" This is the worst oil spill in Australian waters since the mid-1980s and it really does not give us high hopes for the huge expansion of the oil and gas industry that is planned in the region , " he added .
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has said the flow of oil from the damaged well appears to be slowing .
Boats have been spraying chemicals to help disperse the slick and stop it spreading .
A spokeswoman has insisted that the impact on wildlife had been minimal .
Environmentalists , however , worry about the long - term effects of contamination on vulnerable marine species , including flat - back turtles , dolphins and whales .

There are times when I wonder whether we 're really living in the 21st century .
I 've been having that feeling a lot recently , observing other parents ( both online and off ) discuss whether or not getting the H1N1 " Swine Flu " vaccine for their kids is a good idea .
I 'm going to put it to you straight : Unless your child has a specific condition that makes it a bad idea for them to have the vaccine ( and your pediatrician should be able to tell you if that 's the case ) , yes , you absolutely should get him / her vaccinated against H1N1 .
One of those conditions is a severe allergy to eggs , because in years past , all flu vaccines were based in egg serum .
This year , some vaccine production will use a cell - culture process instead and thus be safe for those with egg allergies ; your pediatrician might be able to help ensure that a dose of that variety is available for your child if necessary .
You may have read or seen various members of the " antivax " crowd saying that the H1N1 vaccine is as evil as they think most other vaccines are .
Phil Plait , the Bad Astronomer , wrote an excellent article in August about these claims .
Suffice it to say , any risk there may be of getting sick from the vaccine is so infinitesimal that the risk of getting H1N1 far , far outweighs it .
Any time you see something written by one of the antivaxxers , consider whether the source is using scientific reasoning or not , because most of the time you 'll find their arguments hold less water than a sieve .
So please , for your kids ' sake , for your sake , and for the sake of your kids ' classmates , get your kids vaccinated against H1N1 .
__Update : __There is a lot of misinformation floating around about the vaccine containing live virus .
It is true that the nasal " FluMist " version of the vaccine does contain a form of the live virus that has been modified in the lab so it cannot infect anyone .
To be on the safe side , the CDC does recommend that pregnant women , very young children and people with compromised immune systems not receive the nasal vaccine .
The shot form of the vaccine contains only dead virus , thus is incapable of infecting anyone at all .
The CDC 's website has a great deal of information for anyone with concerns .

Kate Lambert recalls using her library card just once or twice throughout her childhood .
Now , she uses it several times a month .
The lure ?
Electronic books she can download to her laptop .
Beginning earlier this year , Ms. Lambert , a 19 - year - old community college student in New Port Richey , Fla. , borrowed volumes in the “ Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy ” series , “ The Lovely Bones ” by Alice Sebold and a vampire novel by Laurell K. Hamilton , without ever visiting an actual branch .
“ I can just go online and type my library card number in and look through all the books that they have , ” said Ms. Lambert , who usually downloads from the comfort of her bedroom .
And , she added , “ It ’s all for free . ”
Eager to attract digitally savvy patrons and capitalize on the growing popularity of electronic readers , public libraries across the country are expanding collections of books that reside on servers rather than shelves .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
Up to a third of children and adolescents who took common antipsychotic drugs for the first time became overweight or obese in as little as 11 weeks , raising their risk for diabetes and heart disease , U.S. researchers said on Tuesday .

They said doctors who prescribe antipsychotics to children should carefully consider the benefits against the risks , and keep close watch on children taking the drugs .
“ These data confirm prior findings that children and adolescents are highly vulnerable to antipsychotic medication , ” Dr. Christopher Varley and Dr. Jon McClellan of the Seattle Children ’s Hospital wrote in a commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
“ These results challenge the widespread use of atypical antipsychotic medications in youth , ” they wrote .
Dr. Monica Michell , a child psychiatrist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York who was not involved with the study , said it “ cautions us and underscores the long - term potential harm that these medicines can do . ”
“ For children who are not psychotic or bipolar , these medicines should be a last resort , ” she said by email .
The study looked at four of the most common antipsychotic drugs used in children -- Johnson & Johnson ’s Risperdal or risperidone , Eli Lilly ’s Zyprexa or olanzapine , Bristol - Myers Squibb ’s Abilify or aripiprazole and AstraZeneca ’s Seroquel or quetiapine .
A team led by Dr. Christoph Correll of Zucker Hillside Hospital and the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in New York studied 272 children and teens aged 4 to 19 with bipolar disorder , schizophrenia and disruptive or aggressive behavior spectrum disorders .
After roughly 11 weeks , those who took Zyprexa gained an average of 18.7 pounds ( 8.5 kg ) , those on Seroquel gained 13.4 pounds ( 6.1 kg ) , those on Risperdal gained 11.7 pounds ( 3.5 kg ) and those on Abilify gained 9.7 pounds ( 4.4 kg ) .
Altogether , 10 percent to 36 percent of patients became overweight or obese within 11 weeks .
“ The weight gain is dramatic , rapid and pervasive , ” Correll said in a telephone interview .
Even so , he said , not all of the drugs performed the same .
Children who took Zyprexa had the most dramatic weight gain and the biggest changes in metabolic factors such as blood sugar , cholesterol , and triglycerides , which can cause heart problems and diabetes .
Abilify , a drug that is usually not linked with weight gain in adults , did cause children to gain weight , but did not raise cholesterol or blood sugar levels .
Correll hopes to conduct more research to determine what caused these differences .
“ We will look at genetics and look at blood samples to see what changed early on that predicted weight gain , ” he said .
Currently , only two atypical antipsychotics are approved for youth -- Risperdal and Abilify .
But in June , a Food and Drug Administration panel of experts backed wider use of Zyprexa , Seroquel and Pfizer ’s Geodon for children and teens .
At the time , many panel members expressed concern about rising sales of the drugs to young people and the lack of long - term safety studies .
They were especially worried about the chance the drugs might be misused to treat other conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
The FDA has yet to act on the panel ’s endorsement .
Last November , a panel of outside experts called on the FDA and other U.S. health agencies to study the long - term effects of prescribing antipsychotic drugs to children .
Zyprexa is Lilly ’s top - selling drug with sales of $ 4.7 billion last year .
Seroquel is the second - best seller for AstraZeneca with 2008 sales of $ 4.5 billion .
Americans spend millions each year searching for the right diet or exercise program -- all in an effort to shed some fat .
But there ’s one type of fat that most would probably like to hold on to : brown fat .
Instead of storing excess energy from food in lumps and bumps throughout the body -- like its well - known sister , white fat -- brown fat helps burn incoming calories .
Because its primary purpose is temperature regulation , brown fat cells are jam - packed with mitochondria , the powerhouses of cells .
This mitochondria - heavy design is well - suited to use high quantities of sugar , the body ’s fuel , and then release that energy in the form of heat .
This mechanism enables small and hibernating mammals , who ca n’t shiver , to stay warm in cold temperatures .
And it enables newborn humans , who have yet to develop layers of white fat , to stay warm after exiting the stable confines of the womb .

Until recently , only these two types of creatures were thought to even have brown fat .
Now researchers have found that adults do n’t , in fact , lose all of their brown fat to the creeping ubiquitousness of white fat ; with that finding , they ’ve launched a scramble to discover how the substance ’s fat - burning abilities could be harnessed for weight loss .
If brown fat is unleashed , it could potentially “ tickle ” the metabolism enough to make weight loss easier and more manageable , said Sven Enerback , a researcher at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and one of the scientists who discovered that brown fat persists in adults .
As is , once a person reduces his or her starting weight , the body begins to compensate for the loss by getting better gas mileage -- that is , burning fewer calories .
Enerback calculates that inserting only 50 to 100 grams of activated brown fat into a person could significantly increase their energy metabolism and eliminate 10 pounds of white fat a year .

However , these gains in metabolic rate can be achieved only if the brown fat is active .
“ When heat is not needed , the burner is off -- so we need to find good ways to activate it safely , ” he said .
The role of cold
Researchers are exploring various avenues through which to do this .
It ’s possible cold temperatures may play a role .
Already they ’ve learned in experiments exposing a variety of people to cold temperatures that healthy people tend to have more active brown fat than their less healthy , older or more overweight counterparts , said Dr. Aaron Cypess of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston .
But researchers are not sure whether the brown fat helped lead to better health or whether people in better health have more brown fat .
Further investigation will need to determine whether brown fat actually plays a protective role against obesity .

“ First , we need to know the significance of brown fat function in human adults -- we can look at how to increase brown fat -- but first we need to understand it more , ” said Wouter van Marken Lichtenbelt , a professor of physiology at Maastricht University in the Netherlands and a co-discoverer of brown fat in adults .
Recently , a team of researchers led by Dr. Bruce Spiegelman , a professor of cell biology at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston , was able to increase brown fat stores in mice by turning immature muscle cells into brown fat cells , then transplanting these cells into adult mice .
Their findings were published July 29 in the journal Nature .
The brown fat made by the research team was able to actively burn off incoming caloric energy , Spiegelman said .
Though the study did not demonstrate whether the animals lost weight , he said , the researchers ’ next step will be to implant the engineered brown fat into obese mice to observe whether or not they get thinner .

Animal models in previous studies have already demonstrated how the elimination of brown fat in rodents leads to obesity , Spiegelman said .
So brown fat may have the potential to help humans in the same way , he added .
Future therapies
“ These findings open up another avenue for treatment , ” Enerback said .
“ It could be the first step toward a cell - based therapy for obesity . ”
This may even lead to drug treatments that would make it possible to activate brown fat and allow it to burn up incoming calories before white fat acts to store it in the body .

Not only are such therapies a long way off , however -- brown fat was discovered in human adults just a few months ago -- such interventions would likely be effective only if coupled with lifestyle changes such as exercise and diet , Enerback added .
Though the discovery of brown fat in humans has shed light on its potential as a weight - loss strategy , many questions remain unanswered .
To name a few : Can brown fat be activated in humans ?
Can more be implanted without causing serious side effects ?
Who naturally has more brown fat and why ?
With all these missing pieces , researchers predict a wait of about five to 10 years before potential brown fat interventions -- such as a brown fat pill or brown fat implants -- can be tested on humans .
But already the substance has changed how people should think about fat .

“ We have to navigate war torn areas and unmapped roads .

America 's thirst for oil is a gathering threat to its national security – and the risk will grow further as the world 's population touches 7 billion , a military adviser to the Pentagon told the Senate today .
In a second day of debate on energy , Democratic senators today pivoted from the economy to national security to try to make the case for a climate change bill .
The threat to Americans ' security ranged from the here and now – with troops in Afghanistan and Iraq tied down by their reliance on gas - guzzling equipment – to years into the future when extreme temperatures and rising sea levels could lead to a widespread social breakdown .
" We have never before on this planet had close to 7 billion people which we will have in 2011 .
We have never had the unprecedented level of per capita energy use multiplied by that 7 billion people , " Dennis McGinn , a member of the Military Advisory Board , composed of senior retired admirals and generals , told the Senate .
" We have a whole host of indicators , warnings and trends that tells us climate change is bad for national security . "
He said the country would face risks on multiple fronts .
" America 's current energy posture constitutes a serious and urgent threat to national security – militarily , diplomatically and economically . "
The Pentagon is already beginning to focus more acutely on the threat posed by climate change .
Military research labs are exploring new energy - saving devices , and other ways of conserving fuel in the battlefield .
The conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq have made planners acutely conscious that fuel dependence is putting US forces at risk .
The US marines corps recently ordered an energy audit of its operations in Afghanistan , in a bid to reduce enormous fuel costs .
" We are tied down by fuel .
Fuel is a real day - today concern for our forces in the field who are tethered to that fossil fuel tail , " said Kathleen Hicks , the deputy undersecretary of defence for strategy .
The US military is beginning to focus more intensely on the threat posed by climate change .
Hicks also told the Senate that global warming was emerging as a dangerous " accelerant " – fuelling conflicts and speeding the breakdown of fragile states .
It also created opportunities for extremist groups such as al - Qaida .
Progress on the climate change bill is seen as essential a to a successful outcome at the international meeting on carbon reduction in Copenhagen in December .
The White House has also stepped up its efforts to shepherd the bill through the Senate .
This week 's hearings , the formal start of the legislative process , were carefully coordinated with the White House .
Obama yesterday toured a solar facility in Florida and announced the award of some $ 3.5 bn ( £ 2.1 bn ) in grants to modernise America 's electrical grid .
Today , the White House sponsored a public forum on energy .
The White House and Democratic leaders are also trying to rally support around the climate change bill in the Senate – in part by bowing to Republican demands for a larger place for nuclear power .
Barbara Boxer , the co-author of the proposed legislation , said today she would press ahead to get her environment and public works committee for early approval of the draft – despite opposition from Republicans and even a powerful Democrat .
" I think there will be good news out of the committee this week , so stay tuned , " she said .
From the 26th floor of Boston ’s newest high - rise , residents are treated to a sweeping view encompassing the historic Bunker Hill monument , the gilded dome of the State House , the majestic Harbor Islands , and the jets alighting and ascending from the distant airport .
Just below , sailboats and rowing shells silently glide along the Charles River .
Despite the million - dollar vista , this is not the penthouse suite of a four - star hotel or a luxury condominium in the Back Bay .
It ’s the common room of a Boston University dorm , perhaps the most opulent residence hall to ever grace the local college landscape .
Name tags taped to students ’ doors say it all : “ Skyview from the Center of the BUniverse . ’’
“ Sometimes I miss the elevator because I ’m too busy looking out the window , ’’ said Rina Beyda , a junior from Los Angeles and one of just 14 students lucky enough to land a room on the 25th floor , the highest residential level .
The view is not the only amenity .
So luxurious is the 960 - bed dorm that parents ’ jaws dropped in disbelief when they helped their children move in last week .
The suites of singles and doubles , with elegantly furnished common rooms , large private baths , walk - in closets , and floor - length mirrors , resemble nothing like what older generations remember of their college housing - sterile cinder - block boxes with institutional bunk beds and a communal bathroom down the hall .
“ Life is tough , ’’ said Laurie Hanafin , as she pushed a large orange crate full of her daughter ’s belongings into her sixth - floor suite .
“ I ’m going back to college .
If there ’s a martini bar , I ’m staying . ’’
No martini bar - after all , most residents are underage .
But in addition to the panorama of the city skyline , students have access to a media lounge with a plasma TV for watching movies and playing video games .
Other amenities include soundproof piano rooms that allow students to practice without disturbing those studying in the 24 - hour reading room , which is outfitted with plush adjustable furniture befitting a first - class airport lounge .
The laundry room - with washers and dryers programmed to alert students via computer when they are available - overlooks the athletic field and stadium .
A trio of futuristic chandeliers hangs in the stairwell of the airy lobby .
Newly potted lady - finger palms and creeping ficus fill giant stainless steel planters .
“ Students want beauty , and they should have beauty , ’’ Kenneth Elmore , BU ’s dean of students , said during a tour of the dorm .

Last month , I posted about Johnathan Ayers , a pastor in Georgia who was killed by police who confronted him in the parking lot of a convenience store .
Police said the target of their investigation was a prostitute who had been in Ayers car shortly before the confrontation .
They say they shot Ayers because he struck an officer with his car .
The officers who confronted Ayers were in plain clothes , and emerged from a black , unmarked SUV .
Now the woman , who was later arrested on drug charges , is talking .
Kayla Barrett , a 26 - year - old admitted drug addict , says Ayers had no involvement in drug activity , had tried for several years to help her get her life straightened out , and was helping her get home and pay her rent on the day of his death .
She says she is n't a prostitute , has never been charged with that crime , and is refuting insinuation on some comment threads to news stories that Ayers was having an affair with her .
Barrett says she'd had a miscarriage 11 days before Ayers was killed , and was " not capable " of sex .
Here 's her account of the day Ayers died :
Barrett said Ayers saw her walking from the Exxon station across from the Shell station ( where he eventually was shot ) back toward Relax Inn , where she and her fiancé were staying .
Since she had experienced a miscarriage 11 days prior and she visibly was having difficulty walking , Barrett said Ayers offered her a ride back to the motel .
" I was in his car for probably about five to seven minutes — and it was probably 20 - 30 minutes before he got shot , " Barrett said .
" When I got in the car , I was telling him about my recent miscarriage , " she said .
Barrett said she was paying $ 30 per day to stay at Relax Inn and , on Sept. 1 , was three days behind .
Her fiancé , who was staying there with her , had hurt his back and was unable to work , she said .
She said they had been doing " odd jobs " and " yard work " to make money .
Barrett said she asked Ayers if he could help her out with the back rent , and that he gave " all the money he had on him " — $ 23 .
" His last words to me were I did n't owe him anything , " Barrett said .
" Probably 15 - 20 minutes after that I could hear the shots . "
Giving Barrett the last of his cash would explain why Ayers stopped off at the Exxon ATM in the moments before his death .
It is one of the safest cities in the world , but for teenage girls and young women , travelling on Tokyo's vast train and subway system comes with the ever - present risk of sexual harassment from fellow commuters .
But this week the Japanese capital 's police launched a crackdown on the scourge of groping .
In the first reported case , Tsutomu Yamane , 30 , was arrested with minutes of allegedly groping a 15 - year - old girl on Monday morning .
Undercover police officers have been dispatched to notorious train lines across Tokyo in a new offensive against chikan , a catch - all term that covers groping , sexual rubbing and surreptitious mobile phone photography .
The introduction almost a decade ago of women - only carriages during the morning and evening rush hours failed to put an end to Japan 's chikan plague , despite warnings that convicted gropers face up to six months in prison and a fine of up to 500,000 yen ( £ 3,300 ) .
Police in Tokyo make between 1,500 and 1,800 arrests a year , and have recorded more than 700 cases in the first six months of this year .
More than 50 % of victims are women in their 20s , and about a third are teenage girls .
According to one survey , nearly two - thirds of young women say they have been touched inappropriately in train or underground carriages .
Kimiko Kitagawa , a 31 - year - old business consultant , joined the long list of chikan victims as she stepped off a subway train near her office in central Tokyo earlier this year .
" I felt a hand grab my backside , but when I turned around there were several men rushing to get past , " she said .
" I had no way of knowing who had touched me . "
Confusion and embarrassment mean the number of groping incidents is suspected of being much higher than official reports suggest .
" Many victims are reluctant to come forward , as they feel too embarrassed , " a police spokesman told the Yomiuri newspaper .
" We are going to concentrate on the most serious cases . "
The crackdown came in response to a recent jump in cases involving groups of men who use online chat rooms to arrange where and when to target women .
At least 100 websites list prime groping locations , offering hints on how to fondle undetected and , if that does not work , evade arrest .
One site advises would - be gropers to select carriages with doors that open near platform escalators or staircases – perfect escape routes .
Several men arrested in recent months have admitted being encouraged by the websites and emboldened by the prospect of working as part of a group .
A typical tactic is to position two men in front and behind a victim , while as many as six other men block the view of other passengers .
The police are targeting nine railway lines in Tokyo where groping has become endemic , especially the Saikyo line , which takes commuters between Ikebukuro and Akabane in the capital 's suburbs .
Attempts to prosecute gropers , however , have been frustrated by cases in which women , often with the help of male accomplices , make have made false accusations in the hope of securing huge out - of - court settlements .
Men who are apprehended are usually found guilty .
The 2007 film , I Just Didn't Do
It , was based on the true story of a young man accused of groping who cleared his name after a five - year battle .
In another high - profile case , the supreme court last year acquitted a 63 - year - old professor of molesting a teenage girl in 2006 .
He had earlier been sentenced to 22 months in prison .

I can't help wondering :
Do you suppose Obama actually believed the insurance industry was on his side ?
I can't tell if they 're really surprised or just pretending .
But I do n't think anyone here was all that shocked by these developments :
As the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday approved a 10 - year , $ 829 billion bill to remake the health - care system , Obama 's top advisers and the insurers moved into a more intense stage of conflict .
" The insurance industry has decided to lead the charge against health reform , and everyone recognizes their motives : profits , " said White House deputy communications director Dan Pfeiffer .
" We are going to make sure they can't sink this effort at the last minute . "
Pfeiffer castigated the industry for releasing a report Monday that concluded that the finance panel 's bill would increase costs for consumers .
" They made themselves a very good foil , " he said .
The insurers , however , showed no sign of being chastened .
America 's Health Insurance Plans , an industry trade group , opened a fresh line of attack with a multistate advertising campaign warning that senior citizens enrolled in private Medicare plans could lose benefits under the legislation .
" Is it right to ask 10 million seniors on Medicare Advantage for more than their fair share ? " the television spot asks .
" Congress is proposing $ 100 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says many seniors will see cuts in benefits . "
The Finance Committee 's bill would reduce spending on the plans AHIP cites by $ 113 billion over the next decade , which could mean reduced insurer profits , higher co-payments by beneficiaries or fewer extra benefits such as eyeglasses and gym memberships .
" We want to begin to build an awareness of the potential implications to seniors , " said AHIP President Karen Ignagni .
She declined to say how much money would be spent on the commercials airing in six states , but one advertising analyst said the industry has enough cash to pose a serious threat .
" They can spend whatever they feel they need to influence this , " said Evan Tracey , president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group .
" Seniors are a very important group politically . "
The insurance sector and health maintenance organizations spent more than $ 116 million on lobbying in the first six months of this year , according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .
Analysis Yesterday the UK's arms industry launched its renewed pitch for more government money .
Shooting themselves in the foot somewhat , assembled weapons - biz kingpins revealed that - by their own estimation - the UK taxpayer is already supporting at least twice as many well - paid British arms workers as there are ( poorly - paid ) soldiers in the British army .
The revelations came at the Westminster launch on Tuesday of two reports from the Defence Industries Council ( DIC ) , the British armsbiz trade body .
According to the DIC :
The UK - based defence and security industry ... employs 300,000 people across the UK .
Sir Kevin Tebbit , once the top civilian official at the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) and now chairman of Finmeccanica UK ( parent company of the noted AgustaWestland helicopter plant ) , briefed reporters that 55,000 of these jobs " are linked to exports " .
Martin Faussett of Rolls Royce added that defence workers " are paid significantly more than average " .
That equates , of course , to approximately a quarter of a million well - paid UK armsbiz workers who have nothing to do with exports - in other words they live completely off the taxpayer , just the same as soldiers and civil servants .
But there are , apparently , a lot more of them : and civil servants ' pay is distinctly average , while soldiers ' pay is well below average .
In fact , the British army is budgeted to have 101,000 soldiers on the payroll .
Despite the fact that recruiting has improved lately , the army is still short of that figure by nearly 2,000 .
In general , fewer people apply to be soldiers than there are vacancies - and this is despite vigorous recruiting abroad and a serious rise in British unemployment .
It 's not so much the risk of being killed or wounded that puts would - be soldiers off - anyone who has met British troops knows that those who have n't been in action are usually keen to experience it , and in fact some Irish recruits have given the chance of fighting as an attraction for joining the British forces .
What might put some people off , though , is the fact that starting pay for a combat soldier is under £ 14,000 - less than you can get as a kitchen potwash boy .
Even as a veteran corporal years later , in charge of seven other men and enough firepower to blow up tanks or flatten small buildings , a soldier is still paid less than a police constable starts on .
Only as a sergeant , probably into his thirties - quite likely to be running a platoon of thirty men while training up a young officer to do so too - does a soldier start getting up to the average rates of pay enjoyed by the rest of us with our safe jobs back here in Blighty .
And do n't forget , we taxpayers are also coughing up for two or more arms workers per soldier , each paid , on average , more than we and the sergeant are .
As a final sting in the tail , our early - thirties sergeant is looking at compulsory retirement when he hits forty : there 's no job for life for him , and his pension - while nice in terms of bennies per year served - reflects the fact that he probably wo n't be allowed to keep working for the government until retirement age , the way teachers and coppers and other civil servants do .
And the soldier 's government lodgings may well be quite disgusting , even with all the millions currently being ploughed into improving them .
So it 's not too surprising that even the undeniable warrior spirit of old Blighty ( and Ireland , Fiji , South Africa etc. ) does n't furnish enough recruits for the British army - this despite the fact that we have actually cut it in size quite substantially in the last few years .
At the moment , meanwhile , we have 9,000 troops fighting in Afghanistan .
It 's a not - very - well - kept secret that our generals are arguing that this is a foolish number - enough to hurt us , but not enough to dominate much ground or get much done .
If Britain is to be in Afghanistan , they argue , it should take on the job seriously .
Over a few beers at a suburban bar , she told a police officer she needed two tickets , one for herself and one for her husband .
No price had been discussed , and Ms Finkelstein and her lawyer stopped short of recounting specifics of what was said before several officers sitting at a nearby table came to arrest her .
As a physician thoroughly frustrated with our State medical apparatus , I read a large number of opinion pieces and news articles on its perceived woes and proposals for its reform .
Though I have read some excellent works on these pages and at the Mises Institute site , the majority found in the popular media reek of economic ignorance and worship of the State .
Most private physicians knowingly groan when they encounter such garbage , and simply go about the business of their day caring for the sick in the often impossible system which they find themselves .
In sharp contrast , many in academic medicine and professional societies such as the AMA cheer , spread it amongst their colleagues , and write additional State - supporting propaganda , the latest of which to come to my attention was the proverbial straw for this camel , and from which I include a particularly remarkable quote :
“ It would be such a shame if we once again fail to cover the uninsured because of hang - ups over costs .
Physician decisions drive the majority of expenditures in the US health care system .
American health care costs will never be controlled until most physicians are no longer paid fees for specific services . ”
So begin the fantasies of yet another healthcare dictator in the making , proceeding to issue his decree specifying exactly which types of medical services should and should not be provided in this country .
At the stroke of his mighty pen , many common services demanded by patients are restricted or ( even better ) prohibited .
Today he limits his list to seven broad categories , including coronary bypass , angioplasty and stenting , prostate cancer screening and treatment , mammography , and CT / MRI ( which he interestingly refers to as “ art forms ” ) .
Tomorrow , who knows which unthinkable ways he will devise to save money for his benefactor the State .
Forget the decisions of millions of patients and physicians across the country , they ’re wrong , all wrong .
After all , unlike us common grunts providing the care he seeks to limit , he has the proper credentials !
He ’s used his medical degree to specialize in pathology , work as a professor , laboratory director , journal editor and now “ serves ” as President and Chair of the Board of The Lundberg Institute , named for himself , whose mission is to “ forge a patient - physician alliance based on trust , providing leadership , strategies , and communications that promote evidence - informed , efficient , and effective health care delivery to benefit the health and well - being of patients , physicians , and the public . ”
While possessing a truly impressive rsum in the academic world , it is woefully devoid of virtually any experience in that one often messy matter which is the essence of the profession : actual face - to - face contact with living , breathing patients .
To summarize , perfect for our newest Czar .
One would understandably be excused for choosing not to read his decree in full , but near its end we are blessed with another treat .
“ Academic medical centers should take the lead , rather than continuing to teach new doctors to ‘ take the money and run ’ . ”
Yup , yet again , he ’s spot on !
After all , that ’s the exact take - home message I got during my seven years of exhausting around - the - clock education and training at academic medical centers .
Ethics ?
Nope .
Squeeze those sick suckers for all they ’re worth , their health be damned !
Never mind that during most of those seven years my colleagues and I could have been pocketing six - figure salaries in law or six - plus - figure bonuses on Wall Street rather than accumulating education - related debt .
Maybe some physicians do n’t resent his ( and our President ’s ) accusations that we base our clinical practice decisions purely or even primarily on income , but I sure do .
While I agree that physicians commonly order tests and perform procedures that are medically unnecessary , this fact is due to two main reasons the author completely fails to mention : first , the tort system , which terrorizes doctors in their practices on a daily basis , and second , that patients have minimal if any financial stake in their care .
As a consequence , they demand everything in excess , and are often angry when we suggest a desired test or treatment is not indicated , no matter how much time we spend trying to educate them .
When people do n’t pay for something with their own money , they hardly care about costs .
They just milk others for all they ’re worth , because after all , that ’s what they perceive everybody else is doing to them , too .
Physicians have two options .
We either serve the patient , which increases costs primarily to the State ( for many physicians , it is the largest payor ) , or serve the State ( and insurance companies ) by limiting care and in so doing expose ourselves to increased customer ire and legal risk .
For most , the choice is easy .
Others , often rather conveniently insulated from such issues as customer preferences , anger , reimbursement , and legal risk , resort to utopian fantasy and contorted illogic to justify their servitude to the State , all while concealing their wolf - like aggression in the sheep ’s clothing of nonsensical platitudes such as the mission statement of the institute quoted earlier .
It is not our responsibility as physicians to deny access or limit desires , other than by informing patients of risks and benefits , sticking to our oath to do no harm , and by charging a fair price .
If someone wants to spend many thousands of dollars of their own money on larger breasts , that ’s their business .
Only they can judge if the money and the risk of surgical complications including anesthesia - related death is worth the benefit of a new bra size .
However you might disagree , you have no right to decide for them .
Incidentally , such cosmetic procedures are one of the few areas in medicine where costs have been driven ever lower as quality only improves .
The reason ?
Plastic surgeons generally only accept patients who actually pay the price they mutually agree upon , compared to the majority of physicians who must accept State - mandated rates ( and frequently no payment whatsoever ) in exchange for the “ benefit ” of additional paperwork , regulation , and clipboard - carrying overseers .
Essentially , free market vs. State market .
Referring back to the initial quote , if physicians are n’t paid fees for services , then what exactly should we be paid for instead , and by whom ?
A flat salary for providing “ healthcare ” from the State , or from some State authorized co-op or State - regulated “ insurance ” company ?
For checking the right boxes on a form , for adhering to scientifically absurd “ best practice ” guidelines , for incentives to keep a patient healthy and out of the hospital no matter how many packs per day he smokes or motorcycles he chooses to crash while riding drunk and unhelmeted ?
Yeah , that ’ll work .
Well , it might , if we just outlaw alcohol , and cigarettes , and motorcycles , and stupidity .
Here are some parallels that expose the utter ridiculousness and complete ignorance of economics revealed by his claim :
American plumbing costs will never be controlled until most plumbers are no longer paid fees for specific services .
American grocery costs will never be controlled until most stores are no longer paid fees for specific foods .
American computing costs will never be controlled until most technology companies are no longer paid fees for specific products .
Oh , imagine how much better it would be if plumbers , groceries , and tech companies were instead paid by the State to provide equal access for all Americans to their products and services !
Would expenses skyrocket , because plumbing , groceries , and computers would be “ free , ” and people would demand all the toilet - unclogging , truffle - eating , and number - crunching that other peoples ’ money can buy ?
No ! Instead , by Dr. Lundberg ’s reasoning , demand would skyrocket because plumbers , grocers , and electronics stores “ drive the majority of expenditures ! ”
The customers ( citizens , serfs , proles ) are clueless !
They care nothing about price , they care nothing about quality , they care nothing about risks or opportunity costs , they are too stupid to know anything at all !
They just do whatever the greedy grocer tells them , such as “ BUY MORE SPINACH !!!
HA , HA , HA , HA !!! ”
So , of course , we must take care of them .
So how could costs be controlled ?
How could the State achieve its aims ?
Just how exactly would it work ?
Simple , a bureaucrat or even better a “ blue - ribbon ” panel of bureaucrats would get to declare that no one needs more than 2 GB of memory on his computer , or more than 3 apples per week , or a toilet with more than 1 gallon per flush ( OH WAIT !
They ALREADY dictate that to us ! ) .
Of course , any APPROVED graphic designers , or bakers , or influential friends in high places could obtain special State permission for an exception , even through lobbying and “ donations ” if necessary .
And going further , that such important items as these must pass rigorous State standards and regulations , and therefore can only be purchased from licensed entities such as Halliburton Computer Company , or Goldman Sachs Apple Orchards , or General Motors Plumbing !
See how the web of power and control works !
Of course , prices could not be allowed to rise , so the plumber would be paid no more than $ 50 for unclogging a toilet , the grocer no more than $ 0.25 per apple , the tech company no more than $ 200 per desktop computer .
How would the plumber , the grocer , and the tech company respond ?
Would they bask in the glow of the State ’s beneficence ?
Perhaps , shielded from competition with their executives ensconced in Aspen or St. Martin , but they ’d still plumb fewer toilets , grow fewer apples , and make the crappiest computers you ’ve ever had the pain of trying to use , while customers remained on waiting lists for months just for the chance to redeem their quota .
In disgust , their best employees might even decide to take up carpentry instead .
In fact , about half of physicians in a frequently cited though controversial poll have admitted considering similar measures if another thousand or so pages of preposterous power - grabbing healthcare law is passed in the near future .
Admittedly , I do n’t think half will quit , but in my circles the number making such considerations , particularly to cut back their practices significantly while exploring other career options far exceeds half .
Forget freedom , forget choice , forget customers actually informing themselves about what they do or do not wish to purchase with money they have actually earned themselves , all because many in this country have been brainwashed into believing that our so - called “ free market ” does n’t work , is broke , kaput , out of service , and that the classic conception of individual rights is helplessly pass , replaced instead with their newfangled “ progressive ” misconception of rights such as a right to healthcare , a right to affordable housing , a right to food , and a right to whatever anybody wants anytime ( except when it costs too much , whereby your rights will be modulated by your rulers to fit their budget ! ) .
Some other essential points to round out the picture while I ’m at it :
State “ insurance ” is not insurance .
It is money taken by force from some to pay for the medical care of others .
In the case of Medicare , it is also money taken by force from some to pay for their own care , though they may very well prefer to use said money for other purposes .
This is wrong .
Period .
Arguing for expansion of such programs is therefore also wrong .
If Medicare were an insurance company , it would be out of business , or its executives in prison , or both .
Most private insurance is not insurance ( health savings accounts coupled with high - deductible plans excepted ) .
It is prepaid care , or care paid for by a third party , usually an employer .
Insurance does not usually cover routine expenses ( e.g. homeowner ’s does n’t cover window washing , auto does n’t cover tire changes ) .
Insurance is a voluntary agreement whereby an individual pays a portion of current resources in order to protect against a potential future large loss .
The reason private medical payment is structured in such an unnatural way is a direct result of the employer tax - deductibility of health insurance , which has been in effect since the World War II era as a direct consequence of State price and wage controls .
True insurance , such as HSAs , tends to reduce costs compared with State programs , as Whole Foods CEO John Mackey has explained recently to much liberal consternation .
We are not operating in a medical free market , or anything that comes anywhere close to approximating one .
When the State already spends approximately half of all healthcare dollars , we are operating in a half - socialized market .
When the State endlessly regulates providers and payors , and engineers a system where employers rather than patients pay for “ private ” care , we have even less of a free market .
State interference in the free market is the number one reason for the cost problem in healthcare .
It has increased demand through programs such as Medicare and Medicaid , and by making even those with private insurance relatively unconcerned about prices .
It has also limited supply through professional licensing laws , patents , certificate of need requirements , and other innumerable regulations .
The State , not physicians , is “ driving the majority of expenditures in the US health care system . ”
In the absence of State intervention , charity care would be provided , and in abundance .
The uninsured and the indigent would have a place to go , to be cared for , even more so than they do today .
Imagine , if the State stole less of your income , if it deprived you of less of your life , if it regulated and ruled you less , if you were faced with gratitude rather than entitlement , would you be more or less likely to contribute to charity , and to provide charitable care ?
Medicine is not fundamentally different from any other product or service .
Medical services have a monetary value .
Consumers can be educated on the value of medical services .
If they can learn about such esoteric concepts as computer memory , processor speed , hard disk size , monitor resolution , internet bandwidth , etc. , then they sure can learn about the risks and benefits of prostate surgery .
Physicians are just one of the many sources of education for them .
The internet is the great equalizer and educator .
The only reform that is n’t some scheme to increasingly violate individual rights in a vain and misguided attempt to defy the laws of economics , which is to say our essential human nature , is to free ( repeal State programs and regulations ) rather than to even further socialize medicine .

The Best of Michael Scott , MD
NEW YORK �( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks tumbled Monday , retreating after the Dow climbed above the 10,000 level again , as a stronger dollar battered commodity shares and the financial sector took a hit .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) lost 104 points , or 1 % , after having gained as much as 100 points in the morning .
The S&P 500 ( SPX ) index fell 13 points , or 1.2 % .
The Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) dropprf 13 points , or 0.6 % .
Stocks gained in early trading , but did an about - face as the greenback firmed up .
Financials spearheaded a broad - based selloff , with 27 of 30 issues falling , including Bank of America , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , Chevron ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) , Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ , Fortune 500 ) , Caterpillar ( CAT , Fortune 500 ) , Boeing ( BA , Fortune 500 ) and United Technologies ( UTX , Fortune 500 ) .
The dollar turned higher on the back of a stronger - than - expected Treasury auction , pressuring dollar - traded commodities and big multi-nationals that benefit from the weak dollar , said Richard Campagna , chief investment officer at 300 North Capital .
The financial sector was hit by reports over the weekend that Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) 's plans to repay federal bailout money may have hit some roadblocks .
Regional banks Fifth Third Bancorp and SunTrust were both downgraded to " sell " by Richard X. Bove of Rochdale Securities .
But the selloff was also a continuation of last week 's declines , Campagna said .
" I think people are very nervous short term even though the prospects are positive long term . "
Stocks ended last week lower , with investors not impressed by the latest spate of better - than - expected quarterly results , including Microsoft and Amazon.com late in the week .
Since bottoming at a 12 - year low on March 9 , the S&P 500 has gained nearly 60 % , with any modest selloff being met with renewed buying interest .
But in the last week , that trend has changed a little , with the buyers sitting out .
" The market got a little overextended through mid-month and some people are waiting for an opportunity to jump back in , " Campagna said .
" Meanwhile , the short - term guys want to cash out , so you 're seeing some weakness .
Tuesday brings quarterly results from BP and Valero Energy and economic reports on durable goods orders in September , the Case Shiller home price index for August and the October Consumer Confidence index .
Quarterly results : Dow component Verizon Communications ( VZ , Fortune 500 ) said profit tumbled 30 % as higher costs countered an increase in revenue from its strong wireless business .
Nonetheless , earnings topped expectations .
The company also reported higher quarterly revenue .
But shares slipped , getting dragged down in the bigger selloff .
Just shy of 140 components of the S&P 500 are due to report quarterly results this week .
With 206 companies , or 41 % of the S&P 500 having already reported , profits are currently on track to have fallen 18.3 % from a year ago , according to Thomson Reuters .
So far , results have been soundly above forecasts , with 81 % of companies topping expectations , 7 % meeting and 12 % missing .
Company news : Capmark Financial , one of the country 's largest commercial real estate lenders , filed for bankruptcy protection Sunday , reflecting the major problems in the business property sector .
Dutch financial services firm ING ( ING ) said Monday it plans to spin off its insurance business and sell $ 11.3 billion of stock to pay back some of what it took in bailout money from the government last year .
World markets : Global markets were negative .
In Europe , London 's FTSE 100 lost 0.8 % , France 's CAC 40 lost 1.2 % and Germany 's DAX gave up 1.3 % .
Asian markets ended lower .
Bonds : Treasury prices tumbled , raising the yield on the 10 - year note to 3.54 % from 3.48 % late Friday .
Treasury prices and yields move in opposite directions .
Yields jumped as the government completed the first few auctions in a record week for debt sales .
Treasury sold $ 30 billion in six - month notes , $ 29 billion in 3 - month notes and $ 7 billion in five - month Treasury Inflation Protected Securities , or TIPS .
All three saw strong demand .
Currency and commodities :
The dollar gained versus the euro , after falling to a 14 - month low last week .
The dollar gained versus the yen as well .
The stronger dollar pressured dollar - traded commodity prices .
U.S. light crude oil for December delivery fell $ 1.82 to settle at $ 78.68 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
COMEX gold for December delivery fell $ 13.60 to settle at $ 1,042.80 an ounce .
Gold has surpassed records repeatedly this month due to the weak dollar and longer - term worries about inflation .
Market breadth was negative .
On the New York Stock Exchange , losers beat winners thee to one on volume of 1.39 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , decliners beat advancers two to one on volume of 2.34 billion shares .
Fried dough and fermented cabbage are n't two things that usually join forces , except maybe in South Korea where my friend spotted this kimchi donut .
It 's one of five " ethnic " flavors that Dunkin ' Donuts launched ( they also made a yogurt - filled one in Greece and soy - filled one in Japan ) .
Technically there 's no hole , so they 're calling them kimchi croquettes .
File this under : potentially genius or a vile , gag reflex - inducing mistake .

A definitive grid for the Japanese Grand Prix will be issued prior to the race on Sunday morning .
Title rivals Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button , Force India 's Adrian Sutil and Renault 's Fernando Alonso have all been given five - place penalties for failing to slow sufficiently under yellow flags for Sebastien Buemi 's accident in Q2 .
The Toro Rosso driver was also penalised for dragging his damaged car back to the pits .
Although provisional grids have been circulated , a firm decision on the starting order has yet to be made , as the positions will depend on the order in which penalties are applied - with the regulations stating that " grid position penalties will be applied to the drivers in question in the order the offences were committed . "
Mark Webber and Timo Glock will have to start from the pitlane having changed chassis after today 's accidents , while Tonio Liuzzi had already received a five - place penalty prior to qualifying due to a gearbox change .
Daytime Dating in New York : The Preparation
0 SHARES Share
When I first started out in the dating or “ pick up artist ” community , I just wanted to get laid more , be able to attract beautiful women and have more choice .
But everything evolves .
Now that I ’ve done those things , I know that what I really want are high quality women that inspire me in my life .
I was a terribly introverted kid .
Everything I ’ve done in my life since about age 12 has been to try to buck that trend .
When I was young , I thought that because I was short , Sri Lankan and not a good - looking kid , I could never be good with girls .
Then one day I found Love Systems , and my life began to change .
I worked hard on myself for years to get to where I am now : a full - time Love Systems instructor , traveling the world running Day Game Workshops and living my passions .
I ca n’t tell you how many ups and downs I have had over the years .
But no matter how many times I fell off the horse , I kept getting back on it again , more determined each time .
Today , I am living in Stockholm and dating a girl in New York .
Let ’s call her Alison .
This woman is not only beautiful , but intelligent , creative , daring and challenges me in ways that no other woman ever has .
Meeting and attracting a girl like Alison was n’t only the work of a 3 - minute conversation and a 2 - hour date later that evening .
It took years for me to become the man that she would find so attractive .
Today , I want to outline some of things that prepared me for the moment that I met her , walking through Union Square on a mild day in NYC .
Mentality
I read a book on self - defense once that said , “ When you leave the house , you have to be ready to fight .
You have to know where the line is , and that when someone crosses it , you will do what you need to do to defend yourself . ”
It ’s the same with meeting women : every day is a new opportunity to meet the woman of your dreams or have the best sex you ’ve ever had .
When you wake up each morning , you have a choice : will you seize the opportunity today or will you wuss out like most people do every day of their lives ?
Whenever a beautiful woman walks past you on the street , whenever you ’re on your lunch break and there ’s a gorgeous woman sitting next to you in a café , or whenever a cute girl is helping you out in a store , there is an opportunity .
Do n’t waste it !
Radar
Most people I know walk with their heads down towards the ground .
It ’s all too common in cities like New York and London where people are focused on keeping themselves to themselves .
But you need to keep your head up and look around at the world if you ’re going to see opportunity .
Part of it is also making sure you look like an ambitious , confident guy .
Keep your eyes on the horizon , and look out for attractive women .
If a woman catches your attention , do n’t let her see you staring at her while you hesitate and invent reasons why you should n’t go talk to her .
Allow her beauty to sweep you up in the moment , walk straight over and tell her what you need to tell her .
Check out my article on Direct Openers if you are not sure what to say and need help starting the conversation .
Style
The way you dress is one of the biggest things a woman will notice about you the first time she sees you .
I ’ve never been a professional style expert , but a lot of guys on workshops often ask me about my style and how I got it .
' Get used to being poor ' : Judge orders £ 400 m divorce wife to be evicted from £ 8,000 - a- month home
A woman who is seeking half her husband 's £ 400 million fortune in a divorce settlement lost her battle against eviction yesterday and was told to get used to being poor .
Michelle Young , 45 , must move out of her townhouse in Regent 's Park within six weeks or face being forcibly removed by bailiffs .
She had argued that being evicted from the property would cause her and her two daughters ' exceptional hardship ' .
' Utterly distraught ' : Michelle
Young leaves court yesterday after she was ordered to leave her luxury £ 2.8 m townhouse .
Her husband Scot Young ( pictured at an earlier hearing , right ) , with whom she is locked in a £ 400 m divorce battle
But lawyer Felix Geiringer , representing her landlords , turned on the former model , telling her that if she wanted the court to believe her divorce fight had left her penniless , she should start claiming benefits and find a council house .
Mr Geiringer told Mrs Young it was time for her to face the reality of her situation .
' The fact that she continues to wish to live in an £ 8,666 - a - month house , to school her children in an expensive school , to come to court dressed in very fine clothes - the fact that she makes these choices does not bring her within the realm of exceptional hardship , ' he said .
' Nobody in this country needs to be homeless .
If she 's being evicted then the local council has an obligation to provide her with housing .
She has access to benefits , her children can be schooled for free .
The fact is that she is not seeking benefits that are available to her . '
Mrs Young is at the centre of one of Britain 's most high - value divorces , and is seeking a £ 200 million settlement from her estranged husband , tycoon Scot Young .
Mr Young , a one - time ' fixer ' to the super - rich , claims that the credit crunch destroyed his property empire and left him with debts of £ 27 million .
He has not paid Mrs Young any maintenance for almost a year , and their daughters ' £ 9,000 - a- term school fees have gone unpaid since April , the court heard .
Mrs Young claims he has also failed to pay almost £ 24,000 in rent on the home she shares with the girls , who are aged 17 and 15 .
She insists he has hidden his fortune in offshore bank accounts and secret property deals to avoid a court order to hand over half his assets .
Mrs Young has called for her husband to be jailed if he cannot explain how he lost his fortune , and her lawyers have asked for him to hear ' the clang of the prison gate ' .
But she has been unable to stop her landlords , Peter and Charlotte Bolland , from seeking her eviction .
Yesterday 's hearing at the Central London County Court laid bare the extent of her riches - to - rags saga .
Scot Young with his new girlfriend fashion designer Noelle Reno
Her lawyer Claire van Overdijk told the court : ' In order to be able to survive and support her two daughters ... she has sold all her jewellery now and has no assets worth selling to her name . '
Mrs van Overdijk said Mrs Young owed solicitors ' fees of £ 120,000 , and said her daughters ' unpaid school fees now totalled £ 36,000 .
She added : ' Mrs Young 's funds are effectively zero .
At this moment in time she has no funds to her name . '
But Mr Geiringer said Mrs Young 's case was no worse than that of any other evictee who had come before the judge in these difficult economic times .
He told the court : ' On a cold - hearted , rational assessment of her own evidence , the defendant is failing to come to terms with a change in her personal circumstances .
' One can be sympathetic to that , and can accept that she is having a very hard time , but in my submission that does not reach the level of exceptional hardship .
' The circumstances the defendant finds herself in are not more difficult than the average person facing eviction .
' Everybody who is evicted from their residence has difficulties associated with that eviction . '
District Judge Michael Gilchrist gave Mrs Young a six - week stay of execution to find a new house , but awarded her landlords a possession order for November 25 .
Eviction notice :

She appeared close to tears as she left the court , and she later issued an emotional statement in which she said she was ' utterly distraught ' .
It said : ' My husband , Scot Young , has totally abandoned his responsibilities to his young daughters , and his failure to provide a safe and secure home for them is causing exceptional emotional torment .
' He appears to have no concern for the welfare of his girls , let alone me .
' He and those who aid him should be ashamed .
He is clearly trying to destroy me and break our resolve to fight for what is rightfully ours .
' Allowing his family to end up on the street is a despicable act and people will start to see what sort of a man he is . '
Mr Young has told friends that he will prove he has genuinely lost his fortune , and is now unable to pay his wife the £ 48,000 - a- month maintenance she is seeking .
Family Court judge Mrs Justice Parker has warned Mr Young that he will face a six - month jail term if he cannot account for his losses at the next hearing , on November 13 .
Wayne Gretzky has had enough and resigned as head coach of the bankrupt Phoenix Coyotes .
" This was a difficult decision that I 've thought long and hard about , " Gretzky said in a statement issued Thursday .
" We all hoped there would be a resolution earlier this month to the Coyotes ownership situation .
" But the decision is taking longer than expected .
Since both remaining bidders have made it clear that I do n't fit into their future plans , I approached general manager Don Maloney and suggested he begin looking for someone to replace me as coach . "
Hours later , Maloney introduced Dave Tippett as Gretzky 's successor .
" I want to thank Wayne for the years he put in as head coach , especially the past two years during my tenure , " Maloney said .
" He has taken a lot of bumps and bruises as head coach . "
" He is a really competitive person , " Hockey Night In Canada analyst Glenn Healy said of Gretzky , nicknamed The Great One .
" He was getting close to taking the franchise to next step so it is disappointing to him he did n't get to finish the mission . "
Gretzky was a casualty of the bitter battle for ownership of the Coyotes still being waged in bankruptcy court between Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie and the NHL .
Neither Balsillie nor the league intended to retain Gretzky as head coach , presumably because he makes $ 8.5 million US annually , and with the season about to start , he felt it best to step down .
" Wayne placed the welfare of the team ahead of his own in making this extremely difficult decision , " NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said .
" What is most disappointing to Wayne is that the league did n't come to him and renegotiate what is a monstrous salary for an organization that does n't have a lot of cash and a lot of revenue , " Healy noted .
" He understands it is a big nut in a market that does n't have a lot of money and probably would 've appreciated the league at least approaching him in the last couple of weeks and asking how do we approach this or how we can make this work .
" The league did n't even approach him to say , ' Hey , how do we make it work ? '
They never approached him . "
Gretzky reportedly is owed another $ 9 million US in connection with his minority stake in the Coyotes .
' He always put the team first '
Gretzky in Phoenix Season Record Result 2005 - 06 38-39 -5 12th in West 2006 - 07 31-46-5 15th 2007-08 38-37-7 12th 2008-09 36-39-7 13th
Gretzky played a prominent role as head coach , but he chose not to oversee training camp over the ownership issue .
" He always put the team first , " Healy said .
" He never wants to be a distraction and it would have been a distraction again and questions would been directed to him every day .
" He thinks the players first .
He has always taken the high road and done it again . "
" I always marvel at him , " Hockey Canada president Bob Nicholson told CBCSports.ca .
" He is , I think , the highest - profile person to ever be in our game and he always seems to take the high road .
" He did n't say much through all of this and could have stirred the waters but certainly did n't .
That is why I always admire him and why he is Wayne Gretzky . "
Gretzky enjoyed a solid , not stellar , four - year stint as Coyotes head coach , posting a winning record just once and failing to make the playoffs each season .
He went 143- 161 - 24 overall for a .473 winning percentage .
" He relied on a lot of people to help him and you never knew if it was something that he could overcome , " said retired forward Jeremy Roenick , who played for Gretzky in 2006 - 07 .
" He obviously did the best he could for the team and felt the team would be better without him .
" I think his status is legendary and he should keep his status legendary as one of the best players to ever play the game and poster boy of hockey around the world .
He is an absolute icon in Canada and he should protect that status .
" I think he had a lot of stress on him , a lot of pressure on him and he did what he needed to do , " Roenick continued .
" Gretz is Gretz .
" He is not going to overwhelm you with his wit or overwhelm you with his sense of humour , publicly .
He makes sure he protects his image and he does that very well .
" I was proud to have played against him .
I was proud to have played for him . "
' Phoenix is a great sports city '
Cherry Disappointed Don Cherry , the star of Coach 's Corner on Hockey Night In Canada , weighed in on Gretzky 's resignation .
" I do n't understand it , " Cherry said .
" He should have been there on the ice with his players . "
Cherry told reporters Thursday in Winnipeg it 's just a matter of time before a team in the southern U.S. relocates to the Manitoba capital .
Gretzky has been involved with the Coyotes since 2000 , when he agreed to purchase a 10 per cent stake in the team and accept the roles of alternate governor , managing partner and head of hockey operations .
The $ 90 - million US deal was finalized in 2001 in a partnership led by developer Steve Ellman and Jerry Moyes , who took over as majority owner in 2006 .
Moyes filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 5 , claiming he had lost $ 200 million US in equity and $ 100 million US in debt .
Moyes intended to facilitate the sale of the Coyotes in bankruptcy court to Balsillie , but the NHL is opposed to the BlackBerry tycoon buying them and moving them to Hamilton .
Judge Redfield T. Baum has presided over the case for the past five months , but he has yet to rule on whether Balsillie or the NHL or neither will be awarded the franchise in a court - supervised auction .
" I 've always said that Phoenix is a great sports city and deserves nothing but the best , " Gretzky said .
" I still believe that .
" As a young boy , I learned to play hockey in Southern Ontario and I know what great fans they have there .
It 's my hope they too will have an NHL franchise in the not too distant future . "
As for Gretzky 's future , Healy said : " The world is his jewel .
He would be an asset to every team in the NHL . "

Because an underlying karma score is a number , product managers often misunderstand the interaction between numerical values and online identity .
The thinking goes something like this :
This thinking — though seemingly intuitive — is impoverished , and is wrong in at least two important ways .
Even eBay , with the most well - known example of public negative karma , does n't represent how untrustworthy an actual seller might be - it only gives buyers reasons to take specific actions to protect themselves .
In general , avoid negative public karma .
If you really want to know who the bad guys are , keep the score separate and restrict it to internal use by moderation staff .
The Sims Online was a multiplayer version of the popular Sims games by Electronic Arts and Maxis in which the user controlled an animated character in a virtual world with houses , furniture , games , virtual currency ( called Simoleans ) , rental property , and social activities .
You could call it playing dollhouse online .
One of the features that supported user socialization in the game was the ability to declare that another user was a trusted friend .
The feature involved a graphical display that showed the faces of users who had declared you trustworthy outlined in green , attached in a hub - and - spoke pattern to your face in the center .
People checked each other 's hubs for help in deciding whether to take certain in - game actions , such as becoming roommates in a house .
Decisions like these are costly for a new user – the ramifications of the decision stick with a newbie for a long time , and backing outof a bad decision is not an easy thing to do .
The hub was a useful decision - making device for these purposes .
That feature was fine as far as it went , but unlike other social networks , The Sims Online allowed users to declare other users un trustworthy too .
The face of an untrustworthy user appeared circled in bright red among all the trustworthy faces in a user 's hub .
It did n't take long for a group calling itself the Sims Mafia to figure out how to use this mechanic to shake down new users when they arrived in the game .
The dialog would go something like this :
" Hi !
I see from your hub that you 're new to the area .
Give me all your Simoleans or my friends and I will make it impossible to rent a house . ”
" What are you talking about ? "
" I'm a member of the Sims Mafia , and we will all mark you as untrustworthy , turning your hub solid red ( with no more room for green ) , and no one will play with you .
You have five minutes to comply .
If you think I 'm kidding , look at your hub - three of us have already marked you red .
Do n't worry , we 'll turn it green when you pay … "
If you think this is a fun game , think again - a typical response to this shakedown was for the user to decide that the game was n't worth $ 10 a month .
Playing dollhouse does n't usually involve gangsters .
Avoid public negative reputation .
Really .
South Park " Whale Whores " : Captain Paul Watson Responds !
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
Wednesday night ’s airing of the latest South Park episode Whale Whores created quite the conversation in our early morning recap .
While some praised the message of the show , others felt that it went a little too far in playing Wack - A - Mole with Sea Shepherd Captain Paul Watson .
Not one to shy away from controversy , Watson stopped by the comments to share his feelings on the show — and explain why South Park ’s exposure was worth the satirical abuse .
In his own words ,
I have to say that being lampooned on South Park is hardly something to complain about .
They spelt Sea Shepherd right and they brought the issue of the dolphin and whale slaughter by the Japanese to a very large audience .
I could not really care less how I was portrayed personally , I ’m in good company along with Tom Cruise and Sean Penn . ”
It ’s a tough situation we are in .
We ca n’t hurt the whalers and we have to stay within the boundaries of the law in opposing illegal whaling operations .
If that makes us pussies so be it , it ’s better than being portrayed as killers .
The point however that was missed is that we have cut the Japanese kill quotas in half over the last three years and cost them their profits .
Our objective is to bankrupt them and we are doing just that .
South Park has however linked Japan to the horrific and senseless slaughter of dolphins and whales and all in all that ’s a damn good message in our opinion .
What the Whale Whores episode also achieved was to highlight just how successful Whale Wars has been as a television show and how Sea Shepherd is out on the high seas actually trying to do something about the problem .

Abstract
We present a system that composes a realistic picture from a simple freehand sketch annotated with text labels .
The composed picture is generated by seamlessly stitching several photographs in agreement with the sketch and text labels ; these are found by searching the Internet .
Although online image search generates many inappropriate results , our system is able to automatically select suitable photographs to generate a high quality composition , using a filtering scheme to exclude undesirable images .
We also provide a novel image blending algorithm to allow seamless image composition .
Each blending result is given a numeric score , allowing us to find an optimal combination of discovered images .
Experimental results show the method is very successful ; we also evaluate our system using the results from two user studies .

A Fox 5 cameraman happened to be shooting footage near the Ed Sullivan Theater yesterday for a segment on taxi medallions when an angry brawl exploded between a pedicab driver and a cabbie .
It starts when the pedicab driver , fed up with the hack honking his horn behind him , tosses a cup of coffee at the cab 's passenger - side window .
You gonna take that cabbie ?
Not in New York !
Check it out :
Fox 5 reporter Reid Lamberty and a photographer from Entertainment Tonight , who was covering the David Letterman sextortion story outside the theater , eventually pried the two apart .
It does n't look like any blood was spilled , but then the pedicab driver , who comes off as the loser in this bout , goes all WWE , picking up a metal garbage can and [ SPOILER !] heaving it at the hack .
He misses , and then escapes by pedaling off into the sunset , first against traffic and then on the sidewalk , naturally .
You do hate to see violence , but on the other hand , this is so quintessentially New York that we can't help but smile like Burt Lancaster in Sweet Smell of Success : " I love this dirty town . "
A new collaborative investigation by the Sunlight Foundation and the Center for Responsive Politics has found that many of the major players in the health insurance reform debate have hit members of Congress with a one - two punch of campaign contributions from at least 10 of their hired , outside lobbyists on top of donations from their employees or political action committees .
Since January 2007 , more than 500 individual lobbyists who fit these criteria donated roughly $ 2.8 million to 61 members of Congress who also received about $ 1.9 million from the companies ’ PACs or employees .
These lobbyists represented 25 major health care and health insurance organizations .
Here is a table of the top Senate recipients of these contributions .
( Read more about the methodology here . )
Recipient From Clients From Lobbyists Overall Total John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) $ 427,530 $ 473,400 $ 900,930 Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) $ 276,050 $ 237,722 $ 513,772 Max Baucus ( D - Mont . ) $ 252,750 $ 200,899 $ 453,649 Arlen Specter ( D - Penn . ) $ 116,750 $ 108,778 $ 225,528 Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) $ 56,950 $ 130,808 $ 187,758 Mark Udall ( D - Colo . ) $ 76,025 $ 79,150 $ 155,175 Mark Warner ( D - Va. ) $ 46,650 $ 84,450 $ 131,100 Pat Roberts ( R - Kan . ) $ 47,200 $ 83,420 $ 130,620 Mary Landrieu ( D - La . ) $ 35,800 $ 67,000 $ 102,800 Patty Murray ( D - Wa . ) $ 32,800 $ 59,500 $ 92,300 Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) $ 22,500 $ 55,950 $ 78,450 Susan Collins ( R- Maine ) $ 28,300 $ 40,916 $ 69,216
Among the 61 recipients of these joint contributions are 11 senators who sit on the 23 - member Senate Finance Committee , which is chaired by Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont . ) .
Baucus ranked as the third highest recipients of such contributions , accepting about $ 201,000 from 109 lobbyists representing 11 health - related organizations , plus an additional $ 252,750 from the lobbying clients ’ employees or PACs .
( The Sunlight Foundation illustrates these contributions , pictured in the image above , in graphic form here . )
Four other Democratic senators on the Finance committee also received such contributions : Sens. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , Blanche Lincoln ( D - Ark. ) , Jay Rockefeller ( D - W.Va . ) and Deborah Stabenow ( D - Mich . ) .
These lawmakers combined received roughly one - sixth of Baucus ’ haul — averaging about $ 19,800 in contributions per person from these clients and their external lobbyists during the two - and - a - half year period studied .
On the other side of the aisle , 60 percent of the Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee were found to have accepted campaign contributions from these major health - related organizations and their outside lobbyists .
Sen . Pat Roberts ( R - Kan . ) received the most in such contributions , with $ 130,620 from these lobbyists and their clients , followed by Sen.
Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) , who received $ 78,450 .
Sens. Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) , Mike Crapo ( R - Idaho ) , Mike Enzi ( R - Wyo. ) and John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) round out the list of GOP recipients .
These Republican lawmakers received an average of $ 67,700 per person from these clients and their external lobbyists during the two - and - a - half year period studied .
Politicians With Tough Re-Election Contests Also Made the List
Beyond the Senate Finance Committee , several high - profile senators with tough re-elections battles also made the list of top recipients of the combined “ bundles ” of lobbyist - client giving .
Sen. Arlen Specter ( D - Penn . ) ranks fourth overall , behind Baucus , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) and John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) — though much of McCain ’s money was directed at his presidential campaign last year .
Between January 1 , 2007 , and June 30 , 2009 , Specter received about $ 225,500 in contributions from seven major health care and health insurance organizations and 67 of their hired lobbyists .
Earlier this year , former Club for Growth president and ex-Rep .
Pat Toomey ( R - Penn . ) announced his intent to run against Specter in a Republican primary .
Specter then switched his party alliance to become a Democrat , although he now faces a contentious primary challenge from Rep. Joe Sestak ( D - Penn . ) .
Next up after Specter ?
Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn. ) , a key member of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , who stewarded that committee ’s health reform legislation while Chairman Edward Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) battled brain cancer .
Between January 2007 and June 2009 , Dodd received about $ 187,800 in contributions from six major health care and health insurance organizations and 63 of their hired lobbyists .
Numerous Republicans , including former WWE chief executive Linda McMahon , are vying to unseat Dodd .
Also among the senators in the top half of the list : Freshman Sen. Michael Bennet ( D - Colo. ) , who was appointed by Colorado ’s Democratic governor to fill the vacancy created when President Barack Obama in January tapped Ken Salazar for secretary of the interior .
( Obama has since also endorsed Bennet over former Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff in a Democratic primary race . )
The political action committee of drug company Amgen has contributed just $ 1,500 to Bennet , and employees the Amgen , plus the employees of the drug industry trade group PhRMA have given Bennet an additional , if modest , $ 1,750 .
Yet , 27 lobbyists representing these two major pharmaceutical players have contributed $ 35,950 to Bennet since he assumed office .
On the House side , three powerful Republicans and two high - profile Democrats top the list ( see table below ) .
Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) has received $ 157,500 from three health - related organizations and 32 of their hired outside lobbyists since January 2007 .
Rep. Dave Camp ( R - Mich . ) , the ranking member on the House Ways and Means Committee , one of three committees with jurisdiction over the House ’s health care reform legislation , has received $ 83,500 from two major groups ( PhRMA and America ’s Health Insurance Plans ) and 40 of their hired outside lobbyists since January 2007 .
Both groups have been vocally opposing Democratic attempts to create a public health insurance option
Rep. Kendrick Meeks ( D - Fla. ) , who is running for the Senate seat now held by Republican George LeMieux , after Republican Mel Martinez ‘s retirement last month , has received about $ 68,900 from four health insurance and pharmaceutical companies and 49 of their hired outside lobbyists since January 2007 .
Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) has received $ 58,500 from PhRMA ’s employees , PAC and 20 of its outside lobbyists since January 2007 .
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) , meanwhile , has received $ 45,125 from PhRMA ’s employees , PAC and 25 of its outside lobbyists since January 2007 .
Recipient From Clients From Lobbyists Overall Total Eric Cantor ( R - Va . ) $ 86,200 $ 71,300 $ 157,500 Dave Camp ( R- Mich . ) $ 10,750 $ 72,750 $ 83,500 Kendrick Meek ( D - Fla . ) $ 18,900 $ 50,028 $ 68,928 John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) $ 3,500 $ 55,000 $ 58,500 Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) $ 3,500 $ 41,625 $ 45,125
Lobbyists Dole Out Contributions
The collaborative investigation between the Sunlight Foundation and Center for Responsive Politics identified 516 individual lobbyists who donated to lawmakers to whom their clients also contributed , and to whom at least nine other outside lobbyists hired by the same clients contributed in the past two - and - a - half years .
In all , these individuals contributed roughly $ 2.8 million .
Companies with fewer than 10 lobbyists that fit these criteria were not included in this initial study .
Many of these lobbyists were on the payrolls of several health care or health insurance companies during this period .
Between January 2007 and June 2009 , lobbyists on the payroll of PhRMA gave the most .
These 131 individuals and their immediate family members contributed more than $ 1 million to the campaign committees and leadership PACs of 32 members of Congress .
More than 60 percent of the lobbyists hired by PhRMA during this period made such contributions .
Nearly three - fourths of lobbyists hired by Amgen also made such contributions .
These 124 individuals contributed about $ 685,700 to two - dozen members of Congress .
Similarly , between two - thirds and one - half of the external lobbyists of Roche Holdings , Pfizer and Blue Cross / Blue Shield all made such contributions .
The extra contributions for each firm each totaled between $ 200,000 and $ 400,000 .
Notably , more than half of the external lobbyists hired by insurance giant American International Group ( AIG ) , which offers supplemental health insurance and long - term health care policies among its other insurance products , also made campaign contributions to the same members of Congress to which AIG ’s employees or political action committee also contributed since 2007 .
These 25 outside lobbyists donated about $ 133,100 to five Republican Senators , including $ 42,200 to McCain , the top recipient of such “ bundles ” from AIG .
The Sunlight Foundation and the Center for Responsive Politics said in a press release earlier today , “ There is no indication that the extra giving by lobbyists was part of a planned effort by the healthcare firms to solidify their support among key members of Congress .
But whether coordinated or not , the newly - found clusters of lobbyist giving clearly illustrate the intensity of the full - court press that the industry is currently waging on Capitol Hill . ”

Tags : Asylum seekers
The issue of asylum seekers cuts right to the heart of everything that ’s rotten and inhumane about capitalism – its racism , its hypocrisy , its brutality and its utter contempt for humanity Liam Ward argues in Socialist Alternative .
Anyone who heard Brindha , the 9 year old Tamil asylum seeker , pleading recently to be allowed into Australia should have been disgusted with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd ’s response .
Adrift on a crowded boat off the Indonesian coast , Brindha made a heartbreaking plea to Australian journalists : “ please save us , please , please ! ”
With an unflinching appeal to the right , Rudd delivered a chilling reply : “ I make absolutely no apology whatsoever for taking a hard line on illegal immigration to Australia . ”
The 253 asylum seekers – not “ illegal immigrants ” – on that boat have sacrificed everything they once had to make a desperate bid for safety from the systematic slaughter being wrought on them by the Sri Lankan government – a slaughter supported by the Australian government , who could n’t wait to label the Tamils as “ terrorists . ”
They are fleeing a situation where the Sri Lankan government is killing 1400 a week of the 300,000 detained in concentration camps .
This horror , this hell - on - earth that drives people to flee with nothing other than the clothes on their back , is what politicians and media goons have taken to euphemistically calling a “ push factor . ”
This same anti-human Orwellian logic recently led senators in parliament to draw parallels between the Oceanic Viking ( the Australian customs ship stranded off the Indonesian coast with 78 asylum seekers onboard ) and another maritime stand - off from the John Howard era .
And no , they were n’t talking about the Tampa … .
They were talking about the Como Express , which in 2003 was unable to dock in Saudi Arabia and unload its cargo of 50,000 sheep .
This is the way Australian politicians talk about people fleeing war and genocide , as though they were a kind of livestock .
Less marketable , not profitable , but apparently just as disposable .
Socialist Alternative stands for a total scrapping of mandatory detention .
Indeed , we are opposed to all immigration controls .
In a world where money can flow unhindered across any and every border on the planet , it is deeply , profoundly objectionable that human beings are denied that same privilege , or that those who try are hounded , demonised , shot at and locked up .
While the Australian ruling class claims a need to militarise its borders to keep out “ unauthorised non-citizens ” , it repeatedly uses that same military to breach the borders of other nations .
So Australian troops and federal police invade the Solomons , Papua New Guinea , Tonga , East Timor , to say nothing of the carnage they have helped wreak on Iraq and Afghanistan .
Australian companies force their way into the sovereign territory of these same islands of the South Pacific , where they pillage the earth and poison the population .
Consider the many notorious Australian - owned mines that scar the region , including BHP ’s Ok Tedi in PNG and Rio Tinto ’s Freeport Grasberg in West Papua and Panguna in Bougainville .
This article aims to counter some of the myths and lies being peddled by Australian politicians and the media .
It ’s a good rule of thumb that when it comes to the issue of refugees , it ’s no overstatement to assume that every word uttered by any politician in this country is a lie .
And the media are a party to this whole thing .
We need to attack every one of these myths , these lies and these distortions .
Firstly , we need to emphasise that mandatory detention of asylum seekers is still the practice and policy of the Australian government .
Any unauthorised off - shore ( ie. not on the mainland ) asylum seeker will be incarcerated for an indefinite period .
Recently , much of the liberal media have rightly highlighted the horrific conditions in the Indonesian detention centres .
They tell of people having to drink water contaminated by fungus and faeces , and of being held for years on end .
Without a doubt these claims are true .
But the conclusion reached by many – including the Greens , from whom we expect better – is that Australia needs to pressure Indonesia into improving things , to “ clean up ” their detention centres .
Nothing at all from most of them about closing the centres , or about Australia bringing those people here and granting them refugee status , not even those people who Australia previously sent back to the camps in Indonesia .
But more importantly , this whole focus on the horrors of the Indonesian detention centres is built on an implicit suggestion that the detention centres in Australia are somehow acceptable .
This is outrageous .
We need to be calling for all the Australian detention centres to be closed and for mandatory detention to be scrapped .
Besides , the conditions in the Australian centres are gruesome , particularly the indefinite nature of detention .
Dozens of people have been driven to suicide and mental breakdowns over many years now .
People in Australian detention centres have self - harmed and sewed their lips shut in protest at their treatment .
After detainees resisted , rioted , broke out and staged hunger strikes at the notorious camps at Port Hedland and Woomera , the Howard Government opened the heavily militarised Baxter detention centre in 2003 .
This camp was designed from the ground up to psychologically crush those held inside .
And it was the only prison complex in Australia surrounded by an electric fence – and not a minor one either , it carried a 9000 - volt charge .
But even that was n’t enough ; last year the Labor government opened the major wing of their Christmas Island centre .
Modelled on Guantanamo Bay , this newest most militarised monstrosity yet , is separated not by an electric fence , but by a five - hour plane flight from the Australian mainland .
In 2002 , the Medical Journal of Australia described the extreme psychological and emotional damage done to people detained in immigration detention in Australia .
The pervasive pattern they describe includes “ the development of a psychological state characterised by severe depression , despair , hopelessness , paranoia , chronic rage , persecutory delusions , sub - syndromal psychosis , characterological change , stereotypic movements and persistent self harming behaviour ” .
In their sample , “ all but one of the detained asylum seekers displayed symptoms of psychological distress at some time during their period of detention ” .
Eighty - five per cent had “ chronic depressive symptoms ” and sixty - five per cent had “ pronounced ongoing suicidal ideation ” .
That ’s the reality of detention in Australia , and it ’s not old history .
You might be forgiven for not noticing , but in late October , amid all the cries of horror over the Indonesian detention centres , the Australian Human Rights Commission published yet another report condemning the Christmas Island centre .
They particularly singled out the old “ construction camp ” wing where children are now held , explicitly stating that the situation for children detained by the Labor government has actually regressed since 2005 .
Their report describes “ a claustrophobic facility consisting of demountables linked by covered walkways .
There is little open space , there are virtually no trees , and there is no open grassy area for children to play .
The bedrooms are very small , with beds that are not appropriate for babies or young toddlers . ”
This is Rudd ’s detention centre , where in the last 12 months , his government has imprisoned over 1600 people who have committed no crime , let alone been charged or sentenced .
This is the “ humane ” treatment of asylum seekers Rudd constantly proclaims .
As part of this , we are being subjected to a vicious campaign to criminalise asylum seekers .
First , there ’s the pervasive practice of labelling asylum seekers as “ illegal . ”
This lie has been consciously pushed by people up to and including Kevin Rudd .
In fact , there is absolutely nothing illegal about seeking asylum , about arriving without authorisation or papers , or about coming by unregistered boats .
The UN Declaration on Refugees spells this out explicitly .
Even the Australian Press Council has begrudgingly acknowledged this on numerous occasions and directed media outlets to stop describing asylum seekers or their actions as “ illegal . ”
The twin line of this argument is pushed by those who suggest that some if not all of the asylum seekers could be “ criminals ” or “ terrorists ” .
This is sheer racism .
And coming from the Australian state who gave the world ’s worst war criminal and mass murderer , George Bush , a red carpet welcome when he visited Sydney !
Another common myth is that the real villains are not the governments who invade other countries or sponsor genocide or lock up refugees in concentration camps , but the people who help them escape , the people smugglers .
So Rudd talks about the “ scourge ” of people - smugglers , who he says represent the “ vilest form of people on the planet ” .
Labor ’s Home Affairs Minister Brendan O’Connor claims “ organised crime syndicates are involved in the vast majority of vessel arrivals . ”
Everyone under the sun seems to agree that the aim is to “ stop the boats coming . ”
This is a travesty .
The real crime is not people smuggling , but the insurmountable obstacles that the Australian government continues to place in front of refugees .
Arresting the smugglers , further militarising the Australian coastline or just generally increasing the obstacles facing refugees only pushes the industry further into the criminal underground , increasing the danger and almost certainly the death toll .
If Rudd really cared about the lives of refugees he would remove all such obstacles .
In other words he would dismantle the fortress that surrounds this continent and let the refugees in .
Furthermore , he ’d withdraw Australian troops from Afghanistan , and stop instigating the type of horror that creates refugees .
It ’s still claimed that asylum seekers who come unauthorised by boat are “ queue jumpers ” .
This is rubbish .
Amid the chaos in Sri Lanka or Afghanistan , there is literally no queue .
This is especially so for persecuted minorities like the Tamils in Sri Lanka or the Hazaras in Afghanistan .
The Hazara , just to illustrate a point here , are a minority persecuted both by the Taliban and by Rudd ’s favoured thugs in Kabul now calling themselves the Afghan government .
What ’s more , as a report in The Age revealed a few months ago , there has n’t even been an Australian embassy capable of processing such visas in Afghanistan since 2007 !
The closest one is in Pakistan , but it can only process particular types of asylum applications .
Hardly helpful when you ’ve got warlords hunting you down and you ’re fleeing for your life .
In the concentration camps of Sri Lanka , along with the media and aid agencies , the UN is not even allowed in ; and the Rudd Labor government is not demanding it be let in to process asylum seekers , or that Australian representative be allowed in .
The refugees who risk everything to reach Australia by boat are , almost by definition , those most at risk , the most desperate .
They ’re not “ freeloaders ” or “ queue jumpers . ”
Finally , we need to challenge the idea that the Australian government has the right to ( and can be trusted to ) be the judge and jury over people ’s claim to asylum .
Even by the government ’s own harsh standards , over 90 per cent of boat arrivals are eventually found to be “ genuine ” refugees .
That “ lucky ” 90 per cent have all been through lengthy periods of traumatic detention .
Those who are n’t deemed worthy are deported , an act that invariably involves returning people to persecution ( if they ’re even returned to the correct country ) .
Over much of the last decade , the Edmund Rice Centre has tracked many of the hundreds of refugees deported from Australia .
Through two meticulously researched projects ( Deported to Danger in 2004 and Deported to Danger II in 2006 ) , they found that almost all of those deported had been returned to situations of extreme danger , many had been deported from Australia under duress and arguably with the use of force , and the rejection of their asylum claims was invariably based on flawed assessments ( and that ’s the ERC ’s overly generous analysis of Immigration Department motives ) .
This year , another study revealed that of 400 refugees deported to Afghanistan , at least 20 had been conclusively proven to be murdered , many had been tortured , and others have simply disappeared .
Australian governments have long proven themselves to be no fair judge of a person ’s asylum claim , and they have no interest in being a fair judge – as the case with the Tamils clearly illustrates .
Socialist Alternative is opposed to all of this .
We do not accept that the Australian government has the right to decide the fate of people seeking refuge , especially from chaos that the government has a hand in creating or an interest in supporting .
Anyone who comes here seeking asylum should be welcomed , and should be granted permanent , full and equal citizenship rights , with no detention .
Socialist Alternative has always been a strident campaigner for refugee rights .
We have never relented on our opposition to mandatory detention , never conceding that perhaps it would be OK to campaign to just get the children out , or to minimise the length of detention , or to just make the detention culture “ nicer ” or “ more accountable ” or “ transparent . ”
We never conceded any of the approaches that were argued for by conservative forces and which would only have legitimised mandatory detention .
In 2002 we helped tear down the fences of the noxious hellhole that was the Woomera Detention Centre , assisting people inside to make a courageous and inspiring breakout .
We would not hesitate to do it again .
This is an issue that might not have been mobilising tens of thousands in the street like it once did , but it ’s an issue that cuts right to the heart of everything that ’s rotten and inhumane about capitalism – its racism , its hypocrisy , its brutality and its utter contempt for humanity .
We stand firmly for the rights of asylum seekers , and we will not go silent until every detention centre on this planet is torn down .
Google has revealed plans for a Chrome cloud service that will allow users to synchronize browser data with their Google accounts .
The synchronization framework , which is still at an early stage of development , will arrive in Google 's open source Chromium project later this week .
Google says that a Chrome build with the sync feature enabled could be made available through a dev-channel update this month .
In a message posted to the Chromium developer group , Google engineer Tim Steele described the process through which the feature will be integrated into the browser .
Google has also published a design document that provides a high - level overview of the synchronization architecture .
" A bunch of us have been working on a feature to sync user data in Chromium with a Google account , " Steele wrote .
" We have built a library that implements the client side of our sync protocol as well as the Google server - side infrastructure to serve Google Chrome users and synchronize data to their Google Account . "
The Chrome synchronization framework will initially handle bookmarks , but it is designed to support other kinds of browser data in the future .
It uses a push messaging model to propagate change notifications , which means that activity in one instance of the browser will be reflected immediately in other instances .
This will make it more seamless than other bookmark synchronization services like Weave and XMarks that rely on polling to determine when data needs to be synchronized .
Google also plans to provide a Web interface so that users can remotely access their bookmarks from any browser by logging into their Google accounts .
The synchronization framework will use a persistent XMPP connection for change notifications .
The Google Talk servers will provide the backend infrastructure for that part of the synchronization process .
The actual bookmark data will be transmitted in Google 's Protocol Buffer format .
The design document suggests that XMPP was adopted instead of a polling model for scalability reasons and to make synchronization more seamless .
Steele says that the sync code represents a major change to the browser 's code base and that it will be landing in the Chromium tree incrementally so that it can be properly reviewed .
The client - side sync code currently works on Windows and Linux but does n't work yet on Mac OS X .
To enable broader testing , the developers plan to make available an experimental Chrome build for Windows with the synchronization feature enabled ; it will be deployed through the developer update channel later this month .
" We 're planning to use the syncapi DLL to produce a sync - enabled Google Chrome build for dev-channel users in a week or so , to get the feature into experimentally inclined hands , " Steele wrote .
" We have a great deal of infrastructure , both in the browser and in the form of production Google services , that needs to start seeing real user traffic and usage .
It takes a great deal of testing and confidence inspired by real usage statistics before any complex system like this can be deemed adequate for use by a large user base . "
Browser sync will boost the value of Google 's browser and advance Google 's strategy of converging the desktop with the cloud .
It 's a particularly intriguing development in light of Google 's upcoming Chrome OS .
Seamless synchronization of browser data between a desktop and netbook could be a very compelling feature .
It 's not clear yet if Google will also bring this feature to its Android mobile browser , but it seems like an obvious move .
Google intends to document the protocols and make the client - side source code available under an open license , which means that it could be possible for third - party developers to bring Google synchronization support to other browsers .
This will be a welcome development for users who still mourn the loss of Google 's Firefox browser sync , which was discontinued last year .
WASHINGTON – Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee voted Thursday to encourage limits on the compensation of insurance executives , responding to charges that expanding health insurance coverage would enrich insurance companies .
The action came as the influential panel brought debate to a close early Friday morning on sweeping legislation that would overhaul the nation 's health system , setting the stage for a pivotal panel vote next week on President Barack Obama 's top domestic priority .
Voting ...
As you see , the news today is that Joe Lieberman says he ’ll campaign for Republicans in 2010 .
And really , that ’s not too surprising since he did that in 2008 .
And it ’s not like he ’s come back to the Dems in any real way since then .
What did strike me though is that Lieberman is apparently planning to run for reelection in 2012 .
That ’s surprises me because Lieberman is actually quite unpopular in his home state .
And I ’d been assuming that he ’d play out his time out showboating through this term and then retire .
But if he is planning on running again , at some point he needs to start thinking of who he plans to get to vote for him .
Which brings me to another idea .
I do n’t know how one would swing this under federal election law .
But I ’ve wondered for a while whether it would be possible to create a placeholder committee that would raise money for Lieberman ’s eventual Democratic opponent in 2012 .
Sort of the Anti-Joe Fund ( AJF ) .
I have the sense that that might be a difficult proposition under federal fundraising laws — like you could have the committee but maybe the committee could only give $ 5000 or something to the eventual anti-Joe candidate rather than allowing the eventual anti-Joe nominee to just walk into the money .
If you could do it though , I would imagine you could probably raise tens of millions of dollars in anti-Joe money over the next three years or so because every time Joe pulled a stunt like the current one , it would be a focus for Dems around the country to work through their anti-Joe ire .
Fox Cable Networks and the National Geographic Channel announced Thursday that they would start a new program service that would focus on natural history and wildlife .
The service , a spinoff of the National Geographic Channel , will appear on the channel that currently is the home of the Fox Reality Channel .
Fox announced Wednesday that the reality channel would stop showing its program slate as of March 31 .
Called Nat Geo
Wild , the new service , which will be a joint venture between Fox Cable Networks and National Geographic Ventures , will concentrate on programs about animals in the wild .
It is an extension of a network that has already found success internationally , with outlets in about 50 countries , including England , France and Germany .
Steven Schiffman , the general manager and executive vice president of the National Geographic Channel , said in a telephone interview that the new channel was an ideal “ extension of the legacy of the brand . ”

A new surveillance video involving the death of Christopher Skinner suggests his assailants may have attacked him because his hand struck their SUV moments before a fight began that ended with his death .
Skinner , 27 , was beaten by two to four men at Victoria and Adelaide Sts. shortly after 3 a.m.
Sunday and left lying on the pavement in front of a black SUV , witnesses said .
According to those accounts , the vehicle 's driver then deliberately drove over Skinner with both the front and rear wheels .
Homicide detective Stacy Gallant presented three new video clips today that show Skinner attempting to hail a cab at two different locations on Adelaide St. that morning .
The first clip is at 2:36 a.m. in the entertainment district where Skinner tries to catch a cab for four minutes before walking east on Adelaide .
The second clip , which is 15 minutes later , shows Skinner looking at what police believe is his cellphone or iPod west of Bay , also on Adelaide .
Before viewing the third clip , which is three to four car lengths away from where Skinner was killed , Gallant explained the fuzzy video seems to show the victim attempting to hail cab again while standing on Adelaide .
A few cars pass before the suspect vehicle come along , which is when Gallant suggests Skinner 's hand may have " intentionally or unintentionally " hit it .
Moments later , Skinner walked towards Victoria where the suspect SUV stopped .
This clip also shows traffic stops after Skinner leaves the frame , leading police to believe that a number of people witnessed the attack .
Gallant is calling on these witnesses to contact police .
So far , the only description of the suspects is of the driver .
Police say he was under 30 , with light skin and short military - style hair .
He was wearing an undershirt .
Friends and family of Skinner mourned his death on Thursday at a memorial service near the town of Uxbridge .
DeLeon called me out of breath a couple of weeks ago .
He has a degree and is out of work living in Denver .
What he told me shocked me .
He had spent 6 hours waiting in line to be seen putting in his energy assistance application .
Folks were handing out cups of water in line .
DeLeon told me he was informed that the phone wait was down to 3 - 4 hours , but he did n't have that many minutes on his phone , and he wanted to save those for calling for jobs .
We talked about how his unemployment visa card fees chewed up precious dollars , taking the bus everywhere , and the importance of keeping his apartment .
He told me , ' damn , I hope I can keep my lights on , but if I gotta go around in the dark , fine , I just do n't want to be homeless , shit I 'm hungry enough already ' laughing .
I asked him when was the last time he ate and he said softly , ' dude , you do n't want to know ' .
Sherry is a young single mother of 2 teenage kids in high school in Wisconsin .
She called ( last winter ) because her gas bill , i.e. heating bill was over $ 400.00 for the third consecutive month .
She was sobbing .
She could n't keep up , she said , and the energy assistance had given her all the money they could for that season .
Her balance had climbed to over $ 1000.00 .
Here 's the kicker - her rented home was freezing , even though her furnace was running constantly .
Her landlord was unavailable , and even the city provided her with no relief .
She had to send her high school kids to bed with their winter overcoats , boots and mittens on .
I have spoken to many Sherrys ' in the exact same position .
A newly minted homeless mother of three calling to try and pay a 750.00 utility bill so she can protect her credit .
You see in Colorado , utility assistance does n't start until Nov 1 .
Her bill will go to collection first .
She does n't have the money for basics .
Her kids have never been homeless .
She was sobbing and crying and screaming down the phone about how she does n't know how to be homeless , and she never wanted to be homeless .
She had a good job , then her man left and she ran out of unemployment and she got evicted ' cause her son threw some shit at a neighbor .
She whispered in the phone help me help me .
I gave her a no money down extension for 3 months and told her to not worry about the bill ' cause we have to hook her up anyway it 's the law .
Take care of your kids , be strong for them , pull yourself together , do n't cry , you 're an awesome person .
I hung up and tears kept hitting the keyboard .
A sister of a male customer in Saint Paul , MN called crying .
' Do you know where Ray is ? ' she asked .
Sorry , I do n't understand .
' Ray lost his job of 27 years , he is mentally challenged and has been very depressed .
He got evicted so stop his service and put my phone number on a note on his account in case he calls to stop his service .
Please , please I beg you to have him call me if he calls .
His job was his life '
She hung up .
Lucia was visited by our door to door disconnector in New Mexico .
She had a modest past due bill , and the field collector had taken the unusual step of calling in for the customer to see if we could help .
After passing the phone over to Lucia , I asked for her special circumstances on what seemed to be the problem .
There , there , stop crying and tell me your story , I said .
' I work 3 jobs , and 2 have n't paid me in a month and the other only part pays me .
My children are hungry , and my husband left for Texas for some work and has n't got any yet .
I do n't know what to do .
I quietly explained to her that she has to tell me that she will pay something out loud or the field collector will disconnect .
She hesitated , ' But I ca n't lie , I 'm sorry , you 'll have to cut me off ' .
She passed the phone over to the collector , and I said '
Hey bud , pass this one by , as a favor , please ? '.
Sure , it 's your head dude , and he left her on .
I talked to Lucia for a good 45 minutes about how she cleans bed pans , makes food and cleaned the house for a month and then got stiffed on her pay .
Twice .
Same employer , though , as he ran a motel and had her clean rooms .
She was surviving on meager room tips .
She has an extra month of electricity but that 's all that can be done .
Esther , an older Wisconsin customer , called to complain about the low income rider that is on each and every electric bill in Wisconsin .
' Why do I have to pay for some fucking lazy Obama n****r so they can turn their furnace up to 80 and laugh at me ' .
After warning her about abusive language , I told her that it seemed to be a program that worked .
After all , I noted , no one has frozen to death in their homes here .
Esther blasted back ' Maybe they should freeze to death , that would get them off their assholes ' .
I am forbidden to hang up on a customer but did so without hesitation .
Kaycee , a young married mother who lives in Wisconsin with 3 kids and a husband who works for 10.00 an hour .
Kaycee told me she loved energy assistance , ' cause she paid some and the agency paid some , ' I do n't like just free energy , I like to pay some . '
We started talking about Badgercare , the free socialized medical insurance for low income working families in Wisconsin and how grateful we both were to live in Wisconsin .
Then she told me something that hit home .
She just starting recieving foodstamps , like myself , and she told me , 'For the first time , I felt like I could go and buy fresh veggies and fruits .
They were always a little too expensive before foodstamps and WIC .
We are eating healthier than ever . '
I admitted the same .
Life on the sharp end .
Nobody is nickeling and dimeing us , they 're gouging us hard - shitty wages , bank fees , and crappy landlords .
And here 's to endless unemployment checks for surviving this recession , ' cause people are drowning and starting to drown .
We need as much protection out there as possible , ' cause there 's a growing fringe that would just as well see us dead .
Update * thanks for all who care for the least fortunate among us .
Peace to all who are suffering this day .
Peace and hope .
An office secretary at Palmer Elementary School was charged Monday with false imprisonment and child abuse after allegedly taping the mouth and hands of a student last week .
Jennifer Carter , 45 , was arrested and issued a criminal summons on the misdemeanor charges .
She is accused of binding the the rowdy 6 - year - old with duct tape on Thursday .
He had been sent to the principal ’s office for being disruptive in class .
The first - grader ’s mother , Ashlye Tenner , said the charges were appropriate .
“ I ’m pleased that the DPD is taking this as seriously as I took it , ” she said .
“ I think this will send a message , obviously , to her , but also the principal , who did n’t handle it right , and to the school district that this kind of treatment of children is a serious matter and should n’t be tolerated . ”
Carter is placed on paid leave , but the school district intends to fire her , according to a statement issued this evening .
“ The district maintains its investigation of this matter and is working closely with the Denver Police Department , ” the district stated .
“ Based on the evidence confirmed at this stage of the investigation , the district is taking action to immediately terminate the employee .
“ This is a deeply troubling incident , and this type of conduct is completely reprehensible and inexcusable . ”
Supermarket Waitrose has pulled its advertising from Fox News after customers complained about presenter Glenn Beck 's remarks about US president Barack Obama .
Beck caused controversy when he said in July that he thought Mr Obama was " a racist " and a number of companies withdrew their advertising with the news channel .
He said the president 's reaction to the arrest of a black academic Henry Louis Gates in Cambridge , Massachusetts proved him to be " a guy who has a deep - seated hatred for white people or the white culture .
I do n't know what it is ... " .

A spokesman for Waitrose said that the company had withdrawn its advertising from the Fox News slot shown on Sky in Britain in response to customer concerns .
He said : " We have pulled it because we believe it 's the right thing to do .
Our customers ' views are important to us . "
A random comment I made on the blog In Mala Fide has made the rounds a bit .
It was in reference to the “ Men ’s Rights ” blogs and forums that I notice popping up everywhere .
Here ’s the comment :
I ’m not against Men ’s Rights , but a lot of these blogs are written by guys who have no game and ca n’t get laid , and serve as just an outlet for being a lifelong sexual loser .
It ’s like women who get around in their circles to complain about about how men are n’t sensitive or caring enough .
These guys dedicate their time to complaining about feminists or marriage , yet they have zero experience with either !
I suspect they are anti-social , bitter virgins who simply do n’t have anything else to do with their bountiful free time , too fearful of putting their fragile ego on the line to be a man and actually get laid .
They have draining corporate gigs and the only thing they have to look forward to are weekly visits to Chipotle Mexican Grill .
In fact you will not go wrong in life by not listening to a man who ca n’t get laid .
He can be very intelligent but his thoughts are not based on the “ real world ” where there are guys banging and traveling and starting businesses and having a good time with life .
Thinking without doing is nothing but masturbation , something that I suspect these MR bloggers do a lot of .
Now I want you to brace yourself for what I ’m about to tell you .
You braced ?
A lot of guys in the Men ’s Rights community do not believe that game works .
Yeah I spit out my vitamin water on the monitor too .
Do n’t believe me ?
Try wallowing through these threads :
Is the “ PUA ” approach to women valid ?
Why the PUAs are winning
( This is a good opportunity to gripe about the misuse of the acronym PUA .
It stands for pick - up artist , which is a man who uses the art of game to pick up women .
If you say , “ I do n’t know if I believe in PUA , ” you ’re saying “ I do n’t know if I believe in pick - up artist . ”
That does n’t make sense .
Game is a philosophy ( or lifestyle ) that is mastered by guys who can be called pick - up artists or players or whatever .
I prefer the player term , though it does n’t seem to be popular among white males . )
Pretend you ’re me for a second , and you ’ve read comment after comment by guys who do n’t believe in game , when you yourself have made a complete 180 because of it .
What further proof can I offer than myself , a sexless wonder who started getting laid only after studying and practicing game ?
Unfortunately no proof is enough for Men ’s Rights followers .
I can film my pickups from start to end , using several lines that are word - for - word what you can find here or in Bang , film the resulting three - minute sex act and declarations of affection from the girl , and they ’ll still find some way to rationalize that I ’m not using game at all .
They ’ll say I ’m a natural , when they do n’t understand I ’ve been working on my game every week for going on nine years .
They ’ll say , “ Roosh is naturally funny , or charming , or okay looking .
I ’m sure he would do well even without game . ”
Wrong .
I ’m “ funny ” because I ’ve practiced my jokes on hundreds of girls .
I ’m “ charming ” because I ’ve measured the reactions of women to see what works and what does n’t , and kept only that which got the result I wanted .
I ’m “ okay looking ” because I work out , tried different styles , learned how to carry myself , and have rigorously experimented with different hair and beard configurations .
I can tell you right now where a Jesus haircut would work well for me versus a hipster shag cut .
If you see me pick up today it does look very natural because I ’ve integrated all these game component parts into something fluid that works a good percentage of the time , but there was absolutely nothing fluid about my initial attempts to overcome my inability to get laid .
I do n’t hide from you guys that I ’ve been rejected a million times .
Of course I still get rejected to this day , by girls who for some odd reason do n’t want to bang me .
If you ’ve read A Dead Bat In Paraguay you saw how bad it can get .
But I ’m very open to learning , and I continue to do so no matter how satisfied I ’ve become with where I ’m at .
For example I used the lessons from those tough six months in South America to come to Colombia and do pretty well with the women .
In fact I almost wish I had more troubles so that I would have a “ problem ” to base a sequel on .
But there are none , and I know no one wants to read a memoir about a guy who is happy and getting what he wants .
Then the Men ’s Rights guys will say , “ But he is SELLING books . ”
Yes because anyone who ’s passionate enough about a topic to spend months or years to compile their life experiences into works that teach others cannot be trusted .
If someone has written a book or produced anything of value , do not listen to them !
They ’re ruthless businessmen in disguise !
I would n’t even listen to someone who has a blog because they ’re obviously doing it for the fame of receiving many visitors or comments ( and in the case of male bloggers , groupies ) .
Or else they would simply maintain a diary that rests inside their nightstand .
They blog mainly for their ego .
Same for people who post on the same forums for years .
They have an ulterior motive of wanting to feel special in knowing that other people respect their four - digit post count and are getting something out of their words .
In fact if you think about it , anyone who shares knowledge is suspect .
Lately I only gain knowledge from homeless men who talk outloud to themselves because they ’re not doing it for money , fame , ego , attention or any type of satisfaction that comes from helping others .
Approach anyone else ’s words with extreme hesitation .
Hyperbole aside , all men can learn and improve , whether it ’s in business , women , sports , or Chinese checkers .
To think that getting laid is genetically determined and that you ca n’t improve — what a horrible way to live !
If I had to accept my lot I would probably be in some shitty job not getting laid and feeling miserable about how “ unlucky ” I am while complaining about how much women suck .
I would be a Men ’s Rights follower .
I would camp out on blogs and forums all day posting “ intellectual ” comments for other guys who are socially awkward because they are too scared to step away from the computer monitor for one minute and take some social risk by practicing conversation with attractive women .
But if you tell them , “ Bro , you need to approach a girl and get some action , ” they ’ll say , “ Stop using shaming language on me ! ”
That ’s their comeback .
It ’s like a little boy on the playground saying , “ Do n’t make fun of me !
I like eating my boogers ! ”
For guys who supposedly love using logic , they are completely unable to properly defend their lack of action , and have insulated themselves in a protective internet bubble where they gang up on the slightest bit of dissent by saying it makes them feel ashamed .
They ca n’t get laid , they supposedly do n’t like women ( especially Western women ) and do n’t want to work to bang them , yet they whine and bitch about women all day long .
Now I ’ve whined and bitched about women plenty on this blog , and I think it ’s especially fun to get on feminsts and American women , but at the end of the day I ’m also banging feminists and American women , drinking with them , having a laugh with them , and cuddling with them until I get bored and need a break from their sense of entitlement and masculine attitudes .
Variety is the spice of life and the reason you ’re reading me right now is because of the wide range of experiences I ’ve had with many different types of women .
While I would n’t mind being a one - hit - wonder by wearing my plaid shirt every night and going to a hipster bar in D.C. to get laid with minimal effort , there would n’t be much advice I can share for men of the world .
The bottom line is that a real man puts himself in new , challenging environments and pushes the limits of his ability and character to get what he truly desires .
I greatly admire the 21 - year - old who goes onto my forum and posts about a brutal rejection , but perserveres and weeks later shares a success story .
I admire the three guys I met in Medellin who all rolled up with little Spanish but got their flags in less than two weeks after approaching like machines day and night .
I admire the guy who I saw do his first ever bookstore approach and get a long - term girlfriend out of it .
You think they give a shit about Men ’s Rights ?
No , because they use game to get laid with the women they want .
They believe in action to accomplish their goals , not mental masturbation with a bunch of guys who have trouble telling you what a vagina feels like , yet ca n’t stop obsessing over it .
Der Vertrieb von Pornografie ist in Deutschland nicht verboten .
Der Besitz schon gar nicht .
Wer Pornografie vertreiben will , muss aber den strengen Jugendschutz - Anforderungen in Deutschland genügen – wenn er in Deutschland seinen Firmensitz hat .
Es muss durch ein wirksames System sichergestellt sein , dass nur Erwachsene an das Material kommen .
Das gilt auch fürs Internet .
Die Vorstellungen , was eine wirksame Altersverifikation ist , gehen weit auseinander .
Die Gerichte legen strengste Maßstäbe an .
In der Praxis wird alles als unsicher verworfen , von der Eingabe der Kreditkarten - bzw .
Personalausweisnummer bis zur Übersendung des Personalausweises in Fotokopie .
Lediglich das POSTIDENT - Verfahren scheint derzeit Gnade vor den Augen der Justiz zu finden .
Kein Wunder :
Es ist nicht nur zweifellos schwer zu umgehen , sondern auch teuer und so umständlich , dass kaum ein Kunde bereit ist , den Download von Pornos erst mal mit einem Besuch auf dem Postamt einschließlich Papierkram und Ausweiskontrolle einzuläuten .
Aber auch schon deshalb wird niemand POSTIDENT über sich ergehen lassen , weil es unendlich viele ausländische Bezahlangebote gibt , für die das deutsche Recht nicht gilt .
Entsprechend den dortigen Gesetzen reicht der Altersnachweis meist durch Angabe einer gültigen Kreditkarte – wenn es in den betreffenden Ländern überhaupt Jugendschutzbestimmungen für die Verbreitung normaler Pornografie gibt .
Der deutsche Käufer , der aus dem Ausland lädt , geht dabei kein Risiko ein , denn die Strafvorschriften für Verbreitung gelten nur auf der Verkäufer - , nicht aber auf der Käuferseite .
Diese faktische Wettbewerbsverzerrung erzürnt die deutschen Pornoproduzenten seit langem .
Nun haben sie auch vor dem höchsten deutschen Gericht kein Gehör gefunden .
Das Bundesverfassungsgericht hat Beschwerden , unter anderem gegen die strengen Anforderungen im Bereich der Altersverifikation , per Beschluss gar nicht zur Entscheidung angenommen .
Die in Deutschland sitzenden Produzenten müssen weiter zusehen , wie ihnen die ausländische Konkurrenz das Geschäft wegnimmt .
Oder sie ziehen halt auch aus Deutschland weg .
Oder verlagern zumindest ihre Online - Angebote rechtssicher über die Grenzen .
Dass nicht nur Arbeitsplätze verloren gehen , sondern bei der derzeitigen Situation kein einziger Minderjähriger tatsächlich wirksam „ geschützt “ wird , braucht ja nicht zu stören .
An interesting article from The Economist discussing the merits of workers ' co-operatives as a means to avoid class conflict in a time of recession .
These are difficult times for the Fagor appliance factory in Mondragón , in northern Spain .
Sales have seized up , as at many other white - goods companies .
Workers had four weeks ’ pay docked at Christmas .
Some have been laid off .
Now salaries are about to be cut by 8 % .
Time for Spain ’s mighty unions to call a strike ?
Not at Fagor — for here the decisions are taken by the workers themselves .
Fagor is a workers ’ co-operative , one of dozens that dot the valleys of Spain ’s hilly northern Basque country .
Most belong to the world ’s biggest group of co-operatives , the Mondragón Corporation .
It is Spain ’s seventh - largest industrial group , with interests ranging from supermarkets and finance to white goods and car parts .
It accounts for 4 % of GDP in the Basque country , a region of 2 m people .
All this has made Mondragón a model for co-operatives from California to Queensland .
How will co-ops , with their ideals of equity and democracy , cope in the recession ?
Workers ’ co-ops are often seen as hotbeds of radical , anti-capitalist thought .
Images of hippies , earnest vegetarians or executives in blue overalls could not , however , be further from reality .
“ We are private companies that work in the same market as everybody else , ” says Mikel Zabala , Mondragón ’s human - resources chief .
“ We are exposed to the same conditions as our competitors . ”
Problems may be shared with competitors , but solutions are not .
A workers ’ co-op has its hands tied .
It can not make members redundant or , in Mondragón ’s case , sell companies or divisions .
Losses in one unit are covered by the others .
“ It can be painful at times , when you are earning , to give to the rest , ” Mr Zabala admits .
Lossmaking co-ops can be closed , but members must be re-employed within a 50 km ( 30 - mile ) radius .
That may sound like a nightmare for managers battling recession .
But co-ops also have their advantages .
Lay - offs , short hours and wage cuts can be achieved without strikes , and agreements are reached faster than in companies that must negotiate with unions and government bodies under Spanish labour law .
Workers ’ co-ops are often seen as hotbeds of radical , anti-capitalist thought .
Images of hippies , earnest vegetarians or executives in blue overalls could not , however , be further from reality .
The 13,000 members of Eroski , another co-operative in the Mondragón group and Spain ’s second - largest retailer , have not just frozen their salaries this year .
They have also given up their annual dividend on their individual stakes in the company .
A constant flow of information to worker - owners , says Mr Zabala , makes them ready to take painful decisions .
It sounds conflict - free , but that is misleading .
One of Mondragón ’s many paradoxes is that worker - owners are also the bosses of other workers .
People have been hired in far - flung places , from America to China , as the group has expanded .
It now has more subsidiary companies than co-operatives .
Mondragón has two employees for every co-op member .
The result is a two - tier system .
And when recession bites , non-member employees suffer most .
They are already losing jobs as temporary contracts are not renewed .
Like capitalist bosses , the Mondragón co-operativists must , indeed , occasionally handle strikes and trade - union trouble .
Some worry that Mondragón - style success kills the idealism on which most co-ops are based .
Those within the Mondragón group are aware of the danger .
Eroski wants to offer co-op membership to its 38,500 salaried employees .
The most successful co-ops , however , are those least shackled by ideology .
Mondragón used to cap managers ’ pay at three times that of the lowest - paid co-operativist , for example .
But it realised it was losing its best managers , and that some non-member managers were earning more than member managers .
The cap was raised to eight times .
But this is still 30 % below market rates , and some managers are still tempted away .
“ Frankly , it would be a bad sign if nobody was , ” says Adrián Celaya , Mondragón ’s general secretary .
Lately Mondragón has had trouble keeping successful co-operatives locked in .
Irizar , a maker of luxury coaches , split off last year , reportedly because it no longer wanted to support lossmaking co-ops elsewhere in the group .
Henry Hansmann , a professor at Yale Law School , says co-ops often fall apart when worker - owners become too diverse .
He points to United Airlines — not a co-operative , but once mainly owned by workers from competing trade unions — as an example of how clashing interests can kill worker ownership .
By bringing in tens of thousands of new members at Eroski , many far from the Basque country , Mondragón risks falling into that trap .
The group ’s bosses believe , however , that the way forward is to promote the idea that co-operativism brings advantages .
The global downturn may strengthen the group internally .
As unemployment sweeps the globe , after all , there is no greater social glue than the fight to keep jobs .
Dear jeebus , seriously , will someone just shoot me in the freaking head if this abject insanity gets any worse ?
Words just seriously fail for the levels of batshit craziness being gobbled up by the poundful on both the far right and the far - far - right :
For the past couple of weeks , Fox News ’ Sean Hannity has been aggressively pushing the talking point that the Obama White House is compiling an “ enemies list . ”
That wild accusation came in response to Obama communications director Anita Dunn ’s suggestion that Fox News operates as a “ communications arm ” of the GOP .
“ I mean , is this an enemies list ?
Seems like it to me , ” Hannity said on his program last Wednesday .
“ They want to come after the Fox News Channel , ” the right - wing pundit complained .
Almost every night in recent weeks , Hannity has badgered his guests , demanding that they take up his talking point .
Last night , Liz Cheney took the bait : HANNITY : It seems to me , it ’s almost like an enemies list .
Is that a fair description ?
CHENEY : Well , uhh , yeah .
On Fox News Sunday this past weekend , Karl Rove propagated the talking point .
“ Let ’s not kid ourselves — this is the White House engaging in its own version of a media enemies list , ” Rove said .
Yesterday , Hannity won his biggest convert yet .
Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - TN ) took to the Senate floor and read Sean Hannity ’s talking points into the congressional record : ALEXANDER : I want to make what I hope will be a friendly suggestion to President Obama and his White House , and it is this : do n’t create an enemies list . [ … ]
So in conclusion Mr. President , here ’s my point .
These are unusually difficult times with plenty of forces encouraging us to disagree .
Let ’s not start calling people out and compiling an enemies list .
Seriously .
I hardly have the snark in my quiver to fully address this .
I am going to be sooooo fucking tired by the end of Obama ’s eight years in office …
By the way , how do you like that Globe cover up above ?
Did you notice who they think is on Obama ’s nefarious “ enemies list ” ?
Toby Keith – the country singer !
If some mouth - breathing , 400 - lb redneck housewife in Tuscaloosa reads that article and seriously comes to believe that Barack Obama actually gives a fuck about Toby Keith — off to the death panel with her .
Forthwith .
Mycocepurus smithii ants tending their fungus garden .
These are the only known completely asexual ants in the world .

Do not use without permission .
The complete asexuality of a widespread fungus - gardening ant , the only ant species in the world known to have dispensed with males entirely , has been confirmed by a team of Texas and Brazilian researchers .
Most social insects — the wasps , ants and bees — are relatively used to daily life without males .
Their colonies are well run by swarms of sterile sisters lorded over by an egg - laying queen .
But , eventually , all social insect species have the ability to produce a crop of males who go forth in the world to fertilize new queens and propagate .
Queens of the ant Mycocepurus smithii reproduce without fertilization and males appear to be completely absent , report Christian Rabeling , Ulrich Mueller and their Brazilian colleagues in PLoS ONE this week .
" Animals that are completely asexual are relatively rare , which makes this is a very interesting ant , " says Rabeling , an ecology , evolution and behavior graduate student at The University of Texas at Austin .
" Asexual species do n't mix their genes through recombination , so you expect harmful mutations to accumulate over time and for the species to go extinct more quickly than others .
They do n't generally persist for very long over evolutionary time . "
Previous studies of the ants from Puerto Rico and Panama have pointed toward the ants being completely asexual .
One study in particular , by Mueller and former graduate student Anna Himler ( now at Arizona State University ) , showed that the ants reproduced in the lab without males , and that no amount of stress induced the production of males .
Scientists believed that specimens of male ants previously collected in Brazil in the 1960s could be males of M. smithii .
If males of the species existed , it would suggest that — at least from time to time — the ants reproduce sexually .
Rabeling analyzed the males in question and discovered that they belonged to another closely related ( sexually reproducing ) species of fungus - farmer , Mycocepurus obsoletus , thus establishing that no males are known to exist for M. smithii .
He also dissected reproducing M. smithii queens from Brazil and found that their sperm storage organs were empty .
Taken together with the previous studies of the ants , Rabeling and his colleagues have concluded that the species is very likely to be totally asexual across its entire range , from Northern Mexico through Central America to Brazil , including some Caribbean islands .
As for the age of the species , the scientists estimate the ants could have first evolved within the last one to two million years , a very young species given that the fungus - farming ants evolved 50 million years ago .
Rabeling says he is using genetic markers to study the evolution and systematics of the fungus - gardening ants and this will help determine the date of the appearance and genetic mechanism of asexual reproduction more precisely in the near future .

On the last day of her life I took her to the graveyard and thought about Fall .
It was August 31st , the completion of summer to my way of thinking .
I love Fall .
It ’s my favorite season and I think it has something to do with the light .
The glare of summer is softened and there seems to be a quietness , a gentleness afoot .
It seems still out .
It was evening when we went and I was n’t even going to take her at first .
I go to the graveyard at least once a week and always in the evening to repose and consort with the dead .
It ’s so very quiet there , especially in the evening , and I love the way the loneliness feels against my skin .
I felt guilty , though , because I was having her killed at 11 am the next morning .
Halfway there , I turned around and went home and got her .
I sat her in the backseat , noticing how happy she looked and how bright her eyes were .
Although morning is a very close second , the evening of the day is my favorite .
It is a settled and relaxed time that for some reason perks me up , stimulates me .
My mind gets going with a clarity not usually present at other times .
The same could be said about Fall , I suppose .
The evening of the year .
She looked happy sniffing around the tombstones .
She would look at me , her mouth open and her tongue hanging and her eyes shining .
It was her smile .
She was smiling at me .
I noticed that the Sun was setting .
Sometimes I do n’t notice , so lost am I in other thoughts , but that day I did .
Gone from its perch up high , it was now relegated to the side of the sky by the inevitable rotation of the Earth .
It protested fiercely with fiery , explosive beauty .
It captured me and I knew I would remain there in the graveyard with her until it weakened and finally failed .
It was the least I could do .
It was the least .
I watched , never taking my eyes off it .
It grew angrier and angrier , yet I remained serene , contemplating the ends of things and places and times .
There are beginnings and middles and ends
( and I know what holds the most beauty )
The End

An impression of what " Ardi " would have looked like based on the fossil finds
An ancient human - like creature that may be a direct ancestor to our species has been described by researchers .
The assessment of the 4.4 - million - year - old animal called Ardipithecus ramidus is reported in the journal Science .
Even if it is not on the direct line to us , it offers new insights into how we evolved from the common ancestor we share with chimps , the team says .
Fossils of A. ramidus were first found in Ethiopia in 1992 , but it has taken 17 years to assess their significance .
The most important specimen is a partial skeleton of a female nicknamed " Ardi " .
If Ardipithecus ramidus was not actually the species directly ancestral to us , she must have been closely related to it
The Ardipithecus project team
The international team has recovered key bones , including the skull with teeth , arms , hands , pelvis , legs , and feet .
But the researchers have other fragments that may represent perhaps at least 36 different individuals , including youngsters , males , and females .
One of the lead scientists on the project , Professor Tim White from the University of California , Berkeley , said the investigation had been painstaking .
" It took us many , many years to clean the bones in the National Museum of Ethiopia and then set about to restore this skeleton to its original dimensions and form ; and then study it and compare it with all the other fossils that are known from Africa and elsewhere , as well as with the modern age , " he told the journal .
" This is not an ordinary fossil .
It 's not a chimp .
It 's not a human .
It shows us what we used to be . "
Tree life
The fossils come from the Middle Awash study area in the Afar Rift , about 230 km northeast of Addis Ababa , Ethiopia 's capital .

Some of the characteristics of the animal 's skeleton are said to echo features seen in very ancient apes ; others presage traits seen in later , more human - like species .
The scientists say 1.2 m - high ( 4ft ) Ardi was good at climbing trees but also walked on two feet .
However she did not have arched feet like us , indicating that she could not walk or run for long distances .
" She has opposable great toes and she has a pelvis that allows her to negotiate tree branches rather well , " explained team - member Professor Owen Lovejoy , from Kent State University , Ohio .
" So half of her life is spent in the trees ; she would have nested in trees and occasionally fed in trees , but when she was on the ground she walked upright pretty close to how you and I walk , " he told BBC News .
That she lived in what would have been a wooded area 4.4 million years ago is somewhat challenging , says the team .
It had been thought that early human evolution was driven , if only in part , by the disappearance of trees - encouraging our ancestors to walk on the ground .
" These creatures were living and dying in a woodland habitat , not an open savannah , " said Professor White .
Because of its age , Ardipithecus is said to take science closer to the yet - to - be - found last common ancestor with chimps , our close genetic relatives .
And because many of Ardipithecus ' traits do not appear in modern - day African apes , it suggests this common ancestor may have existed much further back in time than had previously been supposed - perhaps seven or nine million years ago .
Comparisons with modern chimp and gorilla anatomy also underline just how much these African apes themselves have evolved since parting company with the line that led eventually to modern humans .
Rapid evolution Asked whether A. ramidus was our direct ancestor or not , the team said more fossils from different places and time periods were needed to answer the question .
" We will need many more fossil recoveries from the period of 3 - 5 million years ago to confidently answer that question in the future , " the scientists said in a briefing document that accompanied their journal papers .
" But if Ardipithecus ramidus was not actually the species directly ancestral to us , she must have been closely related to it , and would have been similar in appearance and adaptation .
It has been a 17 - year investigation to assess the discoveries Independent experts in the field are struck by how primitive Ardipithecus appears compared with the Australopithecines , another group of hominid ( human - like ) creatures from Africa that lived slightly nearer to us in time .
One species in particular , Australopithecus afarensis , the famous " Lucy " fossil found in 1974 , is very strongly linked into the human story because of its developed walking ability .
For Ardipithecus ramidus to also sit on that direct line seemed to require some rapid evolutionary change , commented Professor Chris Stringer from London 's Natural History museum .
" With Australopithecus starting from four million years ago , one would have thought that things would have moved further down the line by 4.4 million years ago , " he told BBC News .
" OK , you can have very rapid change , perhaps ; or Ardipithecus might be a residual form , a relic of a somewhat older stage of evolution that had carried on .
Perhaps we will find something more like Australopithecus at 4.4 million years old somewhere else in Africa . "

“ A woman at the Wall is like a pig at the Wall . ”
This was the statement made by Yehuda Getz , the late Chief Rabbi of the Western Wall in Jerusalem , following one of the most shocking demonstrations of violence at one of Judaism ’s holiest shrines — the Kotel ( Western Wall ) — on a bleak December morning in 1988 .
What had happened ?
Rivka Haut , an Orthodox Jewish woman from Borough Park , Brooklyn , had decided to organize the first women ’s Rosh Chodesh ( welcoming of the new month ) Torah reading at the Western Wall , complete with a Torah scroll and wearing tallitot ( prayer shawls ) .
Calling themselves “ The Women of the Wall , ” the group of 70 Jewish women assembled quietly on the women ’s side of the wall at 7 a.m. and began to pray .
By 7:20 , they were gone ; driven away by Ultra - Orthodox men , who caused a near riot .
When the women opened the Torah scroll , the men began to throw chairs , hurl verbal abuse , and spit on them , and the police did nothing to curb the violence .
Haut was injured when she was hit over the head with a chair .
The incident was the first of its kind , but it was n’t the last .
Over the past two decades , the Women of the Wall ’s efforts have been met with attacks by both Orthodox men and women at the Kotel , ranging from throwing chairs and feces to attacks by Israeli police with tear gas .
Twenty years later , Yael Katzir ’s powerful documentary , Praying in her Own Voice , takes an up - close - and - personal look at the ongoing struggles of the Women of the Wall as the group continues to seek the right to read from the Torah at the Western Wall .
It ’s a battle that has seen the group take their case all the way to the Israeli Supreme Court .
Thanks to Katzir ’s film , the Women of the Wall have achieved more exposure , recognition , and discussion in the last 20 months than the movement itself has in the last 20 years .
Katzir , a secular Israeli , has spent years following these women and documenting their plight ; and her film has finally managed to put the issues of feminism , equality , and the status of Jewish women front and center .
Anat Hoffman , a prominent Israeli activist , notes in the film , “ Israel markets the Kotel as a symbol of unity … how can there be unity when half the population is silenced ? ”
And , she adds , a Supreme Court ruling states that if a woman dares to read from the Torah or wear a tallit at the Kotel , she can be imprisoned for seven years .
The Women of the Wall are still continuing their fight , and now the issue is gaining more traction in Jewish communities outside of Israel thanks to Katzir ’s film .
It also helps that six prominent American female rabbis ( Laura Geller , Lisa Edwards , Sharon Brous , Lynn Brody , Naomi Levy and Denise Eger ) are all interviewed in the documentary .
Katzir had no way of knowing when she started to film that in 2008 Eger would conduct California ’s first same - sex marriage on the steps of the Beverly Hills courthouse , and in 2009 be appointed as the President of the Board of Rabbis of Southern California .
Yet Eger ’s rise in prominence has surely helped boost the plight of the Women of the Wall .
Dan Katzir is
Yael ’s son and a documentary filmmaker in his own right who lives in Los Angeles .
Together with Ravit Markus and their company New Love Films , Katzir produced Praying in her Own Voice , and has been touring the film festival circuit around the country with the movie .
He says it was extremely important to include the rabbis in the film to help clarify to American audiences how important the film ’s issue is .
“ We had one man come to the Los Angeles Israeli Film Festival screening last year and say , ‘ Who cares about this film ? ’
But when he saw that Orthodox women came to the screening and started screaming and calling the film a ‘ disgrace ’ and had to be escorted out of the theater , the man suddenly realized [ the film ’s ] importance .
This [ incident ] took place in West Hollywood in the 21st century and it still caused a stir , ” Katzir notes .
Reaching out to an audience beyond Israel is key for several reasons , Katzir says .
“ In Israel the film did n’t really resonate with anyone , because there you ’re either Orthodox or secular .
The Orthodox do n’t question anything and the secular hate the Orthodox , so they see the film as just another example of how primitive Orthodox Judaism is . ”
Most important , Katzir says , are the comments made in the film by Rabbi David Hartmann of Jerusalem ’s Shalom Institute .
“ He basically says the future of Judaism rests on the issue of the Women of the Wall , ” says Katzir .
“ The Judaism of today is not the Judaism of 3,000 years ago , but the role of women has n’t changed in that time .
If Judaism does n’t change its attitudes and adapt to the 21st century , then according to Hartmann it will stop being a relevant religion . ”
“ The Women of the Wall are a very clear and precise metaphor for this battle , ” Katzir notes , adding that even Reform Judaism , which has the most liberal attitudes towards women in Judaism , still only began to allow the ordination women rabbis in the last 30 years .
And yet , it ’s only in the past year that the film has really gained a strong following .
It took time , Katzir says , because many film festivals felt the documentary was too controversial to be screened .
“ I spoke to the head of one festival and said , ‘ You show films about Palestinian causes , Jewish causes , homosexuality , lesbianism , rape , and incest , but a film about the role of women in Judaism is too controversial ? ’ ”
Katzir says he hopes that the film will make people become more proactive in helping the Women of the Wall with their plight ; even if Jewish women who now travel to Israel simply make a point of going to the Kotel and praying with them ( they currently pray in a designated space away from the main section of the Kotel ) .
“ I also hope people come away from this film with an understanding that Judaism still has a lot of places where things need to change . ”

The first thing a president must have is decorum .
You would never see Ronald Reagan twitch like that , make that type of unabashed challenge to a lowly backbencher .

While I understand that the comment was inappropriate all eyes were on Obama and not Joe Wilson .

Mathews : Hi , this is Chris Mathews on Hardball .
We ’re going to be talking about “ The Twitch ” with a Democratic consultant .
Did n’t Obama make a real mistake with that Twitch ?
Democratic Consultant :
Well , I ’ll admit it was n’t Obama ’s best moment , but he was doing it in response to a comment .
Mathews : Come on Joe Wilson is a nothing , a nobody , and hey , we all know what that twitch means .
I ’m a lunch bucket kind of guy , I ’ve been in bars , I have a sister .
Democratic Consultant :
Well we need to admit Obama made a mistake with the Twitch and try and move on and pass health care .

Obama ’s Twitch is causing him enormous trouble .
It ’s hard to believe this type of blowback .
How did the White House lose control of an issue that should have played in their favor ?

Television chatshow king David Letterman has confessed to a string of affairs with female employees after falling victim to a $ 2 m ( £ 1.2 m ) blackmail plot .
The long - time host of America 's top-rated Late Show admitted his dalliances to his studio audience last night after giving testimony to a grand jury in New York about the alleged extortion .
The suspect , Robert J " Joe " Halderman , was arrested yesterday and indicted on one count of attempted first - degree grand larceny , punishable from five to 15 years upon conviction , Manhattan district attorney Robert Morgenthau said .
Letterman , 62 , said he was sent a letter by a man who threatened to reveal " terrible things " about his life in a film screenplay and book he was writing , unless the star paid up .
" What was all this creepy stuff ? " said Letterman , who is married with a five - year - old son .
" It was that I have had sex with women who work for me on this show .
My response to that is yes , I have had sex with women on my show .
" Would it be embarrassing if it were made public ?
Perhaps it would , especially for the women . "
A sombre - faced Letterman made the admission as the audience laughed and cheered , clearly believing his monologue during last night 's show to be a joke .
The star did not say when the affairs took place , but explained that he felt menaced by the blackmail attempt , which began when he found a package in the back of his car as he went to work one morning about three weeks ago .
" There was a letter in the package .
It says , ' I know you do some terrible things , ' " he said .
" It 's a guy who 's going to make a screenplay about me , he 's going to take all this terrible stuff he knows about my life and put it in a movie unless I give him some money . "
Letterman , who is one of American television 's highest - paid performers with an annual salary of more than $ 31 m , said he took the package to the special prosecutions bureau of the Manhattan district attorney 's office , who helped set up a meeting with the alleged blackmailer at which a fake cheque for $ 2 m was handed over .
It led to the arrest of Halderman yesterday , said to be an employee with the same CBS network who works on the true - crime show 48 hours .
Halderman has been suspended .
Letterman was summoned to a grand jury hearing later yesterday at which he gave his side of the story .
The jury will decide if there is enough evidence to bring charges .
" It 's been a very bizarre experience , " Letterman said .
" I feel the need to protect my family , my job , my friends and everyone who has been supportive .
I do n't plan to say much more about it . "
Letterman , who was divorced from his first wife in 1977 , married his girlfriend Regina Lasko in March , more than 20 years after they began dating .
Their son Harry was born in 2003 , 10 years after he took over as host of the Late Show .
The star has had to contend with a number of stalkers during his career .
In 1998 , Margaret Ray , who has schizophrenia , spent two years in prison and a mental institution for breaking into his home and driving his Porsche .
She then killed herself by kneeling in front of a train .
In 2005 , police foiled a plot to snatch Letterman 's then 16 - month - old son Harry from his 2,700 - acre Montana ranch and hold him for a $ 5 m ransom .
Kelly Frank , who worked as a handyman on the ranch , was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in jail .
In December 2005 a judge in New Mexico granted a restraining order against Letterman to a woman who claimed he was sending her coded proposals of marriage through his television show .
The infatuated fan , Colleen Nestler , accused the star of mental harassment by sending her " thoughts of love " across the airwaves .
Letterman 's lawyers quickly succeeded in having the temporary order quashed , claiming it was a " ludicrous abuse of the judicial process " .
When dot com v1.0 when pop , remember how all those consumer plays that were floating on bloated bubble economics all suddenly re-invented and re-packaged themselves for the business market .

I love how Visto 1999 mentions the word free , four times in its product description , yet I ca n’t seem to find the same word anywhere in its latest marketing gumpf .
Funny how , when the bubble pops companies suddenly need to develop a revenue model , which for Visto was primarily selling through wireless carriers .
Oh , and of course , of late , it ’s worked out an even better revenue model – suing companies like Microsoft and RIM .
So with this in mind , I started to get nostalgia flashbacks when I found out that one of my favourite , but most frustrating Web 2.0 companies , Trumba , announced that it has decided to re-model itself around selling to businesses ; ie people that are actually likely to pay .
You might remember I was non -too kind to the Trumba folk in my post When Good Ideas Go Bad .
I suggested that rather than going after the ordinary consumer they would have been much better off trying to provide the calendar engine to developers , publishers , app builders , etc .
Just about every portal , just about every intranet , every piece of CRM software has calendar functionality that they ’ve had to pay their developers or external developers to build .
Trumba should have set itself with being the calendar inside every online application in the planet .
It should have been built from the ground up as a white label application , easily deployed and integrated into whatever you were building .
Trumba ’s Ted Johnson left a comment on Squash last week saying :
We agree .
Chasing the consumer with a pay - for service was n’t a winning strategy .
Yesterday we announced a refocus on businesses and organizations that need to communicate event information .
See the press release or the updated web site .
Among the messages on the new Trumba website are : “ We focus on calendar communications so you do n’t have to ” .
And it lists its technical benefits as :
Trumba calendar tools allow you to upgrade your website calendar almost instantly .
Reduce development time
Enable direct content updates by the content owners
Increase calendar reliability , security , and performance
Get updates and feature upgrades automatically
I wonder how much of their $ 8 million in VC funding Trumba burnt chasing the consumer holy grail ?
And Trumba actually did start down that path with a business model ( admittedly not a very good one ) .
A lot of these Web 2.0 start - ups will have been going for about a year now .
A lot will be feeling the pinch .
Most people can bootstrap a start - up for 12 months but it starts to get really tough , if you want to do it for any longer than that .
I very much expect to see a rash of Writely - style acquisitions over the next 12 months .
Start - ups facing up to the reality that they ’re not making any money and therefore finally coming to the realisation that they ’re never going to crack the mega pay - day .
So they ’ll sell to one of the big boys for a handy exit sum and a good job in the process .
Sure beats bootstrapping , hey ?
But it ’s a far cry from the Web 2.0 hype that has built up this expectation of dot com daze revisted …
The good news is that companies like Trumba are already taking corrective action before they ’ve got one foot in the grave .
Companies like Writely are taking reasonable exits rather than holding out for the motza .
So these is a semblance of sense starting to infiltrate the Web 2.0 economy .
For those reasons , I do n’t think we ’re in a bubble .
As a company like News comes into play talking up big acquisitions and inflating the environment , simultaneously there seems to be a slow - release valve leaking the pressure out of it because enough of us learnt enough lessons from the first time around .
Web 2.0 is already fizzing .
But it ’s a good thing .
