It 's been a busy couple of weeks for the world 's most famous ball of ground flesh and byproducts .
With the release of the sixth season of Aqua Teen Hunger Force on DVD Tuesday , Meatwad ( pictured ) had to leave his grill behind while he toured the world 's media capitals publicizing the new two - disc set .
The shape - shifting superstar plopped down with Wired.com for 20 questions on the Adult Swim animated hit , the quest for the perfect hot dog and what makes this would - be patty sizzle .
Wired.com : Do you remember the animal (s ) from which you were originally ground ?
Meatwad : I 've got a tough side , and a sweet side , like Mr. T .
So they probably ground up some mighty beasts , like two lions and a cobra .
Then something cute .
A panda perhaps .
Wired.com : Did you ever dream you'd be a star when you were first patted ?
Meatwad :
One time I dreamt that I was riding a pony with Lionel Ritchie and Carrot Top on the back .
Carrot Top turned into a big pizza and then we went to a playground .
That was a good dream .
Wired.com :
If you were n't meat , what food group would you like to be ?
Meatwad : Dippin ' Dots .
You get to go into outer space and be the dessert for astronauts like Lance Bass .
Wired.com :
What 's your position on condiments ?
Meatwad : Ketchup can turn pretty much anything into a good meal .
Empty your pockets and put it on whatever you got in there .
Your taste buds will thank you .
Wired.com :
What was the audition process like for Adult Swim ?
Meatwad : I was frisked several times before I entered the building , but then I realized that I was n't in the building at all , but behind it in a kudzu patch .
That man was lonely .
Wired.com : Your image graces Halloween costumes , throw pillows , stuffed animals and action figures .
Have you had any other merchandising ideas ?
Meatwad :
They crazy !
They made a Meatwad artificial hand that did n't sell very well , but it was n't so ... lifelike .
No fingers or anything .
But it was a dead ringer for me , I 'll give 'em that .
Still though , I think it was a good conversational piece for the price point .
Wired.com :
Who are your acting role models ?
Meatwad : Teen Wolf .
I wish I could do that .
When you transform , you go from zero to hero !
Wired.com :
What 's your relationship status right now ?
Are you really the player you portray on TV ?
Meatwad : I do n't want to be one of those guys that leaves a trail of broken hearts wherever he goes .
So I mostly just eat .
I have a good relationship with foods of all races .
Wired.com :
You 've climbed the acting mountain .
Any ambitions to write or direct ?
Meatwad : I have been working on a one - act version of The Crucible where the witches start farting all over the place and they dress like pilgrims .
It 's a Thanksgiving comedy with farting as the centerpiece .
Wired.com :
What was your reaction to the recent presidential election ?
Meatwad : I think the guy that won it is OK .
But that kindergarten teacher that was trying to be the president was really funny !
She winked at me on the TV .
And she eats mooses like some kind of crazy Sasquatch .
We need a funny president that eats weird things .
Wired.com :
What are your hobbies ?
Meatwad : I 'm constantly looking for the perfect hot dog .
And not the ones with the cheese already in the middle soiling the dog flavor .
If I want cheese , I can put cheese on it myself , OK ?
I 'm kind of a perfectionist like that .
And color is important .
The pinker , the better .
Wired.com :
Who do you hang out with after work wraps for the day ?
Meatwad :
Well , usually I wash all the plates from the craft services table , sweep up some , take out the trash .
Usually everybody gone by that time .
I did n't read my contract very thoroughly when I got this job .
Wired.com :
Are you a religious wad ?
Meatwad : I tried church once , but it was so boring .
So , I brought my Walkman the next time .
At that point I realized that it kind of defeated the purpose of being there .
So I just listen to my Walkman at home on Sundays and call it even .
Wired.com : The Aqua Teen Hunger Force movie faced a rough road at the box office .
What would Meatwad have done differently ?
Meatwad :
Well , I guess if I had it to do over , Meatwad would n't have spent his advance so far in advance .
That money went fast , boy .
You can only have so many different colored sweatbands and stuffed koala bears before you gotta eat something .
And I 'm still poopin ' out bear stuffing .
Was that too candid ?
I 'm sorry , ya'll .
Wired.com :
Do you often refer to yourself in the third person ?
Meatwad :
Only when you have to be serious about something .
Like , " Someone drank all of Meatwad 's chocolate milk .
Meatwad is pissed off about it . "
Because it sounds like you 're talking about someone else , it makes it weird and confusing for people and psychs them out .
Wired.com :
With the exception of a couple pieces of hair and grit , you 're often unclothed on camera .
Are you comfortable doing nude scenes ?
Meatwad : No , and I 'm glad you brought that up .
In a body - crazy society like ours , it 's hard getting out there in front of those harsh , unflattering lights and wearing next to nothing , day in and day out .
People stare at you on set , sizing you up .
Like they better than you .
Like they could get nude and talk on camera better than you , and that they are better at the English language better than you .
It 's not a competition , ya'll .
If you want to get nude on TV , go ahead .
Just do n't stand in the way of me doing it .
Wired.com :
Any plans to settle down ?
Have a meat family ?
Meatwad : I 'm too wild for that .
Like last night , I ate a whole Wonder Bread with chocolate syrup on it in the bed .
What kind of father does that without an earful from the missus ?
Wired.com :
We now have our first African - American president .
Could we one day have a food - based leader ?
Meatwad :
As long as he or she can bring Lancelot Link , Secret Chimp back to prime - time television , I do n't care who it is .
That person 's got my vote , easy .
Wired.com :
What 's your position on the pending strike by the Screen Actors Guild ?
Meatwad : I hate reruns , so I hope it gets resolved in a responsible fashion .
I also hope self - tanning gel is not covered in their benefits .
Ya'll , it makes you look weird .
Wired.com :
Where do you see your career going in the future ?
Meatwad : I 'm not sure about that one .
It 's hard to remember my lines in the show , and they 'll use a stand - in , or put peanut butter on my gums , and let me work it out of my mouth .
Then they drop the audio in later with a computer .
Sometimes I think being a cowboy or a magician would be a lot more fun .
Peanut butter 's good though , boy .

The Federal Reserve is considering issuing its own debt for the first time , a move that would give the central bank additional flexibility as it tries to stabilize rocky financial markets .
Government debt issuance is largely the province of the Treasury Department , and the Fed already can print as much money as it wants .
But as the credit crisis drags on and the economy suffers from recession , Fed officials are looking broadly for new financial tools .
Fed ...
The outgoing Bush administration is planning to announce a broad new “ right of conscience ” rule permitting medical facilities , doctors , nurses , pharmacists and other healthcare workers to refuse to participate in any procedure they find morally objectionable , including abortion and possibly even artificial insemination and birth control .
For more than 30 years , federal law has dictated that doctors and nurses may refuse to perform abortions .
The new rule would go further by making clear that healthcare workers also may refuse to provide information or advice to patients who might want an abortion .
It also seeks to cover more employees .
For example , in addition to a surgeon and a nurse in an operating room , the rule would extend to “ an employee whose task it is to clean the instruments , ” the draft rule said .
The “ conscience ” rule could set the stage for an abortion controversy in the early months of Barack Obama ’s administration .

During the campaign , President - elect Obama sought to find a middle ground on the issue .
He said there is a “ moral dimension to abortion ” that cannot be ignored , but he also promised to protect the rights of women who seek abortion .
While the rule could eventually be overturned by the new administration , the process might open a wound that could take months of wrangling to close again .
Health and Human Services Department officials said the rule would apply to “ any entity ” that receives federal funds .
It estimated 584,000 entities could be covered , including 4,800 hospitals , 234,000 doctor ’s offices and 58,000 pharmacies .
Proponents , including the Christian Medical Assn. and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , say the rule is not limited to abortion .
It will protect doctors who do not wish to prescribe birth control or to provide artificial insemination , said Dr. David Stevens , president of CMA .

“ The real battle line is the morning - after pill , ” he said .
“ This prevents the embryo from implanting .
This involves moral complicity .
Doctors should not be required to dispense a medication they have a moral objection to . ”
Critics of the rule say it will sacrifice patients ’ health to the religious beliefs of providers .
The American Medical Assn. and the American Hospital Assn. in October urged HHS to drop the regulation .
The Planned Parenthood Foundation and other backers of abortion rights condemned the rule as a last - gasp effort by the Bush administration to please social conservatives .
“ It ’s unconscionable that the Bush administration , while promising a smooth transition , would take a final opportunity to politicize women ’s health , ” said Cecile Richards , president of Planned Parenthood .

Despite the controversy , HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt said he intends to issue the rule as a final regulation before the Obama administration takes office , to protect the moral conscience of persons in the healthcare industry .
Abortion - rights advocates are just as insistent that the rights of a patient come first .
If the regulation is issued before Dec. 20 , it will be final when the new administration takes office , HHS officials say .
Overturning it would require publishing a proposed new rule for public comment and then waiting months to accept comments before drafting a final rule .
Abortion - rights advocates think it might be easier to get Congress to reject the rule .
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) , before being nominated Monday for secretary of State , and Sen. Patty Murray ( D - Wash . ) have said they would move to reverse it .
The HHS proposal has set off a sharp debate about medical ethics and the duties of healthcare workers .

Last year , the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology said a “ patient ’s well - being must be paramount ” when a conflict arises over a medical professional ’s beliefs .
In calling for limits on “ conscientious refusals , ” ACOG cited four recent examples .
In Texas , a pharmacist rejected a rape victim ’s prescription for emergency contraception .
In Virginia , a 42 - year - old mother of two became pregnant after being refused emergency contraception .
In California , a physician refused to perform artificial insemination for a lesbian couple .
( In August , the California Supreme Court ruled that this refusal amounted to illegal discrimination based on sexual orientation . )
And in Nebraska , a 19 - year - old with a life - threatening embolism was refused an early abortion at a religiously affiliated hospital .
“ Although respect for conscience is important , conscientious refusals should be limited if they constitute an imposition of religious or moral beliefs on patients [ or ] negatively affect a patient ’s health , ” ACOG ’s Committee on Ethics said .
It also said physicians have a “ duty to refer patients in a timely manner to other providers if they do not feel that they can in conscience provide the standard reproductive services that patients request . ”
Leavitt said ACOG threatened to brand as “ unprofessional ” those who do not share its attitudes toward abortion .
In August , he criticized “ the development of an environment in the healthcare field that is intolerant of individual conscience , certain religious beliefs , ethnic and cultural traditions and moral convictions . ”

In its announcement , HHS said the proposed rule was needed because of an attitude “ that healthcare professionals should be required to provide or assist in the provision of medicine or procedures to which they object , or else risk being subjected to discrimination . ”
In a media briefing , Leavitt said the rule was focused on abortion , not contraception .
But others said its broad language goes beyond abortion .
Since the 1970s , Congress has said no person may be compelled to perform or assist in performing an abortion or sterilization .
One law says no person may be required to assist in a “ health service program or research activity ” that is “ contrary to his religious beliefs or moral convictions . ”
The HHS rule says that law should be enforced “ broadly ” to cover any “ activity related in any way to providing medicine , healthcare or any other service related to health or welfare . ”
Judith Waxman , a lawyer for the National Women ’s Law Center , said Leavitt ’s office has extended the law far beyond what was understood .
“ This goes way beyond abortion , ” she said .
It could reach disputes over contraception , sperm donations and end - of - life care .

“ This kind of rule could wreak havoc in a hospital if any employee can declare they are not willing to do certain parts of their job , ” she said .

Vid A German - American company has successfully tested a prototype unmanned airship of weird and wonderful design .
The so - called " Stratellite " craft is composed of gas - filled segments linked in a chain , so it can flex and bend with the wind .
Here 's a company flight - test vid ( you need Flash and YouTube privileges to see it ) :
Like many modern lighter - than - air projects , the idea of the Stratellite is to serve as a communications relay or surveillance platform , floating at stratospheric heights for long periods .
The cruising height of 65 to 70,000 feet is often chosen for long - endurance unmanned aircraft because of the " wind bucket " found at that height .
Low windspeeds mean that an aircraft can stay on station or move about without needing to burn too much fuel .
The Stratellite 's tadpole - like segmented design is the brainchild of Dr Bernd Kröplin , president of TAO Technologies GmbH of Stuttgart .
The development of the airship is being carried out by a joint venture between TAO and Florida - based Sanswire Corp .
The flexible structure is n't the Stratellite 's only special sauce .
Aviation
Week reports that the ship also uses a cunning method of buoyancy control , one of the great Achilles heels of helium filled lighter - than - air craft .
As fuel is burned up , the ship becomes too light to maintain a steady height ; but helium is too expensive to be casually vented off .
The Stratellite , however , does n't have this problem because is runs its Rotax engine on gaseous fuel stored in the ship 's cells .
The fuel is mixed so that it has exactly the same density as the atmosphere , meaning that the ship 's buoyancy is unaffected as it is burned and its place in the cells taken up by air .
Sanswire - TAO refer to this gas - fuel ploy as " the Company ’s proprietary propulsion solution " in their press release , but there would seem to be prior art here .
The famous 1930s airship liner Graf Zeppelin actually employed the same gambit , running her engines on " Blaugas " specially mixed so as to have the same density as air .
Apart from the bendy structure and buoyancy - compensating gas fuel , Av Week reports that the Stratellite will soon feature powerful engine supercharging in order to operate at its designed cruising height .
The ship is also expected to have an option to drop its payload attached to a satnav - guided parawing of the sort now starting to become common in military airdrop operations .
This would allow the most expensive part of the ship to be recovered in the event that winds between the stratospheric bucket and the ground did n't permit landing .
Alternatively , the entire ship could be deflated at height and parachute itself down , losing only the pricey helium fill .
A 70 m - long ship is slated to make stratospheric flights late next year , according to Sanswire - TAO .
The Av Week report is here , and there 's more from the company here . ®
“ I dwell in Possibility … ” ( 657 )
Emily Dickinson
I dwell in Possibility –
A fairer House than Prose –
More numerous of Windows –
Superior – for Doors –
Of Chambers as the Cedars –
Impregnable of Eye –
And for an Everlasting Roof
The Gambrels of the Sky –
Of Visitors – the fairest –
For Occupation – This –
The spreading wide my narrow Hands
To gather Paradise –
Comment :
“ Possibility ” is a “ fairer House than Prose : ” it can not be the fairest of dwellings because it is possibility , after all .
“ The fairest ” is reserved for visitors to this House , or even , given the ambiguity the dashes create , the activity she engages in : “ The spreading wide my narrow Hands / To gather Paradise . ”
The “ House ” is peculiar .
Compared with “ Prose , ” we are tempted to think that it is poetry itself , with Dickinson addressing us as poet .
I think that interpretation holds , but I really hate “ the theme of this poem is about poetry ” line of thought generally , for this reason : a clever reader can make any poem to sound like a comment on poetry .
Still , Dickinson mentioned “ Prose , ” and that implicitly brings up the theme of poetry .
But she does n’t talk about poetry explicitly – rather , this “ House ” is open to the air in two ways ( “ numerous of Windows , ” “ Gambrels of the Sky ” ) .
When you add in the mention of Cedars , you wonder if this is a House at all .
Prose might actually be a House , trapping thought .
The imagery here reminds one of the forest as Cathedral , only “ Gambrels ” is a term specific to a barn ’s roof .
Using that term , she ’s discounted any formal religious imagery .
We wonder about the House as natural .
Poetry is still a House , of sorts .
That it has more Windows allows more light to come in , but also allows the occupant at any given time to see more .
The doors are “ superior , ” as they are “ impregnable ” as Cedars are : you ca n’t see through them .
The end of Hemingway ’s “ A Farewell to Arms ” has the protagonist looking out at another building , and seeing in the windows what ’s going on in each of the different rooms .
Each thing happening in each room is starkly different from that happening in any other room .
Possibility means choice – when you make a choice , other possibilities are closed to you .
The difference is between the “ Chambers ” ( within ) and the “ Windows ” ( without ) : one must choose how to see , and while choices are not necessarily final , one choice does mean another can not be acted on at the same time .
The problem of human vision causes our speaker to muse on what is above : “ an Everlasting Roof . ”
There is a viewpoint which sees all .
But what ’s funny about the sky is that we see it , too .
The “ fairest ” Visitor might as well be an angel – it is the visit to possibility which makes one “ fairest . ”
“ This ” is parallel with “ Prose ” in the first stanza : whereas Prose was a static House , the noun “ occupation ” strongly implies a verb , and we are given a distinct description of an action :
“ The spreading wide my narrow Hands / To gather Paradise . ”
“ Spreading wide ” implies wings , but what fascinates most is the “ wide ” / ” narrow ” duality : the Hands , by themselves , are narrow .
“ Spread , ” they ’re wide .
This is not a poem necessarily about poetry when all is said – it is a poem that uses the idea of the speaker as poet to make a point about the nature of thought .
Thoughts are possibilities : each one implies a perspective .
To dwell in possibility seems impossible , since to keep every thought alive all at once is impossible .
Hence , “ not - prose , ” not merely thoughts stated as propositions , but something more social , and something ultimately mystical .
A way of communicating that brings the audience to places you stood , and lets them see as you did , and lets them discover for themselves .
The speaker actually is dwelling in possibility : the divine does indeed flow from the natural .
I think I want to be sick to my stomach .
How much longer before it ’s another $ 50 billion ?
When do we say enough ?
The company said it would be able to borrow up to $ 20.9 billion under the new program , raising its maximum available credit from the Fed to $ 144 billion under three different programs .
The credit includes an earlier emergency loan of $ 85 billion from the Fed that carries a much higher interest rate .
A.I.G.’s big borrowings underscore the company ’s bewilderingly rapid decline .
When it suddenly faced a cash crisis in mid-September , the original estimate of the amount it needed was just $ 20 billion .
A few days later , the Fed stepped forward with its $ 85 billion credit line .
And now , the stunning size of that original bailout has grown by almost 70 percent .
A.I.G.’s cash needs could grow even further .
Much of the cash it needs is being used to meet collateral calls from its derivatives counterparties , and the precise collateral triggers and amounts are not public information .
In general , the derivative contracts cost A.I.G. more as the real estate markets decline .
The company ’s financial products division did a lot of business in that type of derivative , called credit - default swaps .
The state will be happy to give you the myriad of reasons why it presumes to have a claim on you and your life .
In fact it does so constantly in its schools , media , and institutions .
I 'm constantly perplexed as to how a monopoly on force could ever be spun to equal goodness .
How does it deem itself to be necessary when any service it provides is rife with waste , inefficiency , gross mismanagement and by default ignores the needs or wants of the individual in favor of the group ?
Is that their claim on me and you , their right to malfunction on the job , to even exist ?
That 's stupid and I can't buy into that , not even on my worst day .
I do n't want to speak for anyone else , but I refute their claim on me , my mind , my efforts or anything associated with me .
The 100 % voluntary and peaceful “ society ” that I now wholeheartedly , and forever will subscribe to , is based on 100 % rational thought .
It does n't get bogged down by any nonsensical and philosophically weak notion that the state must threaten force for noncompliance with each and every transaction it does with and against the public .
The state says that people are no good and must by default , be continually bossed around .
I say that the state has not validated its insane assumption of goodness or ridiculous call for a need for it by the people .
It has proven time and again that its “ one size fits all ” ( non ) solutions only truly benefit those that administer the programs .
People ( not all of them , of course ) are good .
They are charitable and kind with a deep sense of empathy as we are talking of our fellow human beings .
Ordinary people have not lost track of that although the state can't even gain a tiny grasp on such a contention .
Government lacks that necessary empathy when dealing with people .
Before it can even dream that it has a claim on me , or anyone else , it first needs to at least change it 's very way of doing business .
Of course this would be impossible because the state , any state , by default cannot do what it does anywhere on earth in a way that fosters peace between itself and the people , help individuals on a one - on - one basis , or make what it does somehow right .
They just can't pull it off .
You may not in good conscience or any semblance of reality crown the scorpion as a “ defender of all bugs ” .
To do so makes you look absurd and further diminishes your respectability with all .
Government is just naive enough ( and wishes we were equally clueless ) to hold itself out as that so - called “ defender ” .
Perhaps it is just the age old tradition of the state as “ boss ” throughout history that makes them believe a claim on me exists , as they really do n't have anything going on for them other than that .
Maybe it is just long held custom that dictates their foul diktat .
I 'm not buying into that either , of course .
The state has nothing , no surprise there .

Obama : My Cabinet Would Be Bipartisan Candidate tells Charlie Gibson he would work with Republicans if elected .
Oct. 29 , 2008  -- With Election
Day less than a week away , presidential candidate Barack Obama said if elected he would choose a bipartisan Cabinet and criticized John McCain 's campaign 's recent attacks on his economic plan .
Obama told ABC News ' Charlie Gibson that he did n't have a list of people he wanted to bring into the government but said " I 've got some pretty good ideas about the senior Cabinet of government officials that I think could perform very well for the country .
... I have a good idea of who the candidates would be . "
Obama said he would reach across the aisle on a range of issues , from energy independence to health care to education .
" On a whole host of these issues , I think we need Republicans , not just as show pieces , " Obama told Gibson .
" In some cases , Republicans have good ideas .
And , you know , I 've always been more than happy to steal good ideas from whatever the source . "
WATCH CHARLIE GIBSON'S INTERVIEW WITH BARACK OBAMA ON 'WORLD NEWS '
Obama told Gibson that his campaign was " not taking anything for granted " and that his " singular focus is winning this election , " but also said that whoever wins needs to be prepared to " hit the ground running . "
He said he would encourage Democrats to " draw the right lesson from any victory " and " come in with some modesty and humility " if they win .
In recent weeks , the McCain campaign has criticized Obama 's tax plan as a socialist effort to redistribute wealth , but Obama told Gibson that his plan was " as American as apple pie . "
" I want everybody to succeed , " he said .
" I want everybody to have the opportunity at grabbing the brass ring .
And we need to grow our economy and expand the pie .
So this notion that somehow I 'm interested in punishing wealth or success is nonsense .
" There 's no class warfare involved in that , " Obama said .
" That 's just basic American common sense and fairness . "
Obama on Bipartisanship , Bailout Plan
Obama offered support for a second stimulus package that would go beyond stabilizing the system to increasing lending to small businesses and cutting the rate of foreclosure .
" I think it is absolutely necessary for us to have a second stimulus package , " Obama said .
" I think that we 've got to take a look at where the economy is going to be in a month .
I think we 've got to take a careful look at this budget .
But I do n't think that we should be focused on the deficit right now because if this economy continues to slide the way it is , then that , over the long term , will actually make our deficit worse . "
Obama , who voted in favor of the $ 700 billion financial rescue plan , said a " strong signal " needs to be sent to the banks that have received the first installments of funds that while they must exert caution in terms of lending , they also need to " make sure they 're getting some of that money out the door . "
" What I would say is the taxpayers did n't put up $ 700 billion to stabilize the system just so you guys can sit on your hands and watch businesses collapse across the country , " Obama said .
Obama told Gibson that he would " absolutely " want Republicans in his cabinet if he was elected , and stressed the importance of protecting national security interests would influence his choices .
When asked if he would be receptive to keeping Robert Gates as secretary of defense , Obama said , " I 'm not going to get into details , but I can guarantee you that it is important for us , particularly when it comes to national security , to return to a tradition of nonpartisan national security . "
Obama in Primetime
Tonight , Obama will make his case to the American people in a 30 - minute television ad to air in primetime on multiple networks .
Sources told ABC
News that the special will focus on the economic challenges facing the next president as well as a personal discussion of health insurance and Obama 's mother 's death .
The ad will cost the campaign $ 3 million .
Last year Obama and McCain both pledged to accept public financing for the general election if each became his party 's nominee .
But in April 2008 , Obama said the system needed to be revamped in the current age of Internet fundraising .
The Obama campaign has raised more than $ 600 million , far exceeding the $ 85 million McCain received under the federal fundraising guidelines .
When asked if he was only able to buy a half - hour in primetime because he broke a promise on campaign financing , Obama said , " Well look , there is no doubt that the amount of money that we 've raised in this campaign has been extraordinary , and surprised me as much as anybody , maybe more than anybody .
What I would simply point to is , the way we have raised this money has been by expanding the pool of small donors in this country , in an unprecedented way . "
The Obama campaign has not made public the names of donors who have contributed less than $ 200 , but he said that his campaign had complied with Federal Elections Commission guidelines .
" You know , 3.1 million donors would be a pretty hard thing for us to be able to process , " he said .
" And we have done everything that 's been asked of us under the FEC guidelines .
These are small donors , they 're ordinary folks , and the idea , behind all campaign finance reform , is to make sure that the public official is not bought and sold , that that public official is accountable to the public , that they are not subject to undue influence by big special interests in Washington , and lobbyists .
...
In fact , I would argue that probably -- should I be successful , I may come into the White House with fewer strings attached to me than just about any presidential candidate in history . "
A new ad from the McCain campaign refers to the special as " fancy speeches " and " grand promises " designed to mask the fact that Obama is unprepared to lead the country through domestic and international crises .
Palin Says Obama Would Seek ' Redistributive Change '
In recent days , Gov. Sarah Palin has expanded on the McCain campaign 's argument that an Obama administration would " spread the wealth " by raising taxes on Americans earning more than $ 250,000 annually .
Campaigning in West Virginia Tuesday night , Palin referenced a 2001 radio interview by Obama in which he discussed the civil rights movement , implying that Obama would seek to " rewrite the founding document of our great nation . "
" There he was talking about the need for quote ' redistributive change , ' " Palin said during her remarks .
" Sen. Obama said that he regretted that the Supreme Court had n't been more radical .
And he described the Court 's refusal to take up the issues of redistribution of wealth as a tragedy . "
" I will give a tax cut to 95 percent of Americans , " Obama told the crowd in Raleigh , defending his economic plan and accusing the McCain campaign of trying to label him a " communist " because he shared his toys as a child .
When asked if the " redistributionist " label was a compliment or an insult , Obama said , " Well , I gather he means it as an insult . "
" All we want to do is restore some balance so that the economy is growing from the bottom up , " Obama told Gibson .
" That 's good for everybody .
...
There 's nothing wrong with us going back to these old tax rates in order to give tax relief to 95 percent of Americans who have been struggling even when the economy was growing .
Now , that basic principle is as American as apple pie . "
McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds responded to Obama 's speech in a statement : " No one cares what Barack Obama does with his toys , but Americans do care that he wants to raise taxes , add a trillion dollars in new spending and redistribute your hard - earned paycheck as he sees fit . "
Focus on Battleground States in Final Stretch
In Raleigh , N.C. , today , Obama urged supporters not to let up " when there 's so much at stake . "
Obama said McCain had stood by President Bush 's economic policies .
" He has n't been a maverick , he 's been a sidekick , " Obama said in his speech .
Obama spent the day campaigning in North Carolina before heading to Florida , where Gov. Charlie Crist has ordered polls to stay open an extra four hours a day and 12 hours over the weekend for early voting due to record turnout .
According to early voting figures , nearly 12 million people nationwide will have cast their ballots before Nov. 4 .
Late tonight , Obama will hold a joint rally with former President Bill Clinton in Kissimmee , Fla .
Last week , when early voting began in the Sunshine State , Obama appeared in Orlando with Sen. Hillary Clinton .
In their first joint interview , Obama told ABC News that Clinton was " a more effective messenger for us than just about anybody " in Florida .
McCain campaigned today in Florida , attempting to convince voters that Obama is still not ready to lead on critical issues , particularly national security .
In a speech in Tampa , McCain said Obama was unprepared " to protect America from Osama bin Laden , al Qaeda and other grave threats in the world . "
According to a recent ABC News / Washington Post poll , while McCain has narrowed Obama 's lead to 9 points when it comes to who voters trust to manage the economy , Obama maintains a 51 percent to 41 percent advantage in the area of whom voters trust more to address the issue of taxes .
Obama said he has considered what he would do in the future if he lost the election .
" Michelle and I were extraordinarily happy before I started running , " he said .
" And , you know , I 'm a relatively young man .
You know , they say that there are no second acts in politics , but , you know , I think there are enough exceptions out there that I could envision returning to the Senate and just doing some terrific work with the next president and the next Congress . "
When asked to complete the sentence " On Nov. 5 , I 'm so happy I wo n't have to ... , " Obama laughed and said , " Pack .
I am so tired of packing .
... I 'm so tired of not having breakfast with my girls .
You know , waking up and hearing their chatter -- sometimes , they 'll crawl into bed with Michelle and me and they 're bouncing around and poking and prodding you and telling you about what 's going to happen in their day .
Then going downstairs and fixing them some waffles or something .
That is -- that is the sweetest of moments .
And I have n't had enough of those over the last two years . "

“ Love ” may be her middle name , but police say Brittney Love Venton had no love in her heart when she stabbed an ex-boyfriend in an argument over who controlled a TV remote .
Venton , 19 , of St. Paul , made her initial appearance before a judge Tuesday after Hennepin County authorities charged her with second - degree assault in connection with the Dec. 12 attack .
She was being held on $ 50,000 bail .
The man she stabbed , Nicholas Ervin Smith , 25 , also of St. Paul , was reported in stable condition , recovering from a stab wound to the gut at North Memorial Hospital in Robbinsdale .
In an interview Tuesday , he said he could n’t recall what the argument was over .
“ It ’s all a blur to me , ” he said .
“ I remember her stabbing me , ” he said .
As best he could recall , the stabbing was preceded by an “ exchange of words .
I might ’ve said something to piss her off .
“ It ’s the first time I ’ve ever been stabbed , ” Smith noted .
Witnesses told police the stabbing stemmed from an argument over a TV remote .
“ One person wanted to see one thing , one person wanted to see the other , so she stabbed him in the stomach , ” said Juanita Luke , who lives in the apartment downstairs from the rental unit where Smith lives .
“ It was like a movie or a music video .
It was between that . ”
She said she heard a commotion and went up to Smith ’s apartment , and saw the aftermath of the attack .
Minneapolis police said they were called to the apartment in the 2900 block of Third Street North , in the city ’s Hawthorne neighborhood , shortly before 6:30 p.m. Friday .
An affidavit filed by Assistant Hennepin County Attorney William Richardson said that when police arrived , they found Smith “ bleeding profusely ” from a wound in his abdomen .
The affidavit says Smith told police he would n’t identify his attacker , but a witness readily coughed up the name : Venton .
Another witness “ stated that victim and defendant were arguing over the TV remote , ” Richardson wrote .
Venton left the scene , but returned about four hours later .
One of her relatives called police .
“ Upon arrival , officers found defendant , who volunteered that she had stabbed victim , and now wanted to kill herself , ” the affidavit states .
Luke said she knows both Venton and Smith .
Smith is on 10 years ’ probation for a 2005 burglary conviction in Ramsey County .
His upstairs neighbor had kind words for him .
“ He is so sweet , ” she said .
“ He do n’t bother nobody .
He stays to himself . ”
She was n’t so kind to Venton .
“ Brittney just has an attitude problem , ” said Luke .
“ She thinks she ’s Miss It , and everything ’s got to go her way or no way . ”
For his part , Smith said he seems to have blocked out the memory of the stabbing .
“ All I remember is waking up in the hospital .
I ’m still here , and I ’m going to be here for another week , ” he said .
“ They said I ’m going to live , so I ’m happy with that . ”

Two politically - symbolic figures of the late 20th Century are now squaring off in the California courts in the ongoing battle over Proposition 8 — the voter - approved California initiative that banned gay marriage .
The latest twist : its backers want the courts to nullify any gay marriages performed so far .
In one corner , California Attorney General Jerry Brown , the former Governor seemingly - ridiculed into political insignificance by the since - deceased “ Tonight Show ” late - night talk - show host Johnny Carson as “ Governor Moonbeam , ” a one - time wave - of - the - future type who started out being perceived as a serious Presidential primary candidate but crashed and burned amid too - high media expectations and laugh - getting comedy club punchlines .
But Brown rose again in a new incarnation as Oakland ’s innovative and highly - praised mayor , is now California ’s Attorney General — and has an eye on running for Governor of the broke - state again .
In the other corner , Ken Starr , the man Democrats love to hate who went after and got part of President Bill Clinton ’s scalp — a heroic litigator to many Republicans , but considered an ideology - driven tool of conservatives and the organized far - right get -Clinton movement by Clinton supporters .
Now he ’s dean of Pepperdine University ’s law school .
This heightens the drama on an issue that clearly is a no - compromise issue to both sides : the issue of whether to legally recognize gay marriage and bestow upon same - sex relationships the same kinds of legal rights bestowed upon traditional marriage .
But now there is this new twist — one that will heighten the polarization level on this issue even more : Prop 8 ’s backers want to in - effect de-marry any gay couples who were married before the constitutional amendment passed :
The sponsors of Proposition 8 asked the California Supreme Court on Friday to nullify the marriages of the estimated 18,000 same - sex couples who exchanged vows before voters approved the ballot initiative that outlawed gay unions .
The Yes on 8 campaign filed a brief arguing that because the new law holds that only marriages between a man and a woman are recognized or valid in California , the state can no longer recognize the existing same - sex unions .
The document reveals for the first time that opponents of same - sex marriage will fight in court to undo those unions that already exist .
Starr ’s brief was blunt : “ Proposition 8 ’s brevity is matched by its clarity .
There are no conditional clauses , exceptions , exemptions or exclusions , ” reads the brief co-written by Kenneth Starr , dean of Pepperdine University ’s law school and the former independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton .
The campaign submitted the document in response to three lawsuits seeking to invalidate Proposition 8 , the constitutional amendment adopted last month that overruled the court ’s decision in May that had legalized gay marriage in the nation ’s most populous state .
Both Attorney General Jerry Brown , whose office is scheduled to submit its own brief to the court Friday , and gay rights groups maintain that the gay marriage ban may not be applied retroactively .
Brown has taken some heat because he had defended the state ’s ban .
But as the L.A .
Times notes , he has now moved swiftly to seek to scuttle Prop 8 with the same energy that he had previously defended the state ’s old official position :
California Atty . Gen. Jerry Brown asked the state Supreme Court on Friday to invalidate the voter - approved ban on gay marriage , declaring that “ the amendment process cannot be used to extinguish fundamental constitutional rights without compelling justification . ”
Brown ’s argument on Proposition 8 , contained in an 111 - page brief filed at the last possible moment before the court ’s deadline , surprised many legal experts .
The attorney general has a legal duty to uphold the state ’s laws as long as there are reasonable grounds to do so .
Last month , Brown said he planned to “ defend the proposition as enacted by the people of California . ”
But in his filing , Brown , who personally supports same - sex marriage , offered a novel legal theory to back his argument that the measure should be invalidated .
The California Constitution protects certain rights as “ inalienable , ” Brown wrote .
Those include a right to liberty and to privacy , which the courts have said includes a person ’s right to marry .
The issue before the court “ presents a conflict between the constitutional power of the voters to amend the Constitution , on the one hand , and the Constitution ’s Declaration of Rights , on the other , ” Brown wrote .
The issue “ is whether rights secured under the state Constitution ’s safeguard of liberty as an ‘ inalienable ’ right may intentionally be withdrawn from a class of persons by an initiative amendment . ”
Law professor Jonathan Turley ( whose blog should be required - reading for anyone even remotely interested in law ) sees some problem areas for Brown here :
Brown ’s position creates an interesting issue of legal ethics and obligations .
It is the duty of the Attorney General to defend duly enacted laws .
Otherwise , you have a curious situation where a state ’s laws are not defended by the state .
In this case , the state is actually arguing against its own law .
Brown ’s position between the earlier and current litigation seems hopelessly conflicted .
It would have been more consistent if he refused to defend either the earlier law or current law .
Yet , there is the problem of lawyers defending a law that they consider to be unconstitutional .
Brown can argue that , once the Court recognize the constitutional right of same - sex couples in the Constitution , it became a problem to have it set aside by popular vote .
The earlier law was the result of legislative consensus while this is the product of popular vote .
Yet , there status as “ law ” is the same for the purposes of the Attorney General ’s office .
I strongly opposed Proposition 8 .
Yet , Brown ’s reversal does raise some troubling question of who will defend the law for the state .
The move to invalidate marriages is even more troubling .
The idea that the majority can invalidate marriages is a form of majoritarian tyranny .
Couples are allowed to rely on the existing law — whether created by the legislature or the courts .
These advocates may be committing a serious blunder .
Just as gay rights advocates were criticized for pushing too hard and too fast on the marriage issue ( triggering a backlash ) , these advocates have selected the worst possible issue to take to the courts .
Even conservative judges will likely be bothered by this retroactive move .
It is also a move that could result in a federal constitutional loss — taking the issue out of the state constitutional confines .
KTVU calls Brown ’s reversal “ stunning ” :
Attorney General Jerry Brown made a legal u-turn on Friday on Proposition 8 .
He had been expected to defend the ban on same - sex marriage in front of the California Supreme Court .
Friday was the deadline for supporters of the measure to respond to a lawsuit that argued Prop 8 is a revision of the constitution , not just an amendment .
Instead the Attorney General ’s said when his office began looking at it they quickly decided it was an amendment .
But they said they determined it was an unconstitutional one that violates a fundamental right to the pursuit of happiness .
The attorney general ’s office determined it should be stuck down .
Brown said “ What we ’re saying is , that the people can change the constitution but they ca n’t strip away a fundamental liberty unless they can demonstrate a compelling interest .
Well the court has already ruled there is no compelling interest . ”
But the two factors to keep in mind here are clear : ( 1 ) Brown has long reportedly supported same - sex marriage and ( 2 ) a slew of news stories and websites suggest he ’d like to be running the state again .
Proposition 8 won with lots of out - of - state money and some of the political dynamics at play on Nov. 8 might not be at play if he runs for governor .
Is he mending his political fences and making political calculations as well as following his own reported personal beliefs ?
Plame , Wilson to take CIA leak lawsuit to Supreme Court Nick Cargo
Published : Tuesday November 18 , 2008
Print This Email This Former CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson and her husband , former ambassador Joseph Wilson , plan to take their civil lawsuit against Bush administration officials to the Supreme Court after a federal circuit court refused to rehear the case on Monday .
Wilson v. Cheney , filed in 2006 , charges that Bush administration officials such as Vice President Cheney , and aides Karl Rove and I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , violated Plame 's constitutional rights in allegedly engineering the outing Plame , who was undercover at the time , as retaliation against her husband , an Iraq war critic , who had been sent to Niger in 2002 to investigate the possible sale of yellowcake uranium to Iraq .
While Wilson reported back that such sales were unlikely to have taken place , President Bush asserted to the contrary in his 2003 State of the Union address , prompting Wilson to speak out publicly in a July 6 , 2003 New York Times piece entitled " What I Did n't Find in Africa . "
Plame Wilson 's cover was famously blown while she was helping track distribution and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction in Iran .
Her name was leaked to columnist Robert Novak , who published it in his July 14 , 2003 column .
He said in July 2007 that the source of the leak was former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage , but said that it was not meant to be a deliberate act on the part of the White House to hurt the Wilsons .
In August , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld a district judge 's dismissal of the suit saying that it failed to establish a constitutional issue .
" There must be consequences when government officials abuse their power and endanger national security for political ends , " said CREW Executive Director Melanie Sloan on Tuesday .
" This is an issue worth fighting over and we will not give up . "
When it comes to personal finance , the truth can hurt , but the sooner you act , the better off your money situation will be .
With the weakening economy , people find they need to pay closer attention to their personal finances .
As they begin to tackle their finances to get them in order , they usually come across some truths that they really do n't want to accept .
The main reason is that these truths mean that the each person must take more responsibility and make hard decisions that they would rather leave to others .
By understanding these inconvenient truths , you place yourself in a position to better deal with your money in a positive way .
Here are a few of the most common of those awful truths .
6 . You can't have everything you want .
Whine , complain and throw as many tantrums as you want , but the words of your parents when you were a kid still apply now that you 're an adult .
Even though every commercial you see will tell you that you can have everything you want , the hard truth is that you can't .
In order to stay out of debt , make sure your finances are healthy and reach your financial goals , you will need to make difficult choices about where it 's best to spend your money .
That means giving up some things you may want .
If you do n't , you 'll end up with maxed - out credit cards and years of slavery to your debt .
It may not make you happy , but the sooner you realize this truth , the better off your finances will be so that you do n't end up working while all your friends are retired .
This will also help you prioritize your spending on what is really important to you .
5. Financial institutions are not your friends .
Banks , credit card companies and even investment firms are there for only one purpose : to make money off of you .
No matter how much they tell you that they have your best interests at heart , they are not your friends and they will charge you with any fee that they think they can get away with .
It 's common for banks to add " courtesy overdraft protection " to your banking accounts , which can cost you hundreds of dollars and fixed - rate credit cards are only fixed until the credit card issuer decides they want to change the interest rate .
( Do n't miss "
10 Banking Moves You Should Make Today
" )
You must always look out for your own interests and make sure that these financial companies are not trying to nickel and dime you . , because they have no problem changing the rules in the middle of the game -- especially if they feel they are not getting enough of your money .
So next time you listen to their pitches , remember that their primary purpose is
their
bottom line and not yours .
Use their financial services if it is advantageous to you , but never become complacent or you will find a lot of your hard - earned money flowing to their pockets .
4. Nobody is going to teach you personal finance .
In a perfect world , parents or schools would make teaching personal finance knowledge as important as basic reading , writing and arithmetic .
Unfortunately , for the vast majority of people ,
you are entirely on your own to learn personal finance basics
.
Your parents probably did n't teach you because they were clueless and learning themselves as you were growing up and the school system has done little to address the issue .
That means you 're going to have to make a concerted effort to actually learn how to get your personal finances in order yourself .
Go to the library and check - out one of the many excellent books ( such as
Smart and Simple Finances for Busy People
by Jane Bryant Quinn ,
The Total Money Makeover
by Dave Ramsey or
The Wealthy Barber
by David Chilton ) that teach the basics about personal finance and begin reading .
If you do n't , you 're going to learn by trial and error , which is going to hurt your finances a lot more than taking the initiative and learning how to take care of them right now .
The longer you delay learning this truth , the worse off your finances will be .
3 . You are your own worst enemy .
When it comes to personal finances , the state that you find yourself in can't be blamed on outside forces .
If you 're in terrible debt or your finances simply are not where you wan them to be , walk to the mirror and take a good , long , hard look .
The person that 's responsible for all the personal finance problems is staring right back at you .
With few exceptions , you have only yourself to blame .
So accept what you have done , take responsibility for your previous actions and take the steps needed to make the changes to get your personal finances back into order .
These steps include figuring out how to create a budget that works with your current income and identifying where you need to cut spending and ways that you can save more .
Trying to blame others for your situation will only mean that you will not take the needed steps to actually improve your finances and it only prolong the debt you find yourself with .
2 . You need to stop watching TV .
Ask anyone you know whether television influences what they buy and almost all of them will answer " no . "
This is why advertisers spend billions of dollars and laugh all the way to the bank .
If you can't recognize that you are being influenced , then you can't take the steps to stop the influence .
Watching TV can cost you $ 1 million
during your lifetime and you do n't even realize it .
You need to take steps to learn how to limit the amount of influence advertisers have on you and your family .
One effective way to do this is to spend less time in front of the TV by setting a specific number of hours you can watch each week , so that you watch only the shows that you want to watch and you are not sitting there simply because you are being lazy .
By understanding exactly what is important to you and what your financial goals are , you will also limit the impact of advertisers .
If you do n't , you 're at the mercy of the advertisers , which will result in a much lighter wallet .
1. Personal finance is easy .
Even though you want to blame your current money situation on the difficulty of personal finances -- whether it 's reducing credit card debt , finding money to put away for retirement or even creating a budget to make ends meet -- this excuse wo n't fly .
You already know what you need to be successful in personal finances .
All you need to do to get your personal finances in order is
spend less than you make
.
It 's a concept that even a child can comprehend .
Unfortunately , knowing and implementing it are two separate issues .
Much like people wanting to lose weight know that that they need to consume less calories than they use , actually doing it is a lot harder than merely realizing it .
Yes , implementing the knowledge is more difficult than simply having it and
will require some effort
on your part , but that 's not an excuse to claim that it 's too difficult because the reality is that it is not .
While the above information about personal finance may be inconvenient , realizing these six truths and acting on them will go a long way to get your personal finances on the right track .

WASHINGTON , Sept. 23 , 2008  --
The FBI has opened preliminary investigations into several financial institutions whose collapse created chaos on Wall Street , law enforcement officials tell ABC News .
Investigators are probing investment bank Lehman Brothers and insurer American International Group , or AIG , for possible fraud , according to law enforcement officials .
A senior official tells ABC News that lending giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are in the government 's sights , as well .
The news comes as the Bush administration attempts to hash out with lawmakers a $ 700 billion bailout plan for financial institutions that are staggering .
Sources tell ABC
News the investigations are looking into whether company officials systematically misled investors about the financial strength of their institutions .
In congressional testimony last week , FBI Director Robert Mueller confirmed that the bureau is investigating 24 financial institutions , " large corporations , where the allegations would be that there were misstatement of assets , " he said .
FBI spokesman Richard Kolko added to Mueller 's figure , saying in a statement to ABC News that " the FBI currently has 26 pending corporate fraud investigations involving subprime lenders .
As we have seen , this number can fluctuate over time ; however , we do not discuss which companies may or may not be the subject of an investigation . "
According to FBI and Justice Department officials , the FBI investigation is multifaceted and the net is much deeper than the major firms officials confirmed today .
After the collapse of the subprime markets in 2007 , the FBI set up a task force to examine how brokers set up and sold mortgage and asset - based securities .
The bureau cast a wide net on firms that had dealt in collateral debt obligations ( CDOs ) , or debt pools traded as securities .
The bureau 's investigation has expanded from 14 major financial firms to 26 in less than a year .

Norm writes in to ask me about a problem he is having with color on a new site he is designing :
I have a graphical question about my test site .
The header and main page background are pulled from the same original graphic and in Firefox the header and body match up fairly well ( I still need to do a little work to get the patterns to match up better ) but in Safari the shade of brown looks completely different between the header and body creating a seam where they meet .
Do you have any idea on how I can avoid these differences in safari ?
I opened his site in both Safari and Firefox and indeed , I saw the same problem .
Here is a screenshot of them side by side :
See the color clash below the photographs and before the first post ?
Yikes .
My first thought is to find both of the images and take a closer look at them in Photoshop .
Here is the header image and here is the body image .
Check out what happens when I drop the body image square on top of the header image :
On the lower right there , you can see the body image square plain as day .
That explains what is going on in Safari .
The images clearly have different shades of that tan color so the clash makes sense .
So what the heck is happening in Firefox ?!
Does it have some kind of super - genius color - matching abilities ?
Norm offered to send me the original file that he created both the header and the body images from .
I thought I would compare the live graphic files to this to see if that would uncover any information .
I opened this original file and placed the body background square over this , and …
It matches perfectly !
Hmmm …
So it seems like if both of the files were originally created from this original file , then something happened while exporting the top header image that is changing the tone of it somehow .
Right away I considered color indexing .
Since the top image has a much wider variety of colors it is dealing with , if the images were color indexed the top image would have much less colors to dedicate to the tans which could explain a tone variation .
Since both the images are JPG’s , and color indexing only happens with GIF and PNG , this is not the case .
Then it struck me …
Ah ha , it ’s color profiles !
I really should have thought of this right away , but sometimes simple answers are the most elusive .
I remembered that Safari is one of the only browsers that actually supports color profiles of images .
A quick “ Get Info ” glance at the two images reveals the true problem :
The top image indeed was exported differently , it ’s using a “ Calibrated RGB Colorspace ” while the body background image was using “ sRGB ” .
This is likely caused by saving the images from Photoshop in different ways .
If you “ Save As … ” from the file menu , you will have the opportunity to save your color profile along with the image .
If you “ Save for Web & Devices … ” the “ sRGB ” ( best for the web ) color profile will be automatically applied ( in CS3 anyway ) .
So there you have it .
It was n’t Firefox being super - smart , it was actually being dumb and just looking smart .
Like Reese Witherspoon .
The purpose of these color profiles is something I could into another time , but the important thing to remember to avoid problems like Norm ’s is to make sure all your images were exported in the same way and so they either do n’t have a color profile or all have the same color profile .
This will ensure that the site , at least color - wise , renders the same from browser to browser .
To check whether your browser honors color profiles ( and how well ) , check out the ICC page on the subject .
Teenage girl ' stabbed her lover in the lower lip because he refused to have sex '
A teenage girlfriend has been accused of stabbing her lover in the lower lip after he said he was n’t in the mood for sex .
Brittany Phillips , 19 , was arrested by US cops in Louisiana and charged with aggravated battery after allegedly stabbing Todd Stewart in his lower lip .
He can be seen with blood on his mouth in his police photo .
Attack : Todd Stewart ( left ) was allegedly stabbed in the face by his teenage girlfriend Brittany Phillips ( right ) after turning down her demands for sex
The 35 - year - old said Phillips approached him in bed to have sex but he was apparently not in the mood and tried to push her off of him .
The woman then says he became violent , while Stewart says he simply left the bedroom to sleep on a living room couch .
He told police Phillips ' would not leave him alone ' and then things got physical .
Stewart accuses his girlfriend of stabbing him in the lower lip with ' a long metal object which appeared to be a knife . '
For her part , Phillips acknowledged she struck the man - but said she did it to ' protect herself ” .
As well as aggravated assault , she was said to have been arrested for a pair of outstanding warrants for simple battery and damage to property .
As a result of the scuffle Stewart was charged with single battery .
The couple , from West Monroe in Louisiana , were arrested by officers from the Ouachita Parish Sheriff ’s Office .
Documents say feds can track cell phones ' locations without telecoms ' help John Byrne
Published : Monday November 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Federal law enforcement may be able to track cellular phones users ' locations without the help of the telecommunications companies themselves , according to a report Sunday .
Documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union under a Freedom of Information
Act request suggest that existing technology allows law enforcement to bypass wireless companies in locating individual cell phone users .
Using " triggerfish " technology , mobile phones are tricked into transmitting their serial numbers , phone numbers and other data by posing as a cellular phone tower .
Until now , it 's been believed that such technology could only be successfully employed with the help of the telecoms themselves , because the specific location of the phone could n't be traced with enough accuracy .
But a document obtained by the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation from the Justice Department in a lawsuit and posted online last week says triggerfish can be deployed " without the user knowing about it and without involving the cell phone provider . "
The detail was noted by the ACLU 's Rachel Myers on Daily Kos and highlighted in a posting on Ars Technica on Sunday .
As Ars Technica explains , " That may be significant because the legal rulings requiring law enforcement to meet a high " probable cause " standard before acquiring cell location records have , thus far , pertained to requests for information from providers , pursuant to statutes such as the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ( CALEA ) and the Stored Communications Act . "
" The Justice Department 's electronic surveillance manual explicitly suggests that triggerfish may be used to avoid restrictions in statutes like CALEA that bar the use of pen register or trap - and - trace devices which allow tracking of incoming and outgoing calls from a phone subject to much less stringent evidentiary standards to gather location data , " Ars Technica adds .
" ' By its very terms , ' according to the manual , ' this prohibition applies only to information collected by a provider and not to information collected directly by law enforcement authorities .
Thus , CALEA does not bar the use of pen / trap orders to authorize the use of cell phone tracking devices used to locate targeted cell phones . ' "
Another day , another gimmick .
Republicans are digging out every possible turd they can find to fling and seeing what will stick on Barack Obama 's wall -- and so far , no luck .
Earlier this weekend they were peddling a dumb smear about Barack Obama 's aunt being an illegal immigrant who had been ordered deported .
But there 's one little problem with that tale :
As the Washington Post reports , the release of that information was a violation of confidentiality laws for immigrants seeking asylum :
Federal privacy law restricts U.S. immigration agencies from disclosing information about citizens and permanent residents , and DHS policy similarly limits disclosures about the status of legal and illegal immigrants .
Asylum - seekers are granted greater protection , because of the sensitive nature of their claims and the risks of retaliation .
In a statement , a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the matter has been referred to the agency 's Office of Professional Responsibility and its parent department 's inspector general .
" They are looking into whether there was a violation of policy in publicly disclosing individual case information , " ICE spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said .
" We ca n't comment on individual cases . "
As Kyledeb at Citizen Orange observes :
There are very specific confidentiality laws around asylum cases .
Why ?
Because it could be dangerous to disclose information about potential asylee .
It could result in their further persecution .
This is true , of course , even after an asylum case is closed because then there would be a huge disincentive not to apply for asylum .
...
In other words , while nativists are screaming " ILLEGAL " at the top of their lungs and " progressives " are refusing to defend unauthorized migrants , it appears that everyone 's lost sight of who the real " ILLEGAL " is .
That " federal law enforcement agent " broke U.S. immigration law .
Perhaps the anonymous source should be deported ?
Of course , at this point , the GOP seems to believe it has nothing to lose ; after all , any investigation will be too late to do anything about it .
And the intent is obvious :
Scare those white suburbanite undecideds with the notion that Obama is going to open the floodgates to Scary Brown People .
In a related vein , the GOP hopes to revive the wingnut conspiracy theory that Obama 's being elected with a foreign donor base .
But talk about deja vu all over again .
Back in 1992 , GHW Bush 's operatives were caught illegally riffling through Bill Clinton 's passport files and disclosing the information therein .
Of course , the Republican operative -- Joe DiGenova -- appointed as " independent counsel " to investigate the matter rather predictably found no serious lawbreaking had occurred .
This time , they should n't be permitted to get away with it .

Steam is going native for Europeans .
Currently in beta , you can log in to the website version with your account and see all the prices in pounds , including VAT .
Which brings both good and bad news .
The good news is some of the current prices .
They ’ve gone a bit mad .
The bad news : it might be the end of future savings when buying things via Steam .
So let ’s take a look at some of the good news .
These are all in GBP .
The beta looks at your location and assigns the correct currency , so I ’m afraid I ca n’t work out the same for Euros .
Perhaps readers can .
Right now there ’s some odd prices up there .
Bioshock is currently £ 13.99 .
On the US Steam it ’s at a mystifying $ 54.99 .
Which when bought at UK prices , with tax , would be £ 42.38 .
That ’s a mysterious saving of over £ 28 .
Er , blimey .
The Complete Pack for Civ IV is a whopping $ 59.99 for Americans .
That would have been £ 46.21 for us .
It ’s £ 26.99 on the EU beta .
Even some brand new games , like GTA 4 , have notable savings .
US converted price : £ 30.80 .
EU price : £ 26.99 .
And the complete publisher packs are currently insanely cheap .
Fire sale prices .
Edit : Have to include this one .
Civ 3 Complete US : £ 23.12 . Civ 3 Complete UK : £ 2.99 .
Huh ?
Which all sort of leads you to suspect that something ’s gone wrong .
Which should then lead you to login to the beta page and buy this stuff before someone fixes it .
Because even if these prices are intentional , they might not last .
The bad news is the UK is very used to paying hugely hiked up prices when compared to those in the US .
In many cases you can swap the $ for a £ and keep the numbers .
Steam ’s universally dollar - based sales , despite adding on VAT , have often kept things a lot cheaper , which seems entirely reasonable since it ’s digital distribution .
But publishers must surely have been infuriated by this ?
Some , like Ubisoft and Atari , have flat - out refused to even sell their games to Europe via Valve ’s platform , although have repeatedly declined to explain why .
Could it be because they ’re undercutting themselves ?
If your converted dollar price is cheaper than your shop shelf price ( or indeed that of your own digital distribution ) , people can start to see quite how much more they ’re being asked to pay .
Of course right now the pound is so useless that the US dollar prices are actually converting to UK rates , which is a tad frightening , and an example of how peculiarly over - priced PC games are in the US when compared to the rest of their economy .
So while the forthcoming Empire : Total War ’s UK price of £ 39.99 is obviously quite mad ( you can currently pre-order it for under £ 25 at Game ) , it does work out to be the same rate as the equally daft $ 49.99 expected for the States .
Should the GBP recover , however , this will become less equal once again .
We contacted Valve to find out what ’s the what .
Their response ?
Cryptic :
“ The future is now ( in beta anyway ) . ”
Interpretation ?
Prices are coming down on Steam ?
Not for Euros they are n’t .
Bemused .
Right , that ’s the closest to economical nonsense I ’m ever going to get .
But the key thing is here : shit !
The UK prices on the Steam beta are CRAZY .
Buy stuff !
Huge thanks to Theory and the RPS Steam Chatters for the tip - off .
Banks are responding to the troubled economy by jacking up fees on their checking accounts to record amounts .
Last week , Citigroup Inc.'s Citibank started charging some customers a new $ 10 " overdraft protection transfer fee " to transfer money from a savings account or line of credit to cover a checking - account shortfall .
Citibank had already raised foreign - exchange transaction fees on its debit cards and added minimum opening deposit requirements for its checking accounts .
Over the past year , J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s Chase , ...
In the summer of 1986 , my then - two - year - old daughter picked up a tick .
There was this blood - bloated thing sucking on our baby 's scalp , and we were n't quite sure how to go about getting it off .
My wife , Judy , called the pediatrician .
It was eleven o'clock in the evening .
I logged onto the WELL .
I got my answer online within minutes from a fellow with the improbable but genuine name of Flash Gordon , M.D. I had removed the tick by the time Judy got the callback from the pediatrician 's office .
What amazed me was n't just the speed with which we obtained precisely the information we needed to know , right when we needed to know it .
It was also the immense inner sense of security that comes with discovering that real people -- most of them parents , some of them nurses , doctors , and midwives -- are available , around the clock , if you need them .
There is a magic protective circle around the atmosphere of this particular conference .
We 're talking about our sons and daughters in this forum , not about our computers or our opinions about philosophy , and many of us feel that this tacit understanding sanctifies the virtual space .
The atmosphere of the Parenting conference -- the attitudes people exhibit to each other in the tone of what they say in public -- is part of what continues to attract me .
People who never have much to contribute in political debate , technical argument , or intellectual gamesmanship turn out to have a lot to say about raising children .
People you knew as fierce , even nasty , intellectual opponents in other contexts give you emotional support on a deeper level , parent to parent , within the boundaries of Parenting , a small but warmly human corner of cyberspace .
Here is a short list of examples from the hundreds of separate topics available for discussion in the Parenting conference .
Each of these entries is the name of a conversation that includes scores or hundreds of individual contributions spread over a period of days or years , like a long , topical cocktail party you can rewind back to the beginning to find out who said what before you got there .

People who talk about a shared interest , albeit a deep one such as being a parent , do n't often disclose enough about themselves as whole individuals online to inspire real trust in others .
In the case of the subcommunity of the Parenting conference , a few dozen of us , scattered across the country , few of whom rarely if ever saw the others face - to - face , had a few years of minor crises to knit us together and prepare us for serious business when it came our way .
Another several dozen read the conference regularly but contribute only when they have something important to add .
Hundreds more every week read the conference without comment , except when something extraordinary happens .
Jay Allison and his family live in Massachusetts .
He and his wife are public - radio producers .
I 've never met any of them face - to - face , although I feel I know something powerful and intimate about the Allisons and have strong emotional ties to them .
What follows are some of Jay 's postings on the WELL : Woods Hole .
Midnight .
I am sitting in the dark of my daughter 's room .
Her monitor lights blink at me .
The lights used to blink too brightly so I covered them with bits of bandage adhesive and now they flash faintly underneath , a persistent red and green , Lillie 's heart and lungs .
Above the monitor is her portable suction unit .
In the glow of the flashlight I 'm writing by , it looks like the plastic guts of a science - class human model , the tubes coiled around the power supply , the reservoir , the pump .
Tina is upstairs trying to get some sleep .
A baby monitor links our bedroom to Lillie's .
It links our sleep to Lillie 's too , and because our souls are linked to hers , we do not sleep well .
I am naked .
My stomach is full of beer .
The flashlight rests on it , and the beam rises and falls with my breath .
My daughter breathes through a white plastic tube inserted into a hole in her throat .
She 's fourteen months old .
Sitting in front of our computers with our hearts racing and tears in our eyes , in Tokyo and Sacramento and Austin , we read about Lillie 's croup , her tracheostomy , the days and nights at Massachusetts General Hospital , and now the vigil over Lillie 's breathing and the watchful attention to the mechanical apparatus that kept her alive .
It went on for days .
Weeks .
Lillie recovered , and relieved our anxieties about her vocal capabilities after all that time with a hole in her throat by saying the most extraordinary things , duly reported online by Jay .
Later , writing in Whole Earth Review , Jay described the experience : Before this time , my computer screen had never been a place to go for solace .
Far from it .
But there it was .
Those nights sitting up late with my daughter , I 'd go to my computer , dial up the WELL , and ramble .
I wrote about what was happening that night or that year .
I did n't know anyone I was " talking " to .
I had never laid eyes on them .
At 3:00 a.m. my " real " friends were asleep , so I turned to this foreign , invisible community for support .
The WELL was always awake .
Any difficulty is harder to bear in isolation .
There is nothing to measure against , to lean against .
Typing out my journal entries into the computer and over the phone lines , I found fellowship and comfort in this unlikely medium .
Over the years , despite the distances , those of us who made heart - to - heart contact via the Parenting conference began to meet face - to - face .
The WELL 's annual summer picnic in the San Francisco Bay area grew out of a face - to - face gathering that was originally organized in the Parenting conference .
We had been involved in intense online conversations in this conference all year .
When summer rolled around we started talking about doing something relaxing together , like bringing our kids somewhere for a barbecue .
In typical WELL fashion , it quickly amplified to a WELLwide party hosted by the Parenting conference .
Phil Catalfo reserved a picnic site and the use of a softball field in a public park .
Parents talk about their kids online -- what else ?-- and therefore we all already knew about my daughter Mamie and Philcat 's son Gabe and Busy 's son , the banjo player , but we had not seen many of them before .
I remember that when I arrived at the park , Mamie and I recognized one particular group , out of the first half - dozen large parties of picnickers we saw in the distance .
There was just something about the way they were all standing , talking with each other in knots of two or three , while the kids ran around the eucalyptus grove and found their way to the softball diamond .
I remember playing on the same team with a fellow who never ceases to annoy me when he wrenches every conversation online around to a debate about libertarianism ; I remember thinking , after we had darn near accomplished a double play together , that he was n't such a bad guy .
It was a normal American community picnic -- people who value each other 's company , getting together with their kids for softball and barbecue on a summer Sunday .
It could have been any church group or PTA .
In this case , it was the indisputably real - life part of a virtual community .
The first Parenting conference picnic was such a success that it became an annual event , taking place around the summer solstice .
And kids became a fixture at all the other WELL parties .
Another ritual for parents and kids and friends of parents and kids started in the winter , not long after the picnic tradition began .
For the past four or five years , in December , most of the conference participants within a hundred miles , and their little ones , show up in San Francisco for the annual Pickle Family Circus benefit and potluck .
One of the directors of this small circus is a beloved and funny member of the WELL community ; he arranges a special block of seats each year .
After the circus is over and the rest of the audience has left , we treat the performers , the stagehands , and ourselves to a potluck feast .
Albert Mitchell is an uncommonly fierce and stubborn fellow - - many would say pugnacious -- who argues his deeply felt principles in no uncertain terms .
He can be abrasive , even frightening , in his intensity .
He gets particularly riled up by certain topics -- organized religion , taxation , and circumcision -- but there are other ways to cross him and earn some public or private vituperation .
I discovered that I could never again really be too frightened by Albert 's fierce online persona -- the widely known and sometimes feared " sofia " -- after seeing him and his sweet daughter , Sofia , in her clown suit , at a Pickle potluck .
He gave me a jar of honey from his own hive at that event , even though we had been shouting at each other online in ways that probably would have degenerated into fisticuffs face - to - face .
At the Pickle Family Circus or the summer picnic , we were meeting in the sacred space of Parenting , not the bloody arenas of WELL policy or politics .
Leukemia
The Parenting conference had been crisis - tested along with the Allisons , and had undergone months of the little ups and downs with the kids that make up the normal daily history of any parent , when one of our most regular , most dear , most loquacious participants , Phil Catalfo , dropped a bombshell on us .
Topic 349 : Leukemia By : Phil Catalfo ( philcat ) on Wed , Jan 16 , ' 91 404 responses so far < linked topic >
I 'd like to use this topic for discussing leukemia , the disease , both as it affects my family and what is known about it generally .
We learned early last week that our son Gabriel , 7 ( our middle child ) , has acute lymphocytic leukemia , aka ALL .
I will be opening one or more additional topics to discuss the chronology of events , emotions and experiences stirred up by this newly central fact of our lives , and so on .
( I 'm also thinking of opening a topic expressly for everyone to send him get - well wishes . )
I intend for this topic to focus on the disease itself -- his diagnosis and progress , but also other cases we know about , resources ( of all types ) available , etc. etc .
If Tina has no objection , I 'd like to ask the hosts of the Health conf .
to link any / all of these topics to their conf .
I can't think offhand of where else might be appropriate , but I 'm sure you 'll all suggest away .
The first thing I want to say , regardless of how it does or does n't pertain to this particular topic , is that the support and love my family and I , and especially Gabe , have been receiving from the WELL , have been invaluable .
This turns out to have a medical impact , which we 'll discuss in good time , but I want to say out loud how much it 's appreciated : infinitely .
With that , I 'll enter this , and return as soon as I can to say more about Gabe 's case and what I 've learned in the past week about this disease and what to do about it .

# 1 : Nancy A. Pietrafesa ( lapeche ) Wed , Jan 16 , ' 91 ( 17:21 ) Philcat , we 're here and we 're listening .
We share your hope and a small part of your pain .
Hang on .
# 2 : Tina Loney ( onezie ) Wed , Jan 16 , ' 91 ( 19:09 )
Phil , I took the liberty of writing to flash ( host of the Health conf ) and telling him to link whichever of the three topics he feels appropriate .
I very much look forward to you telling us all that you can / are able about Gabe .
In the meanwhile , I 'm thinking about Gabriel and your entire family .
Seems I remember Gabe has quite a good Catalfic sense of humor , and I hope you 're able to aid him in keeping that in top form .
. . .
Virtual hugs are * streaming * in his direction .

The Parenting regulars , who had spent hours in this conference trading quips and commiserating over the little ups and downs of life with children , chimed in with messages of support .
One of them was a nurse .
Individuals who had never contributed to the Parenting conference before entered the conversation , including a couple of doctors who helped Phil and the rest of us understand the daily reports about blood counts and other diagnostics and two other people who had firsthand knowledge , as patients suffering from blood disorders themselves .
Over the weeks , we all became experts on blood disorders .
We also understood how the blood donation system works , what Danny Thomas and his St. Jude Hospital had to do with Phil and Gabe , and how parents learn to be advocates for their children in the medical system without alienating the caregivers .
Best of all , we learned that Gabe 's illness went into remission after about a week of chemotherapy .
With Gabe 's remission , the community that had gathered around the leukemia topic redirected its attention to another part of the groupmind .
Lhary , one of the people from outside the Parenting conference who had joined the discussion of leukemia because of the special knowledge he had to contribute , moved from the San Francisco area to Houston in order to have a months - long bone - marrow transplant procedure in an attempt to abate his own leukemia .
He continued to log onto the WELL from his hospital room .
The Catalfos and others got together and personally tie - dyed regulation lab coats and hospital gowns for Lhary to wear around the hospital corridors .
Many people are alarmed by the very idea of a virtual community , fearing that it is another step in the wrong direction , substituting more technological ersatz for yet another natural resource or human freedom .
These critics often voice their sadness at what people have been reduced to doing in a civilization that worships technology , decrying the circumstances that lead some people into such pathetically disconnected lives that they prefer to find their companions on the other side of a computer screen .
There is a seed of truth in this fear , for virtual communities require more than words on a screen at some point if they intend to be other than ersatz .
Some people -- many people -- do n't do well in spontaneous spoken interaction , but turn out to have valuable contributions to make in a conversation in which they have time to think about what to say .
These people , who might constitute a significant proportion of the population , can find written communication more authentic than the face - to - face kind .
Who is to say that this preference for one mode of communication - - informal written text -- is somehow less authentically human than audible speech ?
Those who critique CMC because some people use it obsessively hit an important target , but miss a great deal more when they do n't take into consideration people who use the medium for genuine human interaction .
Those who find virtual communities cold places point at the limits of the technology , its most dangerous pitfalls , and we need to pay attention to those boundaries .
But these critiques do n't tell us how Philcat and Lhary and the Allisons and my own family could have found the community of support and information we found in the WELL when we needed it .
And those of us who do find communion in cyberspace might do well to pay attention to the way the medium we love can be abused .
Although dramatic incidents are what bring people together and stick in their memories , most of what goes on in the Parenting conference and most virtual communities is informal conversation and downright chitchat .
The model of the WELL and other social clusters in cyberspace as " places " is one that naturally emerges whenever people who use this medium discuss the nature of the medium .
In 1987 , Stewart Brand quoted me in his book The Media Lab about what tempted me to log onto the WELL as often as I did : " There 's always another mind there .
It 's like having the corner bar , complete with old buddies and delightful newcomers and new tools waiting to take home and fresh graffiti and letters , except instead of putting on my coat , shutting down the computer , and walking down to the corner , I just invoke my telecom program and there they are .
It 's a place . "
The existence of computer - linked communities was predicted twenty - five years ago by J. C. R. Licklider and Robert Taylor , research directors for the Department of Defense 's Advanced Research Projects Agency ( ARPA ) , who set in motion the research that resulted in the creation of the first such community , the ARPANET : " What will on - line interactive communities be like ? " Licklider and Taylor wrote in 1968 : " In most fields they will consist of geographically separated members , sometimes grouped in small clusters and sometimes working individually .
They will be communities not of common location , but of common interest .
. . . "
My friends and I sometimes believe we are part of the future that Licklider dreamed about , and we often can attest to the truth of his prediction that " life will be happier for the on - line individual because the people with whom one interacts most strongly will be selected more by commonality of interests and goals than by accidents of proximity . "
I still believe that , but I also know that life online has been unhappy at times , intensely so in some circumstances , because of words I 've read on a screen .
Participating in a virtual community has not solved all of life 's problems for me , but it has served as an aid , a comfort , and an inspiration at times ; at other times , it has been like an endless , ugly , long - simmering family brawl .
I 've changed my mind about a lot of aspects of the WELL over the years , but the sense of place is still as strong as ever .
As Ray Oldenburg proposed in The Great Good Place , there are three essential places in people 's lives : the place we live , the place we work , and the place we gather for conviviality .
Although the casual conversation that takes place in cafes , beauty shops , pubs , and town squares is universally considered to be trivial , idle talk , Oldenburg makes the case that such places are where communities can come into being and continue to hold together .
These are the unacknowledged agorae of modern life .
When the automobilecentric , suburban , fast - food , shopping - mall way of life eliminated many of these " third places " from traditional towns and cities around the world , the social fabric of existing communities started shredding .
Oldenburg explicitly put a name and conceptual framework on that phenomenon that every virtual communitarian knows instinctively , the power of informal public life :
Third places exist on neutral ground and serve to level their guests to a condition of social equality .
Within these places , conversation is the primary activity and the major vehicle for the display and appreciation of human personality and individuality .
Third places are taken for granted and most have a low profile .
Since the formal institutions of society make stronger claims on the individual , third places are normally open in the off hours , as well as at other times .
The character of a third place is determined most of all by its regular clientele and is marked by a playful mood , which contrasts with people 's more serious involvement in other spheres .
Though a radically different kind of setting for a home , the third place is remarkably similar to a good home in the psychological comfort and support that it extends .
Such are the characteristics of third places that appear to be universal and essential to a vital informal public life .
. . .
The problem of place in America manifests itself in a sorely deficient informal public life .
The structure of shared experience beyond that offered by family , job , and passive consumerism is small and dwindling .
The essential group experience is being replaced by the exaggerated self - consciousness of individuals .
American life - styles , for all the material acquisition and the seeking after comforts and pleasures , are plagued by boredom , loneliness , alienation , and a high price tag .
. . .
Unlike many frontiers , that of the informal public life does not remain benign as it awaits development .
It does not become easier to tame as technology evolves , as governmental bureaus and agencies multiply , or as population grows .
It does not yield to the mere passage of time and a policy of letting the chips fall where they may as development proceeds in other areas of urban life .
To the contrary , neglect of the informal public life can make a jungle of what had been a garden while , at the same time , diminishing the ability of people to cultivate it .
It might not be the same kind of place that Oldenburg had in mind , but so many of his descriptions of third places could also describe the WELL .
Perhaps cyberspace is one of the informal public places where people can rebuild the aspects of community that were lost when the malt shop became a mall .
Or perhaps cyberspace is precisely the wrong place to look for the rebirth of community , offering not a tool for conviviality but a life - denying simulacrum of real passion and true commitment to one another .
In either case , we need to find out soon .
***
The feeling of logging into the WELL for just a minute or two , dozens of times a day , is very similar to the feeling of peeking into the caf‚ , the pub , the common room , to see who 's there , and whether you want to stay around for a chat .
As social psychologist Sara Kiesler put it in an article about networks for Harvard Business Review : " One of the surprising properties of computing is that it is a social activity .
Where I work , the most frequently run computer network program is the one called ` Where ' or ` Finger ' that finds other people who are logged onto the computer network . "
Because we cannot see one another in cyberspace , gender , age , national origin , and physical appearance are not apparent unless a person wants to make such characteristics public .
People whose physical handicaps make it difficult to form new friendships find that virtual communities treat them as they always wanted to be treated -- as thinkers and transmitters of ideas and feeling beings , not carnal vessels with a certain appearance and way of walking and talking ( or not walking and not talking ) .
One of the few things that enthusiastic members of virtual communities in Japan , England , France , and the United States all agree on is that expanding their circle of friends is one of the most important advantages of computer conferencing .
CMC is a way to meet people , whether or not you feel the need to affiliate with them on a community level .
It 's a way of both making contact with and maintaining a distance from others .
The way you meet people in cyberspace puts a different spin on affiliation : in traditional kinds of communities , we are accustomed to meeting people , then getting to know them ; in virtual communities , you can get to know people and then choose to meet them .
Affiliation also can be far more ephemeral in cyberspace because you can get to know people you might never meet on the physical plane .
How does anybody find friends ?
In the traditional community , we search through our pool of neighbors and professional colleagues , of acquaintances and acquaintances of acquaintances , in order to find people who share our values and interests .
We then exchange information about one another , disclose and discuss our mutual interests , and sometimes we become friends .
In a virtual community we can go directly to the place where our favorite subjects are being discussed , then get acquainted with people who share our passions or who use words in a way we find attractive .
In this sense , the topic is the address : you can't simply pick up a phone and ask to be connected with someone who wants to talk about Islamic art or California wine , or someone with a three - year - old daughter or a forty - year - old Hudson ; you can , however , join a computer conference on any of those topics , then open a public or private correspondence with the previously unknown people you find there .
Your chances of making friends are magnified by orders of magnitude over the old methods of finding a peer group .
You can be fooled about people in cyberspace , behind the cloak of words .
But that can be said about telephones or face - to - face communication as well ; computer - mediated communications provide new ways to fool people , and the most obvious identity swindles will die out only when enough people learn to use the medium critically .
In some ways , the medium will , by its nature , be forever biased toward certain kinds of obfuscation .
It will also be a place that people often end up revealing themselves far more intimately than they would be inclined to do without the intermediation of screens and pseudonyms .
The sense of communion I 've experienced on the WELL is exemplified by the Parenting conference but far from limited to it .
We began to realize in other conferences , facing other human issues , that we had the power not only to use words to share feelings and exchange helpful information , but to accomplish things in the real world .
Barn Raiser
The power of the WELL 's community of users to accomplish things in the real world manifested itself dramatically when we outgrew our first computer .
The computing engine that put-putted us around as a group of seven hundred users in 1985 was becoming inadequate for the three thousand users we had in 1988 .
Things started slowing down .
You would type a letter on your keyboard and wait seconds for the letter to be displayed on your screen .
It quickly became frustrating .
Because we had such a large proportion of computer experts among the population , we knew that the only solution to the interminable system lag that made it agonizing to read and even more agonizing to write on the WELL 's database was to move to more up - to - date hardware , better suited to keeping up with the communication tasks of a hive numbering in the thousands .
But the WELL 's managing director , Clifford Figallo , himself an active member of the WELL community , reported that the WELL as a business entity was unable to find the kind of financing we 'd need to upgrade our system .
That 's when some of the armchair experts online started talking about their back - of - the - envelope calculations .
If the hard - core users who had grown so irritated about the system 's performance ( but had realized that there was no place remotely like the WELL to turn to as an alternative ) were willing to pay their next few months bills in advance , how much money would it take to buy the big iron ?
Half - seriously , Clifford Figallo named a figure .
Within a few days , enough people had pledged hundreds of dollars each , thousands of dollars cumulatively , to get the show on the road .
The checks arrived , the computer was purchased , the hardware was installed , and the database -- the living heart of the community - - was transferred to its new silicon body .
After suffering through the last months of the Vax , the first months of our new computer , the Sequent , was like switching from a Schwinn to a Rolls .
And we had flexed our first barn - raising muscles in a characteristically unorthodox way : here were the customers , and the producers of the value that the customers buy , raising money among themselves to loan the owners of the business so they could sell themselves more of each other .
Casey 's operation was another barn raising .
This one was her idea .
Casey was another WELL old - timer who had a job -- freelance transcription and word processing services -- that enabled her to work at home .
Nobody ever doubts her intelligence , although her manner is often indelicate .
The way she would say it , I 'm sure , is that she has a " relatively low need for affiliation . "
The way others might say it is that Casey is a tough cookie .
Casey , whose real name is Kathleen , needed an operation that she could almost , but not quite , afford ; her ability to walk was at stake .
So she put up $ 500 to have a poster of her own design printed .
The poster showed the silhouette of a head , with the title " This Is Your Mind on the WELL , " and the head was filled with words and phrases that WELL users would recognize .
She offered copies for sale as a benefit for her operation at $ 30 each .
She raised the money she needed .
The most dramatic barn raising , however , was the saga of Elly , a shy and gentle and much - loved WELLite who left the virtual community , possibly forever , to travel to the farthest reaches of the Himalayas .
Her saga , her crisis , and the WELL 's response unfolded over period of months , and climaxed over a few intensely active days : Topic 198 : News from Elly By : Averi Dunn ( vaxen ) on Wed , Aug 28 , ' 91 263 responses so far < linked topic >
This is the place to post any news which may come your way about Northbay 's vacationing host , Elly van der Pas .
# 1 : Elly van der Pas ( elly ) Wed , Aug 28 , ' 91 ( 18:03 ) Right now , I 'm almost finished moving out of my house .
Later tonight , I 'm going to look at my stuff , and see if I have what I need for my trip , and maybe do last minute shopping tomorrow .
Cleaning Friday .
Gone Saturday to parts unknown .
The plane leaves Monday morning .
Phew ! # 6 : Averi Dunn ( vaxen ) Mon , Sep 23 , '91 ( 18:44 ) I got another postcard from Elly on Saturday : 13 Sept Amsterdam
So far , so good .
The weather 's been beautiful , and I 've been riding all over by bike .
Tomorrow I 'm going to London for a few days , and then to Italy by train .
Should be an adventure .
I went to a piano concert last night with friends of a friend , and may be sailing today .
Greetings to everyone .
Elly # 22 : Averi Dunn ( vaxen ) Thu , Nov 7 , '91 ( 23:25 )
Well , Kim , you can post the parts that do n't repeat .
It 's good to hear any news from Elly .
And with that in mind I post the following from her - own - self : 27 Oct 1991 I got your letter from Sept 14 yesterday , forwarded from Italy .
Apparently they were having a post office strike of something , because one of the workers drowned in the elevator .
Anyway , they did n't process mail for at least a week , so I did n't get any letters .
Anyway , you have no idea how weird it is to be sitting on a mountain in Kathmandu reading about AP2 and the WELL .
Oh , I took a picture of the WELL coffee shop in London and sent it to the office .
I hope they get it .
I thought it was quite appropriate .
Janey Fritsche showed up about a week ago , and then took off trekking .
It was good to see her .
My friend Peter will be here , too , in a few days , and I guess I 'll come down off the mountain to spend some time renewing visas and stocking up for the month - long course .
We have to stay put for that , and no mail , either , so this might be it for awhile .
Happy Thanksgiving , Merry Christmas , and Happy New Year .
They 've just finished their big holiday here -- everyone was off work for a week , and dressed in new clothes .
The kids made huge bamboo swings and went out kite flying .
I 've been studying Dzogchen , which is like Tibetan Zen-- meditating on the empty mind .
Different from what I 've done before .
We stayed for awhile at a monastery way up in the hills , where there 's an old abbot who specializes in pointing out the nature of the mind .
It was rather an unusual opportunity .
You guys are all asleep now , except maybe for you .
It 's 2 pm - - too late for lunch and too early for tea .
Just about bath time , though , because we have a solar heater on the roof .
I 'm taking all my baths now , because in a week , 300 people will come here for the course , and bathing will be a fond dream .
Or showering , that is .
Tell Brian and June and Josephine I said hi , and that I'm OK .
I hope they got my card .
I 'll try to write , but do n't know when I 'll get time .
Take care of yourself and be happy , Elly # 26 : Averi Dunn ( vaxen ) Sat , Dec 28 , ' 91 ( 01:26 )
The following are excerpts from a letter I received from Elly on Dec 21 .
******** 7 Nov
The course starts today so I 'm incommunicado for a month .
13 Dec Hmmm .
I guess I never finished this .
Lots of things have happened since then .
Mainly , I 've become a nun .
I sent details to Hank so he could post , because I have to write about 10 letters for Peter to take back when he goes .
It 's a little strange , but I feel really good about it , and I really feel it 's the right move for me .
Even Peter agrees .
I never wanted to be a nun ( at least not before now ) .
I always felt a little sorry for the Catholic nuns .
This is a little different , though - - much more freedom .
It 's interesting to have short hair , though .
I think I 'll grow it out to about 3/4$ S0 . :-) PPS .
My ordination name is Jigme Palmo : Glorious fearless woman ( !!!? )
********
She also sent an address she can be reached at for the next six months .
Drop me Email if you want it .
So Elly had decided to become a Buddhist nun in Asia , and therefore threatened to pass into the annals of WELL legend .
The topic stayed dormant for six months .
In June , former neighbor Averi Dunn , who had been typing Elly 's correspondence into the WELL , reported hearing that Elly had some kind of amoeba in her liver .
At the end of July 1992 , Flash Gordon reported that Elly was in a hospital in New Delhi .
In a coma .
She had severe hepatitis and reportedly suffered liver failure .
If that report turned out to be true , Flash and the other doctors online agreed that the prognosis was not good .
Within hours , people started doing things in half a dozen directions on their own initiative .
The raw scope and diversity of the resources available to us by pooling our individual networks was astonishing .
People who had medical connections in New Delhi were brought in ; airline schedules and rates for medical evacuation were researched ; a fund was started and contributions started arriving .
Casey used the net to find a possible telecommunications site in New Delhi where they could relay information for Frank , Elly 's ex-husband , who had flown to Asia to help with what was looking like a grave situation .
After a tense few days , the news made its way through the network that she did have some liver function left and might need access to special blood - filtering equipment before she could be moved .
Within hours , we knew how to get such medical equipment in New Delhi and whose name to mention .
We knew whom to call , how to ask , what it cost , and how to transfer funds to get Elly delivered to a hospital in the San Francisco region .
" It gives me goosebumps , " reported Onezie , as the topic unfolded on the WELL .
" This is love in action . "
Elly recovered enough strength to travel without medical evacuation .
Her next message was direct , via the WELL : # 270 : Elly van der Pas ( elly ) Fri , Sep 11 , ' 92 ( 16:03 )
Thanks to everyone for your generous WELLbeams , good wishes , prayers , advice , and contributions of green energy .
The doctor thought the fast recovery was due to Actigall , but in fact it was due to beams , prayers , and pujas .
He even said I might be able to go back to India in February or so .

Anand said he had given one of his best - ever performances
India 's Viswanathan Anand has retained his FIDE World Chess Championship title by beating Russia 's Vladimir Kramnik in the German city of Bonn .
Anand won three games , drew seven times and lost once en route to winning the competition by 6.5 points to 4.5 .
He and Kramnik will share the total prize fund of 1.5 m euros ( $ 1.94 m ) .
Anand became FIDE world champion last year by winning a tournament in Mexico , where Kramnik was again runner - up .
Anand first won the title in 2000 .
Kramnik , the Classical World Chess Champion , had competed in the 2007 World Chess Federation ( FIDE ) world championship with the understanding that if he lost , he would get a chance to reclaim the title by playing a match against the winner in 2008 .
Vladimir pushed me into giving my all
Viswanathan Anand
" Vladimir pushed me into giving my all .
I 've given one of my best - ever performances here in Bonn , " Anand , 38 , told the AFP news agency after his victory on Wednesday .
" I tried everything , but it just was n't enough .
Life is like that and defeat is part of it , " Kramnik conceded .
Anand , who was born in the southern Indian city of Madras ( Chennai ) , divides his time between India and Spain .
Known as the " Tiger from Madras " , his achievements have triggered huge interest in the game in India with chess clubs mushrooming in many parts of the country .

Do n’t forget you can also add a shortcut key for any application which you use regularly using the Keyboard Shortcuts tab in the System Preferences for Keyboard and Mouse .
For example , I find it annoying that — unlike almost every other application in the iLife suite — the main key shortcut for “ Show Main Window ” in iTunes is n’t ⌘+1 , but ⌘+⌥+1 , so I ’ve edited mine back to how it should be .
Custom keyboard shortcuts take primacy over default system ones — but this rather annoyingly changes back to default if an application update is released — which in the case of iTunes is once every five seconds .
Generally , though , custom keyboard shortcuts are extremely useful and you can use them to add Apple - like shortcuts to applications which should already have them — like Firefox browser , for example .

Karl Rove learned how to use the right - wing Evangelicals to such an extent it constitutes abuse .
But the Evangelicals , they are willing participants , you see , they are using Karl Rove , too .
The Evangelicals know they are disrespected and mocked by the Republicans when their backs are turned .
They just do n't care .
It 's just an understood sacrifice of pride needed to obtain their ultimate goal ... controlling Washington .
They are so hellbent on controlling our Government that Evangelicals will betray the very values they claim to live by .
They will lie , they will cheat and they will steal to move closer , inches at a time , to accomplish what Evangelicals call " Enlarging our Territory .
"
Well , those inches have become miles in the Evangelical 's quest to turn America into a theocratic state .
They have pushed the boundaries of church and state to such an extent that what used to be unacceptable is now disregarded as petty and unmoving .
Just the way they want it .
In their documentary , " Faith of the Abomination , " Ceil and Han get to watch this process play out up front and personal .
David Barton is the head of an organization called Wallbuilders .
Aptly named , Wallbuilders stated mission is to turn America into a theocratic state .
David Barton let Karl Rove lead him to the Promise Land and was hired by the RNC ( Republican National Committee ) as a consultant in 2006 .
He travels the country teaching right - wing Evangelical preachers how to get around IRS laws .
At least , that 's what he gets them to believe .
In reality , they are breaking the law .
In a 1996 critique of Barton 's documentary , " America 's Godly Heritage , " the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs said of Barton : " His presentation has just enough ring of truth to make him credible to many people .
It is , however , laced with exaggerations , half - truths , and misstatements of fact .
" During the project , " Faith of the Abomination , " David Barton showed up one Sunday at Victory Christian Center Austin , thus became a big part of the documentary .
Ceil and Han have agreed to let me show you a clip staring David Barton himself , enjoy ... We hope to have " Faith of the Abomination " out to the masses soon .
In the meantime , if you can , please visit their PayPal account and do all you can to help .
Every little bit counts .
Thanks again to Ceil and Han for letting me use the " Politics in the Pulpit " clip .

The 40kg of caviar was seized from two couriers
Beluga caviar seized by Italian customs officers is to be distributed to poor people in Milan as a Christmas gift .
About 40kg ( 88lb ) of caviar was confiscated in November after two couriers travelling from Poland were stopped with the hidden cargo .
Newspaper Corriere Della Sera says the caviar had an estimated value of $ 550,000 ( £ 370,000 ) .
Tests showed the caviar to be edible , so it is to be given to canteens , hospices and shelters for the poor .
Beluga caviar is the most expensive variety of the delicacy .
Countries have tried to crack down on illegal trading of caviar after more than 600 tonnes of it were traded in the EU between 1998 and 2004 .
However , last year the United Nations lifted a ban imposed in 2006 on beluga caviar exports after Caspian Sea states agreed to limit catches of the fish from which it is taken .
The ban was implemented because the sturgeon was fast disappearing from the Caspian , the source of about 90 % of world caviar .
HONG KONG –
The right - wing US advocacy group Freedom ’s Watch is reportedly shutting down as its main funder , Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson , becomes one of the high - profile casualties of the global economic downturn .
Freedom ’s Watch , which according to the Las Vegas Review Journal , has scheduled huge staff layoffs for the end of December , was one of the most prominent advocacy groups aligned with the Republican Party .
Adelson contributed over 30 million dollars to Freedom ’s Watch in 2007 and 2008 , but has had to cut back on his philanthropy as his net worth  estimated at 36 billion dollars in 2007  shrunk by 13 billion dollars .
His company  the Las Vegas Sands Corporation  faces huge losses as its aggressive expansion in Singapore and Macau coincided with the global financial crisis .
Freedom ’s Watch was conceived in March 2007 as an offshoot of the Florida Republican Jewish Coalition in which Adelson is a longtime member .
The stated mission of Freedom ’s Watch has been to “ support mainstream conservative public policies ” but the focus of the group ’s lobbying and media campaigns has reflected the staunchly pro-Iraq war and pro-Israeli - Likud Party politics of its chief benefactor .
In November 2007 , Adelson placed himself to the far right of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , when he denounced the organization ’s support for a two - state solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
“ If someone is going to jump off a bridge , it is incumbent upon their friends to dissuade them , ” he told the Jewish Telegraph Agency .
“ I do n’t continue to support organizations that help friends committing suicide just because they say they want to jump . ”
Freedom ’s Watch spent 15 million dollars on an ad blitz in the summer of 2007 supporting the George W. Bush administration ’s troop surge in Iraq , and the group bought both print ads and television time , in four Senate and over 30 House races in the Nov. 4 election .
But recent reports have suggested that Adelson ’s grip on the group ’s purse - strings and his need to authorize and approve every media campaign and expenditure have led Freedom ’s Watch board members and top Republican party operatives to express frustration with his top - down management style .
The global economic downturn and the rapid expansion of Adelson ’s casino empire in Asia has coincided with a split between Adelson and Christian evangelicals who had aligned themselves with the neoconservative foreign policy interests promoted by Freedom ’s Watch .
Tensions between the Christian right and Adelson ’s business interests boiled over on Sep. 29 when the Christian Coalition of Alabama ’s president , Dr. Randy Brinson , denounced Adelson as “ not sharing our values as Alabamans . ”
Adelson ’s casino interests in Macau , a Chinese gambling enclave near Hong Kong , has called attention to his expanding casino empire and his backroom politicking on behalf of the Chinese government who the Christian right are quick to point criticism at for its human rights violations , restrictions on religion and the government ’s communist identity .
On May 25 , 2008 a Las Vegas , Nevada jury awarded Richard Suen  a Hong Kong businessman  43.8 million dollars in damages against the Sands Corporation .
The judgment was the conclusion of Suen ’s lawsuit which claimed he had served as a “ fixer ” for Adelson and the Sands Corp. in arranging meetings with high - level Chinese government officials in Beijing .
Suen ’s version of events is that Adelson and the Sands Corp. had been seeking a casino license to enter the lucrative gambling market in Macau .
In meetings , arranged by Suen in 2001 , Adelson learned that Beijing was concerned about an effort led by US House Republicans to stop China from winning their 2008 Olympic bid .
Testimony given by Suen revealed that Adelson , eager to curry favor with Beijing , immediately phoned then House Majority Whip Tom Delay and , after getting off the phone with DeLay , reportedly turned to the mayor of Beijing and said , “ The bill will never see the light of day , Mr. Mayor .
Do n’t worry about it . ”
Sands Corp. received the lucrative casino license and has since opened the Cotai Strip development and the Venetian Macau at a cost of 2.4 billion dollars and an estimated 10 to 12 billion dollars in costs by 2010 .
The close relationship between Adelson and the Chinese government damaged Adelson ’s alliances with the Christian Right  a powerful constituency within the Republican Party .
“ Where Sheldon Adelson has placed his treasure makes it quite clear where his heart is : in gambling and backing the regime in China that persecutes Christians , ” said Brinson .
Adelson ’s shrinking fortune has also meant huge cutbacks in his other high - profile philanthropic venture  Birth Right Israel  which sends young Jews on all - expense paid trips to Israel .
With his wife Miriam , Adelson contributed 70 million dollars over the past two years but his pledged contributions for 2009 and 2010 have been reduced to 20 million and 10 million dollars , respectively .
The combination of the global financial crisis , increased media attention on his business dealings in China , and a split between Christian evangelicals and Freedom ’s Watch has marked a particularly inauspicious year for a man who in 2006 ruefully commented to the interviewer Charlie Rose , “ A billion dollars does n’t buy what it used to . ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Morgan Stanley reported a massive $ 2.3 billion quarter loss Tuesday that surpassed even the most dire predictions by analysts .
The nation 's No. 2 investment bank posted a net loss of $ 2.24 a share , during the fourth quarter - a period defined by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and unprecedented market turmoil .
Including results from discontinued operations , the company said it lost $ 2.34 a share .
Either way , the results were far worse than what analysts were anticipating .
Consensus estimates were for a loss of $ 298 million , or 34 cents a share , according to Thomson Reuters .
Just a month ago , analysts were widely expecting Morgan Stanley to report a narrow profit for the quarter .
But they steadily lowered their earnings expectations for the firm given the ongoing volatility in the financial markets .
John Mack , Morgan Stanley 's chairman and CEO , blamed the quarter 's results on unprecedented turmoil that has roiled the stock and credit markets and the entire financial services sector .
" These exceptional market conditions profoundly impacted our performance this year , especially in the fourth quarter , " Mack said in a statement .
Investors , however , seem unfazed by the news .
Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) shares , which have lost more than 60 % of their value since Labor Day , rose about 2 % Wednesday .
The stock did fall in the morning following the release of the results .
A closer look
Nearly all of Morgan Stanley 's key businesses were hit hard during the quarter .
Revenues in its investment banking - related division tumbled from a year ago , as did the results of the company 's prime brokerage business , which caters to hedge fund clients .
Morgan Stanley 's asset management division , typically a consistent performer for the firm , was hit hard during the quarter by losses related to real estate and private equity .
In addition , Morgan Stanley said there was a surge in the number of asset management customers cutting ties with the firm .
" Just the magnitude of the outflows is amazing - in a bad way , " said Michael Wong , an equity analyst at research firm Morningstar .
Employees at Morgan Stanley suffered as a result of the dismal performance during the quarter as the company 's bonus pool was cut in half from a year ago .
Earlier this month , Mack opted to forgo his annual bonus for 2008 , representing the second straight year he would not collect one .
Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in mid-September , Morgan Stanley has scrambled to shore up its capital position .
The company raised nearly $ 25 billion in capital during the quarter , the bulk of which came from a $ 9 billion investment from the Japanese financial firm Mitsubishi UFJ ( MTU ) and $ 10 billion from the U.S. government as part of the bank bailout .
The New York City - based firm has made it clear it is looking to bulk up on deposits as a way of shoring up its funding sources .
It has been widely reported that Morgan Stanley is looking at potential acquisitions of regional banks and has hired two retail banking veterans to help with those efforts .
At the same time , Morgan Stanley has scaled back on leveraged bets by cutting back on its residential mortgage origination business and its proprietary trading unit , which uses the firm 's own money to make investments .
As a result , Morgan Stanley 's total assets are down by more than a third so far this year to $ 658 billion , the company said Wednesday .
During a conference call with investors Wednesday , Colm Kelleher , Morgan Stanley 's chief financial officer , said he expected the near - term environment to be very challenging , and warned that it could take additional writedowns in the future .
" We are expecting 2009 to be a year of transition , " said Kelleher .
While painful , Wednesday 's fourth - quarter numbers still paled in comparison to the same period a year ago .
Morgan Stanley recorded a $ 3.59 billion loss during the same period in 2007 as a result of massive writedowns on its mortgage - related securities .
Just a day earlier , crosstown rival Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) reported a loss of about $ 2.1 billion , its first since the company went public in 1999 .
Next September will mark my 20th year in jail .
It is not an anniversary I 'm particularly proud of .
I was convicted of murder and hopelessly sentenced to life without the possibility of parole .
When I arrived at the infamous Pelican Bay Prison , I was shocked right out of my criminal - minded circuit of stupidity .
The flow of in - house narcotics profits did n't appeal to me anymore .
My drug - dealing days had already brought me to terrestrial hell .
Like the majority of prisoners on the yard , I just wanted to do my time as trouble - free as possible .
I simply wanted to build on the better part of me , redeem whatever part of me was possible .
As the cycle of drug abuse , negative peer pressure , and unfettered rebellion roiled around my years of confinement , I began to long for something better .
I wanted to be productive , do something better .
That desire to build on the better part of me swelled , but with little comfort and no outlet .
With fervent disillusion , I came to see the California Department of Corrections ( CDC ) as nothing more than an empty shell .
It 's a colossal department with two overriding modes of operation : 1 ) behavior control with a heavy stick as its main prod ; and 2 ) the fostering of survival of fittest , thus encouraging a cut - throat atmosphere of criminal cronyism .
In other words , if you do n't join a clique , you could be swallowed up as a loner in the predatory food chain .
Scarce are the rewards for positive behavior , especially for lifers .
Still , I managed to remain disciplinary free for 14 consecutive years ( dodging the racism , prison - styled hazing , and violent clique initiations ) , in spite of the pervasive violence , negativity , and hopelessness .
Ironically , it was n't until I found myself in trouble ( for being too friendly with a nurse ) , that I was transferred to the state prison in Los Angeles County , host of the Prison Honor Program .
Suddenly , my lack of cognitive stimulation and productivity was turned on its head .
There was such a wide array of self - help opportunities to choose from , I did n't know where to start : yoga , creative writing , critical thinking , painting , and many other classes and activities .
I also experienced a different type of peer pressure .
My first day out , I was approached by a succession of other prisoners , echoing the same guidance as the first guy : " We do n't ' bang ' here ; we do n't play [ prison ] politics , racial or any other kind ; and we respect every one , including the guards . "
That speech has been an indelible part of my daily living for the past six years .
I later learned that the program was initiated in 2000 by other reform - minded prisoners .
Prisoners who also had an avid desire for inner growth and change .
With the support of open - minded staff , peer - instructed classes were allowed , using inherent individual talents to sharpen the masses .
To my amazement , not a single class was racially segregated .
Everyone interacts and we 've come to understand one another better .
On the yard , all races play and exercise together , a freakish sight after years of being programmed the other way .
Graffiti is nowhere to be found , replaced instead by colorful , creative murals and other works of art .
Since I 've been here , racial riots , rapes , work stoppages , and the wide range of other wickedness are all memories of the past .
I believe this is the only facility in the states that can make such a positive claim .
The success of the Honor Program can not be denied .
According to a study conducted by prison staff , the Honor Program saved the CDC ( and taxpayers ) more than $ 200,000 in its first year alone .
Meanwhile , weapons infractions decreased 88 percent , and violence and threatening behavior dropped 85 percent .
In a state that features one of the nation 's highest recidivism rates – two - thirds of Cailfornia 's offenders return to prison within three years – such tangible evidence of behavioral correction is welcome indeed .
The secret to this is that it is a completely volunteer program .
To our dismay , our success has earned only partial and inconsistent support from the institution and past secretaries of the department at headquarters in Sacramento .
Sadly there is still a school of thought that does n't believe in incentive - based programs or rehabilitation .
For members of this camp , continuation of the failed model is sufficient .
They want the stick and nothing but the stick .
Sadly , the violence , deaths , and costly court interventions do n't help them see the light .
My hope is that the new secretary of the department , Matthew Cate , will see the light and help move corrections out of the shadows of the dark ages .
It would be a shame to see such a proven success – and a single tree that could yield a much fuller set of branches – go by the wayside .

Washington , DC , December 11 , 2008 --
An independent review investigating the effectiveness of a publicly funded graphic anti-methamphetamine advertising campaign has found that the campaign has been associated with many negative outcomes .
The review was published in the December issue of Prevention Science , a peer reviewed journal of the Society for Prevention Research ( SPR ) .
The Montana Meth Project ( MMP ) was created in 2005 to reduce methamphetamine use in Montana via graphic advertising showing extreme consequences of using meth " just once . "
Initially the ad campaign was privately funded , but it has since received millions of dollars in state and federal support as the MMP has promoted the ad campaign as a resounding success to policy makers and the media .
Based on the apparent success of the ad campaign in Montana , it has since been implemented in other states including Arizona , Idaho , and Illinois , with more states to follow .
The negative outcomes identified in the review include : following six months exposure to the MMP 's graphic ads , there was a threefold increase in the percentage of teenagers who reported that using meth is not a risky behaviour ; teenagers were four times more likely to strongly approve of regular meth use ; teenagers were more likely to report that taking heroin and cocaine is not risky ; and up to 50 % of teenagers reported that the graphic ads exaggerate the risks of using meth .
The review found that the MMP overlooked these unflattering results when promoting their research findings to policymakers and the media .
Instead , the MMP focused on select positive findings .
The author of the review , David Erceg - Hurn , who is currently completing his PhD in Clinical Psychology at the University of Western Australia , came across the Meth Project while conducting research on graphic tobacco advertising .
There was a mention of the Meth Project in an article he read .
Erceg - Hurn followed up on that mention and closely scrutinized the Meth Project 's research reports .
He said that it is important for organizations that are funding or considering funding the MMP 's ad campaign to be made aware of all of the MMP 's findings - positive and negative .
To date , this has not happened .
Erceg -Hurn also criticized claims that the ad campaign has been responsible for reducing meth use in Montana .
" Meth use had been declining for at least six years before the ad campaign commenced , which suggests that factors other than the graphic ads cause reductions in meth use .
Another issue is that the launch of the ad campaign coincided with restrictions on the sale of cold and flu medicines commonly used in the production of meth .
This means that drug use could be declining due to decreased production of meth , rather than being the result of the ad campaign . "
Erceg - Hurn also pointed out in his review that due to the way the MMP has conducted their research , it is impossible to conclude that the ad campaign had any effect on meth use .
To draw such conclusions would require much more rigorous research .
This would involve examining two groups of teenagers that were equivalent in terms of drug use , exposing only one group to the graphic ads , and then examining any differences between the groups in their drug use .
The theory underlying the MMP's ad campaign was also criticized by Erceg - Hurn .
" The idea behind the ad campaign is that teenagers take meth because they believe it is socially acceptable , and not risky - and the ads are meant to alter these perceptions .
However , this theory is flawed because the Meth Project 's own data shows that 98 % of teenagers strongly disapproved of meth use and 97 % thought using meth was risky before the campaign started . "
The review also points out that considerable prior research has found that large anti-drug advertising campaigns can be ineffective and sometimes harmful .
For example , the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign has cost taxpayers over $ 1.5 billion since 1998 .
A Government Accountability
Office report found that the ad campaign has not reduced drug use .
The only significant results were in an unfavorable direction - some youths reported an increase in marijuana use upon increased exposure to the campaign .
Erceg -Hurn concluded in his Prevention Science review that based on current evidence , continued public funding and rollout of Montana - style anti-methamphetamine graphic ad campaign programs is inadvisable .

FOR RELEASE : December 11 , 2008 12:05 EST
After several years of what many court - watchers considered the acme of frivolous litigation , The Great American Pants Suit has died on the vine .
( Click here for a report from the BLT blog . )
Soo Chung , left , and Jin Chung , represented by their lawyer Chris Manning , standing , who are being sued by D.C. judge Roy Pearson , right , June 13 , 2007 .
( AP / Dana Verkouteren ) Roy Pearson , the former administrative law judge who unsuccessfully sued his dry cleaner for $ 54 million over a pair of lost pants , went before the appeals court in October .
He said : " This is not a case about a pair of suit pants . "
Rather , it is about whether the owners of a neighborhood business misled consumers with a sign that claimed " Satisfaction Guaranteed , " he said .
" There is an unconditional guarantee , " he argued , unless the merchant indicates otherwise .
By Pearson 's interpretation of the sign , the Chungs -- the owners of the now - defunct Custom Cleaners -- owe him $ 18,000 for each day the pants were missing over a nearly four - year period .
In that time , Pearson 's demand went up to $ 67 million .
The three judge panel disagreed .
In today 's opinion , Judge Noel Kramer says Pearson 's argument that a " Satisfaction Guaranteed " sign is an unconditional and unlimited warrant of satisfaction has no basis and that when trial Judge Judith Bartnoff rejected that claim , it showed " basic common sense . "
Here 's the opinion .
On appeal , the Chungs were represented by Christopher Manning , a partner at Manning Sossamon .
Reached for comment , Pearson told the BLT blog : " I have no comment , and I have n't seen the opinion . "

Spoonman : Tonight , dear listener , we go to war .
It ’s ironic that just two days ago we paused to remember those who died fighting wars to protect our freedoms and our democracy , our rights to choose .
But today the threat to those values and rights is not from any external force – no foreign country – but from our own Federal Government .
In this case the battlefield is the internet , the trenches are our ISPs , and our only available weapon is your home computer .
I ’ll be urging you to take up the fight during tonight ’s show .
Now as you may or may not be aware , the Rudd government set aside 128.5 million dollars to filter or block internet content that is , under Australian law , illegal .
The Government claims the plan ’s designed to prevent Australians from accessing child pornography .
But in reality , once the issues have all played out , both technically and politically , it ’s entirely possible that the bans would affect anything the Government deemed inappropriate , and we , the internet users of Australia , would n’t have a clue what we ’re not able to access .
It is possible that the blacklist that the Government ’s going to draw up would apply to porn , websites advocating changes to voluntary euthanasia or indeed drug laws , maybe online gaming sites .
Bloggers and independent journo ’s sites could also be blocked , just to mention a few .
And for those of you who get around the lack of an R18 classification for videogames by downloading them from the net , you ’re gonna find those sites on the Government blacklist as well .
Now the blacklist of websites will be held by the Australian Communication and Media Authority , otherwise known as ACMA .
It ’s rumoured to contain around 10 000 websites .
The list will be supplied to the 400 - odd internet service providers ; they ’ll be forced to prevent you from accessing the sites on that list .
The Cybersafety Plan , as the Government calls it , is in reality nothing more than a censorship of the internet .
Despite noises from the now Federal Communications Minister Senator Stephen Controy , during the last election campaign , there will be no capacity to opt out of the scheme .
Instead there ’s going to be two levels of censorship .
The first is the blanket ban of sites the Government determines to be inappropriate .
The second level will allow individual users to block access to ordinary porn sites , for example , to stop kids looking at them .
Critics of the plan are making the following points :
* The Government simply has not made a case for the need for such a censorship of the internet .
* We already have the capacity to download free Net Nanny - type software at the user end to prevent children from accessing pornography .
It cost 84 million dollars of your money to develop , was hacked in thirty minutes by a sixteen - year - old , and the takeup rate so far has been pathetically low .
Most of the people who did decide to download it no longer use it .
* IT experts and the Government ’s own figures show that internet speed , should this plan get up , will be reduce by at least two percent at best , and up to 80 % at worst .
Remember , Kevin Rudd ’s Labor Government is spending another ten billion dollars of your money to develop a high speed broadband network , but seems intent on sabotaging it before it ’s even established .
Those same experts also point to a number of flaws in the plan .
For example :
* Peer to peer protocols , which account for about sixty percent of internet traffic , ca n’t be blocked under the Government ’s plan .
* Other encryption protocols are already available which can render users invisible to any authorities including the Australian Federal Police .
No doubt the disgusting child porn producers will be using these protocols already .
* Critics also claim that this censorship will put Australia in the same league as China , Iran , and Saudia Arabia .
So tonight , I ’m going to dedicate a good slab of the show to finding out exactly what ’s going on , and why we need to take a stand and fight this attack on our so far uncensored internet .
In the interest of fairness , I made a number of approaches to the Federal Communications Minister Stephen Conroy to come on the show tonight and explain his position .
Late this afternoon I received a reply from his media advisor : “ The Senator is not available to talk . ”
Not surprising , given how low - key the Government wants to keep this issue .
But his reply did contain a background briefing paper , which is more damning than enlightening .
So tonight , I ’m going to speak to those spearheading the campaign to stop this stupidity , and then I ’ll open up for a reaction from you , the internet users of Australia .
Because tonight , gang , we are going to war .
The not - for - profit organisation spearheading the anti-censorship campaign is Electronic Frontiers Australia .
Their web address , and I urge you to look at it , is efa.org.au .
As I say , I urge you to check the website , make your comments , even make a donation , so they can take the fight up to Canberra on this one .
I have the Chair of the Electronic Frontiers Australia on the line now .
Dale Clapperton , welcome to Triple M .
Dale Clapperton : G’day .
SM : Now the Government ’s couched this internet censorship plan in very emotive terms , have n’t they , to prevent the distribution of child pornography online .
But it ’s more than that , is n’t it ?
DC : It ’s much more than that .
Playing the child pornography card is something that the Government always trots out when this is on the agenda .
It ’s a fairly low and fairly transparent attempt to shut down debate on it .
Essentially , they like to label anybody who ’s against this as a child pornographer or paedophile .
It ’s pretty low , and it really is a demonstration of how weak their arguments are .
SM : There have been allegations published in the media recently suggesting the Government ’s gone to the extent of trying to gag critics , alleging that anyone who disagrees somehow supports child pornography – which is just outrageous , is n’t it ?
DC : It is .
The Government , via one of the Minister ’s media advisors , actually tried to exert political pressure on the employer of a bloke called Mark Newton , who ’s been speaking out against this scheme .
He ’s a fairly technical person with Internode , a major Australian ISP .
So he ’s probably one of the people in Australia who ’s best placed to be able to know that as a strictly technical matter , what the Government are proposing to do is just farcical .
SM : He has written a letter to his local Member of Parliament .
Are you aware of whether he ’s got a reply to that or not ?
DC : I could n’t tell you , off the top of my head , but so far what seems to be happening is that everybody who ’s writing to their local members about this , or at least where those members are part of the Labor Party , they ’re just getting a strictly form letter response .
It ’s completely canned , and it really does n’t address any specific issues that the people have raised with the Members .
SM : So when you say “ form letters ” , it ’s – “ thank you for your reply , we ’ll have a look at it and get back to you in due course ” kind of thing ?
DC : Well , it ’s “ thankyou for your reply , and here is two pages of spin and propaganda on how we ’re saving the children and making the internet safe for everybody ” .
SM : Mm-hmm , which is basically what I got by way of a background briefing paper from the Minister ’s office today .
Now we were originally told during the election campaign last year that we would have the ability to opt out of this filtering plan .
That ’s not the case now , is it ?
DC : It ’s very definitely not the case .
So either they were lying to us then , or they ’ve backflipped in between then and now .
There is , as you said in your introduction , going to be a level to blacklisting to this system that adults will not be able to opt out of , and as much as the Minister likes to defend this scheme by saying that it ’s either all child pornography or it ’s all what he likes to call “ illegal content ” , that ’s quite simply not the case .
If you look at the Government ’s own figures , for example , for the last annual report from the Australian Communications and Media Authority , nearly half of the items that they ’ve put on the blacklist in that year were n’t child pornography .
They were just everyday run -of - the - mill adult material .
SM : And there are better ways to block access to inappropriate sites , and they ’re already available , and that ’s the type of Net Nanny software you download onto your home PC .
DC : Absolutely .
It ’s a useful tool for parents who want this type of thing to help them control what their children can see or do online .
It ’s not a perfect solution ; supervision is obviously going to be part of the solution , as is education .
But it ’s available for people who want it , and we really do n’t see a case for shoving it down the throats of everybody else .
SM : Is there any way we can verify exactly what websites are contained on this blacklist ?
DC : No .
The blacklist itself is super - secret .
Back in 2001 , shortly after the Commonwealth Government started maintaining this blacklist , although not forcing anybody to actually block access to what ’s on it , EFA made a Freedom of Information request to the Government to try and find out the type of sites which were going on the blacklist .
The Government denied the FOI request .
We had to appeal it to the Minister of Appeals tribunal , where we ultimately lost .
And along the way , the Government actually changed the FOI Act to make these types of documents specifically exempt .
So it is , in reality , a secret blacklist .
Even when the Government bans or refuses classifications to films or computer games , that is actually on a publicly searchable database : you can get at it on the internet .
So then you can see what it is you ’re not allowed to see .
Once this scheme goes into place , there ’s just going to be a secret blacklist of websites you ’re not allowed to see , and you do n’t know what they are , and you do n’t know why , and there ’s no appeal .
SM : What sort of other sites , from your investigation into this issue , might be under threat from the censor ?
DC : Well , on the blacklist as it currently stands , we believe that there ’s a large number of X - rated websites .
So that ’s just ordinary , run -of - the - mill adult porn , the type of stuff that in some States and Territories in Australia you can walk into a shop and buy ; and in other places , you can get via mail order from Canberra for example .
So just regular , ordinary , run - of - the - mill porn .
There is a decent amount of that on the blacklist .
There ’s also a smaller amount of R - rated content ; that is , content which has been classified as inappropriate for children , because of sex or nudity .
SM : I guess there ’s also the capacity for the Government , given the content of the list will be secret – for example , they could blacklist websites that feature things like changes to voluntary euthanasia to laws , changes or proposals to change illicit drug laws , those kinds of things – essentially anything the Government does n’t want to have to deal with in an online capacity , that contradicts their line , could go on the blacklist , and we , the population , have no idea that that ’s happened , or indeed what they are ?
DC : There ’s a technical capacity to do that , and really what we ’ve seen to far is that a lot of the special interest groups in this debate are starting to come out of the woodwork .
Labor needs the support of the five Greens Senators , plus Senator Fielding from Family First , and the Independent from South Australia , Senator Nick Xenophon , to get any legislation through the Senate , if the Coalition votes against it .
SM : I wanted to do the politics in a little while , Dale , after we ’ve walked through some of the technical issues .
Let me just walk through the process here .
So the blacklist , once it ’s created , and it could contain anything up to as I say ten thousand odd websites .
That will have to be given to the 400 - odd ISPs around the country , wo n’t it ?
DC : Yes , it will .
And it ’s without a doubt going to leak , so to the extent that the blacklist does have child pornography sites on it – the blacklist is inevitable going to leak , they will have to distribute it to accomplish what they ’re setting out to do .
And then the Australian Government is essential going to be distributing a list of sites that contain child pornography .
SM : And as we ’ve already seen , when there are leaks of sensitive Government documents , the person doing the leaking is often the subject of a witch - hunt , and the person receiving the leaked documents , by way of a journalist , can find themselves in front of a court .
DC : That is usually the case , but what invariably also happens in those cases is that the leaked material itself does n’t actually get suppressed .
It ’ll end up on Wikileaks , or any number of the other websites outside Australia , outside the control of Australian laws .
And once it ’s leaked , there will be no getting rid of it .
SM : How practical will it be , from the Government ’s point of view or indeed ACMA ’s point of view , the Communications and Media Authority ?
Because they ’re going to have to constantly update this list , wo n’t they , because those who find themselves on the banned list for whatever reason will simply change URL and away you go .
DC : Well , that is correct , of course , to the extent that they know they ’ve ended up on the blacklist , because the Government does n’t tell anybody about what ’s on the blacklist …
SM : But I ’m assuming the list will be leaked and publicly available daily …
DC : Once it ’s leaked , of course people who want to get around it will simply change their domain name ; so the Government will be having to try and hit a moving target in that respect .
SM : Now , is there any suggestion here of transparency ?
Do we know what the process will be in order to determine what websites will be on that blacklist and why ?
DC : We know what ’s currently on the blacklist .
We do n’t know what ’s going to be on the blacklist once Labor implement this scheme .
Because they ’re sending all kinds of equivocal and mixed messages .
In the Senate earlier this week , the Senator was talking about “ unwanted ” content as opposed to “ illegal ” content .
So we do n’t know what the blacklist is going to look like in future .
But as far as the process : currently , content has to be submitted to what used to be the Office of Film and Literature Classification , and is now the Classification Board .
They pretend that that piece of content is actually a film , such as you might see in a cinema , and they classify it according to the same rules .
And if it ’s classified either as “ Refused Classification ” , that is banned , or classified X , or classified R and it ’s not protected by a Government - approved access control scheme , it will go on the blacklist .
SM : How easy will it be for users who are arguable far more net - savvy than me to get around the system ?
What sort of protocols are available to become effectively invisible as an internet user in Australia ?
DC : It will be pretty trivial to accomplish that .
What we ’ve seen in recent years , where the number of countries with frankly fairly oppressive internet regulation schemes go – and I ’m talking about countries such as China , Burma , and so forth here – countries which Australia will probably be joining if this goes ahead : people have developed tools that people in those countries can use to get around the schemes .
And they work quite well .
The same type of tools will be used in Australia .
But even if you ignore those kinds of specialist tools , people will still be able to get “ inappropriate ” material via peer - to - peer services , or via email , or via anything encrypted .
Which of course the internet filters wo n’t be able to filter – the best that they can do is attempt to block it entirely – which would break things such as online banking .
SM : Now , I ’m quoting here directly from the media briefing paper that was sent to me from Senator Conroy ’s office this afternoon .
This is in response to a Q&A .
The question is “ Has the plan been achieved in any other liberal democracies ? ”
The answer is “ ISP filtering of this sort of material has already been implemented in countries such as the UK , Sweden , Norway , and Canada ( amongst others ) . ”
That is a lie , is n’t it ?
DC : It is a lie .
In those countries , only some ISPs do blacklisting .
They do n’t actually filter content , they only apply a blacklist .
It ’s done voluntarily , by not all of the ISPs , and that blacklist is only supposed to target child pornography .
What the Government are proposing will be mandatory for all ISPs , and it is going to target a hell of a lot more than just child porn .
SM : OK .
Some of the technical downsides of the plan as I understand them :
* Speeds will be affected
* Some innocent sites will be blocked
* Some not - so - innocent sites are going to be missed .
Is that a reasonable assessment ?
DC : It ’s a very reasonable assessment , and in fact it ’s borne out by the results of the Government ’s very own trials that they carried out earlier in the year .
They tested six different filtering products .
We ’re not permitted to know exactly which six products they tested .
But from the results that they released , only one of those products had anything approaching an acceptable speed impact , and that caused a two percent slowdown .
The others were all into the double digits , and they averaged about 30 or 40 % speed reduction from the maximum capacity of the network .
And on top of that , they all let through several percent of material that they ought to have blocked access to , and they all blocked an even higher percentage of material that was legitimate , and they should n’t have blocked .
It ’s looked as though , on the basis of those numbers and assuming that they carry over into the real world , that about one in twenty websites could be inadvertently blocked under the type of filtering system they ’re proposing .
SM : Let ’s have a look at politics , if I can .
DC : Absolutely .
SM : I notice the Coalition ’s Bruce Billson , who ’s the Shadow Communications spokesperson , has been virtually absent from this debate .
How do you think the Liberals are going to vote on this one – the Coalition ?
DC : Well , the public policy of the Coalition on this issue is that they do n’t think it can be accomplished .
Almost in their exact words , they ’re saying that they remain to be convinced that it ’s technologically feasible ; and even if it ’s feasible , they ’re not entirely sure that it ’s a good idea .
They ’re really waiting to see what the results of the live trial the Commonwealth is trying to enlist ISPs into carrying out in the next couple of months are .
SM : I ’ll be talking to a senior executive from one ISP who has jumped on board a little later in the show .
Now if – obviously , if the Coalition decide to vote with this , in the Senate particularly , its ’ a fait accompli , is n’t it ?
DC : It is .
There ’s nothing that could be done to stop it in that case .
It would sail through both Houses of Parliament , and the Australian citizens , really their only recourse would be at the next election , when I ’m quite sure they would make their feelings heard in a clear and unambiguous fashion .
SM : Judging from some of the postings on your website I can well understand that .
Now , if the government though has to start horse - trading in the Senate in order to get this legislation through .
Assuming the Coalition votes against it , then Nick Xenophon and Steve Fielding – Xenophon the anti-gambling Senator who is from South Australia , and Steve Fielding from Family First – if they have to start horse - trading with these two , we could find all porn and all online gaming sites on that banned list , could we not ?
DC : It ’s entirely possible .
Those two Senators have shown that they are not afraid to shoot down Labor ’s legislation .
Senator Fielding killed Fuelwatch just yesterday by voting against it in the Senate , so assuming Labor need the support of those two Senators to get it through the Senate , and they want their own little additions to the scheme , it ’s entirely possible that material that those Senators want blocked … and remembering of course that Senator Fielding in particular is from Family First , a fairly right - wing conservative Christian party – it ’s entirely possible that all porn could end up on the blacklist .
SM : He ’s already stated publicly that he would like to see hardcore porn on that banned list , so he ’s already making those kind of noises and the horse - trading has n’t even started .
Now while I ’ve got you Dale Clapperton , the Chair of EFA , you ’re also campaigning , like I have for years on this show , to get an R18 rating for videogames .
What effect is the lack of an R18 category having ?
DC : Well , the lack of an R classification for computer games means that anything that ’s stronger than MA15 + is automatically banned , that is , it ’s refused classification .
When you put that in combination with this blacklisting scheme , what it ’s going to mean is that any computer game that ’s stronger than MA15 + , and I ’m thinking about computer games such as the overseas versions of Grand Theft Auto for example , will probably end up on the blacklist as soon as somebody complains about them , because they are technically banned in Australia .
SM : Now , obviously young people who want access to those games have been able to download them from the net , so the sites they download them from end up on the blacklist , and therefore you wo n’t be able to get access to them .
OK .
Now , the Government ’s asked for expressions of interest from ISPs to trial the filtering over the next few weeks , as you indicated .
Telstra Bigpond and Optus have not yet committed to it .
Iinet has , but only to prove to the government that it ’s unworkable at the technical level .
Have you got any reaction to that ?
Should the ISPs at this point in time take a stand and say , “ We ’re just simply not going to play with this ” ?
DC : We do n’t really have a position on whether the ISPs should do that or not .
If all the ISPs refused to play along with the Government ’s agenda on this , there ’s a very real risk that they would just go ahead and do it anyhow .
If at least some ISPs do participate , and the numbers do in fact show that it ’s not workable , then that is probably hard evidence that might cause the Coalition to oppose it .
So it ’s not an entirely bad thing that ISPs are doing this ; however , we would not want to see them forcing the filtering onto customers who have n’t volunteered for it .
SM : I should point out that Iinet is only getting involved to do just that – to make the case to the Government , and presumably to the Opposition , that this is a really stupid idea .
Now , just in conclusion , Dale , what ’s the best way for ordinary Australian internet users to fight this stupidity , and I guess a hideous waste of taxpayer money as well ?
DC : Well , it is , and the best way that they can do it is simply by telling their elected representatives how pissed off they are about this .
Lots of people have been doing that already ; we need lots more .
People need to find out who their Federal Member of Parliament is , and who their Federal Senators are for their State ; they need to get onto them , send them letters , send them emails , call their offices , try and get appointments to tell them face to face if you can .
Really , if Labor can be convinced that the vast majority of Australians do n’t want this , and I ’m quite sure that that ’s the case , it might cause them to drop it .
SM : Do you think that the Government is in any sort of mood to listen to the desires of the Australian people , or are they determined to push ahead with this .
DC : They are determined to push ahead with it .
It is something that they have promised to do before the election , although as we ’ve already discussed they were promising something quite different .
SM : Indeed , and I reported at the time that that ’s what they were considering , and did n’t worry too much about it on the basis that there would be an opt - out clause for the whole thing for the average internet user in Australia .
DC : Which of course is no longer the case , but notwithstanding that what they ’re proposing now bears no resemblance to what they were saying they would do if they got into power back then , they are saying that they have a mandate to do this and they ’re going to go ahead and do it .
I am , however , hopeful that notwithstanding their determination to do it , that they will have an eye on the next election , and if this does cause half of the damage that ’s being suggested it could by EFA and others , that they will realise that if this blows up in their face it will be something that will come back to haunt them at the next Federal election .
And it could quite conceivably cost them power .
SM : Is there any capacity for court challenges , Dale ?
DC : It ’s not impossible .
It ’s something that we ’ve been looking into .
Doing so would be hampered by the fact that Australian does n’t have a Bill of Rights .
We do n’t really have any kind of guarantee of free speech except for a pretty limited implied right in the Constitution .
SM : That ’s correct , yup .
DC : And that only really applies to speech on political and government matters .
If the scheme , once it was set up , was in fact blocking access to political and government related material , it ’s quite conceivable that a court challenge could succeed .
I ’m aware of at least one filtering programme or service which is sold by an overseas company that , as an example , blocks access to the website of the registered Australian political party One Nation , because it claims it ’s “ hate speech ” .
SM : Interesting .
Dale Clapperton , I very much appreciate your time .
He is the EFA Chairman .
Thank you sir .
DC : Happy to help .
SM : OK .
Now I urge you to log on to the website : efa.org.au .
They ’re happy to take donations .
It ’s a not for profit organisation set up specifically to represent the interests of the average internet user in Australia , under the guise of freedom of speech and all those other freedoms that so many died for so many years ago for the rest of us .

The Whitebark Pine
Tree may be the first widely dispersed tree to receive endangered species protection .
Conservationists have filed a petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stating the tree ’s extinction could leave huge holes in some of the continent ’s most spectacular landscapes and eliminate food sources for wildlife , including grizzly bears .
The petition argues that the current extent of losses of whitebark pine trees and the future threat of continued global warming put the tree at risk .
Under the law , a species is considered endangered if it is in danger of extinction in all or a significant portion of its range .
Scientists consider it a “ foundation species , ” meaning it creates conditions necessary for other plants and animals to live in the harsh alpine ecosystem .
[ social_buttons ]
The whitebark pine has declined dramatically due to a triple threat – a disease called the white pine blister rust ; the mountain pine beetle , which thrives in the warmer high - altitude conditions produced by the burning of fossil fuels ; and forest management practices that have allowed other trees to crowd it out , the NRDC ’s petition said .
“ It ’s kind of a wakeup call about the scope of the problems we ’re going to be facing , ” said NRDC scientist Sylvia Fallon , an ecologist who was one of the authors of the petition .
“ All of the pieces of the ecosystem it holds together will also be affected by its loss . ”

The website of a record label which offers completely free music downloads has been taken down by its host for copyright infringement , even though it only offers its own music .
Quote Unquote Records calls itself " The First Ever Donation Based Record Label " , but is currently homeless after its host pulled the plug .
Quote Unquote Records is an Internet based record label , run by Bomb the Music Industry ! and ‘ The Arrogant Sons of Bitches ’ frontman Jeff Rosenstock .
A forward looking outfit , all artists on the label give their music away for free on the label ’s website .
Well , they would , if the webhost had n’t have taken down the site for alleged copyright infringement .
In a MySpace blog entry , Jeff Rosenstock explained that the Quote Unquote Records site is non-operational , and other sites connected to the label , including the Bomb the Music Industry ! and Arrogant Sons of Bitches sites , have all been taken down too .
So what happened ?
Around a week ago , the label was notified by its webhost that it had some copyright music files on its server , which was no surprise to them since they were tracks by Arrogant Sons of Bitches , one of the label ’s bands .
The tracks the webhost referred to were actually written by Jeff himself .
Jeff spoke with someone at the host on the telephone , explained that they were his own tracks and was informed this was n’t a problem .
Three days later the labels site went down completely , due to Jeff hosting his own copyright files on his own site – a claimed violation of the hosting company ’s Terms of Service .
In order to solve the problem , Jeff would have to send his copyright registration forms to the host by mail , to prove he held the copyright , a problem in itself , explains Jeff :
“ I called the company to explain that a lot of this material was NOT in fact registered with the US copyright office , instead we did the ol’ poor man ’s copyright .
The music that was copyrighted was done so under a Creative Commons License , which is a digital copyright that cannot be viewed if the website where the files are posted is down . ”
It seems amazing that a host should be proactive like this , especially since it has clearly made a huge mistake .
However , a week later and Jeff ’s site is still down and he ’s quite rightly upset : “ I guess the scary thing for me is that it seems that my hosting server employs a guilty before proven innocent policy , which is terrifying for anyone who does not physically mail forms for every small idea they ’ve ever had in their bedroom to the US copyright office .
What a great new digital age , stuck in the trappings of wasteful forms and red tape . ”
If losing your site to a bogus copyright claim is n’t enough , there is a more immediate problem .
Jeff is being denied access to his data by the host and he says that since he had a crash on his local hard drive , he no longer has copies of any of the content that was on the Quote Unquote Records server .
“ So , long story short , I ’m looking for any artwork or mp3s that were put on Quote Unquote Records , ” he said .
If you can find any of the material Jeff is looking for on P2P networks , please post comments on his blog .
Israel is thought to have about 200 nuclear warheads at Dimona
Papers in the British National Archives show a deal was done to export 20 tonnes of heavy water for about £ 1.5 m .
This was vital for plutonium production at the top- secret Dimona nuclear reactor in Israel 's Negev desert .
No " peaceful use only " condition was placed on its use .
Officials said imposing one would be " over zealous " .
Ministers in Harold Macmillan 's government were unaware of the deal .
It was also kept secret from the US .
In one of the documents Foreign Office official Donald Cape concluded : " On the whole I would prefer not to mention this to the Americans . "
It is very surprising to me we were not told because we shared information about the nuclear bomb very closely with the British
Former US defence secretary Robert McNamara
Washington had refused to supply heavy water to Israel without a guarantee it would only be used for peaceful means .
US President John F Kennedy 's defence secretary from 1961 , Robert McNamara , told BBC News he was " astonished " by the cover-up .
" It is very surprising to me we were not told because we shared information about the nuclear bomb very closely with the British .
" The fact Israel was trying to develop a nuclear bomb should not have come as any surprise .
" But that Britain should have supplied it with heavy water was indeed a surprise to me . "
The heavy water - surplus from a consignment bought from Norway in 1956 - was shipped from a British port to Israel .
They just seemed to be concerned with making a bit of money
Former Conservative defence and foreign office minister Lord Gilmour
Officials presented it as a deal between Norway and Israel .
Former Conservative defence and foreign office minister Lord Gilmour told BBC News the revelations were " quite extraordinary " .
The civil servants involved must have known Israel would use the heavy water to develop a nuclear bomb , he added .
" They just seemed to be concerned with making a bit of money . "
By the time Israel asked the UK for more heavy water in 1961 , the existence of the Dimona reactor and a probable nuclear weapons programme had been exposed by the Daily Express newspaper , leading the Foreign Office to block the sale , the papers show .
The Israeli project is much too live an issue for us to get mixed up in it again
Sir Hugh Stephenson
Sir Hugh Stephenson wrote : " I am quite sure we should not agree to this sale .
" The Israeli project is much too live an issue for us to get mixed up in it again . "
While Israel has not publicly conducted a nuclear test and does not admit or deny having nuclear weapons , it has not signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty .
This means the International Atomic Energy Agency does not have the power to inspect Israeli nuclear facilities .
The Israelis say that will not change as long as they feel threatened by countries in the Middle East .
Gay penguins expelled from zoo colony for stealing eggs are given their own to look after following animal rights protest
A pair of gay penguins thrown out of their zoo colony for repeatedly stealing eggs have been given some of their own to look after following a protest by animal rights groups .
Last month the birds were segregated after they were caught placing stones at the feet of parents before waddling away with their eggs .
But angry visitors to Polar Land in Harbin , northern China , complained it was n't fair to stop the couple from becoming surrogate fathers and urged zoo bosses to give them a chance .
Who 's the daddy ?
The segregated penguin couple , right , are seen here in their own enclosure quarrelling with another male over stolen eggs
In response , zookeepers gave the pair two eggs laid by an inexperienced first - time mother .
' We decided to give them two eggs from another couple whose hatching ability had been poor and they 've turned out to be the best parents in the whole zoo , ' said one of the keepers .
' It 's very encouraging and if this works out well we will try to arrange for them to become real parents themselves with artificial insemination . '
Wildlife experts at the park explain that despite being gay the three - year - old male birds are still driven by an urge to be fathers .
' One of the responsibilities of being a male adult is looking after the eggs .
Despite the fact that they can't have eggs naturally , it does not take away their biological drive to be a parent , ' said one .
One campaigner who did not want to be named welcomed the move and said : ' It was n't fair to stop them becoming parents and keep them apart from all the other birds just because of the way nature has made them . '
Last month zookeepers said the couple were removed from the group not because of discrimination , but so as not to disturb the colony during hatching time .
Megan Fox Boasts Some Cleavage in Hollywood
Actress , temptress , seductive seductress , Megan Fox , unleashed her breasts two segments of heaven upon all of Hollywood earlier this week .
Fox strutted her goodies in a low - cut skimpy top , matches with a tight blue jeans , some long beaded jewelery and a pair of hilariously - oversized sunglasses .
If anyone can pull that outfit off , and make it look that hot , it 's Megan Fox !
Dec. 12 , 2008  --
A man standing on a street corner with a sign reading " the lizard people rule you all , " or , " my neighbors are spying on me for the government " is n't likely to get many supporters .
But give that man a Web site template , or let him produce some slick videos on YouTube and , lo and behold , he may have thousands of people across the world supporting him .
Such is the story of several extraordinarily popular conspiracy theorists and theories online today .
Take the victims of gang stalking -- a subculture of people who think their friends and neighbors are all secret government spies ready to turn them over to the authorities .
The movement has recently spawned gang stalking support groups , forums and advice Web sites .
Or take the former journalist and BBC sports announcer , David Icke , for example .
Icke was laughed out of the public eye in the early '90s when he started wearing only turquoise and explaining that voices had sent him on an important mission to save the earth .
Decades later , Icke has written books , has fans in 47 countries and can gather a crowd of 2,500 people in a city simply by posting a date for a lecture on his Web site .
The cornerstone of Icke 's theories is that a malicious race of lizard people -- the " shadowy elite " -- rules the world and all its political leaders primarily by controlling the media and orchestrating fear - mongering catastrophes , such as Sept. 11 .
Icke said he already has speeches lined up for 2009 in Los Angeles , Mexico , Croatia , New Zealand and Australia .
" I knew about the mainstream media , and that the mainstream media has a stunning level of myopia so that only that which is in the mainstream will be presented , " said Icke .
" What the Internet has done [ is that it ] has allowed information to flow outside of the myopia .
...
The Internet has been absolutely essential . "
The Internet has always been a forum for fringe ideas , but success like Icke's , and subcultures built on paranoid theories like gang stalkers , points to an understudied corner in psychiatry :
Who are the people who believe such theories in the quiet of their homes , and what does such behavior mean for a person teetering on the edge of mental illness ?
" It 's not an area that has been studied very well , " said Angus MacDonald , a spokesperson for the mental health charity NARSAD , and an associate professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis .
Does Conspiracy Always Equal Delusion ?
MacDonald cautioned that not everyone who believes in a conspiracy plot is mentally ill .
They just may be suggestible or just suspicious of authority .
For the healthy in mind , MacDonald said , " it 's a wild card about whether this is going to improve people 's state or not .
It may turn out that the value of the community is greater than the destructive nature of the narratives that are spun out of them .
" But on the same point , this is a domain that did n't need more wild cards , " he added .
Whether or not conspiracy theories harm people who are susceptible to mental illness is a matter of debate among psychiatrists .
" Most people with major mental illness do n't believe in conspiracy theories , " said Dr. Ken Duckworth , medical director of the National Alliance of Mental Illness .
Duckworth likes to imagine a Venn diagram with one circle representing people with paranoid psychosis and another circle representing people who believe conspiracy theories .
" They do overlap , but I can't tell you how big the overlap is , " he said .
" And , lizard people ?
Many people who are hearing voices would think that 's crazy . "
Duckworth argued that most mentally ill people create conspiracy theories that are self - centric , such as , " the mailman is after me , " not inclusive such as , " the postal workers are all out to get us by 2015 . "
But others who treat schizophrenics and people with paranoia think there is a risk in circulating online conspiracies .
" Paranoid is wide category -- it 's another way of being separate with reality -- but in our culture , we 've made it synonymous with persecutory delusions , " said MacDonald .
The Making of a Conspiracy : Delusion or Not ?
According to MacDonald , most delusions begin with general , unexplained feelings of discontent that are caused by a problem with the brain .
It 's only when someone tries to search for an explanation for their feelings that a delusion forms .
" Then over time , the delusions become crystallized -- meaning they take on particular narratives , story lines and people 's motives begin to be fleshed out , " said MacDonald .
" When one thing is n't explained , it 's never abandoned .
The plot just thickens ... and you credit your persecutor with a tremendous amount of power . "
MacDonald said it can make it difficult to do talk therapy when delusional people feed their story from outside sources or find evidence with other conspiracy plots .
" You 're sitting across from your therapist and they say , ' Well why would they do all of this ? '
And you 've got the answers because you 've studied online , " he said .
Icke said that sort of danger is not his responsibility .
" You ca n't stop information because it might be misused by people , " he said .
" What people think of my information is none of my business ; it 's their business , " he added .
" I 'm not saying , ' This is how it is , you must believe it . '
I 'm saying , ' This is another way to look at the world .
What do you think ? ' "
Icke said he has run into psychiatrists analyzing why people believe his theories in television interviews .
To them , Icke says , " Check it out .
Check it out .
Then [ decide ] :
Do the facts stand up ?
Do n't go into this psychological babble after you first dismiss the information by reflex action . "
Icke believes his popularity on the Internet is a testament to the validity of his ideas , and that people feel that his predictions have come to pass .
" What you do as you continue to research and you continue to travel is you hone it down , " he said .
" I 've never come across anything that questioned the themes of what I 'm talking about .
...
With every day that passes , you just get more information . "
" If the information over a period of time does not stand up to scrutiny and fact checking , it does n't matter how far it will circulate , it 's going to be dropped , " he said .
After studying conspiracy theorists , Michael Barkun , professor of political science at Syracuse University and author of the book , " Culture of Conspiracy : Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America , " said he thought image and packaging is actually key to attracting followers .
" Even someone whose ideas are deviant can produce a Web site that looks sleek and professional , " said Barkun .
" Those who have conspiracy theories to peddle can do it very easily .
And if they 're reasonably sophisticated , [ they ] can do it in a way that gives those ideas the appearance of validity . "
Whether those who make conspiracy theories for the masses are themselves mentally ill , Barkun said it depends on the conspiracy theorist .
" I do n't think you can generalize , " he said .
" Certainly , in terms of conspiracy theorists , they 're all quite different . "
As for Icke , he has long heard people accusing him of being a mentally - disturbed conspiracy theorist .
" I went out on a limb , " he said .
" What 's happened within a period of 20 years is that the world has come to me .
...
As people have seen it coming to pass , the laughter has stopped .
" I take a different view , " he added , " and if that 's at odds with mainstream society to the point of being crazy , then I 'm fine with that . "
Using Twitter . . . ' The Smart Way '
For those of you that have somehow missed the hype , Twitter - http://twitter.com
- is the quickly growing social networking (? ) and micro-blogging (? ) service , which having been quickly adopted by key influencers in the online world , then by bloggers , content publishers , journalists and marketers , is now being jumped on by the public at large .
Twitter is now a must - have tool if you 're publishing content , undertaking online marketing , or looking to keep up with the latest trends in anything web related .
How Does Twitter Work ?
In a nutshell , Twitter allows users to post regular updates ( known as ' Tweets ' ) , which are short , text - based posts of up to 140 characters in length .
Updates are displayed on the user 's Twitter profile page , or alternatively through a desktop Twitter messaging application , such as Twhirl , Tweetdeck or Seesmic Desktop ( more on these later ) , to other users who have signed up to receive them ( ' Followers ' ) .
The aim of this article is to give you more of an idea about how to use Twitter , for valuable engagement and maxium effect , while avoiding the white noise that Twitter can also create if used incorrectly .
I call this ' Using Twitter , the Smart Way ' .
To get you up to speed , it 's worth checking out the Twitter in Plain English video below , from the folks over at Common Craft .
This will give you a general outline of how Twitter works and how it is most commonly used .
So , Why Should I Use Twitter ?
As i've mentioned , if used smartly , Twitter is a great online tool for engaging with key influencers in your niche and also with your own target audience .
It is immediate , it is fast and it is extremely effective .
Twitter is also valuable as a way of posting , sharing and recording your own ideas and links , as you have them or come across them ( the ones you think others would benefit from hearing about that is ! ) .
Think of it almost as sharing your notepad .
Other Advantages
Twitter helps you cut down on newsletter and RSS feed clutter and gets information in front of your eyes with more immediacy ( especially if using a desktop application )
Shows you as a keen follower / adopter of the latest tools and apps to your peers and general website audience
Helps you get your name known with those that matter ( to you ) and with a new , wider audience , who may not have found you through other mediums
So , how do you get started ?
Here 's the Steps I Recommend :
Step 1 - Obviously , first you need to sign up with Twitter
I suggest using your name / company / brand as your twitter account name , but that 's your call .
Next , you need to find people that are worth following , by using the Twitter search .
Click ' Follow ' , once you 're on their profile , to follow their ' Tweets ' / posts .
Here 's some suggestions ( by no means definative ) to get you off the starting blocks , that fit well with SubHub 's readership :

and SubHub :
It 's worth checking out the friends and followers of those i've listed above as well .
Read their profiles , visit their sites and add them , if you feel they 'll bring value to your Twitter experience .
Step 2 - Download a Desktop Client
TweetDeck and Seesmic Desktop
I suggest you use TweetDeck or Seesmic Desktop once you 've built up a following ( I moved across to TweetDeck when I reached 100 or so followers and have since moved again to Seesmic ) .
At a certain point users find that Twhirl becomes harder to manage , requiring a need to think about grouping people , according to what they do or their relationship to you , with replies and direct messages filed seperately .
Both TweetDeck and Seesmic provide all the functionality you need to adequately manage posts , groups of followers , replies and direct messages - however many followers you may have .
They also have the advantage of allowing you to manage multiple Twitter accounts AND your Facebook status updates .
Both apps work in a similar way , so it 's a matter of personal choice as to which you go with .
The first time you use TweetDeck or Seesmic you will be asked for your Twitter username(s ) and password .
Both apps , like Twhirl , are an Adobe Air based application , allowing them to be used on Windows and Mac's .
As well as using the likes of Twhirl , TweetDesk or Seesmic to follow and engage with others , I suggest using these apps almost like a live bookmarking and idea generation service .
Step 3 - The four key methods of Twitter communication / engagement
Ok , so you 're set and ready to go .
Before people will be prepared to follow you ( barring those that add anybody ) , you need to start ' Twittering ' , i.e. posting or reposting ' Tweets ' ( hope you 're keeping up with the terminology ! ) that others will find useful and that relate to your niche or your interests .
- For general posts , simply either log in and type your Tweet in the message box on the Twitter website , or use the message box in your desktop app ( 140 characters is the maximum length of message ) .
- To reply to someone , use the ' @ ' symbol , then their Twitter username , e.g .
@subhub Hello , I love SubHub.com !
Bear in mind that this reply can be seen publically , by your followers and the followers of who you are replying to .
- To ' Retweet ' / repost a Tweet from someone else , use ' RT ' , a space , the ' @ ' symbol , then their Twitter username , e.g .
RT @subhub Hundreds of free articles can be found at http://www.subhub.com
That 's all there is to communicating and engaging through Twitter . . .
Step 4 - Do n't forget to tell others that you have a Twitter account !
Now you 've started following people yourself and you 've begun Twittering , it 's now time to post about your Twitter accounts ' existence ( www.twitter.com/yourusername) on your website or blog , email friends / collegues / relatives that share your interests and generally get people to follow you ( remember : you do n't necessarily have to follow them back ) .
Do n't forget to link to your Twitter account on any other social sites you use , such as Facebook ( most of them have functionality to add a link to your Twitter account or even take live feeds from it ) .
Step 5 - Remember the importance of Twitter Etiquette !
A surefire way for Twitter users to unfollow you very quickly is if you spam , do n't respond to replies or direct messages , act obnoxiously or fail to bring value to their overall experience by Twittering about ' stuff ' that is of no use to them .
Think of your audience at all times .
Act as you would if you were dealing with them face to face in a business situation , or sitting down for coffee with them .
Respect is key .
Most importantly , remember that new people are viewing your Twitter profile constantly , and making a decision about whether to follow you , based on the Tweets and replies they see .
By all means
Tweet about your website , blog , service or product , but also try and add value by making this just a part of your communcation .
If you come across a website or service that could benefit others Tweet about it .
You 'll soon build up a positive reputation as someone worth following and recommending .
What you give is what you get back .
Apply that mantra and you can't go far wrong !
That 's it .
You 're set !
You now know how to use Twitter , begin following others and build up your own posse of followers .
Most importantly you now know how to use Twitter effectively to communicate and engage with others .
So . . . now for the sexy stuff !

The Internet 's been around in some form for decades .
It was n't until the mid-80s , though , that the Web as we know it started coming together -- and those precious dot - com domains started getting snatched up .
As we finish out the tech - centric year of 2008 , we thought we'd take a look back at the Internet 's oldest commercial Web sites -- the ones registered back when chatting about " the Net " was as socially acceptable as wearing Jedi garb into a crowded nightclub .
So grab your light sabers , dear friends -- we 're boarding the Millennium Falcon and heading back to a virtual galaxy far , far away .
The Internet 's First Dot-Com
Let me set the scene for you :
The year was 1985 .
MS - DOS 3.0 was the PC operating system of choice , most commonly run on the top- selling Tandy 1000 personal computer .
A newly formed company called Dell was getting ready to release its first machine , the " Turbo PC . "
The Commodore Amiga 1000 was also about to hit the market .
That same spring , the first dot - com domain was registered with the sale of symbolics.com on March 15 , 1985 .
The site belonged to a computer manufacturer known for its Open Genera Lisp and Macsyma computer algebra systems .
Symbolics declared bankruptcy in the early 90s but is still under operation with new owners .
That means symbolics.com is the Internet 's oldest still - functioning dot - com domain -- and , I must say , it still looks like it was designed in 1985 .
Other Highlights
Some of the other early dot -coms are domains we know well .
The ninth recorded registration went to hp.com on March 3 , 1986 .
IBM bought its domain a couple of weeks later .
AT&T followed in April , and Apple joined the club after another year .
Unfortunately , the Internet Archive 's Wayback Machine only goes back to the mid-90s , but even in 1997 , you can see how relatively low - tech apple.com looked compared to the snazzy standards we enjoy today .
Some other noteworthy notches on the dot - com timeline that did n't make the first 100 : Microsoft bought microsoft.com in May of 1991 ; PC World entered the online world in April ' 92 ;
Yahoo reserved its dot - com home in January of 1995 ; and Google grabbed google.com in September of 1997 .
As a heads - up , one conspicuous omission that may catch your eye : anything remotely pornographic .
( Those 2400 BPS modems did n't make for great image transmission . )
Allow me to satisfy your curiosity , though : Sex.com first surfaced in 1994 .
Porn.com came into existence about a year later .
( Click to the next page for the full list . )
They did n't have a half a second to realize what the hell hit them .
Sad that this is necessary but perhaps if they handed free videos of this around Iraq , they would think twice about doing this crap .

It 's well known that back in the 50s , the CIA engaged in some un-democratic stuff in Latin America , in order to look out for US business interests .
You know , coups .
The coup in Guatemala , overthrowing Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán , benefitted United Fruit Co. , for example
Slate reports on an interesting paper from the field of forensic economics suggesting insiders familiar with the coup during the planning stages were able to profit in the stock market from their knowledge .
Basically , by looking at the timeline of planning meetings , and associate that with stock price movements , they demonstrated that insiders must have been trading .
If you think about it , it 's not really surprising that this trading would happen , but the fact that they can deduce this is pretty cool .
Now what would be really interesting ?
If you could reverse - engineer foreign policy plans by looking at unexplained stock movements -- like if you could anticipate a coup in , say , Venezuela by looking at movements in the price of oil stocks .
It 's unlikely , but perhaps it 's not that ridiculous .
Remember when the Federal Government toyed with setting up a prediction market to help anticipate terrorism ?
The plan was roundly slammed ( duh ) , but it was based on the notion that people with knowledge of terror attacks would n't be able to resist trading on their knowledge .
Google Zeitgeist monitors what people are searching for
What do Sarah Palin , Facebook and Euro 2008 have in common ?
They are all on the list of the top 10 fastest - rising queries on Google during 2008 .
The search engine has published its year - end Zeitgeist , the tool which reveals what internet users are searching for .
The most searched term for Google users in the UK was Facebook while the BBC came second and its iPlayer service was the fastest rising query .
The list also reveals what global preoccupations are and this year the US election candidates and the Beijing Olympics figure high .
The things people around the globe have in common are a strong interest in socialising and politics , according to Marissa Mayer , vice - president of search at Google .
" Social networks comprised four out of the top 10 global fastest - rising queries while the US election held everyone 's interest around the globe , " she wrote on Google 's official blog .

Gordon Brown will be pleased to hear that he beat David Cameron into second place on the list of most popular politicians among UK searchers .
Barack Obama made it into third place with rival John McCain coming in seventh .
Foodies were interested in recipes for cupcakes , meatballs , lemon posset and pork belly , while the hottest tickets in the UK went to Oasis and Leonard Cohen ( first and second respectively ) .

While news and weather tend to be the most searched for terms globally there are still plenty of country - specific quirks , according to Ms Mayer .
" Russians elected Dmitri Medvedev as their president but a couple of popular music acts got more attention from Google searchers , " she wrote .
In Poland the fifth fastest - rising term was Jozin z Bazin , the title of a 1978 Czech song which has been popular on YouTube .
How He Should Have Handled
It : Thereâs nothing wrong with a gun-toting , gas mask - wearing , barbed wire tattoo - sporting Puerto Rican gangsta rapper endorsing you .
In fact , itâs kind of cool , as long as you never mention it , act like you donât know about it , and avoid eye contact with him whenever youâre in the same room .
Because otherwise , you might as well just put on a day - glo hat , flava flav clock and old person sunglasses , because youâ re already way past trying too hard and into the realm of dignity pulling your pants down and running away giggling .
Youâre going to need a political heavy - hitter to recover from that kind of ego - bruise , and luckily , I know just where to find one â¦ or two .

The Endorsement :
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The Strings :
It kind of goes without saying that a McCain campaign can count on a Bush endorsement .
And really , itâs good for all of us ; if his own party abandoned him , he might just go into a â Nam flashback and rip the throats out of everyone at the nearest caucus .
And if thereâs anything we must protect , itâs our caucuses .
Cauci ?
Cockeye ?
Whatever .
On the surface , the endorsement of the man who has the job youâre interviewing for isnât really a bad deal .
I had a friend who ran the drive thru at a Taco Bell , and when he quit to become a script reader , I snapped that shit up like a Cruchwrap Supreme .
And whatâs the presidency if not a glorified drive thru window ?
You take the orders of America , misinterpret them due to a broken and convoluted communications system , then give them what you thought they wanted and charge them for it anyway .
The point being , if the biggest celeb in the worldâ the President of the gosh - darned United Statesâ and his Dad ( who was also the President ) both want to come out and say you could do their job , thatâs just Fire Sauce .
Unless that Fire Sauce has a 19 percent approval rating .
Despite their differences , a fairly solid campaign strategy from both sides lately has been to point out repeatedly and emphatically â Guys , I am NOT like George Bush .
Seriously , I barely even know the guy .
We like , shook hands , ONCE , and we didnât even make eye contact.â 
While Obama can point to his donkey pin , voting record , and blackness to distance himself from the presidential pariah , all McCainâs really got is the word âmaverick.â 
Which is not to imply that his camp isnât utilizing the word â maverickâ to the absolute fullest extent grammatically possible .
And if you think Iâm being biased , may I point out that during his endorsement speech , President Bush actually offered to oppose McCain if that would be more helpful .
Bitter passive - aggression , or surprising insight ?
If McCainâs going to pull this one out , itâs time to play some âditch the turd.â 
Just do n't say
Sarah Chayes went to Afghanistan to report for National Public Radio just a few weeks after 9/11 , then stayed to become one of the few Westerners running a business there .
In a recent op - ed for the Washington Post she wrote that the big problem in Afghanistan is n't the resurgence of the Taliban .
That 's just a symptom of an epidemic of government corruption and the consequent failure of the rule of law , a gap which the Taliban are doing a better job of filling than either Karzai 's government or US - led military forces .
In an interview with Bill Moyers on Friday , she expanded on her article .
SARAH CHAYES : Our democracy is famous for one thing in particular , checks and balances .
That was the genius of the American system .
BILL MOYERS : Rule of law .
SARAH CHAYES : Rule of law but also recourse .
If one branch of government is abusing you , you 've got other branches of government that you can turn to .
BILL MOYERS : And Afghanistan ?
SARAH CHAYES : Doesn't .
So what we 've really done is set up a kind of monopoly on the exercise of power .
I mean , it 's the opposite of what everything that we consider to be democracy , we 've allowed an abusive concentration of power in the hands of , in particular , the executives , be it , in particular , on a local level like the provincial governors and their acolytes .
Because we 've convinced ourselves and often we have to - by " we " I mean us and our NATO allies - convince our own public opinion that this is a democratically elected representative government of Afghanistan in order to justify the sacrifices in money and troops and things like that .
But the Afghans see it differently .
The Afghans say you brought these people in here .
We repudiated - ...
SARAH CHAYES : The ordinary population .
The people I work with are villagers .
They 're semi-literate , illiterate , these are really ordinary men and women .
And they all are telling me , " You brought these people back into Afghanistan .
We had repudiated them in the early 1990s .
We knew what these people are .
They 're " - BILL MOYERS : Warlords , right ?
SARAH CHAYES : Yes .
Yes .
BILL MOYERS : The criminal class .
SARAH CHAYES : Exactly .
So you brought them in and now you 're backing them up .
And you are making it impossible for us to make our voices heard and to have any leverage on the behavior of these people .
The Obama administration has said that it will dramatically increase the US military presence in Afghanistan , and Admiral Mike Mullen told reporters in Kabul on Saturday that there will be up to 30,000 more US troops in the country by midsummer .
Which will go some way to treating the symptom - that resurgent Taliban presence - but wo n't get at the underlying causes at all .
Instead , those troops will help prop up the criminals and warlords currently in charge of the official Afghan government ( even President Karzai 's brother is widely accused of being heavily involved in the opium trade but protected by the government ) while continuing to alienate the common Afghan people through indiscriminate attacks on civilians .
In turn , the Taliban 's hand will continue to strengthen as people turn to what is actually the lesser of two evils - and the whole cycle renews itself indefinitely .
Thanks as ever , to Heather for the vid clips .
Napolitano appointment to impact Real ID ?
Arizona is one of roughly a dozen states that have passed legislation saying they would not comply with Real ID .
With the nomination of Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano to become secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security it raises questions of whether or not it will effect what states have to do with their driver licenses .
In June Napolitano called Real ID an unfunded mandate .
She cited a White House estimate that Real ID would cost at least $ 4 billion to implement .
But at that point the federal government has only appropriated $ 90 million to help Arizona and other states comply with the measure .
And while Arizona was against Real ID , it was one of the states scheduled to start issuing enhanced driver licenses .
Washington and New York are issuing EDLs to expedite land border crossings and as part of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative .
The IDs have an embedded radio frequency identification tag that can be read from 15 to 20 feet away .
The tags transmit an identification number that corresponds to the cardholder ’s personal information that is stored in a secure database .

While the decline in the value of sterling is posing problems for UK tourists bound for Europe , it is providing an unexpected boon for Northern Ireland 's retailers .
As the pound keeps falling , the traffic - jams keep growing with euro - shoppers coming to Northern Ireland for a Christmas bargain .
With some shops offering a straight ' euro - for - pound ' exchange rate , the queues are getting longer and longer .
So much so that some local people in border towns like Newry and Enniskillen are annoyed at having to fight their way through the " euro tourists " to get to their nearest shops .
Cross - border shopping trips in Ireland are as old as the border itself but what 's happening at the moment is unprecedented .
The scale of the influx is staggering .
Take the Asda store in Enniskillen , Co Fermanagh : 60 % of its customers this month have come from the Irish Republic
It is the 6th busiest store in the global Wal - Mart chain Along the border in Strabane , sales were up 54 % last week at the local Asda , compared with the same week last year .
Not bad for a store in a town which used to be one of the UK 's economic blackspots .
We 're hearing lots of stories about people coming up with trailers , filling them full of alcohol ... then scampering across the border again
Martin McBrearty
Supervalu manager , Strabane Strabane ASDA manager , Eugene Teague , says : " It 's down to the exchange rate and the southern customer just getting in their car and being prepared to drive that bit further . "
Last year , a Euro was worth around 70 p , now it has soared above 90 p .
Most of the cross - border shoppers are making a 30 - minute drive from neighbouring towns but there is evidence of some shoppers being prepared to come from more than an hour away , if not further .
They reckon they can save at least 30 % on their weekly grocery shop .
At the Supervalu store in Strabane , manager Martin McBrearty not only allows customers to pay in euros but gives them their change in the same currency .
So what are the southern shoppers coming north to buy ?
" The big one this year is the alcohol , " says Mr McBrearty .
" We 're hearing lots of stories about people coming up with trailers , and filling them full of alcohol from the local stores and then scampering across the border again . "
The Dublin government is watching the exodus with increasing concern .
Patriotic shopping Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan recently rebuked the cross - border bargain - hunters .
He said : " When you shop in Northern Ireland , you 're paying Her Majesty 's taxes , you 're not paying taxes to the state that you live in . "
It was a blunt appeal for patriotic shopping .
However , the large numbers of cars from the Republic parked at northern shopping centres last weekend suggested Irish people are currently more concerned with personal economics than national politics .
One southern shopper in Strabane said : " I would shop in the South if they would bring down their prices and match the prices in the North .
Sterling 's decline appears to have fuelled a rise in alcohol sales " If they were any way patriotic , they would bring down the prices and not be so greedy .
In the South they raised VAT , here they cut it . "
The VAT rate in the UK is down to 15 % , while it recently went up in the Irish Republic to 21.5 % .
It is making life difficult for southern retailers .
Paul Bradley , who runs a Eurospar in Buncrana , Co Donegal , has already had to reduce his workforce .
He said : " There are job losses in this area and there 's probably going to be more if this exchange rate continues as it is .
It just continues to drop day after day .
" I 've been in the retail trade for about 30 years and this is the toughest patch I 've ever gone through .
I 'm normally a good sleeper but I 'm sleeping less at night now . "
The so - called Celtic Tiger economy in the Republic has limped into recession .
The procession of shoppers across the border is making things worse .
There is little sign of any sympathy from their northern neighbours .
The South 's difficulty is seen as the North 's opportunity to cash in .
It 's not politics .
It 's simply business .

One prediction about the recession is for sure .
It will end .
Every recession in the past century ( roughly 20 of them in all ) did exactly that .
It ended .
It ended when demand stopped falling and began rising .
Those of us with old economics degrees lurking in the mental attic recall that credit bubbles turn into recessions when they lead to a collapse in demand .
People stop buying goods and services .
Businesses lose profits , lay off staff and are refused bank credit .
Unemployment rises , and the vicious circle proceeds .
That is what is happening now .
There is an obvious plan to counter it .
It was put forward by John Maynard Keynes ostensibly to make a point - shower people with money or pay them for doing nothing - and has ever since been treated by policymakers as unsophisticated and rather silly .
Proper macroeconomists do not dabble in such simplicities .
The plan is excellent .
If recessions are caused by collapsing demand , increase demand .
Do not wait on tax cuts or lower interest rates .
They all take time .
Do not plead with people to spend , as the Japanese did while suppressing interest rates to zero , or as Iceland is doing with its patriotic slogan : " Spend for your country . "
Get people to spend by giving them money , and just stop them saving it .
Give them non-cashable vouchers for domestic goods and services that expire in three months .
Drive them to the high streets , supermarkets , restaurants , entertainments , garages , anything that is not saving and has an employment multiplier effect .
Only firms should be able to bank the vouchers .
Demand must feed straight into business revenue , because revenue is collateral for credit .
Without revenue , boosting credit is pointless .
There is no shortage of the requisite money in the Treasury .
We know because anyone can get it if a banker .
The government is obsessed with bankers .
The whole thrust of policy is aimed at trying to get banks to offer credit .
But this was last August 's problem , and it conspicuously failed to stem recession .
Credit is still the obsession of public policy .
The government is underpinning bank deposits and shares to the tune of a staggering £ 500bn in guarantees and £ 50bn in real money .
The giveaway to banks must have reached its limit .
Cuts to bank rate have little effect on the real economy .
The government has nationalised bankers , lunched them , told them how much to pay themselves .
Now it has started bullying them , hectoring them and telling the public how awful they are .
Christmas pantomimes are casting bankers as villains .
Card games depict them as knaves .
Mothers tell children that " a banker " will come to eat them up if they fail to finish their sprouts .
Some £ 1,000 for every man , woman and child in the land has gone into saving banks , the most extravagant policy of all time .
Yet all this is aimed at forcing banks to do precisely what caused the credit collapse in the first place .
It is aimed at making them lend to people and businesses which , with each passing week , are ever less able to pay them back .
As the Guardian 's economics editor wrote despairingly on Monday , " nothing seems to be working " .
Having failed to halt the run on credit in September , the authorities are now trying to halt it when the disease has gone elsewhere , into the cash economy .
Two points off the bank rate or an inter - bank guarantee are no good to a sacked shop worker .
Give that £ 50bn , or even half of it , to every person in the land , and it does not matter what people do with the vouchers , provided they generate economic activity .
They may be traded at a discount , but that does not matter since they can only be banked by firms by the end of the period .
Vouchers are better than hurling money at banks .
The subsidies donated to stave off recession so far appear to have gone on restoring bank balance sheets , rewarding staff and lending overseas .
Money being poured into projects such as Crossrail and the Olympics is going on fees to the rich , which also tend to be saved rather than spent .
America is no wiser , in bailing out its least efficient car firms .
It would make more sense to give people vouchers to buy cars of their choice , rather than have government choose which they may buy instead .
Just giving people money clearly sticks in the gullet of those who run the economy .
The whole point in collecting taxes is to control their disbursement .
The idea of Gordon Brown going into the street and giving the public their own cash seems undignified and somehow wrong .
Yet Brown , Darling , Cameron and the rest seem comfortable giving vast sums to bankers - with no condition that the money be channelled into spending .
The banks say thank you but understandably decline to lend to borrowers who are going bankrupt because the government ( and Bank of England ) has been careless of recession .
The reason for this indulgence of banks is that bankers are " the authorities " .
They are like chateau generals in the first world war .
They talk the same talk as politicians .
They head grand institutions that can supposedly handle billions of pounds .
They " launder the giveaway " and make it seem respectable .
Also ministers can blame them if , as has happened , nothing seems to work .
Such counter - recession policy , like last summer 's credit policy , is always too little , too late .
America earlier this year introduced a mild version of my plan , a $ 300 tax rebate .
While the intention was sound , it suffered from being a rebate , not a restricted cash handout .
The money could vanish into savings .
It was too small and did not work .
A closer parallel is the gift voucher proposed by German Social Democrats .
This is a €500 uncashable voucher with a two - month expiry , for every German over 18 .
Objections have been intriguing : " people might buy imports " ; it " would not solve long - term problems " ; it " might recall wartime rationing " .
In other words , none was substantive .
The authorities are too hidebound to tolerate eccentricity or simplicity .
Giving people money ( or borrowing to give it ) suggests a loss of competence and control .
It is crude and unsophisticated , without the jargoned nuances that have given macro-economic policy its specious intellectual beauty .
Even the Tories , who should welcome the vouchers as an in - the - hand tax rebate , cannot stomach the idea .
The whole lot will go nobly into recession arm - in - arm with their friendly banks , rather than trust people to spend their own money rescuing the economy .

All true .
One is reminded of the pragmatists ’ disdain for long - playing records when compact disks arrived .
Then D.J. ’s and audiophiles revived LPs , in part precisely for the virtues of its inconvenience .
Image FOR ARTS SAKE Andy Warhol used a Polaroid to capture the glamour of the 1970s .
Credit ...
Ron Galella
That is to say , LPs , like Polaroids , entailed certain obligating rituals .
Igor Stravinsky near the end of his life spent evenings confined to a chair .
He listened often to Beethoven .
His assistant , Robert Craft , would cue the records up , then , when one side was finished , rise from his seat , carefully flip the vinyl disk over , place the needle at the beginning , and rejoin the composer , a simple act of devotion required by the limits of LP technology , endlessly repeated until it became a routine binding Stravinsky and Craft like father and son .
I can still picture my own father with his Polaroid camera .
“ Cheese , ” he would actually say , and the machine would whir before expelling a print with the negative still attached , requiring the shutterbug to wait a prescribed time before peeling it off .
My father would check his watch , shaking the covered snapshot as if the photograph were a thermometer .
Then at the right moment , with a surgeon ’s delicate hands , he would separate the negative in a single motion and reveal  well , who knew what .
Because that was part of the beauty of the Polaroid .
Mystery clung to each impending image as it took shape , the camera conjuring up pictures of what was right before one ’s eyes , right before one ’s eyes .
The miracle of photography , which Polaroids instantly exposed , never lost its primitive magic .
And what resulted , as so many sentimentalists today lament , was a memory coming into focus on a small rectangle of film .
Or maybe not .
Digital technology now excuses our mistakes all too easily  the blurry shot of Aunt Ruth fumbling with a 3 - wood at the driving range ; or the one of Cousin Jeff on graduation day where a flying Frisbee blocked the view of his face ; or of Seth in his plaid jacket heading to his first social , the image blanched by the headlight of Burt ’s car coming up the driveway ; or the pictures of you beside the Christmas tree where your hair is a mess .

A brief conversation I had earlier this week with a car dealership executive while standing in a post office line demonstrated simply both why the bank deregulation and consolidation process of the past two decades has been a screw job for ordinary people , and why the Washington bailout has been both a taxpayer rip - off and a failure ( if it was even intended to work ! ) .
I was chatting with the guy standing behind me who works at one of the 14 dealerships in a Philadelphia - area regional family - owned chain of GM dealerships called Bergey ’s .
Noting that a number of big dealers like Knopf ( a Chrysler Dealer ) and McGarrity ’s ( Ford ) had been closing , I asked this Bergey ’s manager if the problem was that the banks had frozen lending , making it hard for people to buy new cars .
He laughed .
“ There ’s no problem getting car loans from the small community banks around our dealerships , ” he said .
“ They ’ve got plenty of money to lend , and they ’re happy to lend it to car buyers .
The problem is that people are too worried about the economy and about their jobs to go out and buy a new car . ”
And that ’s it in a nutshell .
The so - called “ credit freeze ” is a problem afflicting the giant national and global banks , like Citibank and B of A , which went on a tear with all of those derivative investments and loans , like CDOs and subprime mortgages , and which have been pushing credit on consumers with usurious rates that could only lead to default eventually .
Most smaller community banks , many of them family owned or privately held , credit unions , and S&Ls ( which were suitably chastened by their own disastrous scandals of two decades ago ) , have been lending responsibly and are fully solvent and happy to extend credit to people who are credit - worthy .
The big banks may be technically insolvent , and in desperate need of federal bailouts lest they go under and leave their investors holding the empty bag , but the small banks that serve most of the nation ’s ordinary folks have a different problem .
They themselves are n’t insolvent , but their clients are — or at least they are worried that they might become that way .
That ’s why they are n’t buying houses and seeking mortgages , and it ’s why they are n’t buying cars .
What ’s needed , clearly , is not money for the big commercial banks that got greedy and ran into a ditch .
It ’s support for the American people , so that they do n’t have to hunker down into a crouch and not continue to participate in the economy .
When you see foreclosed signs going up along your own street , it makes you start worrying about making your own mortgage payments .
When one in eight people are losing their jobs , just about everyone with a job starts to have friends and relatives who are out of work , and that paycheck starts to seem pretty precarious .
The hundreds of billions of dollars paid to and invested in big commercial banks that do n’t do much for the little guy anyway is doing nothing at all to ease that pain and anxiety among the grassroots .
Instead , it ’s just being pocketed by bank managers and rich investors , to be put to a “ higher ” use somewhere else than on a depressed “ Main Street . ”
( Note that the government has put no strings on the money , much of which is being used to buy other banks , or even to lend overseas . )
That ’s why all those car dealerships are folding .
This brings me to that feeding frenzy of bank deregulation I mentioned earlier .
The whole idea of allowing the creation of national banks like Citibank and Bank of America and Wells Fargo , and of going one step further and allowing banks to merge with brokerages and insurance companies , which began in earnest during the Clinton administration and went ballistic in the Bush administration , was deceptively marketed to the public as being “ good for the consumer . ”
The come - on was that by allowing state and regional banks to merge into national institutions , and by allowing them to add investment banking and insurance operations , consumers would get more services from their bank and have the supposed " advantage " of “ one - stop shopping ” at their bank .
Anyone who watched it happen , however , saw how bogus that claim was .
I lived in New York City as it was going on , and as banks like Citibank bought up their competitors , fees began to appear for services that had no fees before , like checking and even passbook savings , savings accounts began to require minimum deposits , CD interest rates fell as penalties proliferated , and small loans became harder to get .
Some banks actually began to state , at least to analysts and to reporters in the financial press , that they were no longer interested in serving “ small ” clients , and were instituting measures designed to discourage them or drive existing small clients away .
Soon , it was impossible in many neighborhoods of New York to find a bank to serve ordinary people .
As a matter of fact , these big banks do n’t even help when it comes to “ big bank ” - type stuff .
Consider international finance activities like foreign currency exchange .
When my wife , a harpsichordist , came home last week from a month - long tour of performances in China , Taiwan , Hong Kong and Macau , she had with her $ 1000 worth of Taiwanese currency — the fee for a gig that she had not had time to change into US currency while in Taiwan or Hong Kong , where such transactions are commonplace and inexpensive .
Back in Philadelphia , we called around to the big commercial banks — all global institutions — to see if they could change the money .
They could , but at absurd cost .
Take Citibank .
That institution said it would only change up to $ 700 worth of bills unless my wife had an account with them , and in any event , it was offering a rate of 39.5 Taiwanese dollars to one US dollar — way worse than the posted rate that day of 33.5 / 1 .
In other words , they were willing to change up to $ 700 worth of currency , but at a cost of 18 % , plus a $ 10 fee !
That means they ’re making 35 % on a two - way conversion of currency !
Thanks a lot !
The other banks were no better .
Want another example .
Bank of America was a big recipient of taxpayer funded bailout money from the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank .
But it has refused to lend money to Republic Windows & Doors Co. , a factory in Chicago , that has been forced to close and lay off its 300 workers with only three days ' notice , foregoing the legally required 60 - days ' pay and earned vacation pay .
This is a story that will be repeated more and more .
At Republic , the workers , members of the United of Electrical Workers union , are fighting back with a sit - down strike demanding their money .

1. Zoltar Speaks , the Fortune - Telling Machine from Big
- It 's not as cool as the one in the movie — this one does n't have that ramp to get the coin into Zoltar 's mouth .
But it would definitely be a conversation piece .
I mean , if nothing else , you could gripe about spending $ 9,000 on a silly machine that 's over six feet tall , just because it reminds you of a twenty - year - old movie .
__2. LEGO Death Star __-
This is the ultimate in LEGO Star Wars
kits : 3803 pieces , scenes from both Death Stars , lots of minifigs , and a $ 400 pricetag .
It would be a heck of an impressive thing to have in your house , but as for me , if I were to spend the time and energy assembling 3803 LEGO pieces , the idea of playing with the end product afterwards would n't appeal much — what if it fell apart ?!

3. Hand -Crafted Remote - Controlled Hydroplane __-
This is a ridiculously - detailed model of a real 1953 Ferrari Arno hydroplane boat .
According to the web page , it takes 200 hours to make each one , which makes you wonder why they did n't just make it full size .
Seriously , though , how much money do you have to have to be comfortable dropping two grand on an RC boat and then actually put it in the water and risk breaking it ?
__4 . Life - Size Replica of Yoda __-
Fortunately , the " real " Yoda is pretty short , so even a life - size replica is only just over two feet tall .
Still , I can't imagine spending $ 700 to have Yoda in your house all the time , even if he does look ready to kick some Sith ass .

____5 . Giant Balrog Head __-
Apparently Balrogs have uvulas — who knew ?
Now , for a mere $ 1,820 , you can have a four - foot wide Balrog head on your wall , with its mouth wide open as though about to swallow your children and housepets .
Rich Lord of the Rings fans who want to inspire nightmares in their families and guests , this is the item for you !
6 . The Tesla Roadster
- It 's an all - electric car that 's gorgeous and can ( so they say ) go from 0 to 60 in under four seconds .
But it 's $ 109,000 , yet gets barely enough mileage on a charge to go from Washington , D.C. to New York
City .
And then it takes thirty hours to recharge from a standard US
110 v wall outlet , or eight from a 220v appliance outlet .
Someone 's going to have to explain to me how this car is really better for the environment than a regular sports car .
__7 . Halo 3 Master Chief Costume __-
Yes , this is a truly awesome costume .
For nine hundred bucks , it ought to be pretty awesome .
One must wonder , though , since it comes in one
" standard " size , if it would fit many hard - core gamers ' bodies .
__8 . Jayne 's Shirt from Serenity __-
This one 's not a replica :
It 's a shirt actually worn by Adam Baldwin as Jayne in the movie .
At $ 999 , it 's probably one of the top five
T - shirts in the world .
And just think , it might have Jayne 's actual sweat stains still on it ... which could be a plus or a minus , depending on your point of view .

9. A Piece of the First Death Star __-
You think the LEGO Death Star was cool ?
This is a section of the actual filming model of the Death Star 's surface from the original Star Wars movie 's final battle scene .
Yeah , it 's three grand , but it 's literally a piece of movie history !
Who cares if you can't pay the rent / mortgage , right ?
10 .
Name a species of tiny insects after someone - I really thought this was a joke when I first heard about it , but no , it 's serious .
There are currently four species of midge available to be named , and it would be kind of a cute gag gift for someone — if the cheapest one were n't $ 500 !
Husbands :
Just imagine the look on your wife 's face as she opens the envelope containing the certificate , expecting a day at the spa perhaps , and finds that you 've named a small , irritating insect after her .
Frightening , is n't it ?

The battle that has raged over creationism and evolution in the United States is likely to spread to the Islamic world , a scholar of science and religion argues in a new essay .
But author Salman Hameed writes that the opening of a new front in the battle gives scientists an opportunity to reframe the debate .
Better education , the spread of Internet access and news about U.S. controversies over evolution are provoking some Muslims worldwide to start to ask whether Islam is compatible with evolutionary theory , Hameed said .
" Now is the time that these ideas are going to be solidified .
We can shape it .
There are positive ways to shape these ideas in which we can avert a mass rejection of evolution , " Hameed said [ LiveScience ] .
The most fundamentalist form of creationism in the United States is based on a literal reading of the Bible , which implies that the earth and all its creatures were created by God in their present form over the course of six days ; creationists say this narrative is in direct conflict with the idea that organisms slowly evolved over billions of years .
However , Hameed notes that the Koran may be more compatible with evolutionary theory .
One of the big evolution problems from the US creationist perspective is the age of the Earth .
Logically speaking , if you believe in a 6000 or 10,000 year - old Earth , then you have to reject evolution .
In the Muslim countries , young Earth creationism is nonexistent .
The Koran is very vague about creation stories , specifically regarding the creation of the universe .
If you accept an old Earth , then it makes it relatively easier to accept evolution [ New Scientist ] .
In his essay in Science [ subscription required ] , Hameed explains that evolution is taught in high schools in many Muslim countries .
Still , today , only 25 percent of adults in Turkey agree that human beings developed from earlier species of animals , whereas 40 percent of people in the United States agree with this scientific fact , Hameed writes .
And Turkey is one of the most secular and educated of Muslim countries [ LiveScience ] .
He worries that evolution is becoming increasingly linked with atheism in the Islamic world , and it also sometimes viewed as a symbol of Western ideas and imperialism .
Hameed says these association may cause many people to reject evolution out of hand .
No discussion of creationism in the Islamic world would be complete without a mention of Adnan Oktar , the wealthy Turkish autodidact who self - publishes glossy books that he claims disprove evolution , and has sent them , unsolicited , to thousands of academics and media outlets in Europe and the United States .
Oktar has also feuded with Richard Dawkins , the British proponent of evolution and atheism : Oktar
successfully brought a case against Mr Dawkins to a Turkish court , claiming that his website contained blasphemous and defamatory content .
Internet users in Turkey can no longer access the site [ The Scotsman ] .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A lack of appropriate and necessary banking regulation by governments around the globe led to the current economic crisis , according to a report by a body of leading economists and experts released Monday .
" There is great unanimity in the feeling that regulation and supervision need to be revised , " said former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , chairman of the board of trustees for the Group of Thirty ( G30 ) , at a press conference .
" The current situation is an apt illustration of the need for reform . "
Volcker presided over the Fed from 1979 to 1987 , a period of extreme financial unrest .
Volcker is known for raising interest rates to historic highs under the Carter and Reagan administrations in order to combat out - of - control inflation .
The report analyzed financial regulatory structures of 17 governments , including the United States , in an attempt to stabilize markets in the future - and the regulatory system in particular .
" The financial system has raised considerable question about its stability in the future , " Volcker added .
" It is evident that a number of countries need to revise and reform financial regulatory structures . "
Old models do n't work in new era
G30 found that most governments use one of four approaches to supervision of the financial sector , and all of them need to be revised .
The body found some governments determine regulation based on a firm 's legal status and others based on the business type .
Some countries have one integrated regulator , and others have separate safety and conduct regulators .
" None of these structures by itself has proven to be optimal ... and no one model has appeared unambiguously superior . " said Roger Ferguson , vice chairman of G30 , former Fed vice chairman and current chief executive of financial services provider TIAA - CREF .
The body said none of these systems work efficiently enough to properly regulate the financial industry , because they are antiquated and do not reflect new business realities .
Even the United States , which uses a combination of some of these oversight structures , recognized its own regulatory weakness when the Treasury proposed a new supervision model in March .
Even broken models that can function under " normal " conditions can be exposed as weak during more troubling times such as the current global financial crisis .
" We have seen how regulatory approaches and methodologies that may have worked well under benign financial conditions can break down during a major market disruption , " Volcker said .
" The financial turmoil that has unfolded over the last year has tested the ability of regulatory authorities to respond effectively to financial crises . "
Global economic solutions
Though G30 did not offer any specific recommendations , the group did offer a few broad ideas about how to reform oversight .
They included modernization of regulation to accommodate financial evolution and global integration , promoting an efficient deposit insurance system , flexibility and more effective communication .
" A deposit insurance scheme is a critical element to financial confidence , " said Ferguson .
" Reforms must also value the necessity of communication and coordination . "
The group emphasized the need for global coordination on financial oversight reforms , because today 's markets are more integrated than ever before .
" No doubt we are undergoing a fundamental change in the global financial system , " said Jacob Frenkel , G30 chairman .
" The problem is that things are highly contagious . "
Frenkel noted as an example of the " contagions , " the quick and widespread effects that the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis had on the global financial markets .
The report mostly consisted of analysis , but the group promised a subsequent report that tackles more specific and in - depth proposals for reforms of regulation .
" This is just a first step , " said Volcker .
" We will want to say something about the substance of reform in the next few months . "
Sex offenders have rights too .
Do n’t they ?
At least one Missouri City woman who was convicted of a sex crime is out to prove just that in court after being fired from her job at Wal - Mart .
Rebecca Vlasek , 37 , claims that Wal - Mart fired her and more than 800 registered sex offenders , in line with the company ’s policy , but unfairly held onto at least 25 sex offenders .
On top of that , Vlasek claims in Houston federal court that she believes all the offenders that Wal - Mart retained are men , and therefore the company additionally discriminated against her as a woman .
“ I ’m betting a dollar to a doughnut that all 25 of those guys are white males wearing shirt and ties in their offices at pretty high levels , ” Vlasek ’s attorney , Michael Barnes , tells Hair Balls .
He says he does not have the proof yet , but will hopefully once he gets into the discovery phase of the case .
This is the second go - around for Vlasek in court over her firing .
She filed a similar lawsuit in federal court in early January , but her claims , including wrongful termination , were dismissed , according to court records , based on the fact that her contract with Wal - Mart was “ at - will , ” meaning she could be fired for more or less any reason .
This latest lawsuit however , is based on claims of unfair treatment and gender discrimination arising from the revelation , Barnes says , that the company kept 25 sex offenders on the payroll .
“ The neat thing that happened in the case , ” Barnes says , “ was that after spending a day driving up to Bentonville and a sleepless night at a motel in Rogers , Arkansas , I got up the next morning and went and deposed a person , essentially the personnel director , who just out of the blue that morning told me , ‘ Oh , yeah , by the way , we kept 25 of the registered sex offenders out of the 800 we ’ve investigated . ’
Well , my eyes perked up .
I just could n’t believe it .
I said , ‘ Okay , that ’s interesting , ’ and went on .
It did n’t help us in that case , but we were able to re-file and that ’s what we did . ”
Vlasek claims it us unfair to fire some , but not all , of the sex offenders .
“ So my question is like the old Jewish thing , ” says Barnes , “ ’ Why is this night different from all other nights ? ’ ”
Vlasek , a former high - school teacher in Brenham , pleaded guilty in 1999 to felony sexual assault of a minor , according to court records .
Media reported that the charge stemmed from a relationship with a 14 - year - old female student .

George W. Bush did n't see all the intelligence .
He only saw or read what Cheney 's handlers passed on to him ( and insisted that he read ) .
If you like , you can interpret that Bush is disappointed in the intelligence he saw himself , knowing from after - the - fact reporting that he did n't see all of it until after the war was going poorly .
That could be a sign of regret for choosing to follow the Cheney / Rove advice .
I get the sense that Bush is just shell - shocked at what an abject failure he has been .
But there is no way anybody in his position could ever come out and say , " Gee , the last 8 years have been a waste of my and everyone else 's time , and now I can see that I 've dug this nation the deepest hole any single man has ever dug . "
As everyone knows , Bush is a simpleton who was elected at a time of unmitigated prosperity where just enough people thought that electing a simpleton to be their leader was OK .
He is not the evil here , he is just the stooge , and he seems to be acknowledging that with his statements .
I do n't recall a president giving such a dour self - assessment of his own performance Since Johnson decided against another term .
Of course , although Johnson accelerated another idiotic war , there was no economic meltdown he had to atone for .
Johnson could see his failure after four years .
Bush could n't see it until it culminated in unmitigated paralysis after nearly 8 years of idiocy , with even his own party - faithful holding their noses in his presence .
I do n't think this is the best example of msm complicity .
Bush 's regret comes through loud and clear .
And he is right in that it was the complicity of Dems and Reps in congress , and most of all the " liberal " Blair and various Middle Eastern interests that allowed his handlers to continue on the war path without much resistance .
Remember when only one US representative voted against the war bill in 2002 ?
Barbara Lee ?
The label " Mainstream Media " is disingenuous .
Although it is " mainstream " in that most people get their info through their stream , everyone knows the content is driven by a combination of corporate goals and ad revenue .
Ad revenue is generated by giving the viewers what they want .
Why give it such a legitimate label ?
" CAM " for " Corporate Ad- driven Media " would be more appropriate if you need an acronym .
MSM has become a throw - away term used by parties of all political persuasion .
Look at how Sarah Palin was able to use it to defend her poor performance .
The term has come to imply conspiracy theorism and ought to fall into disuse .
You 'll see Fox change their tune as soon as their ad - revenue tumbles , and not until then .
That will coincide with Roger Ailes losing his job .
Raise your glass to all those internet bloggers that do n't have any ad revenue to support their blogging .

What a good point : main stream media was complicit in the lie(s ) , so will keep covering it up .
When I was very young , I did n't like newspapers , saying " I 'll wait until the history is sorted out " .... but , being much much older , I know that a ) much history is written using the same bad articles as " source material " and b) there was no internet then , but there is now , and lots of independent media ( altho way back , I did read " IFStone 's Weekly " .

This all reminds of the quote : " It 's very hard to get someone to understand something when their salary depends on them not understanding it . "
Swap out the word understand for report and it works just as well .
Why have none of the corporate media reported or commented on the Pentagon propaganda program with military analysts on their own networks ( still ) ?
Why after six years at war have most Americans never seen any real footage of what is happening ?
Have you ever seen any reporting on mountaintop removal mining ?
News programming is controlled by corporations that have a vested interest in NOT reporting actual news .

The mainstream media make money for their corporate owners by packaging the news in a way that is most likely to increase the number of readers / viewers .
What they do has nothing to do with fairness , truth , journalistic integrity or standards .
What it does have to do with is competing in a popularity contest called the Nielsen Ratings .
Even those shows that we tend to be happy with such as MSNBC's Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow shows are only aired because the corporate heads at GE / NBC noticed a shift in political attitudes in the revered 25 - 54 age group that they could cash in on .
At least FoxNews ' biased , sensationalistic , ill written and frequently , woefully wrong reporting is true to it 's unstated but obvious goal of being the right wing 's go to spot for propaganda .
Unfortunately , as surly as Pepe ' Le Peu retains a noxious ambiance , the " L " label has stuck to the mainstream media in the eyes of the general public .
At least , thanks to GWB 's henchmen stinkin ' up the political landscape , the " L " label no longer has the negative aura that it did just a few years back .

I think it 's more nefarious than that .
If the viewpoint of the govt and the richest few did n't gain the corporate media more $ $ $ , they 'd do it anyway .
Because they 're infiltrated by them .
They 're losing money right now , but they 're still doing it .
They 're not in it for the money , they 're in it for the propaganda .
It 's their job to " manufacture consent " for the govt and the richest few and corporations .
Making $ $$ is secondary .

This new congress must make an attempt at having hearings on the role of the media and it's complicit nature ( to date ) .
Pelosi , Reid and the rest have not exactly showed any engery at the prospect of exposing and correcting the ills of the Bush Administration .
The onset of this new congress and this new Obama Administration appears to be more the same .
To ignore and placate the media for its Bush era misdeeds is an ennormous mistake .
Addressing the issue however is distasteful to politicians .
It is imperative to not allow the concept of the free press to be remain in the hands of corporate and political interests .
It also a reality that politicians are gutless and have no real interest in reclaiming Americas " freedom of the press " heritage and restoring its validity .

Melanie Brown 's Major Lapse in Judgment ( Photos )
From time to time all of our favorite celebrities make mistakes .
It was so disappointing to see the normally well dressed former Spice Girlsshow up at the Mobo Awards in London dressed as - well that is still to be decided .
Why have we not previously noticed Mel 's extremely prominent ears ?
Maybe the hood was supposed to be a cover up for them - and rightly so .
One hardly knows where to look .
Ears ?
Chest ?
Hair ?
Dress ?
Legs ?
So many issues , so little time .
Sorry Melanie , we hate to point out any fashion ' miss ' moments but clearly this was not one of your best efforts .

From World War II to present , there has been hidden within the highest levels of government secrets that you are not supposed to discover .
Canada 's ruling Conservatives would win a strong majority in Parliament if elections were held today , according to a poll showing the new leader of the opposition Liberals has done little to boost public support .
Canadians favour the Conservatives over the Liberals by 45 per cent to 26 per cent , an Ipsos Reid poll showed .
The New Democrats ( NDP ) had the backing of 12 per cent .
The 19 - point lead for Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's party is only slightly narrower than what the Conservatives enjoyed in a Ipsos Reid poll released Dec. 5 , before the Liberals replaced the unpopular Stephane Dion with Michael Ignatieff .
The Conservatives , whose minority government was returned to power in Oct. 14 elections with 37.6 per cent of the vote , would need at least 40 per cent to win a majority of the seats in the House of Commons , political analysts say .
Dion , who led the Liberals to one of their worst election defeats in history , bowed to pressure within his party to step down this week , instead of in May , clearing the way for Ignatieff to take the reins Wednesday ,
The switch follows Harper 's decision to suspend Parliament rather than face a no - confidence vote by opposition parties over his budget proposals .
The opposition 's threat to vote down the government when the House reconvenes in late January has raised the prospects of fresh elections or the formation of a Liberal - NDP coalition government supported by the separatist Bloc Quebecois .
The latest poll , conducted for Canwest News Service and Global National , shows most Canadians would prefer neither of those options .
Almost two - thirds of the respondents said they would prefer that Ignatieff find a compromise with Harper to keep the Conservatives in power .
On Friday , Harper held his first meeting with Ignatieff since the former Harvard don assumed the Liberal leadership .
The two talked about the economy and the upcoming budget , a Liberal spokesman said .
Opposition parties want the Conservatives to move aggressively to stimulate the economy in the face of the global financial crisis .
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said he would hold talks on the budget with senior Liberals Monday .
Ipsos Reid conducted telephone interviews with 1,001 adults from Tuesday through Thursday .
The results are considered accurate to within 3.1 percentage points , 19 times in 20 .

A Japanese businessman who reportedly committed suicide in a Los Angeles jail cell suffered wounds consistent with a choking and beating , his lawyer said Monday .
Mark Geragos hired an independent pathologist to examine the body of his client , Kazuyoshi Miura , after the L.A. County coroner ’s office released it .
Geragos said the pathologist found injuries to the middle and lower parts of the back as well as to the larynx .
“ Clearly it was missed by the coroner , ” Geragos said .
The death is under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department ’s Force Investigations Division .
On Monday , Police Chief William J. Bratton rebutted suggestions that Miura was strangled by another person .

“ There is no evidence of foul play , ” he said .
“ The death was by suicide . ”
According to LAPD Deputy Chief Mark Perez , officers had made the appropriate checks of Miura , who police say was in a cell alone .
Miura was discovered after an inmate heard a noise .
Geragos confirmed that Miura , who was accused of killing his wife in 1981 , did not leave a suicide note , even though he was a prolific writer and blogger .
Miura , 61 , was found dead Oct. 10 at the Parker Center jail .
Police said he hanged himself with a T - shirt less than a day after being extradited to Los Angeles from Saipan to stand trial on a conspiracy charge in his wife ’s death .

Geragos said pathologist Brian Posey found ligature marks on Miura ’s neck that were “ consistent with a choking , not a hanging . ”
L.A. County coroner ’s spokesman Ed Winter said his office has yet to issue its findings in the case .
“ We have not determined a cause of death , ” Winter said .
Geragos criticized the coroner ’s office for not reexamining Miura ’s body in light of the new findings .

Miura ’s case has long been a high - profile story in Japan , where the onetime ocean - hopping importer was dubbed “ the Japanese O.J. Simpson . ”
Miura was accused of plotting the death of his wife , Kazumi Miura , 28 , who was shot in the head in November 1981 while they were visiting downtown Los Angeles .
He was shot in the leg .
Eventually , authorities said they were able to build a case showing Miura had conspired to kill his wife , possibly by signaling someone else to shoot , to collect $ 750,000 in life insurance payments .
A warrant for his arrest was issued in 1988 alleging murder and conspiracy , but Los Angeles detectives could not extradite him while he was living in Japan .
Miura was convicted of murder there in 1994 , but the verdict was overturned .
Advertisement
In February , Miura wrote on his blog about plans to visit Saipan .
He was arrested there on the original 1988 warrant .
Miura at first fought extradition but last month agreed to return to Los Angeles after a judge dismissed the murder charge as double jeopardy because of Miura ’s trial in Japan .
A charge of conspiracy to commit murder remained .
After the legal hurdles were cleared , Miura was flown to Los Angeles .
He had been booked and was scheduled to be arraigned Oct. 14 on the conspiracy charge .

Miura was found dead in his cell about 9:45 p.m. Oct. 10 by a custody officer .
LAPD Deputy Chief Charlie Beck said a preliminary investigation of the incident found no violations of LAPD policy or state law requiring regular half - hour checks on inmates .
An LAPD detention officer checked on Miura at 9:36 p.m. -- 10 minutes before he was found in distress -- and noted nothing unusual .
Beck added that Miura had made no statements indicating he was suicidal , nor had he acted in any way to suggest he would kill himself either in Los Angeles or during previous stints in jail .
Geragos told The Times that a lawyer from his office had visited Miura , who was in good spirits .
“ There was no indication that he was despondent or depressed , ” Geragos said at the time .
“ He was ready and girded for the fight . ”

If Mark Cuban sidles up to fellow Cubs fans at future Wrigley Field games , apparently he 'll have to do so as a ticket buyer .
Cuban 's bid to buy the team from owner Sam Zell ?
According to the Chicago Sun-Times , the Internet billionaire and owner of the NBA 's Dallas Mavericks wo n't even make the final cut if commissioner Bud Selig and Major League Baseball owners have their way .
" There 's no way Bud and the owners are going to let that happen , " a baseball source told the Chicago Sun - Times earlier this week .
" Zero chance . "
Mark Cuban might be out of the Cubs sweepstakes .
Jonathan Daniel / Getty Images
Zell has yet to shorten the field of five potential buyers who submitted bids of about $ 1 billion to the Tribune Co. for the Cubs and Wrigley Field .
The process has begun to drag :
The Cubs were on the market at the start of the 2007 baseball season and a source told the Sun - Times that a deal before Opening Day 2009 is unlikely .
" Nothing 's changed .
I mean , it 's a great opportunity , " Cuban told The Associated Press before the Mavericks ' game in Denver on Friday night .
He would not comment further .
Major League Baseball must approve the sale of any team .
During the past summer , Comcast SportsNet reported that Cuban was the highest bidder for the Cubs at $ 1.3 billion .
" The Cubs have got smart , smart people here .
I mean they 're winning , they 're doing great things , I 'll just stay out of the way , " Cuban said in August , weeks after learning he had made the field of five bidders .
" Believe it or not , I can stay out of the way . "
Whether the deteriorating economy affects the final purchase price is unknown .
Last summer , several bidders offering between $ 700 million and $ 900 million for all of the properties were excluded from the second round of consideration .
'' We 'll be standing here at next year 's GM meetings , '' the source told the Sun - Times , '' and this will still be unresolved . "
The AP reported that Zell is willing to sell a smaller share of the baseball team than initially planned because the credit crunch has made it tougher for potential buyers to obtain loans , a person familiar with the talks said Friday .
Tribune Co. was looking to sell a 95 percent share of the Cubs and other sports properties for more than $ 1 billion .
Company officials have told representatives for the bidders in recent weeks that Tribune was willing to be flexible , said the person , who asked not to be named because the talks were confidential .
The Wall Street Journal reported in Friday 's editions that Tribune was willing to take bids for a 50 percent or smaller share .
The amount a bidder must borrow to finance such a deal would decline accordingly , and the Journal said Tribune could sell additional stakes in the properties over time .
The paper did not name its sources .
Tribune spokesman Gary Weitman declined comment .
The company , which owns the Los Angeles Times , Chicago Tribune and other newspapers along with television stations , has about $ 12.5 billion in debt , primarily from a complex buyout that real estate mogul Zell orchestrated to take the company private .
Tribune has a $ 593 million principal payment due in June and has been trying to generate cash by selling the Cubs , Chicago 's storied Wrigley Field stadium and the company 's 25 percent stake in a regional sports cable channel .
Among the five bidders in addition to Cuban are the Ricketts family , which founded the brokerage that is now TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. , and a group led by Sports Acquisition Holding Corp . that includes former baseball home run king Henry Aaron and former Republican congressman Jack Kemp .
The Tribune Co. paid $ 20.5 million for the Cubs in 1981 .

The Wiesenthal Center says it will only build on the part of the cemetery that has already been made into a car park
By Wyre Davies
BBC News , Jerusalem
Religious leaders in Jerusalem are warning of dangerous consequences after a decision by Israel 's Supreme Court to allow the destruction of part of an ancient Muslim cemetery .
The graveyard has not been used for more than 50 years , but contains the bodies of some important Islamic figures .
Many of those bodies will now be disturbed to make way for a new Jewish " Museum of Tolerance " .
Earlier this week hundreds of Muslims - young and old - marched through the centre of Jerusalem towards the city 's Mamilla cemetery .
Police helicopters flew overhead and security was tight .
The focus of the march , and of increasing Muslim anger , was the Israeli Supreme Court decision to sanction a controversial new building on part of the Muslim cemetery .
Outrage Located just inside West Jerusalem , the cemetery is not used for burials any more but Muslim leaders made clear they still regard it as sacred , as they arrived for a rally reading verses from the Koran .
The $ 250 m complex was designed by Frank Gehry ( Image : Wiesenthal Center ) The Mufti of Jerusalem , Sheikh Mohammad Hussein , led the peaceful but passionate demonstration .
He called the court 's decision an " outrage " and " disrespectful of the dead " .
The $ 250 m ( £ 160 m ) complex - designed by Frank Gehry - will be built by the Los Angeles - based Simon Wiesenthal Center and is bold and ambitious .
Its sharp , futuristic lines will dominate the immediate area .
In what is already a crowded city , Rabbi Marvin Hier , from the Simon Wiesenthal Center , said the museum was a sensible use of " derelict land " .
" Jerusalem is a city built on top of thousands of bones - Jewish and Muslim , " he said .
" If we declared the whole of Jerusalem one huge cemetery , we 'd never be able to build anything . "
He said that only part of the graveyard which has already been made into a car park will be dug up to make way for the new centre .
Mohammed al - Dejani says the cemetery is older than the US This does little to assuage concerns among Muslims , who point out that the graveyard is still visited by the families of the dead .
" The cemetery is older than the United States - it 's been used for hundreds of years , " said Mohammed al - Dejani , whose great - grandfather is buried in the graveyard .
" Some of the warriors of Saladin [ Muslim leader who retook Jerusalem from the Crusaders ] are buried there and other great Muslim leaders from many years ago . "
Despite the strength of feeling among an increasing number of Muslims , there is no doubt that much of the cemetery is run-down .
Some graves have been vandalised - others are in a poor state of repair .
The Simon Wiesenthal Center says that it will deal respectfully with any human remains it uncovers or graves disturbed by the building work .
Initial excavations under the car park have already uncovered bones Ruling in favour of the Simon Wiesenthal Center , the Supreme Court noted that no objections were lodged in 1960 when part of the graveyard was made into a car park .
Many of those opposed to the new building say that any proposal to build on top of a Jewish cemetery would never have been allowed .
Construction work has already begun in a corner of the graveyard .
Dozens of bones have been dug up and no decision has been taken over what to do with them .
The cemetery is still a relatively quiet , peaceful place - but one which could become another dangerous flashpoint between Jews and Muslims in this divided city .

This post is part of an ongoing series featured on Market Urbanism called Urbanism Legends .
The Urbanism Legends series is intended to expose many of the myths about development and Urban Economics .
( it ’s a play on the term : “ Urban Legends ” in case you did n’t catch that )
Last week President - elect Obama announced some details of his economic stimulus package :
Second , we will create millions of jobs by making the single largest new investment in our national infrastructure since the creation of the federal highway system in the 1950s .
We ’ll invest your precious tax dollars in new and smarter ways
This further taxpayer subsidization , beyond currently insufficient highway revenue sources , of sprawl and auto - dependency seems to contradict Obama ’s promise of “ green jobs ” .
As Tyler Cowen remarks , “ for better or worse you can consider the opposite of a carbon tax . ”
Furthermore , the Obama plan intends to fund the stimulus directly to states , as opposed to metro areas , which have historically received almost two - thirds of the funds directly .
Certainly , Obama ’s plan is not an urbanism - friendly plan , yet I consistently hear urbanists subscribing to and spreading the myth that jobs can be created by spending on infrastructure , and that these jobs will lead to economic recovery .
Even if the job creation myth were true , and could stimulate the economy immediately , you would think urbanists would not sacrifice urbanist ideals for the sake of short - term recovery through their commitment to so - called progressive ideology .
In his enduring 1961 classic , Economics in One Lesson , Henry Hazlitt addresses the long - standing myth about “ creating jobs ” through public works projects :
A bridge is built .
If it is built to meet an insistent public demand , if it solves a traffic problem or a transportation problem otherwise insoluble , if , in short , it is even more necessary to the taxpayers collectively than the things for which they would have individually spent their money had it had not been taxed away from them , there can be no objection .
But a bridge built primarily “ to provide employment ” is a different kind of bridge .
When providing employment becomes the end , need becomes a subordinate consideration .
“ Projects ” have to be invented .
Instead of thinking only of where bridges must be built the government spenders begin to ask themselves where bridges can be built .
Can they think of plausible reasons why an additional bridge should connect Easton and Weston ?
It soon becomes absolutely essential .
Those who doubt the necessity are dismissed as obstructionists and reactionaries .
Two arguments are put forward for the bridge , one of which is mainly heard before it is built , the other of which is mainly heard after it has been completed .
The first argument is that it will provide employment .
It will provide , say , 500 jobs for a year .
The implication is that these are jobs that would not otherwise have come into existence .
This is what is immediately seen .
But if we have trained ourselves to look beyond immediate to secondary consequences , and beyond those who are directly benefited by a government project to others who are indirectly affected , a different picture presents itself .
It is true that a particular group of bridgeworkers may receive more employment than otherwise .
But the bridge has to be paid for out of taxes .
For every dollar that is spent on the bridge a dollar will be taken away from taxpayers .
If the bridge costs $ 10 million the taxpayers will lose $ 10 million .
They will have that much taken away from them which they would otherwise have spent on the things they needed most .
Therefore , for every public job created by the bridge project a private job has been destroyed somewhere else .
We can see the men employed on the bridge .
We can watch them at work .
The employment argument of the government spenders becomes vivid , and probably for most people convincing .
But there are other things that we do not see , because , alas , they have never been permitted to come into existence .
They are the jobs destroyed by the $ 10 million taken from the taxpayers .
All that has happened , at best , is that there has been a diversion of jobs because of the project .
More bridge builders ; fewer automobile workers , television technicians , clothing workers , farmers .
But then we come to the second argument .
The bridge exists .
It is , let us suppose , a beautiful and not an ugly bridge .
It has come into being through the magic of government spending .
Where would it have been if the obstructionists and the reactionaries had had their way ?
There would have been no bridge .
The country would have been just that much poorer .
Here again the government spenders have the better of the argument with all those who cannot see beyond the immediate range of their physical eyes .
They can see the bridge .
But if they have taught themselves to look for indirect as well as direct consequences they can once more see in the eye of imagination the possibilities that have never been allowed to come into existence .
They can see the unbuilt homes , the unmade cars and washing machines , the unmade dresses and coats , perhaps the ungrown and unsold foodstuffs .
To see these uncreated things requires a kind of imagination that not many people have .
We can think of these nonexistent objects once , perhaps , but we cannot keep them before our minds as we can the bridge that we pass every working day .
What has happened is merely that one thing has been created instead of others .
Unfortunately , big spending on infrastructure projects are political chess pieces .
As politicians align themselves for the handout , Governors are sure to push for spending that will allow them to funnel federal tax dollars into vanity projects that will do the most to boost visibility and popularity .
I would n’t expect any wise long - term planning on the part of the spenders .
From an economic recovery point - of - view , it will be years before the money spent on infrastructure trickles back into the overall economy , and even longer for any productivity gains to be realized by the newly constructed infrastructure .
This pervasive myth is a dangerous enabler of one of the least effective strategies for recovery ( in the short - run ) , and a harmful disservice the the environment and living patterns ( in the long - run ) .

A new series of Time / CNN state polls confirms the growing trend towards Barack Obama .
Obama now leads John McCain 51 % - 47 % in Florida , 54 - 43 % in Minnesota , 51 % - 47 % in Nevada , 53 % - 44 % in Virginia , and the two candidates are statistically tied in Missouri where Obama has a small 49 % - 48 % lead .
Obama has gained four points in Florida over the last CNN poll .
He has gained six points in Missouri where John McCain was ahead by five points in the last poll .
McCain led Nevada by two points , and now he trails by four .
The two biggest surprises are in Minnesota and Virginia .
Obama has gone from a two point lead in Minnesota to an 11 point lead , but the most dramatic swing came in Virginia , where McCain two weeks ago , according to CNN , had a four point lead , now he trails in the state by nine .
Let ’s throw out the numbers for a second , and look at the trends and momentum .
It is likely that some of these state numbers are a bit inflated , but the trend towards Obama ca n’t be denied .
So , how did this happen ?
I think the best explanation is that the economic crisis hit the news just as people were really starting to pay attention to this election .
People watched the presidential debate to see what the candidates had to offer on the economy , and what they got from McCain was a lot of talk about earmarks and tax cuts .
Advertisements
In contrast , Obama stood there and said that people are hurting .
He got caught up in McCain ’s discussion about earmarks , but McCain never acknowledged that people are struggling right now .
McCain ’s suspension of his campaign and rush back to Washington , actually hurt him , because it made him look less presidential .
The approach Obama took made him seem calmer and more presidential .
This perception along polling that indicates that women have rejected Sarah Palin , and are flocking to Obama in droves is probably enough to move the state polls that we have seen today .
There are also signs that Independents and moderates are shifting to Obama , because these are groups that are usually more sensitive to problems like the economy and the message of change when they feel that things are going poorly .
It is too early to read too much into any of these polls , but Democrats can see the potential for a big Obama win .
McCain is sinking , and everything is trending towards Obama , but nothing is certain until the votes are counted on November 4 .

As George W Bush prepares to leave the White House , at least one unpleasant episode from his unpopular presidency is threatening to follow him into retirement .
A $ 70 m lawsuit filed by Dan Rather , the veteran former newsreader for CBS Evening News , against his old network is reopening the debate over alleged favourable treatment that Bush received when he served in the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam war .
Bush had hoped that this controversy had been dealt with once and for all during the 2004 election .
Eight weeks before the 2004 presidential poll , Rather broadcast a story based on newly discovered documents which appeared to show that Bush , whose service in the Texas Air National Guard ensured that he did not have to fight in Vietnam , had barely turned up even for basic duty .
After an outcry from the White House and conservative bloggers who claimed that the report had been based on falsified documents , CBS retracted the story , saying that the documents ' authenticity could not be verified .
Rather , who had been with CBS for decades and was one of the most familiar faces in American journalism , was fired by the network the day after the 2004 election .
He claims breach of contract against CBS .
He has already spent $ 2 m on his case , which is likely to go to court early next year .
Rather contends not only that his report was true - " What the documents stated has never been denied , by the president or anyone around him , " he says - but that CBS succumbed to political pressure from conservatives to get the report discredited and to have him fired .
He also claims that a panel set up by CBS to investigate the story was packed with conservatives in an effort to placate the White House .
Part of the reason for that , he suggests , was that Viacom , a sister company of CBS , knew that it would have important broadcasting regulatory issues to deal with during Bush 's second term .
Among those CBS considered for the panel to investigate Rather 's report were far - right broadcasters Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter .
" CBS broke with long - standing tradition at CBS News and elsewhere of standing up to political pressure , " says Rather .
" And , there 's no joy in saying it , they caved ... in an effort to placate their regulators in Washington . "
Rather 's lawsuit makes other serious allegations about CBS succumbing to political pressure in an attempt to suppress important news stories .
In particular , he says that his bosses at CBS tried to stop him reporting evidence of torture at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
According to Rather 's lawsuit , " for weeks they refused to grant permission to air the story " and " continued to raise the goalposts , insisting on additional substantiation " .
Rather also claims that General Richard Meyers , then head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the top military official in the US , called him at home and asked him not to broadcast the story , saying that it would " endanger national security " .
Rather says that CBS only agreed to allow him to broadcast the story when it found out that Seymour Hersh would be writing about it in the New Yorker magazine .
Even then , Rather claims , CBS tried to bury it .
" CBS imposed the unusual restrictions that the story would be aired only once , that it would not be preceded by on - air promotion , and that it would not be referenced on the CBS Evening News , " he says .
The charges outlined in Rather 's lawsuit will cast a further shadow over the Bush legacy .
He recently expressed regret for the " failed intelligence " which led to the invasion of Iraq and has received heavy criticism over the scale and depth of the economic downturn in the United States .
— James Saft is a Reuters columnist .
The opinions expressed are his own —
Government intervention or not , banks will be cutting up America ’s credit cards at an unprecedented rate , with grave implications for the economy and company profits .
The U.S. Federal Reserve last week added more nutrition to its alphabet soup of rescue programs when it unveiled the Term Asset - backed Securities Loan Facility ( TALF ) , under which , among other things , it will lend up to $ 200 billion to investors in securities backed by credit - card , auto and student loans .
It did so for a very good reason : the securitization market ’s freeze now extends beyond mortgages , imperiling run -of - the - mill consumer financing and making it a certainty that many people who use credit to get them over “ cash flow ” situations will be , well , denied .
And even though the U.S. car industry may implode if starved of finance and many students will have to defer education , the real potential disaster is in credit card funding , which could push lots of households over the brink and in the process consumption and every business which depends on it , which would be all of them .
Put simply , even with an apparent will to try anything to bring the wheels of finance back into motion it will be very difficult for government to quickly fill the hole left by private finance .
Details of the plan are still sketchy , but let ’s just take it for granted that it works , even if the plan , at only one year , will give them huge fears about how they get out of their positions at the end of 2009 .
Beyond that , the Fed is seeking to kick start securitization by attracting back a species of investors , leveraged ones , who do n’t really exist any more .
All other things being equal , the amount the Fed is putting into the TALF should take the ABS market back to about where it was in the first half of 2008 , which itself was only a third of the volume we saw in 2007 .
But all other things are not equal .
The banks that provide the bulk of credit card funding generally want to cut back , pushed by their own woes , a conservative read of the economic situation and , potentially , regulatory changes that , while intended to ward off the excesses of the last bubble , will magnify the impact of its bursting .
Meredith Whitney , the Oppenheimer and Co analyst who has so far been ahead in identifying and explaining the weaknesses in the banking system , thinks over $ 2 trillion of credit lines , or 45 percent of lines available , will be pulled out from under American consumers in the next 18 months , a figure that puts the Fed ’s $ 200 billion for asset backed finance in its proper perspective .
“ We are now entering a new era within the financial landscape that will be characterized by expanded forced consumer de-leveraging with a pronounced downshift in consumer spending , ” she wrote in a research note .
“ We view the credit card as the second key source of consumer liquidity , the first being their jobs .
Pulling credit at a time when job losses are increasing by over 50 percent year - on - year in most key states is a dangerous and unprecedented combination , in our view . ”
BIG BANKS ALL WANT TO CUT BACK
Whitney notes that the three largest credit card lenders , Bank of America , Citigroup and JP Morgan , who between them account for more than half of U.S. credit card outstandings , have each discussed reducing card exposure or slowing growth .
Capital One and American Express , who are another 14.5 percent , have also talked about limiting lending .
That will set the tone for the rest of the industry , which will be grappling with new regulation that , if goes ahead as planned , will impair profitability of credit card lending and push more off - balance sheet securitizations back on to the banking industry ’s already strained books .
Cutting back on abusive lending and forcing banks to recognize and account for the risks they take are surely good things , but will have the perverse effect of making the credit crunch worse , at least temporarily .
And looking at the balance sheets of individual Americans , there is good reason to think that the credit crunch should get worse : that they should consume and borrow less and save more .
I ’d argue that far from being non-functioning , financial markets are closer to pricing in the true risk of lending to consumers now with credit cards charging about 10 percentage points more than 5 - year Treasuries than they were six months ago when it was only about a 7.65 percentage point gap .
But the mother of all unintended side effects is that the faster consumers cut back , the worse it will be .
The kind of consumer cut back implied by the consumer credit crunch that now looks likely would blow a hole below the waterline in the U.S. economy , and in U.S. company profits and the stocks that reflect them .
The Federal Reserve and U.S. government ’s use of unconventional measures is only just beginning .

Düsseldorf ( Reuters ) - Von der Spitzelaffäre bei der Deutschen Telekom sind nach bisherigen Erkenntnissen der ermittelnden Bonner Staatsanwaltschaft 55 Menschen betroffen .
Dabei handele es sich unter anderem um Aufsichtsräte der Telekom und der Mobilfunktochter T - Mobile , einen Telekom - Vorstand sowie Betriebsräte und deren Mitarbeiter , teilte Oberstaatsanwalt Friedrich Apostel am Donnerstag mit .
Auch seien Daten von sieben Journalisten und Menschen außerhalb des Konzern erhoben oder verarbeitet worden .
Nach Aussagen von Verdi wurden auch Gewerkschaftschef Frank Bsirske sowie der frühere Verdi-Bundesvorstand und Post - Vize - Aufsichtsratschef Rolf Büttner ausspioniert .
Verdi warf der Telekom einen Angriff auf die Mitbestimmung vor .
Der Konzern habe mit dem Ausspähen von Telefondaten nicht nur das Grundrecht auf vertrauliche Information verletzt , sagte Bundesvorstand Lothar Schröder in Berlin .
Offenbar seien zudem gezielt “ kritische Geister ” unter den Betriebsräten ins Visier genommen worden .
Schröder ist Vize - Aufsichtsratschef bei der Telekom und gehört wie DGB - Chef Michael Sommer , der ebenfalls im Kontrollgremium sitzt , zu den Bespitzelungsopfern .
Insgesamt sind nach Verdi-Angaben fünf Aufsichtsräte der Telekom und zwei von T - Mobile betroffen , mindestens zwölf Betriebsräte und zehn Mitarbeiter aus deren Büros .
Die Telekom selbst hatte Mitte Mai Anzeige erstattet , um das Ausmaß des Missbrauchs von Verbindungsdaten in den Jahren 2005 und 2006 und den oder die Auftraggeber herauszufinden .
Ziel soll es gewesen sein , Kontakte von Aufsichtsräten auszuspähen , um so die Veröffentlichung vertraulicher Informationen in den Medien zu unterbinden .
Verdi stellt diese Argumentation aber infrage : Weder Bsirske noch er selbst hätten 2005 Kenntnisse von den Informationen gehabt , die an die Öffentlichkeit gesickert und angeblich Anlass für die Affäre gewesen seien , sagte Schröder .
Damals sei er noch gar nicht Aufsichtsrat gewesen .
Offenbar seien vor allem Verbindungsdaten von Betriebsräten erfasst worden , die damals als kritisch gegenüber dem Vorstand gegolten hätten , sagte Lothar Holzwarth , Betriebsratsvorsitzender bei der Telekom - Tochter T - Systems und selbst betroffen .
ERMITTLUNGEN WERDEN 2008 KEINEN ABSCHLUSS FINDEN
Die Staatsanwaltschaft
Bonn ermittelt wegen des Verstoßes gegen das Bundesdatenschutzgesetz sowie der Verletzung des Post - und Fernmeldegeheimnisses .
Die Ermittlungen richten sich im Kern gegen acht Beschuldigte , darunter der ehemalige Telekom - Chef Kai-Uwe Ricke , der einstige Aufsichtsratschef Klaus Zumwinkel und der Chef einer Berliner Sicherheitsfirma , die die Daten ausgewertet haben soll .
Sowohl Zumwinkel als auch Ricke hätten erklärt , sich äußern zu wollen , wenn ihre Anwälte Einsicht in die Akten gehabt hätten .
Sie hätten noch keine Erklärung abgegeben .
Apostel rechnet nicht damit , die Ermittlungen noch im laufenden Jahr zu Ende zu bringen .
Apostel sagte , das Sammeln und die Verarbeitung von Daten sei in unterschiedlich großem Ausmaß erfolgt .
“ Das ging von einem Tag bis hin zu Monaten . ” Gespräche seien aber nicht abgehört worden .
Die 55 Betroffenen seien angeschrieben worden und könnten Strafantrag stellen .
Über mögliche Drahtzieher könne er noch nichts sagen , sagte Apostel .
Scientific proof exists that many child support awards are too high
by Roger F. Gay
Introduction :
A competent decision in a child support case involves the complex consideration of a wide variety of factors .
In order to make such a decision , attorneys and judges must apply their skills to extract essential and sufficient information from litigants and understand the proper application of the information they collect .
That will be true regardless of the technology used to calculate an award .
Modern attempts to change the decision process using crude statistical models have reduced complexity for the sake of an odd sort of consistency .
Although child support guidelines themselves show an impressive self - consistency , there is no longer any concrete relationship between an award and the wide variety of factors that are important in making a reasonable decision .
The Project for the Improvement of Child Support Litigation Technology has demonstrated that the logic of traditional child support decision - making can , to a large extent , be transformed into a concrete science .
The application of such a science in the training of judges and attorneys can result in a more desirable sort of consistency .
Each award should be just and appropriate , given consideration of the individual circumstances in each case .
Just and appropriate results require an understanding of the detailed logic used in reaching a competent child support award decision .
With that understanding , it should be possible to produce a similar award in different courts on different days in consideration of a similar set of facts .
In this article , I would like to summarize the work of Project for the Improvement of Child Support Litigation Technology ( PICSLT ) toward developing better child support guidelines , and provide an overview of the PICSLT model .
Detailed theoretical development in the PICSLT work has led to a solid definition for the boundary between child support and alimony .
This development provides scientific proof that many child support awards contain a hidden margin of alimony , and are thus too high in a common , legal sense .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. consumer prices fell in November at the fastest rate since 1932 , the darkest days of the Great Depression , the Labor Department reported Tuesday , as prices for energy , commodities and airline fares plunged across the country .
The U.S. consumer price index fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.7 % , the department reported , the biggest drop since the government began adjusting the CPI for seasonal factors in 1947 .
But on a non-seasonally adjusted basis , the CPI fell by 1.9 % , the biggest decline since January 1932 , at the nadir of the Great Depression .
Read MarketWatch First Take commentary .
" This is scary stuff , " said Mike Schenk , an economist for Credit Union National Association .
" We are teetering on the brink of a massive downward spiral .
Deflation is a threat . "
The seasonally adjusted core CPI was flat in November .
Read the report .
Economists surveyed by MarketWatch were expecting the CPI to fall by 1.4 % .
They forecast that the core CPI would rise by 0.1 % .
See Economic Calendar .
Energy prices declined by a seasonally adjusted 17 % , the most since February 1957 .
Gasoline prices plunged by 29.5 % in November , the most since the government began keeping records in February 1967 .
Fuel oil prices dropped by 7.2 % .
Commodities prices declined by 4.1 % in November .
The CPI data is one of the last pieces of the economic puzzle that the Federal Reserve will have to mull before its announcement about interest rates later Tuesday .
The policy - making Federal Open Market Committee is almost universally expected to cut its target for overnight interest rates to 0.5 % from 1 % .

U.S. stock indexes rose after the price data and data about housing starts were released Tuesday .
See Market Snapshot .
Over the past year , overall consumer prices have risen by 1.1 % , down from their peak of 5.6 % in July .
Core prices have risen by 2 % in the last 12 months .
Medical , food , clothing costs rise
Prices for certain goods rose in November , even as the overall number fell .
Medical care prices , for example , climbed by 0.2 % .
They are up 2.7 % in the past year .
Also , food prices rose by 0.2 % in November .
The cost of owning a house , meanwhile , rose 0.3 % in November .
Falling transportation prices contributed to the overall decline .
Those prices dropped 9.8 % in November , the most in 61 years .
They are down 8.9 % over the past year .
The Labor Department also reported Tuesday that real average weekly earnings rose by 2.3 % from October to November .
Within transportation , new vehicle prices fell 0.6 % .
Airline fares , meanwhile , dropped 4 % .

There ’s been a lot of talk recently about how much money Microsoft is spending ( and some would say wasting ) on its new advertising campaigns to promote its brand .
Of course you ’ve seen them :
The Bill Gates / Seinfeld ads and the newer “ I ’m a PC ” ads .
But there has n’t been much focus on how much Microsoft rival Apple is spending on its advertising .
You might think it ’d be hard to get a figure out of the ever - secretive company , but BNET ’s Technology Industry Blog was able to dig the figure up from Apple ’s 10 - K filing .
Apple had an advertising budget of $ 486 million in 2008 .
That ’s up only slightly from its $ 467 million budget last year , but significantly ahead of its 2006 ad budget of $ 338 million .
Why has it risen so much in the past two years ?
Hard to know for sure , though I ’d guess it ’s because of a certain device that launched in mid-2007 : The iPhone .
While Apple ’s “ Mac vs. PC ” ads are the ones that get a lot of hype because they ’re humorous , its iPhone ads are arguably more effective and important .
After all , they show the device in action , and for a lot of people , seeing is believing .
That ’s why getting air time on these ads is such a big deal for individual app makers like Loopt , Urbanspoon and Shazam — all of which saw their app downloads surge after being featured in commercials by Apple .
Microsoft ’s latest campaign is said to be in the $ 300 million range , but that is just its contract with the ad firm Crispin Porter +
Bogusky for these newest ads .
Microsoft also presumably has a lot of advertising budget outside of that marketing effort , and also apparently has brought on Crispin Porter +
Bogusky for its
Zune ads now as well , according to AdAge .
The following photographic bicycle pedal museum & historical time line is meant to serve as a window into the rich and dynamic history of the bicycle pedal .
Each pedal design is an inventor 's dream of improving on prior designs .
Some of these innovations offered modest improvements over earlier designs while others provided major advances .
Some designs were simply novel .
Many of the designs included represent the cutting edge of the technology of their era .
Some pedals were commercial successes whose use spanned decades before they were made obsolete .
Others , for a variety of reasons , disappeared from the market soon after they appeared .
None of the pedals pictured are still produced today .
All of the designs , however , played some role in the development of modern pedal design and their place in pedal history deserves recognition .
Here is their story . . .

KABUL , Afghanistan  United States forces killed six Afghan police officers and one civilian on Wednesday during an assault on the hide - out of a suspected Taliban commander , the authorities said , in what an American military spokesman called a “ tragic case of mistaken identity . ”
Thirteen Afghan officers were also wounded in the episode .
A statement issued jointly by the American and the Afghan military commands said a contingent of police officers fired on United States forces after the Americans had successfully overrun the hide - out , killing the suspected Taliban commander and detaining another man .
The statement said the Americans had already entered the hide - out , a building in Qalat , the capital of the southern province of Zabul , when they came under attack by small - arms fire and rocket - propelled grenades from “ a compound nearby . ”
“ Multiple attempts to deter the engagement were unsuccessful , ” the statement said .
The Americans , concerned about women and children hiding in the building they had taken , returned fire using small arms and aircraft , the statement said .
Unlike many Saudi women her age , Maha did not have an arranged marriage .
Instead , she wed a young man she 'd known and liked since they played together as children .
" Really , it 's a love story , " added the attractive , 40 - something woman with short curly hair , who asked to be identified only by her first name .
That 's why the divorce , and the way she found out , was a shock .
Maya was at her parents ' home for a short vacation when her husband 's brother came to the door and delivered the court decree :
She and her husband of 10 years were no longer married .
" They do n't ask the woman if she wants to be divorced , " Maha said of the courts .
" It was a very bad day for me .
I did n't expect that .
I knew there were problems but , I thought , we can solve it , especially as we were living together and we understood each other . "
Maya 's experience , not unusual , is just one of the inequities surrounding divorce that Saudi women have endured for decades .
But if a recent gathering in the country 's Eastern Province is any indicator , their patience with such inequalities is growing thin .
About 150 Saudi women filed into the auditorium of the local Chamber of Commerce in the city of Dammam to attend the Saudi Divorce Initiative Forum – the first privately organized , public discussion of problems faced by women during and after divorce .
The aim , organizers said , was to spark debate that would lead to reforms to ensure enforcement of existing , but often ignored , legal protections for women and children .
" We 're doing something historic here , " said Thuraya Arrayed , a women 's rights activist who spoke at the forum .
" For the first time , we are meeting together to look for a solution for a problem .
It 's a worldwide problem , and we 're trying to find a solution . "
Expanded public space for women
Like the first public conference on domestic violence last spring , the divorce forum was another example of the expanded public space that Saudi women have been given to speak about societal problems under the rule of King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz , whose picture was prominently displayed at the gathering .
" He 's supporting women ....
He gives us the right to talk , " said Hind al - Zahid , manager of the Business Women Center , an affiliate of the local chamber of commerce that helped organize the forum .
The conference was also another sign of the concern about Saudi Arabia 's rising divorce rate .
The Ministry of Social Affairs reported earlier this year that it stood at 30 percent , although some experts say it might be as high as 60 percent , according to press reports .
The Nov. 25 forum , held to coincide with International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women , had an array of impressive backers : the Chambers of Commerce in Dammam and Jeddah , the Ministry of Social Affairs , a Saudi human rights group , and the Shura Council , the country 's top advisory body .
The women were encouraged that these organizations had openly supported their efforts .
Many of the attendees – married , divorced , and single – had taken off their coatlike abayas since only women were present .
For several hours , they listened and applauded as a dozen - plus speakers , on a stage festooned with flowers , addressed the legal , psychological , financial , and family problems faced by divorced women .
Judges often wo n't consider a woman 's divorce pleadings unless she is accompanied by a male relative .
In addition , Miss Zahid said , ex-husbands often face no legal penalty if they stop child support , snatch children from their mother , or fail to obtain the necessary papers for a child to attend school , a problem particularly acute in low - income communities .
She called it " wrong " that judges do not require wives to be present when husbands seek divorce , adding , " Sometimes a woman gets divorced and no one tells her !
Imagine ! "
" This is not in our religion .
Ours is a very peaceful religion … we are not against religion , " Zahid added .
But " we need a law to stop this violence against women .
It 's as simple as that . "
Legal problems are compounded by society 's attitudes towards divorced women , who are often viewed with disdain , and blamed , even by their own families , for their marriages ' failure .
Luluah al - Shammari , an educator from Dammam , said the mere fact of holding an event whose title included the word " divorce " would advance public awareness .
" It 's the first step to bring ... the divorce issue up , " she said .
Like other women at the forum , Mrs. Shammari said part of the reason for the rising divorce rate is that young men are raised to believe they should totally control their wives .
They are taught that " you are the man , you have the power , you have the authority , " Shammari said .
" In the end , the man wants to take over this girl and not give her space .
He deals with me as if I 'm an employee , as if he has the remote control : ' Stand up ! '
' Sit down ! '
Women can't take it . "
The forum was proposed by Dammam - based journalist Haifa al - Khalid , who started the kingdom 's first website devoted to divorce last spring : www.saudidivorce.org.
At the end of the meeting , Khalid read aloud the forum 's 70 - plus recommendations that organizers said will be presented to relevant official agencies .
The recommendations cited a need for marriage counseling services , and included demands that women 's national identification cards be recognized in courts as a sufficient form of identification ; that original copies of marriage contracts be given to both partners , not just the man ; that DNA results be relied on if a husband denies paternity of a child ; that official documents state " single , " not " divorced , " for women , as is the case with men , and that women be able to hire female lawyers to represent them .
Remove divorce 's stigma
Another suggestion was for a national awareness campaign to remove the stigma of being a divorced woman .
It is a stigma that Maha , training to be a human development officer , believes is sometimes self - inflicted .
" So many women live in a box … [ as if ] it 's written on their heads : ' This is a divorced woman . '
They blame themselves because society blames them , " she said .
After the shock of her divorce wore off , Maha determined that she would not " live in a box " and as a result , she became a different woman .
" I feel I became stronger than the Maha I knew before , " she said .
" I 'm independent in my mind , in my decisions .
I can put my mind before my feelings . "
Surprise !
Here 's the 2010 Chevrolet Equinox scheduled to make its debut at the 2009 Detroit Auto Show .
Bet you did n't expect to see this on a Sunday morning did you ?

The all - new 2010 Chevrolet Equinox builds on the the previous model with more of what segment buyers are looking for across pretty much every aspect .
Better interior , better styling , better engines , better transmissions and smarter features .
You can bet GM will be trumpeting from the heavens the new Equinox 's 30 MPG highway rating when optioned with the direct injection 2.4 liter four cylinder and standard six speed transmission , but we 've seen the little SUV in the sheetmetal and we 're happy to say the Equinox is n't just a fuel economy figure .
Advertisement
The new Equinox takes styling inspiration mainly from the Chevy Malibu , but there are hints of other cars in the lineup as well .
Outside we see the Equinox gets the new Chevy face , first seen on the Malibu , with a bit more curvaceousness in the headlights and a bit of extra chrome around the fog lamps .
The sides get a heaping helping of styling with big fender flares over your choice of 16 , 17 or 18 inch wheels , and a strong shoulder line runs front to back to link everything together .
We think the Hofmeister kink at the back of the rear door glass is both amusing and cool looking .
The design of the doors has been changed so they extend all the way though the rocker panel , virtually eliminating stepover height .
The rear ... looks like an SUV .

From a mechanical standpoint , the Equinox will come with a duo of engines , both sporting fancy direct injection technology and fuel sipping credentials for their size — there 's even an " Eco " button on the center console which changes the fuel mapping and shift points to give you an extra mile per gallon or two .
You get your pick of a 2.4 liter inline four with 185 HP and a 3.0 liter V6 with 255 HP .
The I4 puts down 21 city , 30 mpg highway , while the V6 is a bit more thirsty at 18 mpg city , 25 mpg highway .
Both of those engines get backed with their own standard six speed transmissions with front wheel drive standard , all wheel drive optional .

Nobody buying in this segment cares about those greasy bits though .
The interior , on the other hand , is something that will demand consumer attentions .
Again , the Equinox takes inspiration from the Malibu inside , with a similar dashboard layout , contrasting materials and stitching , and handsome details ..
Amusingly though , it also takes its gauges from the perennially just around the corner 2010 Camaro .
GM is also pretty excited about the ambient lighting peppering the interior , though lighting never really has rung our bell .
What is bell - ringing are the seats , the gadgets the storage and the legroom .

Those seats are supportive and comfortable , with excellent leather and plenty of adjustability to get everyone where they want to be , obviously we can't make a call on how good they are after four hours of drive time .
Between those front seats is a cavernous storage bin deep enough for a couple of full size laptops and houses the USB port and a 12 volt power port .
Front and back passengers get huge amounts of legroom , and with the second row keeping the sliding and reclining 60 / 40 split bench it 's practically limo - like in the rear .
Order the optional independent dual rear flip - up DVD players and you 'll never hear a peep from the back .
Even with the rear seats pushed all the way back , cargo room is downright generous .
And getting to that cargo area gets clever as the power lift gate is now programmable .
Silly until you think about it — you can program the maximum opening height so it does n't smash into your low clearance garage door .
Overall first impression without having driven it or lived with it for a while is positive .
The styling will leave some wanting more but the mileage figures are impressive for this segment and the interior is , dare we say it , actually pretty nice .
We 're looking forward to seeing how this new crop of direct injection engines and their six speed transmissions perform out on the road .
Look for the debut in January at the Detroit Auto Show and until then , enjoy the complete details below .
2010 CHEVROLET EQUINOX : A COMPACT CROSSOVER FOR ALL SEASONS – AND ALL LIFESTYLES
All - new crossover delivers expected segment - best highway fuel economy DETROIT – Chevrolet unveiled the all - new 2010 Equinox , a compact crossover that blends distinctive design with outstanding efficiency .
A new , 2.4L direct injection engine helps the Equinox deliver expected best - in - segment estimated highway fuel economy of 30 mpg ( EPA certification pending ) – a 25 - percent improvement over the previous model .
Chevrolet expects nearly two - thirds of customers will choose the efficient , 2.4L engine .
The new Equinox draws its exterior design inspiration from the Chevrolet Malibu sedan and Traverse crossover ; and like those vehicles , the new Equinox complements its styling with attention to detail and unexpected features , according to Ed Peper , GM North America vice president , Chevrolet .
The Equinox makes its world debut at the North American Auto Show in Detroit next month .
" At a time when customers are so concerned about the fuel efficiency of their vehicle , the Equinox delivers , " said Peper .
" It offers the roominess and capability of a crossover with great fuel economy .
Equinox will provide customers a vehicle filled with refinement , comfort and great value . "
The 2010 Equinox goes on sale in mid-2009 .
It is available in LS , LT and LTZ trim , with available all - wheel - drive .
Two new engines are offered , each with fuel - saving direct injection and variable valve timing technology .
Vehicle highlights include :
New 2.4L Ecotec direct injected I - 4 engine estimated at 182 horsepower ( 135 kW ) , which delivers an estimated 30 mpg highway , 21 mpg city ( EPA certification pending )
New 3.0L DOHC direct injected V - 6 engine estimated at 255 horsepower ( 190 kW ) , which delivers an estimated 25 mpg highway , 18 mpg city ( EPA certification pending )
Driving range of more than 500 miles ( 800 km ) with both engines , for less - frequent fill - ups
Six standard air bags : dual frontal air bags ; head curtain side air bags and pelvic / thorax seat - mounted side air bags
Standard four - wheel disc brakes with StabiliTrak electronic stability control and traction control
Standard OnStar and XM Satellite Radio
" Smart " remote starting system that also activates the HVAC system and optional heated seats depending on the outside temperature " With the 2010 Equinox , we focused on appealing to the senses – from the overall design to the feel of the interior , " said Peper .
Design details
The design features Chevy 's signature global face – the two - tier grille and prominent gold Bowtie insignia .
Strong fender shapes , a distinctive premium roofline , wraparound headlamps and dual round taillamps are additional elements that define Equinox as a true Chevrolet , Peper said .
" The new Equinox blends function and style into a very sporty , yet upscale compact crossover , " said Ed Welburn , vice president of GM Global Design .
" Both the exterior and interior surprise and delight with careful attention to detail . "
Additional design features include :
A multi-dimensional hood and wraparound rear side glass and a wheels - at - the - corners stance
Improved aerodynamic performance through a number of carefully designed exterior features , including moving the base of the windshield forward approximately three inches ( 75 mm ) for a sleeker profile Equinox 's rocker panels are integrated into the doors to make it easier to get in and out of the vehicle .
They narrow the area over which a passenger must step , offering protection for pant legs that could brush against dirty rockers .
Also , the select use of chrome trim and flush - fitting " exposed - edge " windshield and rear glass reinforce Equinox 's build quality and reduce wind noise .
Dimensionally , the Equinox rides on the same 112.5 - inch wheelbase ( 2,857 mm ) , but is about one inch ( 25 mm ) shorter in length and an inch wider .
It also has a wider front track that enhances the ride and handling .
Interior amenities , storage and flexibility
Inside , the Equinox features attention to detail – including a number of storage bins , such as an oversized glove box ; a closed storage bin in the instrument panel above the center stack ; and closed storage under the center armrest large enough for a laptop computer .
A " floating " center stack houses a multitude of ergonomic comfort and convenience controls .
Contemporary , ice - blue ambient lighting – featured within and surrounding the center stack , encircling the center - console cupholders and within the door pull cups – accentuates the cabin .
The front and rear seats , which include cloth and uplevel , perforated leather - trimmed offerings , were developed to help deliver best - in - class comfort .
The new Equinox retains its MultiFlex rear seat capability , which allows the seat to be moved fore or aft nearly eight inches ( 203 mm ) , for the best rear legroom in its class .
With the 60/40 - split - back rear seat moved all the way forward , the cargo area offers 31.4 cubic feet ( 889 liters ) of storage .
The Equinox 's cabin is notable for its quietness .

Everyone 's been there :
You just bought an expensive ink cartridge for your printer , you use it for a while , and then suddenly — much sooner than seems reasonable — your printer tells you that you 're either low on or out of ink .
Suspicious of the amount of ink wasted by adhering to the low ink warnings of popular printers , PC World hit the lab , testing just how much ink is left in " dead " cartridges .
The results :
Many manufacturer - branded ( OEM ) and third - party ( aftermarket ) vendor cartridges leave a startling amount of ink unused when they read empty .
In fact , some inkjet printers force users to replace black ink cartridges when the cartridge is nearly half full .
Advertisement
In most cases , printers were more apt to call it quits early on third - party cartridges .
Adding insult to injury , PC World illustrates just how expensive your ink is :
If you bought a gallon of the stuff over the life of your printer , you 'd have paid about $ 4731 for a liquid that one aftermarket vendor told us was " cheap " to make .
For some perspective , gasoline costs about $ 3 per gallon ( at the moment ) , while a gallon of Beluga caviar ( imagined as a liquid ) costs about $ 18,000 — surprisingly , only about four times as expensive as good old printer ink .

You can do a lot to offset high cost of printing — many of which we 've covered before .
First and foremost , you can always refill your ink cartridges yourself and save a ton of money in the process .
Software applications like previously mentioned HP Smart Web Printing and GreenPrint are designed to help you cut down on wasted pages .
If you really want to conserve , check out our guide to smart and easy ways to reduce your printing costs .
When possible , I suspect most of us continue printing until the results have visibly deteriorated after receiving low ink messages .
But for those of you whose printers refuse to print after you 're warned of low ink , this news is probably all the more frustrating .
How Much Ink Is Left in That Dead Cartridge ?

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Losing weight is easier when there is money on the line , U.S. researchers said on Tuesday .
Subway riders walk through the turnstiles while leaving the U.S. Open in New York September 4 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson
They said weight - loss programs that reward people with money -- and remind them of the cash they stand to lose if they fail -- provided a powerful incentive to lose weight compared with more conventional approaches .
Dr. Kevin Volpp of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine was looking for an effective way to treat obesity , a growing problem that carries serious health risks .
He said many weight - loss programs fail because people are being asked to make sacrifices now for rewards in the future .
“ We wanted to create a reward system which gave them rewards in the present , ” said Volpp , whose study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
Volpp and colleagues studied two kinds of incentive programs for weight loss .
One was a lottery - based design in which participants played a lottery and were allowed to collect their winnings if they met their weight - loss target .
The lotteries were running daily , and people were told what their winnings would have been if they had met their weight - loss target .
“ There is a very strong sense of loss aversion , ” the theory that people are highly motivated to avoid losses , Volpp said in a telephone interview .
“ The idea was to create a mechanism where loss aversion would help drive people ’s motivation , ” he said .
The other was a deposit contract , in which participants invested a small amount of their own money -- between 1 cent and $ 3 per day -- which they would lose at the end of the month if they failed to reach their goals .
People in this group also got a bonus if they met their goal .
“ You only received your reward at the end of the month if your weight was below the stated goal for the month , ” Volpp said .
The researchers assigned 57 obese but otherwise healthy people to one of these two groups or a control group , in which people were simply weighed at the end of each month .
All were aiming to lose 16 pounds ( 7.26 kg ) by the end of four months .
People in the incentive groups lost far more weight than those who got no pay for their efforts , with about half of the participants in each group meeting their weight loss goals .
People in the lottery program earned a total of $ 378.49 and lost about 13 pounds ( 5.9 kg ) , while people in the deposit group got $ 272.80 and lost 14 pounds ( 6.35 kg ) .
Those in the control group , who were merely rewarded by better - fitting jeans , lost about 4 pounds after four months .
Volpp said the studies were highly effective at producing short - term weight loss , but when the money stopped flowing , the weight began to creep back on .
“ We need to establish whether they can be effective in sustaining weight loss as well , ” he said .
Howdy y'all .
Nobody 's impervious to poor grammar , including myself .
I guess in reality one has to find a happy medium between ignoring it and mocking it ; something I think called " polite discourse . "
The internet , of course , is free from such a burden .
I made chocolate chip pancakes using leftover Halloween candy .

Ouch !
You could almost feel the hurt .
An American writer is unlikely to win the Nobel Prize in Literature , Nobel judge and permanent secretary Horace Engdahl told the Associated Press in an interview .
" The US is too isolated , too insular , " the Swedish historian and critic said .
" They do n't translate enough and do n't really participate in the big dialogue of literature .
That ignorance is restraining .
" You ca n't get away from the fact that Europe still is the centre of the literary world , not the United States , " he added .
It did n't take long for America 's book world to spring to the defense .
" You would think that the permanent secretary of an academy that pretends to wisdom but has historically overlooked Proust , Joyce , and Nabokov , to name just a few non-Nobelists , would spare us the categorical lectures , " said David Remnick , editor of The New Yorker magazine .
Remnick cited Roth , Updike , and DeLillo , along with " many younger writers , some of them sons and daughters of immigrants writing in their adopted English . "
Not one of " these poor souls , old or young , " Remnick said , " seem ravaged by the horrors of Coca - Cola . "
" Such a comment makes me think that Mr. Engdahl has read little of American literature outside the mainstream and has a very narrow view of what constitutes literature in this age , " said Harold Augenbraum , executive director of US National Book Foundation .
Even an unnamed " senior French publishing executive " came to the defense of the US in an interview with the Independent – although rather less vigorously .
Engdahl was " partly right but also fundamentally wrong , " he said , adding that " not all American contemporary literature is parochial or ignorant .... there are also excellent modern American authors . "
" Put [ Engdahl ] in touch with me , and I 'll send him a reading list , " suggested Augenbraum .
Of course , there have been a number of US writers who have been awarded the prize over the years , although some argue that that number is much smaller than it should be .
One - hundred - and - four writers have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature was first awarded in 1901 .
Of those 104 , there have been 10 US winners , starting with Sinclair Lewis in 1930 .
Most recently , Toni Morrison received the prize in 1993 .
This year , Nobel Prizes for physiology , physics , chemistry , peace , and economics will all be announced in October .
According to tradition , however , the Swedish Academy will set the date for its announcement of the Nobel Prize in literature later .
Each Nobel Prize includes a $ 1.3 million purse , a gold medal and a diploma .
The awards are handed out Dec. 10 , the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel 's death in 1896 .

Ian Bernard ( Freeman ) , host of Free Talk Live appeared in Keene , NH municipal court on Friday to answer a complaint regarding a couch on his tenant 's lawn .
As reported , judge Eward Burke ordered him taken into custody within seconds and removed to a separate courtroom , where he received 90 days for three contempt charges and 3 days for the couch .
Now , the Keene courthouse is reporting that Bernard returned to court this morning and had the sentences suspended on the three contempt charges , though the charges stand .
The support for Bernard that blossomed over the weekend was tremendous .
Websites 93days.com and jailedactivist .info sprung to life and chronicaled the various reports and information surrounding Friday 's events .
It now appears that the original complaint about the couch was politically motivated , initiated by a Keene bureaucrat in response to questions posed to her by Bernard on WKBK's Talk Back radio show .
I fear for future generations who are raised in such a constricting , inoffensive environment .
There 's gold in them thar PCs – not to mention silver , copper , aluminum and other valuable recyclables .
That fact , not a desire to save the planet , is now pushing the tech industry toward " greener " manufacturing and recycling practices .
It could mean that there 's an environmental silver lining to the mounting economic crisis :
Tough times are forcing companies to resort to recycling as a means of recouping costs .
These recycling measures are also good public relations in a time when consumers are increasingly eco-conscious – and they might even be good for the planet .
" We view this waste as a valuable resource , and recycling it is a far better use of it , " said Wes Muir , director of communications at
Waste Communication Recycle America , which is handling
Sony and LG 's recycling programs .
Several electronics manufacturers , such as Dell , LG and Sony recently partnered with recycling facilities to offer take - back programs for consumers to freely dispose of their gadgets .
Apple is particularly aggressive with its green message .
The company tags its latest line of MacBooks as " The greenest MacBook ever . "
While Steve Jobs sounds awfully humanitarian , his move toward greener tech is as much for Apple as it is for the environment , said Casey Harrell , a toxics campaigner with environmental group Greenpeace .
By making these gadgets safer to recycle , Apple , and other companies making similar decisions , is saving money by reducing the costs of recycling while benefiting from reusing old materials .
Recycling facilities disassemble old gadgets into different parts and sell salvageable materials to brokers , according to Muir .
Then , the brokers sell the recycled materials , such as plastics , gold and copper , to tech manufacturers to reuse in new gadgets .
Manufacturers are preferring this method because it 's substantially less expensive than purchasing newly mined materials .
Just how much a company saves varies depending on the type of gadget being recycled , but Harrell estimates that recycling old electronics could result in up to 4 - to - 1 cost savings .
" I do n't think these companies would be lobbying [ greener tech ] unless there was a financial incentive , " Harrell said .
" It 's not altruistic , and ultimately we do n't care .
We want the [ cleaner ] results , so if they 're able to make money off of this ... it 's a win-win . "
Other than saving money , the industry - wide shift toward cleaner tech is also being driven by new laws regarding electronic waste .
In 2003 , the
European Union passed the Waste from Electrical and Electronic
Equipment ( WEEE ) Directive
Act , which requires manufacturers to take responsibility for recycling their products after consumers discard them .
In other words , if Sony sells a TV to a European customer , Sony has to take the TV back and recycle it at the end of the device 's life .
While the directive is only directly affecting Europe , it 's spreading to the
United States and Asia , too :
Many big tech manufacturers operate internationally , and it'd be both inefficient and costly to make an eco-friendly product for Europe and a dirtier version of the same gadget for another country .
New rules regarding hazardous waste have also emerged in the United States
\– although they 're a bit less demanding than the EU's .
In 2007 , the
Environmental Protection Agency issued a rule probibiting the United States from exporting used televisions and computer monitors .
This is a small but important step :
Older displays contain high amounts of toxics , such as lead contained in cathode ray tubes ( CRTs ) – as much as several pounds per TV or monitor .
Tech companies are also marketing cleaner tech to retain positive public relations , as they 're feeling the heat from widespread , global concern over the disposal of electronics waste .
Currently , environmental groups are still fighting to eliminate e-waste exports to Asian countries .
The environmental group Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition ( SVTC ) claims the majority of U.S. e-waste – an estimated 20 million pounds – is collected for recycling and shipped to China , India , South Korea ,
Nigeria , Malaysia , Mexico , Vietnam and Brazil .
The problem ?
Many of the recycling organizations in these countries are in the " informal sector "
\– essentially junk dealers with very little money and few resources .
Illustrating the issue , a recent documentary by Current shows recycling workers in China disassembling old gadgets on top of piles of waste .
" We 've kind of won the overall war on the direction of chemical phase - out and waste collection , " Harrell said .
" Now we 're bickering about how much and how fast . "

( Adds analyst comment , paragraphs 6 - 7 )
NEW YORK , Nov 20 ( Reuters ) - Verizon Wireless VZ.N said on Thursday that some employees had gained unauthorized access and viewed a personal cell phone account held by President - elect Barack Obama that is now inactive .
An Obama aide said his voice - mail messages and e-mails were not breached in the incident .
“ We were notified yesterday that employees had accessed the records of an old cell phone no longer in use , ” the Obama aide said .
“ No voice or e-mails were listened to or read . ”
The company said the device in question was a simple voice phone , not a Blackberry or other device designed for e-mail or other data services .
In a statement , Verizon Wireless President and Chief Executive Lowell McAdam apologized to Obama and said all employees who had had access to Obama ’s account , whether authorized or not , were put on immediate leave with pay .
Telecom analyst Michael King of Gartner said that a telephone employee accessing billing information could likely see the numbers a customer had called , how long conversations with those people were and when he called them .
King said he could not recall a high - profile case where an employee had unauthorized access to records and that recent public cases involved company outsiders finding ways to check other people ’s records .
Verizon said it will soon impose disciplinary action against those who accessed Obama ’s account improperly .
Asked to disclose exactly what kind of information was viewed , the duration and frequency of the unauthorized access , Verizon Wireless spokesman Jeffrey Nelson declined comment beyond the company ’s statement .
Verizon Wireless is a venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group Plc. ( Reporting by Phil Wahba ; Additional reporting by Sinead Carew , Editing by Todd Eastham and Philip Barbara )

For all of its 21st - century advancements , the shipping industry drags a lot of old technology around .
Giant vessels are so sophisticated these days that they require only a handful of crew members .
But the ships still burn a thick , dirty sludge called bunker fuel while at sea and slurp diesel to keep the lights and air conditioning running while in port .
Inefficient yard tractors and cranes guzzle fuel and spew exhaust as they stack containers .
And tugboats , pound for pound the most powerful vessels on the water , waste most of that muscle idling or cruising .
Now , as seaports try to raise their environmental standards , some companies are finding business opportunities .
Advertisement
Foss Maritime Co. of Seattle , for instance , has developed the Prius of tugboats , which consumes less diesel and generates less pollution by using batteries for all the vessel ’s low - power needs .
Foss calls it the world ’s first hybrid tug and expects to deliver it to San Pedro harbor early next year .
The stakes are high , said William Lyte , co-founder of Technoplex Group in Los Angeles , a consulting firm that helps entrepreneurs market new technology .
“ The ports have about $ 5 billion in expansion projects they want to do , and they ca n’t do it without mitigating the impact of pollution .
Green systems will have to be in place to get these projects approved , ” Lyte said .
“ Companies from all over the world will be trying to sell that kind of technology here , so California businesses have to be prepared to compete . ”
Those companies will discover what Foss learned .
The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach , the largest cargo container ports in the nation , are willing to serve as testing grounds , business incubators and venture capitalists .
About $ 1.35 million in development costs for the Foss hybrid tug came from the two ports and the South Coast Air Quality Management District .

“ We asked for help to offset the increased capital costs of doing this , ” said Susan Hayman , vice president of environmental and corporate development for Foss .
“ Partnerships are supposed to help jump - start new ideas , and this one is working exactly the way it was supposed to . ”
Geraldine Knatz , executive director of the Port of Los Angeles , said she hoped other businesses would bring their best ideas to the busy harbor .
“ The concept of a hybrid tug really gets to the heart of our technology advancement program , where both ports have set aside a funding pool for the development of clean - technology applications in a maritime environment , ” she said of the $ 15 - million , five - year program .
“ So it ’s very exciting for us to see this concept that Foss brought to us come to fruition . ”
The Foss tugboat , which is being built in a factory in Rainier , Ore. , will be based at Southern California ’s twin ports for five years in exchange for the funding help .

Outwardly , it looks much like other tugboats .
Inside , the tug is so different that it will be able to operate like a regular work boat while using less fuel and expelling less exhaust .
The idea had been kicking around Foss ’ offices since 2006 , based on the knowledge that tugboats tend to run on full power only 7 % of the time and waste their 5,000 - plus horsepower by idling 50 % of the time .
Knowing that railroads were moving to electric propulsion , Foss initially looked at switching locomotives , which are used to move trains inside rail yards .
There was one big problem .
“ The batteries were too heavy .
They would have sunk the boat , ” Foss Chief Engineer Rick McKenna said .
Advertisement
The solution came from the oil industry .
Aspin Kemp & Associates of Owen Sound , Canada , had expertise with “ ultra - deep - water ” drilling rigs that are held in position with “ dynamic positioning thrusters ” instead of anchors .
The thrusters have to power up quickly to keep the rig in place .
The engineering firm designed a way to run the diesel engine and the electrical motor generator through the same drive shaft , McKenna said , enabling Foss to switch to smaller batteries and smaller diesel engines .
“ It drives like a normal tug , ” McKenna said .
The system ’s design would enable most existing tugboats to switch to the diesel - battery setup through a retrofit .
Foss is hoping that will be a key selling point .
Advertisement
Tests have raised expectations that turning hybrid would cut a tug ’s particulate and nitrogen - oxide emissions as much as 44 % .
That ’s enough to impress environmental groups that have been some of the ports ’ harshest critics .
“ Moving the ports ’ tugboat fleet toward hybrid technology is a benefit to both local residents and companies who do business at the ports , ” said Jessica Lass , a spokeswoman for the Natural Resources Defense Council .
“ It shows it ’s entirely possible to move the ports toward greener , hybrid technology that cuts down on toxic greenhouse emissions and diesel fuel that fouls our local waterways and bodies . ”
Foss has been in the tugboat business since 1889 .
But Heather Tomley , senior environmental specialist at the Port of Long Beach , said companies do n’t have to have a maritime background to gain the ports ’ attention .
One such landlubber is Advanced Cleanup Technologies Inc .
The 16 - year - old Rancho Dominguez company is branching out from its main work of mopping up hazardous spills to cleaning up the air .
Advertisement
Advanced Cleanup has used components from three other companies to develop a bonnet that can be lowered on top of a ship ’s smokestack , sending the exhaust through a cleaning system , Tomley said .
Such a device would be useful when a vessel is docked and has to keep its diesel engines running to power its systems , she said .
The bonnet , Tomley said , “ seemed to work very well , ” with initial tests showing emission reductions of more than 95 % .
Another California company cited by Tomley , Yorba Linda - based Vycon Inc. , has developed a flywheel technology that attaches to yard cranes .
The flywheel system collects energy as cargo containers are lowered and then releases it , helping lift containers .
That reduces the power the diesel engine has to supply , cutting fuel consumption and the release of pollutants .
Tomley said Vycon achieved more than a 25 % reduction in particulate emissions in California Air Resources Board testing .
Advertisement
Vycon has been watching sales of the $ 150,000 devices grow .
“ This year we have sold 38 machines , ” said Louis Romo , vice president of sales .
“ We sold five during all of 2007 , so that is a nice jump for us . ”

Why the Ugly Rhetoric Against Gay Marriage Is Familiar to this Historian of Miscegenation
Ms. Pascoe is Associate Professor and Beekman Chair of Northwest and Pacific History at the University of Oregon .
She is completing a book on the significance of miscegenation law in United States history .
We are in the midst of an attempt to ground a category of discrimination in the fundamental social bedrock of marriage law .
I would argue that it is virtually impossible to understand the current debate over same - sex marriage without first understanding the history of American miscegenation laws and the long legal fight against them , if only because both supporters and opponents of same - sex marriage come to this debate , knowing or unknowingly , wielding rhetorical tools forged during the history of miscegenation law .
The arguments white supremacists used to justify for miscegenation laws -- that interracial marriages were contrary to God 's will or somehow unnatural -- are echoed today by the most conservative opponents of same - sex marriage .
And supporters of same - sex marriage base their cases on the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , echoing the position the U.S. Supreme Court took when it declared miscegenation laws unconstitutional in the case of Loving v. Virginia .
Both sides confront the structures of marriage law exclusion that were also forged during the history of miscegenation , including , as I show below , the legal maneuvering over the seemingly minor bureaucratic practice of issuing marriage licenses .
A Brief History of Miscegenation Laws Today , when one out of every fifteen American marriages is interracial , many people are surprised to learn that laws prohibiting interracial marriage ( otherwise known as miscegenation laws ) were so deeply embedded in U.S. history that they would have to be considered America 's longest - lasting form of legal race discrimination -- they lasted far longer than either slavery or school segregation .
All told , miscegenation laws were in effect for nearly three centuries , from 1664 until 1967 , when the U.S. Supreme Court finally declared them unconstitutional in the Loving decision .
The first law against interracial marriage was passed in the colony of Maryland in 1664 .
It set a precedent that spread to the North as well as the South : Massachusetts , for example , adopted a miscegenation law in 1705 .
After British colonies turned into American states , they continued , one by one , to pass miscegenation laws , until , by the time of the Civil War , they covered most of the south , much of the mid-West , and were beginning to appear in western states , too .
Before the Civil War , there was only one significant challenge to this pattern of steady expansion .
In Massachusetts , in the 1830s , a remarkable group of radical abolitionists went out on a limb to argue that the Massachusetts miscegenation law contradicted the fundamental American principle of civil equality .
For more than a decade , abolitionists urged the Massachusetts state legislature to repeal the law ; finally , in 1843 , they succeeded .
Outside Massachusetts , however , laws against interracial marriage held firm right through the Civil War - - and beyond .
One of the first things defeated white Southerners did at the end of the Civil War was to pass new , and stronger , miscegenation laws as part of their infamous black codes .
Determined to overcome Southern resistance , the federal government built its Reconstruction program around the promise of equality , then embedded this promise in the language of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , which guarantees all citizens " equal protection " of the law .
During Reconstruction , the collision between the power of the federal government and the resistance of white Southerners was sharp enough to dislodge miscegenation laws in several Southern states .
In fact , during Reconstruction eight of the eleven formerly Confederate states abandoned their laws against interracial marriage .
But it soon became apparent that Reconstruction would not survive long enough to become a turning point in the history of miscegenation law .
As Reconstruction collapsed in the late 1870s , legislators , policymakers , and , above all , judges began to marshal the arguments they needed to justify the reinstatement -- and subsequent expansion - - of miscegenation law .
Here are four of the arguments they used : 1 ) First , judges claimed that marriage belonged under the control of the states rather than the federal government .
2 ) Second , they began to define and label all interracial relationships ( even longstanding , deeply committed ones ) as illicit sex rather than marriage .
3 ) Third , they insisted that interracial marriage was contrary to God 's will , and 4 ) Fourth , they declared , over and over again , that interracial marriage was somehow " unnatural . "
On this fourth point -- the supposed " unnaturality " of interracial marriage -- judges formed a virtual chorus .
Here , for example , is the declaration that the Supreme Court of Virginia used to invalidate a marriage between a black man and a white woman in 1878 : The purity of public morals , " the court declared , " the moral and physical development of both races .require that they should be kept distinct and separate that connections and alliances so unnatural that God and nature seem to forbid them , should be prohibited by positive law , and be subject to no evasion .
The fifth , and final , argument judges would use to justify miscegenation law was undoubtedly the most important ; it used these claims that interracial marriage was unnatural and immoral to find a way around the Fourteenth Amendment 's guarantee of " equal protection under the laws . "
How did judges do this ?
They insisted that because miscegenation laws punished both the black and white partners to an interracial marriage , they affected blacks and whites " equally . "
This argument , which is usually called the equal application claim , was hammered out in state supreme courts in the late 1870s , endorsed by the United States Supreme Court in 1882 , and would be repeated by judges for the next 85 years .
During the late 19th century , this judicial consensus laid the basis for an ominous expansion in the number , range , and severity of miscegenation laws .
In Southern states , lawmakers enacted new and tougher laws forbidding interracial marriages .
Seven states put miscegenation provisions in their state constitutions as well as in their regular law codes , and most raised criminal penalties to felony level .
In Florida , for example , the penalty for interracial marriage was a maximum of 10 years in prison ; in Alabama , 2 - 7 years .
Meanwhile , western states set off in a new direction by expanding the racial coverage of the laws .
A dozen states passed laws prohibiting whites from marrying American Indians ; a dozen more targeted Asian Americans ; nine targeted Filipinos .
Some states went even further .
Arizona , for example , prohibited whites from marrying " Hindus " and my own state of Oregon prohibited whites from marrying Native Hawaiians , or Kanakas .
Courts responded by expanding the racial coverage of the equal application claim , too .
Thus the Oregon Supreme Court declared that Oregon 's miscegenation law did not discriminate ( in this case , against Indians ) because , as the judge explained , it " " applied alike to all persons , either white , negroes , Chinese , Kanaka , or Indians . "
Between 1880 and 1950 , the regime of miscegenation law was at the height of its power .
The laws were in effect in thirty states -- every Southern state , the vast majority of western states , and several states on the border , like Indiana .
Those states that did n't have miscegenation laws on their books , mostly in the Northeast , boasted that they did n't need to , because opposition to interracial marriage was by then so deeply rooted that new laws were simply unnecessary .
The power of these laws was reflected in the variety of ways that the laws were enforced , civil as well as criminal .
Criminal prosecutions were by no means uncommon .
To give only one example , as political scientist Julie Novkov has recently shown , the state of Alabama prosecuted 343 people for the so - called crime of " miscegenation " between 1883 and 1938 .
In other states , prosecutions for interracial marriage operated in tandem with arrests for illicit sex ( that is , because interracial couples were forbidden to marry , they were subject to prosecution under fornication and adultery laws ) .
Throughout the South , the legal practice of enforcing miscegenation laws was shadowed by the vicious , extra-legal , practice of lynching .
The Role of Marriage License Clerks
It 's worth emphasizing that miscegenation laws were also enforced -- probably even more effectively -- through civil law .
Many an interracial couple managed to avoid attracting the attention of local police only to find their marriages challenged in other court proceedings -- in divorce and annulment cases , for example , in pension disputes , and especially , and repeatedly , in inheritance cases .
And the civil provisions of miscegenation laws were significant in another respect , too .
In the early twentieth century , when marriage licensing served as a kind of public health surveillance system , marriage license clerks were , in effect , assigned responsibility for serving as the gatekeepers of white supremacy , and they wielded this power with considerable effect .
Long after most public officials had discarded the blatantly racist justifications originally used to enact miscegenation laws , county clerks continued to refuse marriage licenses to interracial couples , claiming that they were merely carrying out the requirements of laws they were obliged to obey whether they wanted to or not .
Putting an end to the regime of miscegenation law was a long and difficult process .
Between 1913 and 1927 , the NAACP took the first step by fighting off a rash of attempts to enact miscegenation laws in northeastern states .
In the 1930s , a few especially bold couples took the next step by bringing marriage license officials to court in an attempt to challenge the racial classifications of miscegenation laws .
These challenges failed , but the fact that the suits were brought at all showed the gradual erosion of the notion that interracial sex and marriage were " unnatural . "
During World War II , when the social dislocations common in wartime led to interracial marriages at home and abroad , the NAACP , sometimes with the help of the Red Cross , tried an indirect approach , helping individual couples evade the miscegenation laws of their home states by directing them to marriage license officials in Northern states .
The Beginning of the End The first significant courtroom victories did n't appear , though , until civil rights groups began to support , strategize , and finance direct challenges to the constitutionality of miscegenation laws .
The first group to do this was the Catholic Interracial Council of Los Angeles , a small but remarkably effective pressure group founded in 1946 , which argued that miscegenation laws were a violation of the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom .
In the 1950s , the ACLU began to bring test cases , and the Japanese American Citizens League argued for the repeal of miscegenation laws in several western states .
Both groups marshaled all the arguments they could find .
They insisted that scientists no longer believed that the differences between the races were either " natural " or significant .
They maintained that interracial sex and marriage were perfectly natural , perhaps even especially tempting .
They argued that the only thing miscegenation laws really accomplished was to label otherwise long - term , committed relationships as illicit sex rather than marriage .
Finally , building on the arguments the NAACP 's Legal Defense Fund was making in its famous campaign against school segregation , they argued that the equal application rationale defied common sense .
Surely , they insisted , miscegenation laws were a blatant violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's guarantee of equal protection .
In 1948 , the Supreme Court of California took a giant step toward ending the regime of miscegenation law when it broke an sixty - five year string of post -Reconstruction judicial precedents and declared California 's miscegenation law unconstitutional .
Speaking for a deeply divided court , Justice Roger Traynor flatly rejected the shopworn claim that miscegenation laws applied " equally " to all races .
" A member of any of these races , " Traynor explained , " may find himself barred by law from marrying the person of his choice and that person to him may be irreplaceable . "
" Human beings , " he continued , " are bereft of worth and dignity by a doctrine that would make them as interchangeable as trains . "
" The right to marry , " Traynor insisted , " is the right of individuals , not of racial groups . "
Nineteen years later , in 1967 , in the case of Loving v. Virginia , the United States Supreme Court agreed , this time in a unanimous decision written by Chief Justice Earl Warren .
" There can be no doubt , " Warren wrote , " that restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause . "
The Loving decision spelled the formal end of America 's three - century - long history of miscegenation laws , though opponents of interracial marriage did n't give up overnight .
Alabama , for example , waited until the year 2000 to remove the miscegenation provision from its state constitution .
By and large , however , Americans adjusted remarkably quickly to the new judicial consensus that interracial marriage , like marriage itself , was , as Earl Warren had insisted in Loving , " a basic civil right . "
In the 1980s , when I first started studying the history of miscegenation law , it often seemed as if no one wanted to remember a part of American history that now appeared to be little more than an embarrassment .
Gay Marriage Historians tend to be uncomfortable making direct comparisons between the present and the past , and I 'm no exception to that rule .
It is important to remember that there are real differences in the case of gay marriage and so- called mixed marriages .
The situation of a lesbian or gay couple in 2004 is not the same as that of an interracial couple in the 1930s , when miscegenation laws carried criminal penalties , when whites were nearly unanimous in their condemnation of interracial marriage , and when the specter of lynching hovered over discussions of interracial sex .
The federal government is a much bigger player in the fight over same - sex marriage than it ever was in the case of miscegenation law ; in the case of interracial marriage , there was no federal equivalent to the Defense of Marriage Act .
Supporters of same - sex marriage face formidable obstacles , but in large part because of the successes of twentieth century opponents of miscegenation law , they have also found support that interracial couples in the 1930s would have envied -- from legal experts on the constitution , from county clerks in Oregon who recently decided that rather than discriminate on the basis of sex , they would refuse to issue any marriage licenses at all ( to opposite - sex or same - sex couples ) , and even from the justices of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts , who cited the Loving case repeatedly in their Goodridge decision .
If the campaign for same - sex marriage succeeds ( and I hope , very much , that it does ) , it will be not only because of the efforts of lesbian and gay activists but because of the civil rights advocates ( black , white , Asian American and American Indian ) who spent so much of the twentieth century working to put an end to American 's three - century tradition of miscegenation laws .

Great article !
I posted a link to it on my facebook Page ; Inter- racial Couples for Same - Sex Marriage .
I am a part of an inter-racial couples and I believe we need to declare bans on same - sex marriage unconstitutional as we did with Loving .
Please visit and " like " my page if you agree to show support http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=6195&id=114099548632459&saved#!/pages/Inter-racial-Couples-for-Same-sex-Marriage/114099548632459

I think this is a very interesting writeup .
However , I would find it very useful to have more footnotes , especially to court decisions where these laws were upheld .
It would be similarly useful to have references to religious and political leaders and their statements on interracial marriage so that the parallels to the gay marriage debate can be more easily drawn ( and debated fairly ) .
Stating as fact that religious opposition to interracial marriage mirrors their opposition to gay marriage today is a very strong claim , I am not sure have made your case with the meager documentation you have provided .
That is not to say that such documentation does n't exist , simply that I do n't see it here .

A ban on gay marriage looks a lot like one of those junk laws that do n't make sense unless you 're some fundamentalist screwball , a knight of the Ku Klux Klan , or just plain off your head on angel dust .
Yeah , probably a bit blunt , but really , bans on female actors , bans on witchcraft , bans on blasphemy , bans on interracial marriage , bans on un-american activities ( ????????? ).
The main arguements for a ban on gay marriage I 've seen are " Because God said so , " ( disputed and should n't the First Amendment thing about ' no law picking sides in the great question of what God said ' make that one ineffective ? ) , it 'll be bad for any kids they adopt or have ( what makes you so sure all married couples want kids ?
You want a ban on childless marriages too ?
Maybe something saying " have at least N children in C years or your marriage will be dissolved " ?
And kids are sawn off faeces by nature ( something schools need to be better at dealing with anyway if you want a better society ) , you do n't need to have gay parents to draw attention , so protection from ridicule do n't work either , ) or it'll make marriage somehow less special ( What , like having the earth orbit the sun makes us earthlings less special ?
Also , brace yourself , but :
We 're not even at galactic centre , we 're way out on this arm of stars off to the edge of the Milky Way , ) or it'll aid tax cheats who want to file jointly ( Bit of a stretch , you file jointly , and your personal possessions are legally co-owned by your partner , not to say people wo n't enter these things failing to consider that , but if that 's going to remain a problem with straight marriage ...
I do n't know , how does banning gay marriage help exactly ? )
Try and prove this ain't a junk law , because right now , that 's all this ban looks like :
Even more useless junk .
Richard Kramer - 5/28/2005
As a mathematician , and not a historian by any means , I can only give a lay person 's view of this .
But are n't those opposed to same sex marriage depending on some of the very same laws passed to prevent interracial marriages ?
I 'm thinking here of that old 1913 law ( unenforced for decades until reciently ) in Massachusettes that is aparently preventing same sex marriages from becoming widespread nation wide , delaying widespread challenges to DOMA , by preventing out of state gay couples from marrying there .
Aparently , this law was one of several so - called " Jack Johnson Laws " passed in response to the 1912 arrest and 1913 conviction of former Heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson for violation of tha Mann Act , for crossing state lines with a white woman , who I believe he later married .
It seems that the opponents of same sex marriage are content to not only use the same rhetoric that is used by opponents of interracial marriage , but even the very same laws .

Steven Horwitz - 11/8/2004
One further thought here , re : the 14th Amendment .
I think it was a mistake to use that line of legal reasoning to get to the decision in Loving ( and Roe for that matter ) .
Although the substance of the argument of the anti-miscegenation crowd was wrong , the logic of " equal protection " being satisfied was n't totally warped .
The problem with the language of " equal protection " is that it does open itself to that view , and the anti-gay marriage folks have used it again .
Why not get to the heart of the matter , which is this :
The right to marry , " Traynor insisted , " is the right of individuals , not of racial groups . "
An alternative strategy would be to look to the 9th Amendment 's protection of " unenumerated rights " , which is also the implicit logic underlying Lawrence , and then combine that with the equal protection clause ?
The right to marry is an individual right , even though it is not explicitly enumerated ( the 9th ) and the 14th prohibits states from excluding any group of people from that right .
The first case to mention the " right to marry " ( Meyer v. Nebraska ) lists it along with a bunch of other rights not explicitly in the constitution .
Backing this with the text of the 9th amendment could get advocates of legalized same - sex marriage where they want to go .
Frankly , if you 're going to use the 14th amendment , it 's the " privileges and immunities " clause that makes more sense because that phrase , as Randy Barnett argues in * Restoring the Lost Constitution * had the same meaning as the " unenumerated rights " of the 9th amendment .
All of this stretching and tugging for penumbras in these cases and Roe could be avoided by a much more straightforward recognition that the founders knew there were rights people had that were not listed in the Constitution , and that the " presumption of liberty " was such that the state had to meet a high burden of proof to show why such rights would be trumped .
Peter C Frank - 11/6/2004 " Section 1 .
All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside .
No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . "
Please show me where , in the Fourteeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , it states that the discussion regarding equal protection under the laws is limited to the right to vote .
Cutting out the middle of the sentence , the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is , essentially , " No state shall make or enforce any law which shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . "
Period .
Perhaps you are thinking of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which covers the voting rights of individuals with respect to race / color ?
While you are correct that Congress was granted the power to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment ( by appropriate legislation ) , that provision was included because , if you will refer back to United States Constitution , enforcement of the law is a power reserved to the executive branch of government ( i.e. , the President ) .
The fact remains that the United States Supreme Court is well within its rights to interpret the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment and was correct in its upholding as unconstitutional the anti-miscegenation laws in its Loving v. Virginia decision .
Two things I would correct with respect to Dr. Pascoe 's work , which I commend as a succinct review of the anti-miscegenation laws that prevailed in our history :
First , these laws are more correctly referred to as " anti-miscegenation " as they proscribed miscegenation .
The definition of miscegenation is " Cohabitation , sexual relations , or marriage involving persons of different races . "
( The American Heritage ® Dictionary of the English Language , Fourth Edition . )
Second , until last year 's Supreme Court decision in Lawrence v. Texas ( 2003 ) , there were , in fact , severe criminal penalties ( up to 20 years ) for engaging in sexual relations ( one definition of miscegenation ) among gay partners .
The Supreme Court overturned Texas ' anti-sodomy laws , proscribing consentual conduct with a punishment of a prison sentence of up to 20 years ( for which the petitioners were convicted , for consentual conduct in the privacy of their bedroom ) .
Many states had already decriminalized consentual sodomy by the time the Supreme Court reached its decision striking down as unconstitutional laws against consentual sodomy in 2003 , just as many states had already decriminalized miscegenation by the time the Supreme Court reached its decision striking down as unconstitutional laws proscribing miscegenation in 1967 .
There are , in fact , many , many more parallels that can be drawn between the anti-miscegenation laws and anti-same - sex marriage movement , which , perhaps , could be further explored in a more detailed paper examining the relationship therein .
Bruce Baker - 8/23/2004
I think it is the 15th that specifically mentions voting rights .
The 14th say , " No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . "
As well as a bunch of other stuff .
the supreme court will have to decide if sexual preference is a protected " class " under the equal protection clause

chris l pettit - 4/24/2004
This is an area of contention for many in constitutional debate today .
In the area of human rights , economic , social and cultural rights have been universally recognized outside the US to be inalienable , and nations have the responsibility to protect them .
THere are those in the US that may protest such things , but the fact is that there are no truly " negative " rights , as you have spoke of them .
The right to vote ?
Well , the government is required to set up polling stations , educate the public on their voting rights , provide public financing for candidates , etc .
Right to free speech , fair trial , privacy ... all these rights have positive aspects .
I would challenge anyone to name a right that does not involve the government taking some sort of substantial positive steps .
The truth is that there is little or no separation between positive and negative rights , so i would submit that the argument is a non-sequiter .
Would Jefferson have favored a judiciary that was allowed to overturn state decisions ?
Well , to be honest , i do n't know .
There are indications that he would give the weight of the federalism argument to the Union , which would mean allowing the Court to overturn fallacious state statutes , such as the marriage statutes .
Then there is his famous argument with Marshall over the issue of judicial review .
While , at the time , he favored a strong executive ( some would claim he liked the idea of a monarchy of sorts ) , his later letters to France indicate that his view on the issue had softened a bit and that , while not totally in favor of judicial review , had seen the positives that it could contribute to the national stage .
One must remember that the dispute in Marbury v. Madison was a highly politicised one and the reasons why Jefferson and Marshall clashed were due to the fact that Marshall , while ruling for Jefferson in the case , handcuffed him from enforcing the ruling , essentially placating Adams .
In my view , this is one of if not the most brilliant case in the history of the Supreme Court and sets the stage for exactly what we currently debate , the ability of the courts to interpret the Constitution and determine the validity of legislative acts .
I think history has shown strict constructionalism to be a father naive way of looking at the document .
We could still be looking at slavery of sorts in Jim Crow laws and separate but equal statutes today , as well as many other sorts of discrimination and prejudice .
The Constitution is written in a vague and broad manner as to encourage interpretation and flexibility .
I do n't understand how one can state that the document should be malleable , but not fluid and changing with the times ... how is this possible ?
If it is malleable and able to be used for different purposes , it would therefore be able to be used to deal with the changing social advancements .
In reference to the other courts that you do n't worry about Jesse , I would submit that you should .
Can you think of much that takes place in the world that does not have some effect internationally ?
Indeed , the Commerce Clause of the Constitution recognizes and has been interpreted to demonstrate how , when it comes to economic transactions ( of which marriage licenses are one ) things that happen in certain states carry weight in other states and effect their commerce .
The Constitution gives the federal government the ability to control this .
Its relevance to the international courts ?
Just that we need to pay attention to other nations and their judiciaries because the US does not exist in a bubble .
if you want to take an isolationist stance , that is acceptable , but very naive .
The influence of world opinion and foreign judiciaries is not only limited to economic developments , but extends to all arenas of law .
If one chooses to ignore international law and foreign judiciaries , one ceases to be able to make a case for US interventionism , the " war on terror " as anything but a law enforcement action to enforce US criminal statutes , etc .
It is in these areas that taking an " I do n't care and can choose to listen when I want to " approach becomes hypocritical , contradictory and therefore irreputable .
The Constitution was written to protect white male slaveowners that did not want to completely give up their power ... and the Federalist papers come out and say it ( give me a day or two to find the quote ) .
In addition , the writings of Madison and Hamilton are those supporting the privileged elite while making sure the masses dont get too out of control .
hence the reason why the whole debate took place as to whether the Constitution should be easily changed .
Madison and Hamilton come out and claim that it should support the status quo and not allow society to change it easily .
Thus , even though they might not have liked it , it had to be left to the judiciary to be able to interpret the Constitution in order to make sure it was current with the times .
Ironically , if Jefferson had won the argument with his opinion that there should be a convention ever 30 odd years to examine the consitution and change what needed to be changed , the argument that the courts have not right to make such determinations on issues like gay marriage might have a bit more merit ( something that really stirs up Federalists if you get to debate one in person ) .
Can you find me someone in the Senate that does not belong to the top 10 % of society ?
Name one ... in the House ?
Name a federal judiciary member that is not ?
And you still want to claim that government is not serving the interests of the top 10 % of society ?
I do n't understand why it is so hard to realise that if the only people who can afford to run for office are those with a bunch of money ( the top 10 % ) then we are guaranteed a choice between the top ten versus the top ten every election .
So the interests of the top ten are those represented .
it seems like simple logic to me .
The homosexual argument is also a red herring .
I encourage you to read Matthew Ridley 's text " nature via Nurture " .
you will find that the environment versus biology debate does not even matter .
In addition , you would not call religion biological , yet religious persecution falls under the realm of civil rights .
Again ... the denial that homosexual rights do not qualify as civil rights is illusory thinking .
it gets to the point of acceptence and equality , the essence of the 14th amendment .
Do you want to " convert " all the gays ?
How silly of an idea is that ?
They are entitiled to the same equal rights as the rest of us under the Constitution .
The Massachusetts Court in the Goodrich case determined that , and if the Supreme Court was n't as partisan as it is , it would determine that .
Oh ... that was also my point about the European and South African courts ... they are appointed in an objective manner ... unlike our ouwn worthless judiciary ( and I say this as a lawyer and law scholar ) .
One last thing ... thanks for the polite response Jesse .
i would encourage you to take a look at the South African Constitution and judiciary .
They are much more progressive and objective than our own .
many of the problems you describe are true in South Africa , however the nation is only ten years removed from one of the worst situations the world has seen and has much to rebuild and redistribute .
i should note the " doctrine " of " free market " economics has not helped the situation , instead creating a black elite to join the white elite that got to keep all the money they made off apartheid , leaving the rest of the country in the same desperate situation .
however , the South African judiciary has recognised the importance of ESC rights , something our own judiciary should do and work into our own constitutional framework .
I can claim some degree on knowledge on the issue due to the fact I have lived studied and worked in SOuth Africa .

Jesse David Lamovsky - 4/23/2004 " Madison , Hamilton , Hay et al " ...
My mistake .
I meant , of course , John Jay .
Perhaps I had John Hay , Lincoln 's secretary , on the brain .
Jesse David Lamovsky - 4/23/2004
Certainly , the Founding Fathers believed in the Constitution as a malleable document - some of them , at least .
In the case of Madison , Hamilton , Hay et al , this ca n’t be denied .
But the opinions of the original Federalists on issues like tariffs , mercantilism , internal improvements , ca n’t be treated as legally binding .
Only what is actually in the Constitution can be considered as such .
In addition , the interests of the Federalists in centralizing power in the Federal government mainly centered on economic issues - not social or moral issues .
Moreover , it is n’t as if Federalists were the only people who showed up in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 .
Many of the states ( and their representatives ) were reluctant to sign onto the Constitution in the first place , believing it gave too much power to the Federal government .
And as late as 1861 it was accepted as a given in many areas that the states had a perfect right to abrogate their ties with the federal government and secede from the Union !
Would men like Jefferson and Mason have agreed to a “ flexible ” Constitution that allowed judges to overturn state laws willy - nilly , particularly in cases of personal relationships ?
That allowed the Federal government to reach into every area of social life ?
I doubt it very much .
The Constitution was never meant to be a document that granted positive rights to individuals ( the “ right ” to healthcare , the “ right ” to a living wage , the “ right ” to marry , etc. ) .
It simply enumerates what the Federal government can , and more to the point , what it can not do .
Frankly , I think this whole business about a “ living Constitution ” is , to a degree , a smokescreen , designed to shroud this document ( which is , after all , written in plain English , and can be easily understood by any literate adult ) in an ambiguity it does n’t really possess .
Either way , I can only read what is written in the document , and go on that .
The 14th Amendment specifically mentions only voting rights - the rights of freedmen to participate in the republican process .
It does n’t mention social relationships , or even legal contracts .
And no offense , Mr. Pettit , but I care not a whit for what the European Court or the South African Constitutional Court thinks of our judiciary .
Certainly there is nothing in the Constitution that allows Supreme Court justices to use the decisions of foreign courts as precedents ( despite what Ms. Ginsburg has said on this issue ) , and their opinions are irrelevant here .
Besides , considering the state of South Africa these days , maybe they ought to concentrate on tidying their own house , and not worrying about whether or not we ’re still in the “ Stone Age ” on issues of equal rights .
And the Constitution , as written , protects the natural rights of ALL individuals , not just the “ top 10 % of society ” .
That sounds like the old “ Constitution as a document designed to protect only rich white slaveowners ” argument .
That ’s a dog that wo n’t hunt with me .
The civil rights argument , as applies to homosexuals , is a problematic one as well .
The main difference between African - Americans and gays is biological - blacks cannot choose what they are , while in the case of homosexuality , this might be a biological condition , and it might not be - we just do n’t know yet .
I know one thing - no black man can call himself “ white ” until he ’s 44 , and at that point “ come out ” , and become “ black ” , ( as was the case with Bishop Gene Robinson ) , and instantly become part of a favored minority group .
Come with proof that homosexuality is biological and beyond the control of human beings , and we ’ll talk about civil rights , Mr. Pettit .
But we do n’t know that yet .
And I ’m not in favor of overturning religious and cultural traditions that have served us very well in this country , traditions that I respect very much , based on what might simply be a lifestyle choice on the part of a tiny minority .
In short , I ’m skeptical about how well the civil rights argument applies here .
There is way , way too much ambiguity in the case of gays to treat them as a separate minority group , in the same way blacks or Asians or Hispanics are minority groups .
In addition , we can point to cases in American history where the basic rights of African - Americans were clearly abridged - were , in fact , enforced by law .
There is no equivalent to the old black codes , or Jim Crow , in the case of homosexuals .
Certainly gays have been shunned socially at times - I wo n’t argue with that - but there ’s nothing illegal about this , or even inherently wrong .
People have a right to their own mores and traditions , even if you find them retrograde and reactionary .
I simply ca n’t support a government that forces people to subsidize lifestyles that counter their own religious beliefs and traditions .
It ’s bad enough that Christian citizens are forced to pony up for legalized abortions .
Now gay marriage , too ?
You talk about minority rights .
What about the rights of Christian Americans ?
Certainly you have some good points , Mr. Pettit , and I ’m gratified with the politeness and civility of your post .
You have illuminated aspects of the Constitutional argument that I had n’t thought of , and I thank you for that .
But I do n’t believe your arguments invalidate mine - mine being that the 14th Amendment , as written , says nothing about social relationships , and therefore , the Supreme Court has no right to interfere in state laws governing these relationships , particularly in the case of homosexuals , who may be a minority group deserving of civil rights - and who may not be .
We ’re just going to have to agree to disagree .
Paul Noonan - 4/23/2004
Actually , I was forgetting that Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment calls for the representation in Congress to be reduced for any state that restricted sufferage of adult males for any reason other than participation in rebellion or criminal convictions .
This implicitly recognized the authority of the states to restrict suffrage based on race as long as they accepted the reduction of their Congressional delegations .
Of course , as you point out , the right of suffrage of blacks in the South was routinely denied for a century until the 1960s and the Congressional delegations of those states were never reduced , just as the Fifteenth Amendment remained unenforced .
Hans Vought - 4/23/2004
In the case of state constitutional amendments , it depends on how the legal issue is framed .
If , as most Democrats seem to be arguing , marriage is a " state 's rights " issue - that is , an issue left to state control under federalism - then the state constitution , not the federal constitution , controls .
For example , in the 1991 Hawaii case Baehr v. Anderson , the state supreme court initially ruled in favor of the gay plaintiffs , but after the state amended its constitution , the state supreme court made a final ruling in Dec. 1999 that the new amendment made the plaintiff 's complaint moot .
Ben H. Severance - 4/23/2004
In one sense , I see your point .
Section 1 of the 14th defines citizenship as theoretically all inclusive .
But citizenship in the 19th Century did not automatically make you eligible to vote .
States determined voter qualifications , as Section 2 of the 14th makes clear ( a section designed to encourage southern states to enfranchise blacks ) .
In drafting the 14th , Congressional Republicans were thinking in terms of codifying civil rights , particularly those of the freedmen , not the political rights of suffrage and office holding .
However , with the 15th , as you rigthly point out , black suffrage is " explicitly " guaranteed , though the world of Jim Crow rendered the amendment largely irrelevant .
chris l pettit - 4/22/2004
When I mention Amendments in my above post I meant state Amendments such as the one envisioned in Massachusetts violating the federal Constitution .
I realise that I was not specific enough nor did I define what I was speaking of in a clear enough manner .
Mr. Vought is quite right in his statement about federal amendments ... another key aspect of the checks and balances system .
If the federal Marriage Amendment were to be passed , it would be part of the federal constitution .
Thanks Mr. Vought for clarifying that .
i am in your detriment .
CP
Paul Noonan - 4/22/2004 .. not the Fourteenth that relates specifically to voting .
Actually , the Fifteenth Amendment seems superfluous since the Fourteenth implicitly guarantees that voting rights are not to be abriged because of race , but the Fifteenth Amendment makes it explicit .
Hans Vought - 4/22/2004
Just to clarify , amendments become part of the Constitution .
An amendment to the Constitution cannot be overturned by the Supreme Court , as Pettit states .
On several occasions Congress and the States have amended the Constitution to " overturn " the decisions of the Supreme Court .
The 14th Amendment itself is one example , as Section I overturned the 1857 Dred Scott decision .
So if the proposed amendment reaffirming that marriage applies only to two people of opposit sex is passed by 2/3 of the House and Senate and ratified by 3/4 of the States , the only way to overturn it would be to pass another amendment repealing it ( as the 21st repealed the 18th ) .
chris l pettit - 4/22/2004
The Fourteenth Amendment was originally articulated to deal with voting rights problems ... Section one that contains the equal protection clause says nothing about voting rights whatsoever .
if only voting rights were to be governed by the clause , that is what would have been articulated .
While it is true that those bringing the 14th Amendment to the table were thinking mainly of voting rights , they framed the Amendment in such a sense that it could be utilised for other purposes .
Flexibility of usage is a key aspect of many Constitutional provisions , for those articulating them realise the problems of getting stuck with too many static provisions .
CP
chris l pettit - 4/22/2004 ... and state their own political interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment .
Unfortunately , they are a bit off ... and overly narrow strict constructionalism is also not the best pursuit either if you want to actually progress through history instead of being left behind .
The Founding Fathers were quite clear in articulating that the Constitution was to be a fluid and ever changing document that was to be developed according to changes in society .
The Court in Loving was not the first to expand the application of the 14th Amendment beyond voting rights .
The Fourteenth Amendment , while mentioning voting rights , was designed to apply the Bill of Rights to the all law , federal and state , whereas previously the Bill of Rights only applied to federal law .
The Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment is identical to the clause in the 5th Amendment .
There is also the important difference between the procedural and substantive aspects of the 14th Amendment .
Federalists ... who favor a weak judiciary in favor of a strong executive and legislature , have problems with the substantive aspect due to the fact that the courts can legalize crimes that should not have been criminalized in the first place ... and actually allow the Constitution to be the fluid and changing document that it was designed to be .
It is in this was that the judiciary plays its vital role in the checks and balances system , and protects those vital rights articulated in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights from being trampled by misguided legislative decisions made by certain states .
The courst also give those individuals not in the top 10 % of society that is actually represented within the legislatures a chance to have their voices heard and rights protected .
Were the legislatures truly representative and everyone had a voice in said legislatures , Federalists would have an arguable point .
But given the fact that most individuals do not have their interests represented in our duopoly , the judiciary is a necessary outlet to protect those rights .
The right to idividual liberty becomes the key turning of when , rather than whether , due process should be applied .
Since we are a common law country and rely on precedent , we rely on judges to interpret existing law and societal , historical , and cultural movements ( where legal cases are truly decided ) to determine how the law applies to certain cases .
THose wanting less judicial interpretation and a weaker judiciary are welcome to consider civil law juridictions such as Germany .
This being stated , the courts have made flawed decisions at times ( the Dred Scott decision , separate but equal , upholding sodomy laws , striking down gay marriage ) , but eventually have come around ... historically much faster than legislatures .
It was legislatures and executives that failed to integrate and recognise civil rights and fail ( ed ) to recognize gay rights .
It is unfortunately the case in this nation that the only true progress made in the field of human rights or civil rights is motivated by social movements and established in law by the judiciary interpreting the rights articulated within the Constitution .
If legislatures choose to amend the constitutions , state or otherwise , after these decisions , that is their prerogative , but the amendments are also held to the scrutiny of the existing COnstitution and are invalid if they contradict the existing Constitution ( hence the reason why the marriage amendment would not be upheld even if it were passed ) .
Unfortunately , our judiciary has become so politicised that different partisn views dictate the decisions of a majority of justices .
This is very problematic , as we have seen during the current crisis regarding the extremists ( Scalia , Rehnquist , Thomas ) on the Supreme Court and the fact that Bush will be able to appoint more extremists in the same line if he is re-elected .
THe process needs to be designed so that judges are not politically appointed , but are chosen by a panel of individuals chosen from all sectors of society .
it would also help if judiciary positions were not limited to lawyers , but also legal historians and sociologists in order to get away from the strict positivist interpretation of law that is currently dominating US legal thought and leading us backwards instead of forwards .
The equal protection clause is very key as well since we are dealing with civil rights .
All of the marriage laws are blatant violations of this clause by denying equal rights to homosexuals .
As with slavery , the reasoning is about the unnaturalness and tradition ... the usual crock of bs .
The question with this clause becomes whether it can be satisfied by civil unions ... something that precedent demostrates was not possible with " separate but equal " laws .
Would the same stigma attach ?
I am not sure , but I suspect that it would .
The court would have to engage in a balancing test to determine whether the protection of the rights of homosexuals and the risks that they would be discriminated against was greater or lesser than the " traditional " definition and stereotyping of marriage .
With an objective and human rights based court , this issue would not be a problem ... which is why the European Courts and South African Constitutional Court see this as a ridiculous case and cant believe that the US is still in the Stone Age on it .
By the way ... as an aside ... the Chief Justice in the Goodridge case is a South African expatriate and brilliant woman .
The equal protection clause makes no mention of race ... reading " any person ... "
By the way ... the whole Congress issue ?
Section 5 states that COngress shall have the power to enforce this article .
Huge difference between interpret and enforce .
The judiciary interprets the article ... and has throughout history .
The Congress can decide not to enforce the judiciaries decisions ... and there have been many instances , particularly during the civil rights movement , that judicial decisions were disobeyed ... but eventually everyone complied ... as always happens .
history keeps going ... either hop on or get run over .
One more thing I should mention in terms of civil unions and the 14th Amendment that is an open question that will have to be raised if civil unions go through : the Court has interpreted the 14th Amendment to enable the prohibition and abolition of practices that may not be unconstitutional in and of themselves , but lead to an unconstitutional purpose ( see voting poll tests , etc ) .
If civil unions lead to an unconstitutional discrimination against homosexuals , the Court may be asked to allow gay marriage because of it .
I am not saying that this is the case , and arguments can be put forth on both sides since it has not been put into wide enough practice to determine .
it may not even be determinable due to the fact that it might be a social stigma or attitude that is discriminatory ... an even tougher thing to examine .
If one examines the history of the usage of the 14th Amendment and the clauses within it , one can see the problems with politicising the judiciary .
The political makeup of the Supreme Court has led directly to how narrowly the Amendment has been interpreted , regardless of precedent .
This leads to an even grayer line of determination and results in less certainty as to when the 14th Amendment is applicable .
This current Court is one of the most regressive of our time .
The politicisation of the judiciary should be addressed .
I hope i clarified some of the misstaken political points raised in the above post .
CP
Jesse David Lamovsky - 4/21/2004
Problem is , we 're not necessarily talking about the rhetorical strategy of the anti-gay marriage camp .
What we 're really talking about is Prof.
Pascoe ’s ( progressive ) definition of the rhetorical strategy of the anti-gay marriage camp .
That 's a different thing altogether , and it behooves the question : why bother ?
Why should anti-gay marriage advocates change their rhetoric at all ?
First of all , many of these folks are arguing from a religious standpoint , and I would n’t expect anyone coming from that perspective to water down their beliefs just to temporize the debate .
Besides , progressives by and large much have their minds made up as to the “ bigotry ” and “ homophobia ” of their opponents , so why bother pandering ?
We see where it got George W. Bush : he ’s been sucking up to the left since he took office , and he still gets slammed as a “ racist ” , a “ homophobe ” , and , most absurdly , a “ far - right conservative ” .
Also , the interpretation of the 14th Amendment that compelled the Supreme Court to overturn miscegenation laws in Loving v. Virginia is , in fact , an erroneous one .
Aside from the fact that the “ Equal Protection Clause ” refers specifically to voting rights , and not the “ right ” for two men , or two women , to get hitched , it is up to Congress , and only Congress , to “ enforce , by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article ” .
Not the Supreme Court .
I make this argument not as a supporter of a Defense of Marriage Amendment , nor as a fan of miscegenation laws ( God forbid ! ) .
I simply believe that federalism is the best way to approach this issue .
But I would bet my dog and lot that one of these days , not so far off in the future , the Supreme Court will unconstitutionally strike down DOMA acts in the states and nationalize federally protected homosexual marriage , employing this flawed view of the Equal Protection Clause .
This is exactly what happened with Roe v. Wade .
Which further begs the question : why bother ?
If we already have an idea that the Supreme Court is going to use an ( intentionally ) flawed interpretation of the Constitution to further the agenda of gay - marriage advocates , than again , what does the " rhetoric " of their opponents matter ?
After all , gay - marriage opponents are right on the Constitutional issues involved , and progressives are wrong , but that obviously does n't make a difference .
David Lion Salmanson - 4/21/2004
I do n't think Pascoe is attacking anti-gay marraige advocates .
Rather , she is pointing out that their rhetorical strategy is likely to lose in courts now because that rhetoric has already lost in court before ; the use of Loving as a precedent in the current cases holds the argument together .
If I were anti-gay marraige , I would take away from this article the necessity of changing rhetorical strategies if I were seeking success .
Wonder what Russell Arben Fox and the folks over at Times and Seasons make of this ?
Hans Vought - 4/21/2004
Of course historians can draw conclusions and have opinions .
Rhetorical analysis is fine , but she does not contextualize the use of rhetoric in the current debate .
Her point is obviously to suggest that supporters of the traditional heterosexual definition of marriage are intolerant bigots .
Attacking your opponents ' character rather than answering their arguments is the definition of ad hominem .
Consider the case in reverse : a conservative might write an article showing that Marxists ( or some other conservative bogeymen ) supported racially mixed marriages , thus implying that supporters of homosexual marriage are all Marxists .
Either way it 's a logical fallacy .
Jonathan Dresner - 4/21/2004
Actually , that 's not what she 's discussing at all .
What she 's very clearly described is the parallel rhetoric used by anti-miscegenation and anti-gay marriage partisans , and suggesting that the logic that was flawed in the mid-20th century might still be flawed in the early 21st .
Lots of other historians have discussed the rise and fall of laws against male homosexual behavior .
Remind me again , why can't historians draw conclusions and have opinions ?
Informed , reasoned opinions ?
Why can everyone else use historical arguments ( " 2000 years of sanctified heterosexuality .... " ) but historians can't ?
Hans Vought - 4/21/2004 Dr. Pascoe 's succinct history lesson on miscegenation laws was very good .
However , she does not demonstrate any connection between miscegenation laws and laws banning homosexual unions .
Instead , she implies that since opponents of interracial marriage were vile racists , opponents of homosexual unions must be vile homophobes - and most likely racists , too .
This is a misuse of history to conduct what is , in essence , an ad hominem attack .
Instead of countering the arguments of those who support the traditional definition of marriage , she calls them names , masking her logical fallacy by using a lengthy but largely irrelevant history lesson .
Whatever one 's views on the controversy may be , surely it is not too much to expect that professional historians will not twist history to support their views .
Why not discuss the relevant history - i.e. , laws regarding homosexual practices ?
David Lion Salmanson - 4/21/2004
Except the scarcity argument does n't work in the American Southwest where the Navajo maintained - and continue to maintain - a matriarchal culture .
Jonathan Dresner - 4/21/2004
Indeed , the increase in single - parent households in urban / minority populations is at least as much caused by as a cause of the rising incarceration rate ( note : not rising crime rate , because any crime whose definition has remained more or less constant and for which we have decent records is dropping , as they have for at least a century ) which Mr. Tyrka cites as a symptom of non-marriage .
And I 'm increasingly familiar with Pacific traditions , which , while different from Western and Asian ones , nonetheless preserve some very powerful patriarchal elements .
The argument about scarcity and resources , though , is interesting , in that it suggests the possibility of radically divergent relationship patterns once scarcity has been ameliorated .
And that 's what we 're seeing : patriarchy and mandatory , exclusive heterosexual marriage , having served their historical purpose , are now obsolete ?
That 's remarkably materialistic argumentation from a cultural traditionalist .
Name Removed at Poster 's Request - 4/20/2004
" Yes , I could just as easily have said that , but I did n't because I recognize , as apparently you do n't , that family structure was a mutually beneficial arrangement for both parents and children . "
So I guess you have no problem with two married gay parents raising children ?
Your arguments all work against keeping otherwise committed longterm same sex couples with children from marrying .
" All you have to do is look at the burgeoning prison population of violent criminals to see the results of single parenthood combined with a milieu bereft of meaningful values . "
You have n't proven cause and effect here .
I think the burgeoning prison population is more due to the orgy of prison building since the late 1960s , the lengthening of sentences for existing crimes , the changing of previous misdemeanor into felonies , as well as the legislation of new crimes to convict people on , as well as our country 's moralistic , puritanical , punitive drug war .
Robert Henry Tyrka Sr - 4/20/2004
That I " could just as easily have said Marriage historically has been used by societies as a way to maintain male control over women and children , who were considered assets to developed and denied rights of property and independence , which explains the prevalance of polygamy and the acceptance of divorce for infertility "
is true .
Yes , I could just as easily have said that , but I did n't because I recognize , as apparently you do n't , that family structure was a mutually beneficial arrangement for both parents and children .
The old shibboleth about maintaining male control with all of its attendant evils shows up predominately in societies where basic necessities were in short supply -- as they continue to be in the great majority of patriarchal societies today .
If you look at societies where this has not been the case -- especially in the Western and South Pacific , you can often see very different patterns of male / female / child behavior .
Much the same kind of behavior differentials can be seen in other mammals -- a study of sea lions in California , as I recall , was particularly illustrative of the change in male behavior toward both his male peers and his harem when food was scarce contrasted with it when the food supply was more than sufficient .
I must say that all this half - baked , feminist - generated twaddle about the evils of male control in marriage gets to be rather tiresome after a few decades .
I 'm surprised you did n't tell us that a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle .
" Until you study the long - term effects of single parenthood in an environment that is accepting rather than condemning ( as the US is ) , you do n't really know that it 's a bad thing . "
You obviously have little if any awareness or experience of black inner cities , or white rural poverty areas to make such a claim .
We are growing ever larger populations of uneducated , and , horrible dictu , uneducable people who have been " raised " by a sometimes - there parent and an indulgent society in such a manner that many have become vicious sociopaths .
All you have to do is look at the burgeoning prison population of violent criminals to see the results of single parenthood combined with a milieu bereft of meaningful values .
Jonathan Dresner - 4/20/2004
You assert that " Marriage historically has been used by societies as ways to confer priveleges on male and female bonding in order to reinforce the attempt to have a secure environment for offspring that have , for mammals , such a long maturation process . "
You could just as easily have said " Marriage historically has been used by societies as a way to maintain male control over women and children , who were considered assets to developed and denied rights of property and independence , which explains the prevalance of polygamy and the acceptance of divorce for infertility . "
Your Scandanavian study is only convincing if you already think that marriage is necessarily a good thing : until you study the long - term effects of single parenthood in an environment that is accepting rather than condemning ( as the US is ) , you do n't really know that it 's a bad thing .
And , being free individuals , whether or not it 's a thing with bad results may not actually determine whether we should make it a matter of law .

It is not known where the giant Lego figure came from
Enlarge Image
A Dutch artist is thought to be behind the mysterious appearance of a giant Lego man on Brighton beach .
The 6 ft - tall ( 1.8 m ) red , green and yellow figure has the slogan " No Real Than You Are " painted on the front .
Brighton resident Peter McNiven said he had spotted the figure in the sea while walking to work this week .
A spokeswoman for Lego said the artist responsible , Ego Leonard , would be exhibiting artwork in London in the coming weeks .
A Lego man with the same slogan appeared on a Dutch beach last year .
Mr McNiven , 32 , who works for a digital marketing company , said : " I just happened to stumble across him on Wednesday morning .
" I took a couple of pictures because it 's not something you see every day .
" There 's a lot of talk about him coming over from Holland to here , but there 's no tide marks on him . "
The Dutch Lego man was pulled out of the sea last year In August 2007 a giant Lego toy , bearing a close resemblance to the Brighton figure , mysteriously appeared on Zandvoort beach in the Netherlands .
The blue and yellow figure was pulled out of the sea and bore the same slogan " No Real Than You Are " .
A Lego spokeswoman said : " This giant Lego figure [ in Brighton ] came as quite a surprise to us when we heard about it yesterday .
" We understand the person behind this is a Dutch artist called Ego Leonard who will be exhibiting in London in the coming weeks . "
A spokesman for Brighton and Hove City Council said the figure had been taken away .

STOCKHOLM ( Reuters ) - A French scientist who shared this year ’s Nobel prize for medicine said on Saturday he believed the transmission of AIDS could be eliminated within years .
Winners of the 2008 Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology , French scientists Luc Montagnier ( L - R ) and Francoise Barre - Sinoussi for their discovery of the virus that causes AIDS , and German scientist Harald zur Hausen for his work into the cause of cervical cancer , pose before a news conference in Stockholm , December 6 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Bob Strong
Luc Montagnier , director of the World Foundation for AIDS Research and Prevention , told a news conference together with this year ’s other winners for medicine that halting the transmission of AIDS would make it a disease much like others .
“ Our job , of course , is to find complementary treatment to eradicate the infection .
I think it ’s not impossible to do it within a few years , ” Montagnier said .
“ So I hope to see in my lifetime the eradication of , not the AIDS epidemic , but at least the infection , ” the 76 - year - old said .
“ This could be achieved . ”
Montagnier and Francoise Barre - Sinoussi , of the Institut Pasteur , shared half of the 2008 prize for discovering the virus that has killed 25 million people since the early 1980s .
There is no cure for AIDS , which infects an estimated 33 million globally , but cocktails of drugs can control the virus and keep patients healthy .
There is no vaccine either , although researchers are trying to find vaccines that either prevent infection or would control the virus so that patients are less likely to transmit it -- a so - called therapeutic vaccine .
Montagnier said he hoped such a therapeutic vaccine could be developed within about four to five years , noting he and colleagues had already been working on this for a decade .
German scientist Harald zur Hausen of the University of Duesseldorf won the other half of the 10 - million - Swedish - crown ( $ 1.2 million ) award for finding the cause of cervical cancer .
The three scientists said that since the announcement in early October they had found themselves constantly giving interviews and speaking with world leaders .
“ There ’s obviously a belief in many of the politicians and some other people ... that you know everything , which of course is nonsense .
But in a way indeed I think one cannot ignore this , ” zur Hausen said .
Barre - Sinoussi , who had come from Senegal following a meeting with the African country ’s president , agreed .
“ Of course I have the same feeling .
I think I feel that we have responsibility to try to influence , especially , the politicians . ”
She feared the global financial crisis could lead some countries to water down their commitment to the fight against diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis or malaria , so it was important Nobel winners tried to use their influence .
The three are in Stockholm for “ Nobel Week , ” when laureates come to the Swedish capital for a barrage of news conferences , interviews and events , culminating with a gala dinner which this year takes place on Wednesday .
Montagnier and Barre - Sinoussi expected to use the prize money to further their research .
They also said the award was important in that it shed a bright light on the issue of AIDS .
“ Still , 25 years after the HIV discovery , ( there is ) discrimination , stigmatization against HIV - infected individuals , even criminalization .
This is not acceptable .
This is really not acceptable , ” Barre - Sinoussi said .
Besides contributing at @ TheDailyWTF , I write DevDisasters for Visual Studio Magazine , and involved in various side projects including child rearing and marriage .
Fresh out of school , Maxim was able to score himself a pretty sweet entry level position in a small private bank .
Rather than being responsible for maintaining the company 's static phone book on the corporate intranet or some other stereotypical entry level thing , he was placed in the understaffed Publications department to do some surprisingly heavy impacting IT work .
The department 's job was to produce and distribute various financial reports including the most important one of all - the Recommendation List .
This list was considered mission critical for the bank as it contained the official recommendations of what stocks and bonds to buy or sell and was sent out to managers and customers alike .
A bad recommendation could make or break the financial managers , not to mention the customers whom invested their money with the bank , who made decisions based on this information .
At the core of the Recommendation List was the Great Excel Spreadsheet ( or " G.E.S. " as it was known internally ) .
Its existence was so crucial that it even had its own dedicated employee , Helen , the Report Editor .
Each week , the Helen 's dance would go like this :
First she would send the spreadsheet to a team of Analysts who would make adjustments based on their " insight " of the market .
Once returned to the Editor , she would then run a macro that would update stock and bond values from a data provider .
This spreadsheet would then be returned to the Analysts for re-verification .
If everything was in order , it would be sent to the print shop and then snail mailed to managers every week and to their private customers monthly .
With all of this back and forth , Management felt that this process was ripe for improvement .
So , armed with a copy of Access for the front end and a SQL Server account to handle everything on the back end , Maxim went to work .
Never Underestimate the Power of Yield
The original developer of the G.E.S. was long gone by the time Maxim showed up , but this was n't much of a problem .
Amid the ocean of financial mumbo- jumbo , he found good comments and descriptively named data fields .
From a technical perspective , everything was clear except for one field - Yield .
The information surrounding Yield was more cautionary than helpful .
The formula 's description , for example , simply read " DO NOT EVER ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THIS CALCULATION ! EVER ! " Looking for some useful information , Maxim turned to the analysts for some help .
" Oh , God ! " the lead analyst cringed , " you 're not touching the Yield !?!
Oh no no no , do n't touch that !
That 's the most important part of the whole spreadsheet ! ! "
After a bit more prodding , he learned that the Yield was the magic number that influenced the Analysts ' decision to recommend a stock or bond .
Thankfully , Maxim was able to port over the function that calculated the yield value alone and very soon , he was on his way to making his new application live .
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle ... of Copy - and - Pasting into Spreadsheets ?
With a month 's worth of experience under his belt , Maxim 's project was coming along quite well .
Everybody loved using the pretty Access front end with its drop - downs and he had created instead of the ominous facade of the Great Excel Spreadsheet .
Even Helen was satisfied since she now had more of purpose than pushing paper out week after week !
However , the joy was short - lived , as was revealed during an emergency department meeting .
The lead analyst started , " Maxim , we 're finding some discrepancies in the report .
Several values in what we 're finding to be random stocks and bonds are being grossly misrepresented . "
" How do you mean ? " asked Maxim .
" Point blank - we believe that YOU broke the Yield calculation and we 're two days away from sending out bad figures that could ruin the bank and its investors . "
After having to awkwardly sit through the rest of the meeting where " Plan B " ( resurrect Helen ) was discussed , Maxim got to work looking for a root cause .
Skeptical that the database would calculate some fields incorrectly , Maxim manually worked out the values by hand and found the problem and found the biggest shocker of all - some of the formulas in the original spreadsheet were wrong to begin with .
In going back previous editions of the spreadsheet , somehow , they managed to send completely idiotic numbers to their customers for three full years ( at least ) .
Not a single customer , not a single manager ever noticed the inconsistency for what were supposed to be trivial multiplications ; not a single one of them noticed that " The - most - important - figure - on - this - chart - we - base - all - our - decisions - on " was random garbage .
In the end , he found out that whenever Helen needed to create a new row , she would simply copy and paste some random row and then adjust the values .
At some point , however , she must have messed up and the spreadsheet ended up in a weird state , with formulas referring to cells in other rows , or sometimes even referring to nothing , creating a whole bunch of inconsistent values .
Excited at the chance to clear his name , Maxim revealed his findings to the lead analyst .
However , instead of relief , he only shrugged and responded “ Hmph ... well , we usually just use our gut for recommendations , anyway . "
Fed wo n't give info on nearly $ 2 trillion in loans
Fed wo n’t give info on nearly $ 2 trillion in loans
The Federal Reserve is refusing to identify the recipients of almost $ 2 trillion of emergency loans from American taxpayers or the troubled assets the central bank is accepting as collateral .
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in September they would comply with congressional demands for transparency in a $ 700 billion bailout of the banking system .
Two months later , as the Fed lends far more than that in separate rescue programs that did n’t require approval by Congress , Americans have no idea where their money is going or what securities the banks are pledging in return .
“ The collateral is not being adequately disclosed , and that ’s a big problem , ” said Dan Fuss , vice chairman of Boston - based Loomis Sayles & Co. , where he co-manages $ 17 billion in bonds .
“ In a liquid market , this would n’t matter , but we ’re not .
The market is very nervous and very thin . ”
Bloomberg News has requested details of the Fed lending under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act and filed a federal lawsuit Nov. 7 seeking to force disclosure .
The Fed made the loans under terms of 11 programs , eight of them created in the past 15 months , in the midst of the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression .
“ It ’s your money ; it ’s not the Fed ’s money , ” said billionaire Ted Forstmann , senior partner of Forstmann Little & Co. in New York .
“ Of course there should be transparency . ”
Federal Reserve spokeswoman Michelle Smith declined to comment on the loans or the Bloomberg lawsuit .
Treasury spokeswoman Michele Davis did n’t respond to a phone call and an e-mail seeking comment .
The Fed ’s lending is significant because the central bank has stepped into a rescue role that was also the purpose of the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , bailout plan — without safeguards put into the TARP legislation by Congress .
Total Fed lending topped $ 2 trillion for the first time last week and has risen by 140 percent , or $ 1.172 trillion , in the seven weeks since Fed governors relaxed the collateral standards on Sept. 14 .
The difference includes a $ 788 billion increase in loans to banks through the Fed and $ 474 billion in other lending , mostly through the central bank ’s purchase of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds .
Before Sept. 14 , the Fed accepted mostly top-rated government and asset - backed securities as collateral .
After that date , the central bank widened standards to accept other kinds of securities , some with lower ratings .
The Fed collects interest on all its loans .
The plan to purchase distressed securities through TARP called for buying at the “ lowest price that the secretary ( of the Treasury ) determines to be consistent with the purposes of this Act , ” according to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 , the law that covers TARP .
The legislation did n’t require any specific method for the purchases beyond saying mechanisms such as auctions or reverse auctions should be used “ when appropriate . ”
In a reverse auction , bidders offer to sell securities at successively lower prices , helping to ensure that the Fed would pay less .
The measure also included a five - member oversight board that includes Paulson and Bernanke .
At a Sept. 23 Senate Banking Committee hearing in Washington , Paulson called for transparency in the purchase of distressed assets under the TARP program .
" We need oversight , " Paulson told lawmakers .
" We need protection .
We need transparency .
I want it .
We all want it . "
At a joint House - Senate hearing the next day , Bernanke also stressed the importance of openness in the program .
" Transparency is a big issue , " he said .
The Fed lent cash and government bonds to banks , which gave the Fed collateral in the form of equities and debt , including subprime and structured securities such as collateralized debt obligations , according to the Fed Web site .
The borrowers have included the now - bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co .
Banks oppose any release of information because it might signal weakness and spur short - selling or a run by depositors , said Scott Talbott , senior vice president of government affairs for the Financial Services Roundtable , a Washington trade group .
“ You have to balance the need for transparency with protecting the public interest , ” Talbott said .
“ Taxpayers have a right to know where their tax dollars are going , but one piece of information standing alone could undermine public confidence in the system . ”
The nation ’s biggest banks , Citigroup , Bank of America Corp. , JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo & Co. , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley , declined to comment on whether they have borrowed money from the Fed .
They received $ 120 billion in capital from the TARP , which was signed into law Oct.
3 .
In an interview Nov. 6 , House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank said the Fed ’s disclosure is sufficient and that the risk the central bank is taking on is appropriate in the current economic climate .
Frank said he has discussed the program with Timothy F. Geithner , president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a possible candidate to succeed Paulson as Treasury secretary .
“ I talk to Geithner and he was pretty sure that they ’re OK , ” said Frank , a Massachusetts Democrat .
“ If the risk is that the Fed takes a little bit of a haircut , well that ’s regrettable . ”
Such losses would be acceptable , he said , if the program helps revive the economy .
Frank said the Fed should n’t reveal the assets it holds or how it values them because of “ delicacy with respect to pricing . ”
He said such disclosure would “ give people clues to what your pricing is and what they might be able to sell us and what your estimates are . ”
He would n’t say why he thought that information would be problematic .
Revealing how the Fed values collateral could help thaw frozen credit markets , said Ron D’Vari , chief executive officer of NewOak Capital LLC in New York and the former head of structured finance at BlackRock Inc .
“ I ’d love to hear the methodology , how the Fed priced the assets , ” D’Vari said .
“ That would unclog the market very quickly . ”

Politico is reporting that Rahm Emanuel has accepted the position of White House Chief of Staff in President - elect Obama ’s Administration .
The Illinois congressman , best known for being one of the architects of the 2006 Democratic takeover of Congress , has been dubbed “ Rahmbo ” by the media for the way he combines the high - energy style of his brother , Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel , with the Windy City machine politics of Chicago mayor and dynast Richard M. Daley .
Back in May , Congressman Emanuel spoke with Ryan Lizza at the annual New Yorker Conference about the Democratic primaries , Hillary Clinton ’s future , and — most notably , given today ’s news — what the first hundred days of the Obama Administration might look like .
Almost 80,000 asylum - seekers from countries described by the Foreign Office as dangerous and unstable have been refused refuge in Britain in the past five years .
The Government was last night accused of double standards forregistering alarm about 21 " major countries of concern " at the same time as refusing sanctuary to 77,000 of their citizens who fled persecution and bloodshed .
Refugees from turbulent nations such as Iraq , Afghanistan , Zimbabwe and Sudan are being turned down at the rate of nearly 40 a day , The Independent has learnt .
Since 2003 , more than 5,000 refugees from Democratic Republic of Congo , which is facing humanitarian disaster , have been told by the immigration authorities to return home .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Foreign Office 's most recent human rights report listed 21 " major countries of concern " whose citizens suffered persecution and discrimination .
Fifteen of them still have the death penalty .
The report warned of " widespread sectarian violence , lawlessness and violent insurgency " in Iraq , yet 13,131 Iraqi nationals have had applications for asylum in the UK turned down , including 1,090 last year and 520 in the first six months of this year .
Enforced removals of rejected asylum - seekers have begun to the Kurdish - controlled north of the country .
A total of 10,060 Afghans – much of whose homeland is run by the Taliban and local warlords – have been refused asylum , as have 7,525 Zimbabweans .
Although no Zimbabweans have been forcibly sent back since 2006 , the Government is fighting legal action to allow forcible deportations to resume to the country .
Paul Holmes , the Liberal Democrats ' justice spokesman , said yesterday : " This country has a proud record of providing refuge for people fleeing persecution but that tradition is being undermined .
It is staggering so many asylum applications are being refused for people from countries the Government admits it is concerned about . "
Mr Holmes added : " It is vital that Britain remains a beacon of freedom in a world of too many tyrants . "
A spokesman for the UK Border Agency said : " Britain has a proud tradition of offering refugee to those in genuine fear of persecution .
However , when an independent judge decides a person does not need asylum , we expect them to return home .
If they do not , we will enforce their removal .
Last year we removed a person every eight minutes .
Not everyone from countries where there is internal conflict needs our protection .
Each case is judged on its individual merits . "
But the Refugee Council 's chief executive , Donna Covey , said : " These figures show just how tough our asylum system is .
People claiming asylum struggle to get a fair hearing , despite coming from countries where human rights abuse is well - documented .
" This results in a growing number of people who are unable to return home as it is too dangerous , but who have no rights in the United Kingdom , so are left destitute , with an uncertain future , and unable to work and support themselves .
This situation is unacceptable .
The Government needs to take a more enlightened approach and offer people some sort of stability in the UK until it is safe for them to return . "
IOC to open India 's first hydrogen fuel pump
Danny Goodman in New Delhi | December 23 , 2008 10:24 IST
While conventional fuels are derived from crude oil or gas , the hydrogen fuel will use atmospheric air to synthesise pure hydrogen .
Indian Oil Corporation [ Get Quote ] , the country 's largest oil marketing company by sales , will open the country 's first hydrogen fuel - dispensing station in New Delhi next month .
The new - age pump will be set up in Dwarka .
" This is the culmination of a journey undertaken by IOC to diversify the energy mix of the country which ultimately results in energy security in the future , " says RK Malhotra , IOC 's executive director of research and development .
While conventional fossil fuels like petrol , diesel and CNG are derived from raw materials such as crude oil or gas , and mostly imported , the hydrogen fuel to be dispensed at this pump will use atmospheric air to synthesise pure hydrogen , which will be used to fuel vehicles .
The process is called " electroliser " technology .
Further , hydrogen - fuelled cell cars emit only water , while CNG vehicles emit noxious oxides that have been a concern to authorities ever since CNG was introduced as an automobile fuel in the capital .
The fuel pump , according to the company , will be set up at a cost of Rs 5 crore ( Rs 50 million ) , with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas funding the project in equal measure .
In 2006 , the government unveiled its National Hydrogen Energy Roadmap , outlining an ambitious target of converting one million vehicles to run on hydrogen .
The hydrogen fuel pump will dispense a mix of hydrogen and CNG roughly in the ratio 20:80 to a group of test vehicles comprising three - wheelers and passenger vehicles , mainly drawn from the government 's fleet .
General Motors India has confirmed to Business Standard that its next - generation fuel car under validation in the US -- the Equinox , which is a hydrogen - powered fuel cell car -- has been sounded out by IOC as a possible test vehicle in India in the coming months .
German auto major BMW also runs a fleet of cars on pure hydrogen across Europe .
" But the hydrogen we use is qualitatively different from the one India will experiment with .
So we are unable to participate in the rollout , " said the spokesperson of BMW India .
In the initial phase , we plan to target current CNG vehicle - owners in the capital -- public transport vehicle operators , goods carriers or passenger car owners because these vehicles can be run on hydrogen fuel mix with a little modification , " says Malhotra .
But use of 100 per cent pure hydrogen as auto fuel , Malhotra adds , will require a completely new engine .
Automobile manufacturers like Bajaj Auto [ Get Quote ] , Tata Motors [ Get Quote ] , Ashok Leyland [ Get Quote ] , Eicher Motors [ Get Quote ] and Mahindra & Mahindra have been involved in IOC 's efforts to test hydrogen fuel as a commercially viable fuel option in the country since 2006 .
In 2005 , talks were conducted between IOC and Bangalore - based Reva Electric Car Company ( RECC ) to fine - tune the hydrogen fuel technology for large - scale commercial use in the country .
No progress was made on the joint venture , says RECC .
In terms of mileage efficiency , cost of fuel and emissions , hydrogen is superior to CNG .
" It depends on how you use hydrogen fuel .
If used in a fuel cell car , the mileage efficiency obtained is twice that of a conventional internal combustion ( petrol ) engine , " says Chetan Maini , deputy chairman and chief technical officer , RECC .

On September 13rd , saturday morning , I assisted to Smalltalking group meeting .
This time , the meeting was in a coffee store , near the National Library buildign , here , in Buenos Aires , Argentina .
The group is small but enthusiast , and the talkings were interesting .
The first one to arrive was Leonardo de Marco , that is changing his job to dedicate full time to Smalltalk development .
Alejandro Reimondo , the “ chief ” of the group , was present .
Other members that assisted were Esteban Lorenzano , Diego Coronel , Matías Castilla and Juan ( no lastname , it ’s only Juan … :-) .
Alejandro is a reference in the field of Smalltalk development , around the world .
He is a chemist , that is working with Smalltalk since the eighties .
He is the founder of Smalltalking group , dedicated to the difussion and discussion of software development in an virtual object environment .
Esteban Lorenzano is teaching project architecture in information technology , in Universidad Tecnológica Nacional , Buenos Aires .
The page of the cathedra is :
http://apit.wikidot.com/
He is one of the founder of Smallworks , a new firm dedicated to software development using Smalltalk .
Diego Coronel has a company Informagine ( I guess the URL is http://www.informagine.com ) , that works with Smalltalk , here in Argentina , and actually , in México .
He is living between the two countries .
Matías Castillas is a student .
He cames from La Plata ( 70 km from Buenos Aires ) .
We missed another member from La Plata , Elvio Fernandez , that this time could not assist to the meeting .
There were many discussions , about the sustainability of open source development , the situation of education of object and architecture concepts in Argentina , the scarcity of human resources , in Smalltalk and other technologies , the rotation of the developers in companies , and the high salaries of junior developers , since the global situation and exchange rate in Argentina .
Alejandro commented his travel to Postdam , where he assisted to
Workshop on Self - Sustaining Systems ( S3 ) 2008
The Workshop on Self - sustaining Systems ( S3 ) is a forum for discussion of topics relating to computer systems and languages that are able to bootstrap , implement , modify , and maintain themselves .
One property of these systems is that their implementation is based on small but powerful abstractions ; examples include ( amongst others ) Squeak / Smalltalk , COLA , Klein / Self , PyPy / Python , Rubinius / Ruby , and Lisp .
Such systems are the engines of their own replacement , giving researchers and developers great power to experiment with , and explore future directions from within , their own small language kernels .
He was impressed by the work of Richard Gabriel , of IBM ( personal web page of Gabriel here ) .
You can see the work presented by Gabriel on Sustaining Self at :
http://www.tele-task.de/page50_lecture3625.html
But the star of the meeting , was Claus Gittinger , founder of Exept Software AG , and the creator of Smalltalk / X .
If you read his Linked In full profile , you ’ll find impressive works of Claus , since the eighties , in many companies in technologies .
In 1995 , he founded Exept Software , that :
provides solutions , advice and consulting services in the Telecom , Automation , Automobile and other technology oriented software areas .
Products include a state of the art OO - development framework and environment ( www.smalltalk-x.de) and frameworks for Test - and Qualitymanagement ( www.expecco.de)
Claus skills includes
Architecture , Project Management , Team Building and Leading , Coaching , Teaching , Testing , Test Management , Prototyping ,
Programming Language Implementation , VM design & Implementation , Compiler Construction , IDE Design & Implementation , GUI Framework Design & Implementation , OS - Kernel , OO , Smalltalk , ESUG
He is visiting my country , accompained by Félix Madrid , an argentinian developer that works for Exept in Germany .
It ’s Claus ’ first visit to Argentina , so I hope he enjoy the trip .
Smalltalk / X
Claus was a kindly man , that gaves us a complete demo of his product , Smalltalk /X :
Smalltalk / X , a product from eXept Software AG , is a complete implementation of the programming language , class library and development environment , providing :
An object - oriented programming language
Graphic development environment with editors , browsers , debuggers , GUI builders , etc .
Incremental compilation , byte code interpreter and dynamic ( just in time ) compiler
Static compilation and DLL generation , controlled by make - files
Comprehensive class library with ready - to - use modules for applications
Open Smalltalk source code Implementation of the language and class library complies with the draft ANSI standard and the industry standard .
Claus showed us the compilation of .st files directly to C language , in many platforms ( in Windows , you can compile the full system with Borland C or with Microsoft Visual C++ ) .
In this way , you can produce native executables from your Smalltalk project .
The features from the documentation :
ST/X Smalltalk is a complete implementation of the Smalltalk language .
Smalltalk / X is not based on the original ST - 80 virtual machine implementation and has been written from scratch .
However , the API , class libraries and language semantic is highly compatible to ST - 80 based smalltalks , such as VisualWorks , Squeak and others .
Smalltalk / X consists of both an integrated environment for program development AND a standalone smalltalk compiler ( 1 ) , which generates true machine code , shared code libraries and binary executables without a need for a so called “ image ” .
However , traditional image - based development is also supported and typically used for program development .
The programming environment includes editors , browsers , compiler and debugger and a large library of ready to use building blocks for application writers .
The standalone compiler generates true machine code from smalltalk source files – and can be used in a batch environment for production / delivery .
Features Language syntax and semantic compatible to the industry standard , including arbitrary precision arithmetic and automatic number conversion , exception handling , automatic memory management , threads , contexts , blocks ( block closures ) , metaprogramming and much more .
and , , , , , , and much more .
Additional ( mostly backward compatible ) extensions to the smalltalk language include : private classes , multiple namespaces , method privacy and end of line comments .
, , and .
A comprehensive threadsafe library of basic classes , including collection classes , numeric classes , streams , lightweight processes , exception handling and metaclass hierachy .
, , , , and .
Many user interface widget classes usable as building blocks for graphical applications .
These are fully ( non-polling ) event driven , multithreaded and support multiple displays , parametrized view styles , wide characters ( unicode ) and national languages .
, and support , , and .
Integrated programming environment including browsers with sophisticated refactoring and code generation support , GUI - and Menu builders , monitors and symbolic debugger for efficient program development .
with sophisticated , , and for efficient program development .
The additional Scripting Engine allows for command - line execution of smalltalk scripts .
These script files can be generated by any other editor , or alternatively by saving code from the IDE ( file - out from the browser ) .
Debug once – run everywhere !
complete Source - and Byte- Code compatibility between Unix and Windows versions .
Write your application once , run it without change on Win-NT , Linux , Alpha-OSF , Sun-solaris , HPUX , AIX , Silicon - Graphics IRIX ( 4 ) .

Binary files containing bytecode are portable across different machine architectures .
Dynamic ( just - in - time ) compilation from internal bytecodes to machine code ( 2 ) .
Except for the faster execution , this is transparent to the program or user .
Except for the faster execution , this is transparent to the program or user .
Batch compilation to real machine code for high performance production code , enabling the creation of binary object modules , class libraries or even shared class libraries .
Since more optimizations and code analysis are performed by this ( offline ) compiler , the resulting code executes faster – even when compared to dynamic compiled machine code .
Although static compiled machine code leads to bigger executables , the main advantage ( beside faster execution ) is the deterministic runtime behavior , which cannot always be guaranteed , if bytecodes are compiled dynamically at execution time .
In addition , big applications benefit from static compilation by the sharability of this compiled code among multiple applications , if shared libraries and / or shared text segments are supported by the operating system .
Applications can ( and do ) use a mix of precompiled machine code classes and interpreted bytecode classes – this is transparent to the program or programmer .
If supported by the operating system ( 3 ) , machine compiled modules can be dynamically added to and removed from the running system .
Since more optimizations and code analysis are performed by this ( offline ) compiler , the resulting code executes faster – even when compared to dynamic compiled machine code .
Easy creation of standalone executables and applications without graphical user interfaces .
This includes self - extracting installation code for windows platforms ( null - soft self installing executables ) .
Easy binding to C - language by allowing inline c code ( even inline assembler by using asm statements ) or via the ffi-callout mechanism to dynamically loaded shared libraries ( dll’s ) .
Sophisticated window interface combining event and process driven techniques .
ST /X supports multiple display devices – you can work with others in the same object environment , or write applications which serve multiple screens .
Your application can even run on a display - less host , serving multiple xTerminals or client applications via TCP connections .

Your application can even run on a display - less host , serving multiple xTerminals or client applications via TCP connections .
Additional protocol provided in the process , semaphore and processor classes , for better thread synchronization .
ST /X’s process handling includes additional mechanisms for recovery ( semaphore cleanup ) in exceptional situations , which is required in technical applications .
The ST /X’s process scheduler supports timeSlicing and dynamic thread priorities .
This allows for better response behavior in multiwindow applications and allows progress of background processes even in case of busy foreground processing .

Modern generational garbage collector , with dynamic adjustable newSpace , adaptive tenuring , both incremental and non-incremental collectors for the oldSpace , both copying and non-copying compressors for the oldSpace .
Object finalization via the WeakArray mechanism ; in addition , a number of other collection classes are available with weak references ( WeakSet , WeakDictionary etc . )
Both ANSI compliant class based exceptions and ( VW - ) backward compatible Signal - based exceptions are supported .
In addition , process specific and global default exception handlers are avaliable , to allow for non scoped , global exception handling .
In addition , process specific and global default exception handlers are avaliable , to allow for non scoped , global exception handling .
The byteCode interpreter and just - in - time compilers support multiple bytecode sets , for total integration of different languages into a single unified system .
In the current release , this feature is used to support execution of compiled Java code .
Claus showed the command line compilation of .st files to .c , and the on the fly compilation of byte codes in native code during development .
His implementation has departures from the classic Smalltalk , the product is not a direct reimplementation of the classic VM in other Smalltalks .
For example , the context calls are in the C stack , and if you add a new variable in a class , the previously created instances are not affected , and become instances of the old class definition .
become : implementation is tricky .
The VM does not uses an object table .
The garbage collector is a mark - and - sweep variant .
You can download the binaries of the system , or you can access and check out the company CVS ( be prepared to a big download : more than 20000 files , > 180 megas ) .
We asked Claus many details about the VM implementation ( I was the more curious in the group : I ’m very interested in VM implementation , since my AjTalk work in progress ) .
One interesting thing , is that in the .st files , we can include C language fragments .
For example , in Object.st file the basicAt : implementation has C language code included :
basicAt:index " return the indexed instance variable with index , anInteger ... " ... % { /* NOCONTEXT */ REGISTER int nbytes , indx ; OBJ myClass ; REGISTER char * pFirst ; REGISTER int n ; ... if ( __isSmallInteger( index ) ) { myClass = __qClass ( self ) ; indx = __intVal ( index ) - 1 ; n /* nInstVars */ = __intVal(__ClassInstPtr(myClass ) -> c_ninstvars ) ; n /* nInstBytes */ = OHDR_SIZE + __OBJS2BYTES__( n /* nInstVars */ ) ; nbytes = __qSize( self ) - n /* n InstBytes */ ; p First = ( char * ) ( __InstPtr( self ) ) + n /* n InstBytes */ ; ... } %
Claus showed the GUI environment , with workspaces , browsers , implemented directly in Smalltalk .
You can design GUI forms .
And the product includes an HTTP server , so you can create web pages with Smalltalk .
This part of the demo would deserve more space in this post , but you can check the product page for more info .
If you are interested in Smalltalk , you must visit the links page and documentation ( with free books on Smalltalk ) .
Thanks to Claus Gittinger , for sharing his time and knowledge , with our group .
It was a very interesing meeting .

As far as Junichi Tazawa is concerned , the most rebellious acts in his 22 years have been ignoring his homework and sneaking home after sunrise .
But as the first high - profile Japanese baseball prospect to turn down his nation ’s leagues to entertain offers from Major League Baseball teams , he has found himself straining relations between baseball entities on two continents , with accusations of talent raiding and defiance of decades - long understandings .
Many Japanese baseball officials are outraged that United States teams are courting Tazawa , a hard - throwing right - handed pitcher , because they insist it is long - established practice for amateurs like him to be strictly off limits to major league clubs .
Even some American general managers , including the Yankees ’ Brian Cashman , agree .
Major League Baseball officials maintain that the letter of their protocol agreement with their Japanese counterparts , Nippon Professional Baseball , does not forbid either league from courting amateur talent from the other ’s nation .
When one Japanese representative characterized the rule as a gentlemen ’s agreement during a meeting in New York , he was angrily rebutted by a Major League Baseball official , according to two attendees .
The Tazawa dispute extends beyond one pitching phenom and an interpretation of honor .
The Japanese major leagues have already seen established stars leave for American clubs , and amateurs following Tazawa ’s path away from those leagues could further hurt the leagues ’ long - term viability .
( Fortune ) -- Charles Ponzi would n't have thought much of Bernard Madoff .
Legendary Wall Street trader Madoff reportedly admitted last week that his success was an illusion , a fraud in which investors were paid not with the fruits of his own acumen , but with money from other investors .
Prosecutors quoted Madoff as telling an associate that his $ 50 billion business was " basically , a giant Ponzi scheme . "
Nearly 60 years after his death , Ponzi still has plenty to answer for .
But if the allegations against Madoff are true , he has tarred what little was left of Ponzi 's semi - good name .
That might come as a surprise to people who consider Ponzi synonymous with fraud .
But his tale is more complicated , and more nuanced , than that .
In 1903 , Ponzi was a 21 - year - old good - time - Carlo who had squandered his inheritance and washed out of the University of Rome .
He boarded the S.S. Vancouver with $ 200 , bound for Boston , but by the time the ship landed a cardsharp had relieved young Ponzi of all but $ 2.50 .
For the next 14 years , Ponzi roamed throughout the U.S. and Canada , seeking fortune and adventure but more often finding poverty and misadventure .
Clever and charismatic , at various times he was a hero -- saving the life of a young nurse by literally giving her the skin off his back for primitive , but successful , skin grafts -- and a criminal , serving time for passing a bad check and for helping fellow Italians to sneak into the U.S. from Canada .
When he returned to Boston in 1917 , Ponzi was still seeking his big break .
First , though , he fell in love with a beautiful woman named Rose Gnecco .
All she wanted was a little house filled with children , but Ponzi wanted her draped in diamonds and furs .
He tried and failed at several businesses .
Then , in late 1919 , he opened a letter from an acquaintance in Spain .
Pinned to the corner of the letter was an International Reply Coupon , an obscure little document that could be used to purchase a postage stamp at a fixed price in 63 countries that were members of the Universal Postal Union .
A lifetime of experiences coalesced in Ponzi 's mind -- among other jobs , he had worked as a bank teller and a clerk for an import - export company , and was a hobby stamp collector .
He knew that European currencies had been depressed by the Great War , so the value of the coupon would fluctuate depending on where it was bought and where it was used .
For instance , a person could buy 66 International Reply Coupons in Rome for the equivalent of $ 1 .
Those same 66 coupons would cost $ 3.30 in Boston .
If he could buy coupons in Rome and trade them in Boston , Ponzi could earn 230 % profit , before expenses , on every $ 1 .
In essence , Ponzi was thinking arbitrage .
Best of all , it was technically legal .
First , though , Ponzi needed seed money to buy coupons in bulk .
He hung out a shingle as the Securities Exchange Co. ( more than a decade before the creation of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission ) .
Thousands of investors responded to his promise of 50 % return in 90 days , soon doubled to 100 % in 90 days -- well within his theoretical business model .
Over the next seven months , Ponzi collected roughly $ 8 million ( about $ 100 million today ) and became one of the most talked - about men in the U.S. Imitators quickly followed , with one especially brazen group opening an office down the hall from his , prompting Ponzi to proclaim that he was the " real " financial wizard amid a sea of fakes .
Problem was , Ponzi never figured out how to translate his idea into reality .
There were n't enough International Reply Coupons in circulation to carry out the plan , and even if there were , the logistics would have been impossible .
Fifty - three - thousand coupons would have been necessary just to satisfy the first 18 investors .
In the meantime , he bought Rose a mansion , tooled around in a luxury car called a Locomobile , invested in banks and businesses , and brought his mother over from Italy .
Hardly the moves of a take - the - money - and - run swindler .
Indeed , there 's considerable evidence that , when he realized the coupons were unworkable , Ponzi was seeking a legitimate way to repay all his investors , ideally with the promised interest .
Soon , though , lethargic regulators were roused to action by a suspicious newspaper editor .
By August 1920 they proved that Ponzi had been repaying investors whose notes came due with money from more recent investors .
The move had long been called " Robbing Peter to Pay Paul , " but would henceforth be known as a Ponzi Scheme .
Why then would Ponzi -- whose fall took him from pinstripes to prison stripes -- look down on Madoff ?
Remember , Ponzi started with nothing and thought he had found a legitimate , if far - fetched , road to riches .
If the allegations against Madoff are true , he enjoyed great success but could n't deign failure .
Prosecutors say that when he began losing money , he indulged in greed and hubris to create imaginary profits .
He allegedly knew all along it was a scheme , and it only unraveled when the economy turned , his investors sought their money , and he tried to siphon off a last few hundred million for undeserved bonuses .
Sure , it bore a certain resemblance to Ponzi 's downfall .
But be fair and call it a Madoff scheme .
Mitchell Zuckoff is a professor of journalism at Boston University and author of " Ponzi 's Scheme : The True Story of a Financial Legend . "

The cuts will ultimately amount to a 40 % - 60 % cut in tech and sales staff .
Given AOL 's emphasis on Platform A , the third - party network strategy , and the cuts that have been made already , this strikes us as extreme .
Some cuts , sure .
50 % ?
We doubt it .

Apparently there is dissent at Yahoo over buyout price .

All this sounds plausible , in our opinion .
If we were Yahoo , we would be very focused on price .

A pony who was stuffed in the boot of a car and then dumped close to death on a roadside is making a full recovery .
Tiny Tim was rescued 12 months ago by the RSPCA after he was seen wandering along a quiet lane near Aberaeron .
He had been thrown from the boot of a car where all his four legs had been bound together .
The charity 's equine re-homing officer Sally Learoyd said : " We did not think he would make it because he was in such a state . "
She christened the pony after the sickly child in Charles Dickens ' story , A Christmas Carol and offered him a new home with her other horses .
" He was very very lame on two legs and very thin and dehydrated , " she said .
Tiny
Tim was very thin and dehydrated when he was found .
" He had rope sores on all four legs , was infested with lice , hungry and frightened . "
But thanks to months of loving care Tiny Tim is close to making a full recovery .
" Within six months he was a different pony , " added Ms Learoyd .
After treatment his appetite slowly returned and he is now fully mobile .
" There will always be a mark on his leg , to remind us of his hard times , but now , a year on from his rescue , his story has a happy ending , " she added .
" We 've all got very attached to him - he was tough and determined and he is quite happy and healthy to be a companion pony . "
RSPCA Cymru currently has 70 horses in its care .

WANTED : FOOLISH ECONOMISTS ….
House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) has made clear he ’s against the idea of a government rescue package in response to the financial crisis , but he ’s apparently having trouble finding economists who agree .
So , as Matt Stoller discovered , Boehner has gone online looking for help .
This plea was published this week on Boehner ’s website .
Attention Economists : Are You A Stimulus Spending Skeptic ?
A recent Associated Press article quoted transition officials for President - elect Obama as saying “ [ o ] nly one outside economist ” contacted by the President - elect ’s advisors had “ voiced skepticism ” about the President - elect ’s emerging plans for an economic “ stimulus ” spending bill with a price tag as large as $ 1 trillion , with the vast majority of that number going to new spending on government programs and projects .
House Republican Leader John Boehner ( R - OH ) is compiling a list of credentialed American economists who would like to add their voices to the list of stimulus spending skeptics .
If you are an economist who would like to be added to this list , you can join the list here and provide your comments .
Boehner knows he ’s against injecting money into a struggling economy , he just needs some credentialed conservatives to tell him how right he is .
Good luck with that , John .
This strikes me as a surprisingly embarrassing exercise .
First , why Boehner would oppose a stimulus right now is beyond comprehension .
Second , House Republicans should be able to make their case on the merits , and not point to a list of people Boehner found online to bolster a weak argument .
And third , is n’t this the kind of thing Boehner should do quietly ?
Call up the Heritage Foundation , AEI , and Cato , tell them you need some skewed reports showing that the economy ’s in pretty good shape and will get even better on its own , and tell the Wall Street Journal editorial page to repeat the talking points .
Is n’t that usually how this game is played ?
Let ’s put aside the fact that Boehner knows that the future of our economy is on the line , and he wants to stand in the way of the one thing the nation desperately needs .
Even looking past this , Boehner putting up an “ economists needed ” plea on his website is kind of humiliating .
A radio presenter was stunned when he answered a call from a listener who admitted she was once an unwitting cannibal .
DJ Graham Mack , from Teesside - based station TFM , had issued a challenge to listeners to find the most unusual thing they had eaten .
He had come up with the idea for Monday 's show to coincide with the return of TV's I'm A Celebrity .. Get Me Out Of Here ! , which started the previous evening .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
He took a flood of calls giving the type of exotic cuisine he had expected , including snails , sea urchins , monkey brains and dog and horse .
But when he received a call from a woman who once said she had eaten human flesh , he did not know what to say .
The caller , only known as Anthea , said : " I 've eaten human being . "
Mr Mack slowly replied : " Oh my goodness .
Right , all bets are off .
You can't beat that .
How come you were a cannibal ? "
She answered : " It was when I was a child when I lived in Africa .
We always went to the same butcher and then suddenly - we were there a couple of years - the meat started to get so much better .
" It was only when we moved back to England a couple of years later that we realised that the butcher had been arrested because he farmed little black girls . "
There were gasps in the studio .
Anthea added : " We did n't know at the time .
According to my mum it was very delicious but not very nice ( inaudible ) . "
The DJ replied : " So what do you think it was ?
You thought it was beef ? "
She said : " My mum said yes , she was just buying mince . "
There were further gasps before someone in the background said : " That 's horrific . "
Mr Mack added : " You are the winner this morning .
Goodness me .
I do n't even know what to say .
I had no idea we would get this call this morning .
Wow . "
Breakfast show producer Matt Bailey said : " The phone topic was ' what have you eaten ? '.
" We had people ringing up saying they had eaten snails , oysters , Play - Doh and soil , then out of the blue we get Anthea , who says she has eaten humans .
" It was one of the strangest calls we have ever had .
Graham was taken aback
" We were all in shock really at what we were hearing . "
" I am convinced he has got no idea what 's going on , " said Mr Chavez , who has nationalised large parts of the Venezuelan economy in recent years and is in negotiations to take over a Spanish bank .
It 's a simple question : " Why not try Jesus ? "
Equally simple is an opposite : " Why believe in a god ? "
Yet in the United States the first question is widely viewed as positive , or at least ordinary , while the second can be perceived as offensive and even hate speech .
This difference in reaction can't result from the structure of the statements .
They 're the same .
Nor can it be the tone .
Nope , it 's just the message .
Americans think it 's good to believe in a god and bad not to .
Furthermore , it 's good to tell everyone about your belief but bad to be just as open about nonbelief or doubt – especially during the winter holiday season .
Clearly , American nontheists can't get a break .
We in the American Humanist Association found this out first hand when we launched our Washington DC advertising campaign on November 11 with the slogan " Why believe in a god ?
Just be good for goodness ' sake . "
The venue was the sides , rears and insides of 230 of the city 's buses .
News coverage of the campaign generated an outpouring of phone calls and e-mails , mostly negative .
The largest number came directly to us but hundreds of complaints also came to Metro , the government entity that handles the city 's buses and subways .
One of the complainers expressed a wish ( or perhaps a prayer ) : " May all your atheist buses break down ! "
The sudden high volume of visitors to our special campaign website www.whybelieveinagod.org crashed our server twice .
Soon , the conservative talkshow hosts were clamouring to give us air time so they could argue against us and further rouse their audience .
And conservative Christian organisations not only denounced our efforts but encouraged their flocks to come bleat in our ears .
All this before our bus ads actually started to appear one week later .
By the beginning of December we 'd received 37,742 hits on our campaign website , logged 638 new members and received over $ 6,000 in new contributions .

Now , it seems , we have a couple of competitors .
The primary one , a local Catholic stay - at - home mother of four , decided to launch a counter campaign : same types of bus advertisements , same number of buses , same topic .
Her slogan ?
" Why believe ?
Because I created you and I love you , for goodness ' sake . "
The sentiment is signed , " God " .
The second competitor , Pennsylvania Friends of Christ , announced an ad on 10 buses that will read , " Believe in God. Christ is Christmas for goodness sake . "
This led to more newspaper stories and interviews on radio and television .
So much so that the company that handles bus advertising for Metro asked us this week if we would be so kind as to quantify all our results for them so they can inform would - be clients just how effective bus ads can be !
If all this buzz sounds a little familiar , it 's because it is .
Back in October a story in the Guardian went global about the Atheist Bus Campaign in London .
The planned adverts , written by comedy writer and Guardian contributor Ariane Sherine , were designed to read : " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . "
This was in reaction to a widely run Christian campaign threatening unbelievers with hellfire .
The British Humanist Association agreed to handle the financial contributions for this effort and was able to raise a whopping £ 120,402 in the first month .
Yet none of the adverts have actually appeared on buses , being slated to hit the streets in January .
Naturally , this excitement affected those of us planning promotional efforts for the American Humanist Association .
We 'd been trying to work up a splashy advertising campaign for Washington DC buses since July but had n't figured out an ad slogan we really liked .
So , when the news hit about the London plans , it became for us like an inspiration , a revelation – dare I say , a miracle ?
We accelerated our work , experimenting with a range of slogans , until finally settling on the one .
Then we contracted for the ad space , designed and printed the signs , bought display ads in the New York Times and Washington Post , and the rest followed .
The media is still heated up .
There 's more to come .
But we pause amid the flurry and fury to reach our hands across the pond in gratitude and solidarity with our likeminded friends in the UK .
The work of each enhances that of the other as we both let millions of atheists , agnostics and humanists know there are others like them and organisations to serve their needs and advance their ideals .
COMBAT OUTPOST LOWELL , Afghanistan 
The small stone castle , sandbagged and bristling with weapons and American soldiers , rises from a rock spur beside the Landai River .
Mountains lean overhead .
Once a hunting lodge for Mohammad Zahir Shah , Afghanistan ’s last king , the castle is home for a year for an American cavalry troop , an Afghan infantry company , a Navy corpsman and two American marines .
In the deadly contest for Afghanistan ’s borderlands , it plays what might seem a singularly unattractive role .
The position lies exposed near the bottom of a natural amphitheater deep within territory out of government control .
Insurgents hide in caves surrounding it and in villages nearby , operating unhindered almost to the castle ’s concertina wire and lobbing mortar shells toward it at will .
The steep slopes facing the walls are littered with shattered boulders and trees blown to splinters by the artillery and airstrikes with which the soldiers have fought back .
The Americans ’ mission is to disrupt the Taliban and foreign fighters on supply paths from Pakistan ’s tribal areas .
Col. John Spiszer , the commanding officer for the larger task force in the region , distilled how the mission often worked .
The American presence , he said , is a Taliban magnet , drawing insurgents from more populated areas and enhancing security elsewhere .

I ’m going to talk about an issue I had with remoting a few days ago when handling a specific scenario with a server and a client .
You know remoting is no longer the newest and cooler technology out there , since WCF is being there for a while , but AFAIK we do n’t have WCF yet on Mono , which means it simply does n’t exist for me and all you multi-platform people .
So , that ’s why I ’m still diving into the deep remoting implementation looking for answers .
Here ’s the problem : I have a simple scenario like the one in the following picture :
A client and a server working together , nothing special .
The server publishes a IRemoteCall interface using remoting and the following simple code ( not I ’m marshalling an existing object , with infinite lifetime , which is not the usual way of doing things unless you ’re an old COM cowboy ... :- P)
Ok , you see there ’s nothing special so far .
Just a few lines of code to implement the shared interface and the server code to start up the service and publish it .
The client is even simpler : Simple , right ?
It simply access the remote object ( specified at the command line , in my case something like tcp://beardtongue:6060/remote ) , makes a call , waits for a user key hit , and runs a second call .
The next listing is the remoting .
conf file used on the client :
And the one for the server : I ’m using TCP remoting channels in binary mode .
Well , needless to say it was not my start up scenario , but it is a simple example I wrote to study in detail a problem I discovered on a real deployment .
During normal operation both the client and server work smoothly , but I ran into problems when the machine running the server experienced an IP change .
How this happened ?
Well , I was traveling back and forth from the office to home , and I experienced problems with clients and servers running on the same laptop .
They worked at the office but I had to restart the client to continue working at home .
What was going on ?
The issue seemed to be related to the IP change the laptop was having at each network when connecting to a different DHCP server .
The scenario is better depicted at the next figure :
Let ’s see : I have a server up and running , then my client makes a first successful call .
My laptop is suspended and awakened with a new IP address .
Then the client tries a new call and it fails .
In order to reproduce it without having to reconfigure my DHCP server or traveling 20 km each time , I used the following commands on my XP laptop : ( Everything on a single line ) I changed from 253 to 245 each time I changed IP .
Why does n’t it work if I ’m using the server name instead of the IP ?
Should n’t it work ?
Then I run the test using the Mono runtime and ... it worked !!
In fact , I was playing with a custom TCP channel I wrote deriving from the Mono TCP channel ( implementing SSL and some other tuning ) and it was working too ...
So the problem with the .NET implementation is somewhere in the TCP Channel , not the remoting stack .
After some study I found out the following : inside the Mono TCP channel implementation there ’s a small class named ReusableTCPChannel which in turn implements a property named IsAlive .
The IsAlive property makes a call to : which basically checks whether the underlying socket is still valid each time it is retrieved from the internal TCP channel socket cache .
When the server ’s IP changes and the client tries to run the next call it detects that the socket is no longer usable and creates a new one .
This is not happening on the .NET stack ( I ’m talking about 1.1 , did n’t check whether it is solved on . NET 2.0 or 3.5 ) and the initial socket is reused to issue the next call , and simply raises an exception after a few seconds when it ca n’t reach the server anymore .
The problem could be probably fixed somewhere inside the remoting library , maybe at the SocketCache .
GetSocket method , where the RemoteConnection is retrieved from a HashTable and the underlying socket is used but never checked .
Fortunately it ’s not an extremely common scenario for server applications , but if it happens to you try to grab another TCP channel ( use the one from Mono ) to get it fixed .
Women who suffer a type of severe heart attack were less likely than men to survive the first 24 hours in a hospital , a new study has found .
Female heart attack patients overall were less likely to receive timely treatment with aspirin or certain heart drugs , therapy to restore blood flow , or angioplasty to open blocked arteries , the authors also reported .
The study appears in today ’s issue of the medical journal Circulation , which is published by the American Heart Association .
Researchers at the University of California , Los Angeles and elsewhere reviewed data on treatments and outcomes from more than 78,000 patients admitted to 420 hospitals between 2001 and 2006 .
The data were gathered by hospitals using an online tool to track patient care .
Libertarian Anarchism : Responses to Ten Objections
by Roderick T. Long by Roderick T. Long
Thanks to Revi N. Nair for transcribing this talk from the 2004 Mises University .
I want to talk about some of the main objections that have been given to libertarian anarchism and my attempts to answer them .
But before I start giving objections and trying to answer them , there is no point in trying to answer objections to a view unless you have given some positive reason to hold the view in the first place .
So , I just want to say briefly what I think the positive case is for it before going on to defend it against objections .
THE CASE FOR LIBERTARIAN ANARCHISM
Problems with Forced Monopoly
Think about it this way .
What ’s wrong with a shoe monopoly ?
Suppose that I and my gang are the only ones that are legally allowed to manufacture and sell shoes — my gang and anyone else that I authorize , but nobody else .
What ’s wrong with it ?
Well , first of all , from a moral point of view , the question is : why us ?
What ’s so special about us ?
Now in this case , because I ’ve chosen me , it is more plausible that I ought to have that kind of monopoly , so maybe I should pick a different example !
But still , you might wonder , where do I and my gang get off claiming this right to make and sell something that no one else has the right to make and sell , to provide a good or service no one else has the right to provide .
At least as far as you know , I ’m just another mortal , another human like unto yourselves ( more or less ) .
So , from a moral standpoint I have no more right to do it than anyone else .
Then , of course , from a pragmatic , consequentialist standpoint — well , first of all , what is the likely result of my and my gang having a monopoly on shoes ?
Well , first of all , there are incentive problems .
If I ’m the only person who has the right to make and sell shoes , you ’re probably not going to get the shoes from me very cheaply .
I can charge as much as I want , as long as I do n’t charge so much that you just ca n’t afford them at all or you decide you ’re happier just not having the shoes .
But as long as you ’re willing and able , I ’ll charge the highest price that I can get out of you — because you ’ve got no competition , nowhere else to go .
You also probably should n’t expect the shoes to be of particularly high quality , because , after all , as long as they ’re barely serviceable , and you still prefer them to going barefoot — then you have to buy them from me .
In addition to the likelihood that the shoes are going to be expensive and not very good , there ’s also the fact that my ability to be the only person who makes and sells shoes gives me a certain leverage over you .
Suppose that I do n’t like you .
Suppose you ’ve offended me in some way .
Well , maybe you just do n’t get shoes for a while .
So , there ’s also abuse - of - power issues .
But , it ’s just not the incentive problem , because , after all , suppose that I ’m a perfect saint and I will make the best shoes I possibly can for you , and I ’ll charge the lowest price I possibly can charge , and I wo n’t abuse my power at all .
Suppose I ’m utterly trustworthy .
I ’m a prince among men ( not in Machiavelli ’s sense ) .
There is still a problem , which is : how do I know exactly that I ’m doing the best job I can with these shoes ?
After all , there ’s no competition .
I guess I could poll people to try to find out what kind of shoes they seem to want .
But there are lots of different ways I could make shoes .
Some of them are more expensive ways of making them , and some are less expensive .
How do I know , given that there ’s no market , and there ’s really not much I can do in the way of profit and loss accounting ?
I just have to make guesses .
So even if I ’m doing my best , the quantity I make , the quality I make may not be best suited to satisfy people ’s preferences , and I have a hard time finding these things out .
Government Is a Forced Monopoly
So those are all reasons not to have a monopoly on the making and selling of shoes .
Now , prima facie at least , it seems as though those are all good reasons for anyone not to have a monopoly in the provision of services of adjudicating disputes , and protecting rights , and all the things that are involved in what you might broadly call the enterprise of law .
First of all there ’s the moral question : why does one gang of people get the right to be the only ones in a given territory who can offer certain kinds of legal services or enforce certain kinds of things ?
And then there are these economic questions : what are the incentives going to be ?
Once again , it ’s a monopoly .
It seems likely that with a captive customer base they ’re going to charge higher prices than they otherwise would and offer lower quality .
There might even be the occasional abuse of power .
And then , even if you manage to avoid all those problems , and you get all the saintly types into the government , there ’s still the problem of how do they know that the particular way that they ’re providing legal services , the particular mix of legal services they ’re offering , the particular ways they do it are really the best ones ?
They just try to figure out what will work .
Since there ’s no competition , they do n’t have much way of knowing whether what they ’re doing is the most successful thing they could be doing .
So , the purpose of those considerations is to put the burden of proof on the opponent .
So this is the point , then , when the opponent of competition in legal services has to raise some objections .
TEN OBJECTIONS TO LIBERTARIAN ANARCHISM
(1) Government Is Not a Coercive Monopoly
Now , one objection that ’s sometimes raised is n’t so much an objection to anarchism as an objection to the moral argument for anarchism : well , look , it ’s not really a coercive monopoly .
It ’s not as though people have n’t consented to this because there ’s a certain sense in which people have consented to the existing system — by living within the borders of a particular territory , by accepting the benefits the government offers , and so forth , they have , in effect , consented .
Just as if you walk into a restaurant and sit down and say , " I ’ll have a steak , " you do n’t have to explicitly mention that you are agreeing to pay for it ; it ’s just sort of understood .
By sitting down in the restaurant and asking for the steak , you are agreeing to pay for it .
Likewise , the argument goes , if you sit down in the territory of this given state , and you accept benefits of police protection or something , then you ’ve implicitly agreed to abide by its requirements .
Now , notice that even if this argument works , it does n’t settle the pragmatic question of whether this is the best working system .
But I think there is something dubious about this argument .
It ’s certainly true that if I go onto someone else ’s property , then it seems like there ’s an expectation that as long as I ’m on their property I have to do as they say .
I have to follow their rules .
If I do n’t want to follow their rules , then I ’ve got to leave .
So , I invite you over to my house , and when you come in I say , " You have to wear the funny hat . "
And you say , " What ’s this ? "
And I say , " Well , that ’s the way it works in my house .
Everyone has to wear the funny hat .
Those are my rules . "
Well , you ca n’t say , " I wo n’t wear the hat but I ’m staying anyway . "
These are my rules — they may be dumb rules , but I can do it .
Now suppose that you ’re at home having dinner , and I ’m your next - door - neighbor , and I come and knock on your door .
You open the door , and I come in and I say , " You have to wear the funny hat . "
And you say , " Why is this ? "
And I say , " Well , you moved in next door to me , did n’t you ?
By doing that , you sort of agreed . "
And you say , " Well , wait a second !
When did I agree to this ? "
I think that the person who makes this argument is already assuming that the government has some legitimate jurisdiction over this territory .
And then they say , well , now , anyone who is in the territory is therefore agreeing to the prevailing rules .
But they ’re assuming the very thing they ’re trying to prove — namely that this jurisdiction over the territory is legitimate .
If it ’s not , then the government is just one more group of people living in this broad general geographical territory .
But I ’ve got my property , and exactly what their arrangements are I do n’t know , but here I am in my property and they do n’t own it — at least they have n’t given me any argument that they do — and so , the fact that I am living in " this country " means I am living in a certain geographical region that they have certain pretensions over — but the question is whether those pretensions are legitimate .
You ca n’t assume it as a means to proving it .
Another thing is , one of the problems with these implicit social contract arguments is that it ’s not clear what the contract is .
In the case of ordering food in a restaurant , everyone pretty much knows what the contract is .
So you could run an implicit consent argument there .
But no one would suggest that you could buy a house the same way .
There are all these rules and things like that .
When it ’s something complicated no one says , " You just sort of agreed by nodding your head at some point , " or something .
You have to find out what it is that ’s actually in the contract ; what are you agreeing to ?
It ’s not clear if no one knows what exactly the details of the contract are .
It ’s not that persuasive .
Okay , well , most of the arguments I ’m going to talk about are pragmatic , or a mixture of moral and pragmatic .
(2) Hobbes : Government Is Necessary for Cooperation
Probably the most famous argument against anarchy is Hobbes .
Hobbes ’ argument is : well , look , human cooperation , social cooperation , requires a structure of law in the background .
The reason we can trust each other to cooperate is because we know that there are legal forces that will punish us if we violate each other ’s rights .
I know that they ’ll punish me if I violate your rights , but they ’ll also punish you if you violate my rights .
And so I can trust you because I do n’t have to rely on your own personal character .
I just have to rely on the fact that you ’ll be intimidated by the law .
So , social cooperation requires this legal framework backed up by force of the state .
Well , Hobbes is assuming several things at once here .
First he ’s assuming that there ca n’t be any social cooperation without law .
Second , he ’s assuming that there ca n’t be any law unless it ’s enforced by physical force .
And third , he ’s assuming you ca n’t have law enforced by physical force unless it ’s done by a monopoly state .
But all those assumptions are false .
It ’s certainly true that cooperation can and does emerge , maybe not as efficiently as it would with law , but without law .
There ’s Robert Ellickson ’s book Order Without Law where he talks about how neighbors manage to resolve disputes .
He offers all these examples about what happens if one farmer ’s cow wanders onto another farmer ’s territory and they solve it through some mutual customary agreements and so forth , and there ’s no legal framework for resolving it .
Maybe that ’s not enough for a complex economy , but it certainly shows that you can have some kind of cooperation without an actual legal framework .
Second , you can have a legal framework that is n’t backed up by force .
An example would be the Law Merchant in the late Middle Ages : a system of commercial law that was backed up by threats of boycott .
Boycott is n’t an act of force .
But still , you ’ve got merchants making all these contracts , and if you do n’t abide by the contract , then the court just publicizes to everyone : " this person did n’t abide by the contract ; take that into account if you ’re going to make another contract with them . "
And third , you can have formal legal systems that do use force that are not monopolistic .
Since Hobbes does n’t even consider that possibility , he does n’t really give any argument against it .
But you can certainly see examples in history .
The history of medieval Iceland , for example , where there was no one center of enforcement .
Although there was something that you might perhaps call a government , it had no executive arm at all .
It had no police , no soldiers , no nothing .
It had a sort of a competitive court system .
But then enforcement was just up to whoever .
And there were systems that evolved for taking care of that .
(3) Locke : Three " Inconveniences " of Anarchy
Okay , well , more interesting arguments are from Locke .
Locke argues that anarchy involves three things he calls " inconveniences . "
And " inconvenience " has a somewhat more weighty sound in 17th century English than it does in modern English , but still his point in calling it " inconveniences , " which still is a bit weaker , was that Locke thought that social cooperation could exist somewhat under anarchy .
He was more optimistic than Hobbes was .
He thought , on the basis of moral sympathies on the one hand and self - interest on the other , cooperation could emerge .
He thought there were three problems .
One problem , he said , was that there would n’t be a general body of law that was generally known , and agreed on , and understood .
People could grasp certain basic principles of the law of nature .
But their applications and precise detail were always going to be controversial .
Even libertarians do n’t agree .
They can agree on general things , but we ’re always arguing with each other about various points of fine detail .
So , even in a society of peaceful , cooperative libertarians , there are going to be disagreements about details .
And so , unless there ’s some general body of law that everyone knows about so that they can know what they can count on being able to do and what not , it ’s not going to work .
So that was Locke ’s first argument .
There has to be a generally known universal body of law that applies to everyone that everyone knows about ahead of time .
Second , there is a power - of - enforcement problem .
He thought that without a government you do n’t have sufficiently unified power to enforce .
You just have individuals enforcing things on their own , and they ’re just too weak , they ’re not organized enough , they could be overrun by a gang of bandits or something .
Third , Locke said the problem is that people ca n’t be trusted to be judges in their own case .
If two people have a disagreement , and one of them says , " Well , I know what the law of nature is and I ’m going to enforce it on you , " well , people tend to be biased , and they ’re going to find most plausible the interpretation of the law of nature that favors their own case .
So , he thought that you ca n’t trust people to be judges in their own case ; therefore , they should be morally required to submit their disputes to an arbitrator .
Maybe in cases of emergency they can still defend themselves on - the - spot , but for other cases where it ’s not a matter of immediate self - defense , they need to delegate this to an arbitrator , a third party — and that ’s the state .
So Locke thinks that these are three problems you have under anarchy , and that you would n’t have them under government or at least under the right kind of government .
But I think that it ’s actually exactly the other way around .
I think that anarchy can solve all three of those problems , and that the state , by its very nature , cannot possibly solve them .
So let ’s first take the case of universality , or having a universally known body of law that people can know ahead of time and count on .
Now , can that emerge in a non-state system ?
Well , in fact , it did emerge in the Law Merchant precisely because the states were not providing it .
One of the things that helped to bring about the emergence of the Law Merchant is the individual states in Europe each had different sets of laws governing merchants .
They were all different .
And a court in France would n’t uphold a contract made in England under the laws of England , and vice versa .
And so , the merchants ’ ability to engage in international trade was hampered by the fact that there was n’t any uniform system of commercial law for all of Europe .
So the merchants got together and said , " Well , let ’s just make some of our own .
The courts are coming up with these crazy rules , and they ’re all different , and they wo n’t respect each other ’s decisions , so we ’ll just ignore them and we ’ll set up our own system . "
So this is a case in which uniformity and predictability were produced by the market and not by the state .
And you can see why that ’s not surprising .
It ’s in the interest of those who are providing a private system to make it uniform and predictable if that ’s what the customers need .
It ’s for the same reason that you do n’t find any triangular ATM cards .
As far as I know , there ’s no law saying that you ca n’t have a triangular ATM card , but if anyone tried to market them , they just would n’t be very popular because they would n’t fit into the existing machines .
When what people need is diversity , when what people need is different systems for different people , the market provides that .
But there are some things where uniformity is better .
Your ATM card is more valuable to you if everyone else is using the same kind as well or a kind compatible with it so that you can all use the machines wherever you go ; and therefore , the merchants , if they want to make a profit , they ’re going to provide uniformity .
So the market has an incentive to provide uniformity in a way that government does n’t necessarily .
On the question of having sufficient power for organizing for defense — well , there ’s no reason you ca n’t have organization under anarchy .
Anarchy does n’t mean that each person makes their own shoes .
The alternative to government providing all the shoes is not that each person makes their own shoes .
So , likewise , the alternative to government providing all the legal services is not that each person has to be their own independent policeman .
There ’s no reason that they ca n’t organize in various ways .
In fact , if you ’re worried about not having sufficient force to resist an aggressor , well , a monopoly government is a much more dangerous aggressor than just some gang of bandits or other because it ’s unified all this power in just one point in the whole society .
But I think , most interestingly , the argument about being a judge in your own case really boomerangs against Locke ’s argument here .
Because first of all , it ’s not a good argument for a monopoly because it ’s a fallacy to argue from everyone should submit their disputes to a third party to there should be a third party that everyone submits their disputes to .
That ’s like arguing from everyone likes at least one TV show to there ’s at least one TV show that everyone likes .
It just does n’t follow .
You can have everyone submitting their disputes to third parties without there being some one third party that every one submits their disputes to .
Suppose you ’ve got three people on an island .
A and B can submit their disputes to C , and A and C can submit their disputes to B , and B and C can submit their disputes to A .
So you do n’t need a monopoly in order to embody this principle that people should submit their disputes to a third party .
But moreover , not only do you not need a government , but a government is precisely what does n’t satisfy that principle .
Because if you have a dispute with the government , the government does n’t submit that dispute to a third party .
If you have a dispute with the government , it ’ll be settled in a government court ( if you ’re lucky — if you ’re unlucky , if you live under one of the more rough - and - ready governments , you wo n’t ever even get as far as a court ) .
Now , of course , it ’s better if the government is itself divided , checks - and - balances and so forth .
That ’s a little bit better , that ’s closer to there being third parties , but still they are all part of the same system ; the judges are paid by tax money and so forth .
So , it ’s not as though you ca n’t have better and worse approximations to this principle among different kinds of governments .
Still , as long as it ’s a monopoly system , by its nature , it ’s in a certain sense lawless .
It never ultimately submits its disputes to a third party .
(4) Ayn Rand : Private Protection Agencies Will Battle
Probably the most popular argument against libertarian anarchy is : well , what happens if ( and this is Ayn Rand ’s famous argument ) I think you ’ve violated my rights and you think you have n’t , so I call up my protection agency , and you call up your protection agency — why wo n’t they just do battle ?
What guarantees that they wo n’t do battle ?
To which , of course , the answer is : well , nothing guarantees they wo n’t do battle .
Human beings have free will .
They can do all kinds of crazy things .
They might go to battle .
Likewise , George Bush might decide to push the nuclear button tomorrow .
They might do all sorts of things .
The question is : what ’s likely ?
Which is likelier to settle its disputes through violence : a government or a private protection agency ?
Well , the difference is that private protection agencies have to bear the costs of their own decisions to go to war .
Going to war is expensive .
If you have a choice between two protection agencies , and one solves its disputes through violence most of the time , and the other one solves its disputes through arbitration most of the time — now , you might think , " I want the one that solves its disputes through violence — that ’s sounds really cool ! "
But then you look at your monthly premiums .
And you think , well , how committed are you to this Viking mentality ?
Now , you might be so committed to the Viking mentality that you ’re willing to pay for it ; but still , it is more expensive .
A lot of customers are going to say , " I want to go to one that does n’t charge all this extra amount for the violence . "
Whereas , governments — first of all , they ’ve got captive customers , they ca n’t go anywhere else — but since they ’re taxing the customers anyway , and so the customers do n’t have the option to switch to a different agency .
And so , governments can externalize the costs of their going to war much more effectively than private agencies can .
(5) Robert Bidinotto : No Final Arbiter of Disputes
One common objection — this is one you find , for example , in Robert Bidinotto , who ’s a Randian who ’s written a number of articles against anarchy ( he and I have had sort of a running debate online about this ) — his principal objection to anarchy is that under anarchy , there ’s no final arbiter in disputes .
Under government , some final arbiter at some point comes along and resolves the dispute one way or the other .
Well , under anarchy , since there ’s no one agency that has the right to settle things once and for all , there ’s no final arbiter , and so disputes , in some sense , never end , they never get resolved , they always remain open - ended .
So what ’s the answer to that ?
Well , I think that there ’s an ambiguity to the concept here of a final arbiter .
By " final arbiter , " you could mean the final arbiter in what I call the Platonic sense .
That is to say , someone or something or some institution that somehow absolutely guarantees that the dispute is resolved forever ; that absolutely guarantees the resolution .
Or , instead , by " final arbiter " you could simply mean some person or process or institution or something - or - other that more or less reliably guarantees most of the time that these problems get resolved .
Now , it is true , that in the Platonic sense of an absolute guarantee of a final arbiter — in that sense , anarchy does not provide one .
But neither does any other system .
Take a minarchist constitutional republic of the sort that Bidinotto favors .
Is there a final arbiter under that system , in the sense of something that absolutely guarantees ending the process of dispute forever ?
Well , I sue you , or I ’ve been sued , or I am accused of something , whatever — I ’m in some kind of court case .
I lose .
I appeal it .
I appeal it to the Supreme Court .
They go against me .
I lobby the Congress to change the laws to favor me .
They do n’t do it .
So then I try to get a movement for a Constitutional Amendment going .
That fails , so I try and get people together to vote in new people in Congress who will vote for it .
In some sense it can go on forever .
The dispute is n’t over .
But , as a matter of fact , most of the time most legal disputes eventually end .
Someone finds it too costly to continue fighting .
Likewise , under anarchy — of course there ’s no guarantee that the conflict wo n’t go on forever .
There are very few guarantees of that iron - clad sort .
But that ’s no reason not to expect it to work .
(6) Property Law Cannot Emerge from the Market
Another popular argument , also used often by the Randians , is that market exchanges presuppose a background of property law .
You and I ca n’t be making exchanges of goods for services , or money for services , or whatever , unless there ’s already a stable background of property law that ensures us the property titles that we have .
And because the market , in order to function , presupposes existing background property law , therefore , that property law cannot itself be the product of the market .
The property law must emerge — they must really think it must emerge out of an infallible robot or something — but I do n’t know exactly what it emerges from , but somehow it ca n’t emerge from the market .
But their thinking this is sort of like : first , there ’s this property law , and it ’s all put in place , and no market transactions are happening — everyone is just waiting for the whole legal structure to be put in place .
And then it ’s in place — and now we can finally start trading back and forth .
It certainly is true that you ca n’t have functioning markets without a functioning legal system ; that ’s true .
But it ’s not as though first the legal system is in place , and then on the last day they finally finish putting the legal system together — then people begin their trading .
These things arise together .
Legal institutions and economic trade arise together in one and the same place , at one and the same time .
The legal system is not something independent of the activity it constrains .
After all , a legal system again is not a robot or a god or something separate from us .
The existence of a legal system consists in people obeying it .
If everyone ignored the legal system , it would have no power at all .
So it ’s only because people generally go along with it that it survives .
The legal system , too , depends on voluntary support .
I think that a lot of people — one reason that they ’re scared of anarchy is they think that under government it ’s as though there ’s some kind of guarantee that ’s taken away under anarchy .
That somehow there ’s this firm background we can always fall back on that under anarchy is just gone .
But the firm background is just the product of people interacting with the incentives that they have .
Likewise , when anarchists say people under anarchy would probably have the incentive to do this or that , and people say , " Well , that ’s not good enough !
I do n’t just want it to be likely that they ’ll have the incentive to do this .
I want the government to absolutely guarantee that they ’ll do it ! "
But the government is just people .
And depending on what the constitutional structure of that government is , it ’s likely that they ’ll do this or that .
You ca n’t design a constitution that will guarantee that the people in the government will behave in any particular way .
You can structure it in such a way so that they ’re more likely to do this or less likely to do this .
And you can see anarchy as just an extension of checks - and - balances to a broader level .
For example , people say , " What guarantees that the different agencies will resolve things in any particular way ? "
Well , the U.S. Constitution says nothing about what happens if different branches of the government disagree about how to resolve things .
It does n’t say what happens if the Supreme Court thinks something is unconstitutional but Congress thinks it does n’t , and wants to go ahead and do it anyway .
Famously , it does n’t say what happens if there ’s a dispute between the states and the federal government .
The current system where once the Supreme Court declares something unconstitutional , then the Congress and the President do n’t try to do it anymore ( or at least not quite so much ) — that did n’t always exist .
Remember when the Court declared what Andrew Jackson was doing unconstitutional , when he was President , he just said , " Well , they ’ve made their decision , let them enforce it . "
The Constitution does n’t say whether the way Jackson did it was the right way .
The way we do it now is the way that ’s emerged through custom .
Maybe you ’re for it , maybe you ’re against it — whatever it is , it was never codified in law .
(7) Organized Crime Will Take Over
One objection is that under anarchy organized crime will take over .
Well , it might .
But is it likely ?
Organized crime gets its power because it specializes in things that are illegal — things like drugs and prostitution and so forth .
During the years when alcohol was prohibited , organized crime specialized in the alcohol trade .
Nowadays , they ’re not so big in the alcohol trade .
So the power of organized crime to a large extent depends on the power of government .
It ’s sort of a parasite on government ’s activities .
Governments by banning things create black markets .
Black markets are dangerous things to be in because you have to worry both about the government and about other dodgy people who are going into the black market field .
Organized crime specializes in that .
So , organized crime I think would be weaker , not stronger , in a libertarian system .
(8) The Rich Will Rule
Another worry is that the rich would rule .
After all , wo n’t justice just go to the highest bidder in that case , if you turn legal services into an economic good ?
That ’s a common objection .
Interestingly , it ’s a particularly common objection among Randians , who suddenly become very concerned about the poor impoverished masses .
But under which system are the rich more powerful ?
Under the current system or under anarchy ?
Certainly , you ’ve always got some sort of advantage if you ’re rich .
It ’s good to be rich .
You ’re always in a better position to bribe people if you ’re rich than if you ’re not ; that ’s true .
But , under the current system , the power of the rich is magnified .
Suppose that I ’m an evil rich person , and I want to get the government to do something - or - other that costs a million dollars .
Do I have to bribe some bureaucrat a million dollars to get it done ?
No , because I ’m not asking him to do it with his own money .
Obviously , if I were asking him to do it with his own money , I could n’t get him to spend a million dollars by bribing him any less than a million .
It would have to be at least a million dollars and one cent .
But people who control tax money that they do n’t themselves personally own , and therefore ca n’t do whatever they want with , the bureaucrat ca n’t just pocket the million and go home ( although it can get surprisingly close to that ) .
All I have to do is bribe him a few thousand , and he can direct this million dollars in tax money to my favorite project or whatever , and thus the power of my bribe money is multiplied .
Whereas , if you were the head of some private protection agency and I ’m trying to get you to do something that costs a million dollars , I ’d have to bribe you more than a million .
So , the power of the rich is actually less under this system .
And , of course , any court that got the reputation of discriminating in favor of millionaires against poor people would also presumably have the reputation of discriminating for billionaires against millionaires .
So , the millionaires would not want to deal with it all of the time .
They ’d only want to deal with it when they ’re dealing with people poorer , not people richer .
The reputation effects — I do n’t think this would be too popular an outfit .
Worries about poor victims who ca n’t afford legal services , or victims who die without heirs ( again , the Randians are very worried about victims dying without heirs ) — in the case of poor victims , you can do what they did in Medieval Iceland .
You ’re too poor to purchase legal services , but still , if someone has harmed you , you have a claim to compensation from that person .
You can sell that claim , part of the claim or all of the claim , to someone else .
Actually , it ’s kind of like hiring a lawyer on a contingency fee basis .
You can sell to someone who is in a position to enforce your claim .
Or , if you die without heirs , in a sense , one of the goods you left behind was your claim to compensation , and that can be homesteaded .
(9 ) Robert Bidinotto : The Masses Will Demand Bad Laws
Another worry that Bidinotto has — and this is sort of the opposite of the worry that the rich will rule — is : well , look , is n’t Mises right , that the market is like a big democracy , where there is consumer sovereignty , and the masses get whatever they want ?
That ’s great when it ’s refrigerators and cars and so forth .
But surely that ’s not a good thing when it ’s laws .
Because , after all , the masses are a bunch of ignorant , intolerant fools , and if they just get whatever laws they want , who knows what horrible things they will make .
Of course , the difference between economic democracy of the Mises sort and political democracy is : well , yeah , they get whatever they want , but they ’re going to have to pay for it .
Now , it ’s perfectly true that if you have people who are fanatical enough about wanting to impose some wretched thing on other people , if you ’ve got a large enough group of people who are fanatical enough about this , then anarchy might not lead to libertarian results .
If you live in California , you ’ve got enough people who are absolutely fanatical about banning smoking , or maybe if you ’re in Alabama , and it ’s homosexuality instead of smoking they want to ban ( neither one would ban the other , I think ) — in that case , it might happen that they ’re so fanatical about it that they would ban it .
But remember that they are going to have to be paying for this .
So when you get your monthly premium , you see : well , here ’s your basic service — protecting you against aggression ; oh , and then here ’s also your extended service , and the extra fee for that — peering in your neighbors ’ windows to make sure that they ’re not — either the tobacco or the homosexuality or whatever it is you ’re worried about .
Now the really fanatical people will say , " Yes , I ’m going to shell out the extra money for this . "
( Of course , if they ’re that fanatical , they ’re probably going to be trouble under minarchy , too . )
But if they ’re not that fanatical , they ’ll say , " Well , if all I have to do is go into a voting booth and vote for these laws restricting other people ’s freedom , well , heck , I ’d go in , it ’s pretty easy to go in and vote for it . "
But if they actually have to pay for it —
" Gee , I do n’t know .
Maybe I can reconcile myself to this . "
( 10 ) Robert Nozick and Tyler Cowen : Private Protection Agencies Will Become a de facto Government
Okay , one last consideration I want to talk about .
This is a question that originally was raised by Robert Nozick and has since been pushed farther by Tyler Cowen .
Nozick said : Suppose you have anarchy .
One of three things will happen .
Either the agencies will fight — and he gives two different scenarios of what will happen if they fight .
But I ’ve already talked about what happens if they fight , so I ’ll talk about the third option .
What if they do n’t fight ?
Then he says , if instead they agree to these mutual arbitration contracts and so forth , then basically this whole thing just turns into a government .
And then Tyler Cowen has pushed this argument farther .
He said what happens is that basically this forms into a cartel , and it ’s going to be in the interest of this cartel to sort of turn itself into a government .
And any new agency that comes along , they can just boycott it .
Just as it ’s in your interest if you come along with a new ATM card that it be compatible with everyone else ’s machines , so if you come along with a brand new protection agency , it is in your interest that you get to be part of this system of contracts and arbitration and so forth that the existing ones have .
Consumers are n’t going to come to you if they find out that you do n’t have any agreements as to what happens if you ’re in a conflict with these other agencies .
And so , this cartel will be able to freeze everyone out .
Well , could that happen ?
Sure .
All kinds of things could happen .
Half the country could commit suicide tomorrow .
But , is it likely ?
Is this cartel likely to be able to abuse its power in this way ?
The problem is cartels are unstable for all the usual reasons .
That does n’t mean that it ’s impossible that a cartel succeed .
After all , people have free will .
But it ’s unlikely because the very incentives that lead you to form the cartel also lead you to cheat on it — because it ’s always in the interest of anyone to make agreements outside the cartel once they are in it .
Bryan Caplan makes a distinction between self - enforcing boycotts and non-self - enforcing boycotts .
Self - enforcing boycotts are ones where the boycott is pretty stable because it ’s a boycott against , for example , doing business with people who cheat their business partners .
Now , you do n’t have to have some iron resolve of moral commitment in order to avoid doing business with people who cheat their business partners .
You have a perfectly self - interested reason not to do business with those people .
But think instead of a commitment not to do business with someone because you do n’t like their religion or something like that , or they ’re a member of the wrong protection agency , one that your fellow protection agencies told you not to deal with — well , the boycott might work .
Maybe enough people ( and maybe everyone ) in the cartel are so committed to upholding the cartel that they just wo n’t deal with the person .
Is that possible ?
Yes .
But , if we assume that they formed the cartel out of their own economic self - interest , then the economic self - interest is precisely what leads to the undermining because it ’s in their interest to deal with the person , just as it ’s always in your interest to engage in mutually beneficial trade .
QUESTION PERIOD
Anyway , those are some of the objections and some of my replies , and I ’ll open it up .
Q1 : My chief concern about anarchism is : why ca n’t you say that government is just another division of labor ?
Because it could be that some people are better or possess natural capabilities that are more suited to ruling over others .
I ’m not saying anarchy cannot work , but solely from empirical evidence , the fact that none of the industrialized regions in the world are in a state of anarchy , nor have they ever been for long in a state of anarchy says something about perhaps the stability or viability of complex human societies in the present state .
And also , going back to what I said earlier , you can conceive of the relationship between the ruler and the ruled as just another common division of labor .
Some people possess leadership abilities that are better able to organize people than others .
Some people lack that .
RL : On the division - of - labor point , to the extent the division of labor is voluntary — if you ’re better at something - or - other than I am , and so you do it , and then I buy the services from you — as long as it ’s voluntary , that ’s fine .
But when we ’re talking about division of labor and some people are better at ruling than other people — well , if I consent to your ruling me — maybe I ’m hiring you as my advisor because I think you ’re better at making decisions than I am , so I make one last decision which is to hire you as my advisor , and from then on I do what you say — that ’s not government ; you ’re my employee , you ’re an employee that I follow very religiously .
But , ruling implies ruling people without their consent .
That the division of labor is beneficial to everyone involved does n’t seem to apply in cases where one group is forcing the other to accept its services .
And on the question of why we do n’t see any industrialized country that has anarchy — of course , we also do n’t see any industrialized county that has monarchy .
But then industrialized countries have n’t been around all that long .
There was a time when people said every civilized country ( or just about every civilized country ) is a monarchy .
You find people in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saying : look , all the civilized countries are monarchies ; democracy would never work .
And by saying democracy would never work , they meant not just that it would have these various bad results in the long run ; they just thought it would completely fall apart into chaos in a matter of months .
Whatever you may think of democracy , it was more viable than they predicted .
It could last longer , at any rate , than they predicted .
So , things are in flux .
There was a time when it was all monarchies .
Now it ’s all semi-oligarchical democracies .
The night is young .
Q2 : Roderick , surely we all appreciate the wonderful work that you do here at the Mises Institute , but Ludwig von Mises was n’t an anarchist .
So , I was wondering if you could tell us more about your institute and the Molinari Institute .
RL : Mises was n’t really a Misesian ! [ laughter ]
Well , I have my own think tank .
It is somewhat smaller than this one .
I ’m not sure whether it has a physical size .
It does consist of more than one person .
The board of directors is three people .
So , it ’s three people plus a website .
Someday it will rule the Earth — in an anarchic way .
Right now mostly what it does is put up various libertarian and anarchist classics on the website .
There ’s an offshoot of it — the Molinari Society , which is the same three people plus one more .
Insofar as , as Hayek said , social facts consist in people ’s attitudes toward them , the more people who think that it exists , the more it exists .
The whole thing exists a little bit more because we got affiliated with the American Philosophical Association .
The Molinari Society is hosting a session at the American Philosophical Association meetings in December .
So it is actually going to be a Molinari event in December involving the three - people - plus - another - one .
So that ’s the grand and glorious progress .
Its mission is to overthrow the government .
We ’ve applied for tax - exempt status from the government .
( We ’ll see just how dumb they are !
We worded the description somewhat differently when we sent in the forms . )
Q3 : I was going to bolster the point you made about the Randian objection that market transactions require some sort of legal background to them .
The fact that there are black markets belies this .
If you ’re a cocaine dealer and you get ripped off by your middle - man , you certainly ca n’t go to a court and say " Go arrest him , he did n’t give me the cocaine he was supposed to " …
RL : I ’m sure someone ’s tried it …
Q3 : … Now , of course , this very easily can lead to violence , but do n’t forget that there are people actively trying to stop you , not just that they ’re not letting you arbitrate , they ’re actively stopping you from doing it .
RL : David Friedman makes the argument that one of the main functions of the Mafia is to serve as something like a court system for criminals .
That ’s not all it does , but the Mafia takes an interest in what sorts of criminal goings - on are going on in its territory — because it wants its cut , but it also does n’t want gangs having shoot - outs with each other in its territory .
If you ’ve got a conflict , you agreed to some kind of criminal deal with someone and they cheated you , and it happened in the jurisdiction of some particular Mafia group , they ’ll take an interest in that as long as you ’re providing your cut .
If they ’re not cooperating , the Mafia will act as something kind of court - like and police - like .
They ’re sort of cops for criminals .
Q4 : What will prevent protection companies from becoming a protection racket ?
RL : Well , other protection companies .
If it succeeds in doing it , then it ’s become a government .
But during the time it ’s trying to do it , it has n’t yet become a government , so we assume there are still other agencies around , and it ’s in those other agencies ’ interest to make sure that this does n’t happen .
Could it become a protection racket ?
In principle , could protection agencies evolve into government ?
Some could .
I think probably historically some have .
But the question is : is that a likely or inevitable result ?
I do n’t think so because there is a check - and - balance against it .
Checks - and - balances can fail in anarchy just like they can fail under constitutions .
But there is a check - and - balance against it which is the possibility of calling in other protection agencies or someone starting another protection agency before this thing has yet had a chance to acquire that kind of power .
Q5 : Who best explains the origin of the state ?
RL : Well , there ’s a popular nineteenth - century theory of the origin of the state that you find in a number of different forms .
It ’s in Herbert Spencer , it ’s in Oppenheimer , and you find it in some of the French liberals like Comte and Dunoyer , and Molinari — who was n’t really French , he was Belgian ( " I am not a Frenchie , I ’m a Belgie ! " ) .
This theory — they had different versions of it , but it ’s all pretty similar — was that what happens is that one group conquers another group .
Often the theory was that a sort of hunter - marauder group conquers an agricultural group .
In Molinari ’s version of it what happens is : first , they just go and kill people and grab their stuff .
And then gradually they figure out : well , maybe we should wait and not kill them because we want them to grow more stuff next time we come back .
So instead , we ’ll just come and grab their stuff and not kill them , and then they ’ll grow some more stuff , and next year we ’ll be back .
And then they think , well , if we take all their stuff , then they wo n’t have enough seed corn to grow it , or they wo n’t have any incentive to grow it — they ’ll just run away or something — so we wo n’t take everything .
And finally , they think : we do n’t have to keep going away and coming back .
We can just move in .
And then gradually , over time , you get a ruling class and a ruled class .
At first , the ruling class and the ruled class may be ethnically different because they were these different tribes .
But even if , over time , the tribes intermarry and there ’s no longer any difference in the compositions , they still have got the same structure of a ruling group and a ruled group .
So that was one popular theory of the origin of the state , or at least the origin of many states .
I think another origin you can see of some states or state - like things is in the same sort of situation but in cases where they succeed in fending off the invaders .
Some local group within the invaded group says : we ’re going to specialize in defense — we ’re going to specialize in defending the rest of you guys against these invaders .
And they succeed .
If you look at the history of England , I think this is what happens with the English monarchy .
Before the Norman conquest , the earliest English monarchs were war leaders whose main job was national defense .
They had very little to do within the country .
They were primarily directed against foreign invaders .
But it was a monopoly .
( Now , the question is how they got that monopoly .
I ’m not so sure . )
But once they got it , they gradually started getting involved more and more in domestic control as well .
Q6 : Hector , Murray ’s story about Hector ?
It ’s very much similar to this story and it ’s on the web , and it ’s just a beautiful story .
RL : Which story about Hector is this ?
Q6 : The first one about why do we have to leave , let ’s just stay there …
RL : Oh , yeah .
Q6 : Murray did a beautiful job on that , and I would recommend it .
RL : What ’s that in ?
Q6 : It ’s on LewRockwell.com .
RL : It ’s one of the Rothbard articles on there ?
Okay .
Q6 : I wanted to buttress your thesis in several ways .
One , another argument in favor of anarchy is that if you really favor the government , you have to favor world government because right now there ’s anarchy between governments , and we ca n’t have that if you want government .
Very few people favor world government , and it ’s incompatible with the case against anarchy .
RL : There has to be a final final arbiter .
Q6 : Another buttress is the issue about negotiations .
The way that the time zones came up and the way that the standard gauge for railroads came up was through negotiations between railroad companies .
RL : And the Internet .
Some of that is legal , but other aspects are just customary .
Q6 : And another support is this thing about the cartel .
At one time the National Basketball Association had eight teams and they would n’t allow any other people to come in , so they started the ABA ( the American Basketball Association , with the red - white - and - blue ball ) .
So if you had this cartel that would n’t let other people in , they could start another cartel .
RL : What happened to them ?
Q6 : They eventually merged .
Now there are like thirty teams in the NBA .
And if that ’s too few , yet another league can come up .
RL : The crucial point is that in the Austrian definition of competition it ’s not number of competing firms , it ’s the free entry .
As long as it ’s possible to start another one , that can have the same effect as actually doing it .
Q6 : In addition to the dissolution of a cartel , you can have other cartels competing against the first cartel .
RL : Did the XFL have any good effect ?
[ laughter ]
Q6 : I wanted to ask a question .
In your answer to the first question , where you said you were appointing him as your guide — does this mean you take my side —
RL : No .
Q6 : — on alienability ?
RL : No , no .
That ’s why I said he was the employee rather than the owner .
I believe in inalienable rights .
Q6 : He ’s an employee , yet you ca n’t fire him …
RL : No , I can fire him .
He ’s my advisor , I always will follow him — but I have n’t given up my right to fire him .
The Best of Roderick T. Long
Merkley will join Oregon 's senior senator , Ron Wyden , giving Oregon a two - Democrat team for the first time in four decades .
Democratic senatorial leaders , who threw millions of dollars into the effort to defeat Smith , were hoping to boost their ranks to 60 , which would effectively give them unfettered sway over Congress .
... Merkley said he feels especially satisfied given how hard it is to unseat an incumbent in modern politics .
It has been more than 40 years since an Oregon Democrat knocked out a sitting Republican senator , he said .
" It takes an enormous sense by citizens that things are way off track and that it 's necessary to intervene to change the course , " he said .
He said he hopes to bring to the Senate the same skills he used as Oregon House speaker during the 2007 legislative session , which has been praised as one of the most productive in years .
Earlier today some of my colleagues were arguing over whether or not a progressive congressmember from Illinois was progressive enough to be termed " Wellstone - like . "
I was uncertain but Icertain that the Senate candidate Blue America backed this year who is the most like Paul Wellstone is the former Speaker of Oregon 's House , Jeff Merkley .
After slow counting in heavily Democratic Multnomah and Lane counties finally came in Jeff won the seat and ousted Bush rubber stamp incumbent Gordon Smith , one of the Senate 's least honorable members -- and in this Senate that is saying a lot !
We expect Jeff to be one of the Senate 's most tenacious and effective fighters for working families -- just like he was in Oregon .
This is the best news in the Senate races this year -- although Tom Udall ( D - NM ) is also an outstanding new member .
Gordon Smith has finally conceded the defeat he earned .
Let 's hope we never hear from that hack again .

By this year , the bleeding housing market had drained the equity from Judy Jones ’ home in Murrieta , but her life still seemed secure .
She had a government job , after all , and a 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage at 5.875 % , unlike the shaky , variable - rate loans of many of her Inland Empire neighbors .
Then her employer , the city of Corona , decided to deal with the economic slump by eliminating 112 positions , including Jones ’ job as a code enforcer .
Last month , at age 61 , she joined a surge of once - solid borrowers who no longer could afford their mortgages .
“ Every week at church , somebody else is out of work , ” Jones said .
“ I ’ve been a homeowner a long time -- the last 10 years as a single mother -- and I never missed a payment .
Now look at me .
And it could be you -- any middle - class person who goes to work today could be walking out the door of a foreclosed house in a couple of months . ”
Jones ’ concern is well - founded .
Although soaring defaults on subprime loans and other dicey mortgages are a well - known cause of the country ’s financial crisis , delinquencies and foreclosures now are skyrocketing among “ prime ” borrowers -- people with good credit histories who documented their incomes when applying for their relatively straightforward mortgages .
Advertisement
Nationwide , 3.07 % of prime mortgages were in foreclosure or at least 60 days late in the second quarter of this year , the latest period for which the Mortgage Bankers Assn. has figures , easily topping the previous record of 1.97 % set in 1985 .
In California , with a jobless rate topping 8 % and home prices down more than 40 % from their peak and falling , the situation is significantly worse , with 4.15 % of prime loans seriously delinquent .
That far exceeded peaks of about 2.6 % reached in the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s .
The epidemic of bad loans and lost homes among prime borrowers has only worsened since the second quarter ended , according to other , more recent data .
By putting more foreclosed homes on the market , the trend is likely to further depress housing prices , intensify the mortgage - related crisis afflicting the financial system and exacerbate the recession most economists believe is already underway .
Advertisement
“ We should be really worried , ” said Stephen C. Levy , director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy , a private research firm in Palo Alto .
And as home prices continue to fall , delinquent borrowers are more likely than ever to end up in foreclosure .
“ During the rising market , if you lost your job , got sick or your marriage failed you always had a parachute :
Sell the house , pay off your mortgage and have something left to start again , ” said consumer finance expert Elizabeth Warren , a professor at Harvard Law School .
“ Or sometimes you could use your home equity line of credit to get by . ”
But now , for most people , “ that parachute has gone up in flames , ” Warren said .
Advertisement
In California , delinquencies on prime mortgages could increase for years , said Christopher Thornberg , founder of consulting firm Beacon Economics in Los Angeles .
One reason , he said , is that home lenders became so complacent during the housing boom that they did little to qualify borrowers besides having computers check a few facts .
“ ‘ Prime ’ lost a lot of meaning in the insanity of the last few years , ” said Thornberg , who was one of the first experts to foresee the housing downturn .
To be sure , the damage has been greatest in subprime mortgages , the high - risk loans tapped heavily during the go - go years by borrowers with the worst credit , the heaviest debt loads or the lowest down payments ( and sometimes all three of those ) .
Advertisement
In August , more than 43 % of subprime loans nationally were in foreclosure or at least 60 days late in paying , a rate nearly double that of August 2007 , according to First American CoreLogic ’s LoanPerformance unit , which tracks 82 % of all U.S. loans .
But problems with prime loans are increasing as fast or faster .
About 7.5 % of prime jumbo mortgages -- high - quality home loans too large to be sold to government - backed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- were at least 60 days late or in foreclosure , according to LoanPerformance .
That was more than three times the level of a year earlier .
As a result , prime loans account for a larger proportion of foreclosures than they did in August 2007 .
In Murrieta , Jones said she never wanted anything other than a safe , prime loan .
She has worked nearly nonstop since she was 19 .
She moved from El Cajon to Murrieta in 2005 with her adult daughter , who provided $ 20,000 of the $ 80,000 down payment on the new three - bedroom home .
Advertisement
With property values still rising , they took out a second mortgage for home improvements in 2006 , a 15 - year loan for $ 40,000 with a fixed interest rate of 9.25 % , bringing their total mortgage debt to about $ 355,000 .
Between her salary in Corona and her daughter ’s work at a preschool , the $ 2,276 in monthly home loan payments was manageable .
Jones , whose recent duties in Corona included badgering the owners of foreclosed homes to maintain the properties , had survived a round of city layoffs this spring but was not so lucky when Oct. 2 arrived .
“ I came in that morning and I was gone by 10 a.m. , ” she said .
To make things worse , her daughter recently had been laid off from the preschool .
Jones figures she owes about $ 100,000 more on the mortgages than her home ’s current value .
She said she notified Bank of America Corp .'s Countrywide unit , which funded both loans , soon after she lost her job -- the approach the lender urges troubled borrowers to take .
Advertisement
But the Calabasas lender declined to talk about changing the loan terms so long as she was current on payments , she said .
So she intentionally missed an Oct. 15 deadline , then called Countrywide again and asked for help .
The lender offered to reduce her total payment to $ 1,500 for three months , adding the difference back to her loan balance , she said .
But when Countrywide said the arrangement would damage her credit score , she declined the offer , dipping into her savings to make the full payments .
Asked for comment early this month , Countrywide did n’t dispute Jones ’ account .
Representatives of the lender called later that day with a better offer .
Jones said late last week that she was working with Countrywide to finalize a deal that would lower her payments for three months -- with an option for significant , longer - term modifications .
Levy , the Palo Alto economist , said stories like Jones ’ and the ominous mortgage delinquency trends illustrated the “ critical importance ” for the economy of having lenders work to keep troubled borrowers in their homes .

“ The only practical help in sight is to get as many of these potential foreclosures modified as possible , so they come off the market , ” he said .

When the chief executives of General Motors and Ford said they'd take $ 1 a year in salary if Congress bailed their companies out , I rolled my eyes .
Not for a moment did that gesture make me feel better about the possibility of the automakers receiving welfare .
Who in their right mind thinks a chief executive earning a $ 1 a year is actually making a sacrifice ?
Last year , the CEOs of at least 32 companies took the symbolic salary of $ 1 a year , according to Equilar Inc .
We regular wage earners know darn well these guys will get stock options , benefits , and perks that far exceed what most of us will earn in our lifetimes .
From 2006 to 2007 , the median value of total stock holdings and accumulated retirement benefits for Fortune 500 chief executives increased 6.1 percent , to $ 56.7 million .
These amounts include pension benefits , deferred compensation , outstanding stock - option awards , unvested stock awards , and shares owned outright .
Executive compensation has again become a hot - button issue as company after company tanks , taking the economy along with them .
On a gut level , it just feels so morally wrong for executives to earn millions while shareholders and employees are suffering so badly .
Ideally , executive compensation should be set by the marketplace .
Pay for performance is what we all expect on our jobs .
But we know that chief executives , at least those running major corporations , are different .
There 's so much more at stake when they fail to do their jobs properly .
Just look at the auto industry .
The executives who ran Chrysler , Ford , and GM off the road are still getting compensated handsomely while begging for a bailout .
Even if their companies go broke , the bigwigs will still get millions .
But there 's some good that could be had from the current crisis .
When someone is pleading for a handout , you can get something in exchange .
It would be idiotic if Congress did n't find a way to better control the way CEOs and their immediate underlings are compensated .
If we now have an economy in which we can't allow certain industries or companies to fail , then we need better governance over executive compensation .
We need checks and balances so that top executives are n't allowed to run firms into the ground while enjoying outrageous pay packages .
Perhaps one way is to focus more on the boards that approve executive pay .
Let 's hold accountable the people responsible for granting the monstrous stock options , bonuses , golden parachutes , and other benefits .
Last year , according to preliminary findings by the Corporate Library , an independent research firm , median total compensation for individual directors of S&P 500 companies was nearly $ 200,000 .
This is the third year of double - digit increases for directors and boards .
Is it no wonder that executive pay is so high ?
The people determining how much executives will get are lapping up the money , too .

Research by dating site FreeDating .co.uk found that 36 % of women would end a relationship over an ' inadequate ' Christmas gift .
This was particularly the case when the present was the latest in a series of disappointing let - downs within the relationship .
Examples of gifts which were deemed inadequate included cooking utensils , cleaning products , and a sticky tape dispenser .
Generally speaking , it seems common sense to think that devices meant to cook for a significant other or clean the house would be a bad idea - but that 's why science studies are needed .
Highly educated women were much more likely to end a relationship for this reason than those with no qualifications .
Women working in the legal profession were especially demanding , nearly two thirds of whom considered a poor present as grounds for ditching a partner .
Hey , they make $ 300 an hour so they probably bought you something nice .
You can do the same .
Just 17 % of men would end a relationship over their partner 's choice of Christmas present .
Which means that , once again , men are the less materialistic gender - and we mostly care about sex .
Dan Winchester of FreeDating.co.uk commented : " Clearly men and women attach different levels of significance to gifts within relationships .
The danger is that men will judge the importance of their gift choice for a partner based on their own expectations , which are dramatically lower . "
About this research :
This research was based on an online poll of 5,032 UK members of FreeDating.co.uk , questioned between 4th and 8th of December 2008 .
IT start - up Bastionhost has purchased an former government continuity bunker in Nova Scotia as part of its plan to build a " Dataville " of data centers in the province .
Bastionhost today announced a deal with the Colchester Regional Development Agency ( CoRDA ) to buy properties on the outskirts of Truro , Nova Scotia to serve as the nucleus of the planned network of facilities .
The properties include a 64,000 square foot former government continuity headquarters bunker known as a " Diefenbunker " because it was built during the era of then Prime Minister John Diefenbaker at the height of the Cuban missile crisis .
The facility , which was built to withstand an atomic blast and protect occupants from nuclear fallout is one of a network of six Diefenbunkers built across Canada .
The 45 year - old bunker features geothermal cooling , a sophisticated air filtration system , and redundant backup power engineered to military specifications .
The building will house Dataville ’s network operations center and provide business continuity and disaster recovery workstations .
Bastionhost introduced the Dataville concept last summer , focusing on financial clients in New York and London .
“ There ’s pent - up demand for this type of critical infrastructure for computer systems that power the Internet , and the people behind the scenes who keep them running , ” says Anton Self , Bastionhost ’s founder and CEO .
“ Enterprises and governments scramble to manage and store ever - increasing amounts of digital information , while worldwide demand for data centres is outstripping supply by a factor of three to one . ”
Self said he has been intrigued for years by the prospect of building data centers in underground bunkers .
“ I first looked at the bunker in 1999 , but the concept of serving both New York and London from Nova Scotia was probably years ahead of its time , " said Self . " The world has evolved since then .
Reliance on the Internet has exploded , while insurance underwriters and business continuity managers have been pushing server farms like Dataville farther out of cities into more rural locations , less subject to the constraints , costs and high risks posed by metropolitan areas . ”
The Dataville vision sees Nova Scotia emerging as an " information Switzerland " due to its central location between London and New York .
Bastionhost says Canada ’s strong privacy laws offer another advantage to financial firms wary of the USA Patriot Act , which complicates hosting in the U.S. for some Canadian and European companies .
“ We ’ll put this Dr. Strangelove style building to profitable use , while incorporating the latest technologies and best practices for our customers in North America and Europe , ” said Self .
Among the services Bastionhost envisions is " hot parking " for data center containers in a facility that offers hookups for water , power and network and a sheltered storage environment .
Bastionhost did not disclose how much it was paying for the bunker in Debert , Nova Scotia .
Local media reports indicate the building has been assessed at $ 290,000 .
" We are quite pleased with this deal , " said Alan Johnson , spokesman for the Colchester Regional Development Agency , who said it cost about $ 60,000 a year to maintain the bunker .

When can we be rid of such dangerously incompetent and arrogant people from positions of trust and power ?
To make matters worse , the 38 - year - old then raced off the train , leaving a file of documents behind .
Shocked passengers told how Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Purnell left his red box wide open while he wandered around the train making calls on his mobile .
The embarrassing gaffe comes days after civil servant Richard Jackson was fined for leaving top secret documents relating to al - Qaeda and Iraq on a train .
Ministers are warned against taking their Cabinet briefcases on public transport amid fears secret papers could be lost or stolen .
The rising Labour star - tipped as a future PM - broke strict guidelines by taking documents out of his " red box " on the trip .
It is said that a fish starts to rot from the head first , so it comes as no surprise that the ambitious , arrogant , yet inept , Government Minister with direct responsibility for the Government Gateway passwords etc. USB memory device scandal ( see the immediately previous Spy Blog article ) is James Purnell , the former Labour party apparatchik and now Secretary of State for Work and Pensions .
Among the private letters was one about the plight of Wayne Bowers , including his name , address and national insurance number .
He was furious last night when told of Mr Purnell 's carelessness .
Jobless Mr Bowers , 35 , from Manchester had asked for help from his MP Gerald Kaufman to sort out a benefit claim .
Mr Purnell 's reply to Mr Kaufman was among documents left on the train .
An outraged Mr Bowers said : " I feel violated .
To think that my personal details are in a letter a minister just leaves lying around on a train beggars belief .
This is confidential information .
It 's out of order and I deserve an apology . "
A personal , public apology from James Purnell would be fair , but , given his attitude , it seems unlikely .
Hopefully the electorate will punish him for his arrogance and incompetence .
Mr Purnell was travelling first class on the Virgin Pendolino 9.06 am service from Macclesfield , Cheshire , to Euston , London , on October 4 .
Fellow travellers said Mr Purnell thought nothing of emptying his ministerial box on to the table in front of him .
He also left the red box - marked with the words Secretary of State .
Department of Work and Pensions - unlocked and with papers on the table .
One fellow traveller told the Sunday Mirror : " We recognised him straight away and he seemed to be showing off a bit .
" He kept leaving the box and walking in and out of the carriage talking on his mobile .
" I think he realised people knew who he was and was playing the big man .
His behaviour was unbelievable .
He was very arrogant . "
Arrogant , incompetent and criminally negligent with the public 's private data - a typical Labour Cabinet Minister .
Some astonished passengers took photos and videoed Mr Purnell 's red box as it lay unguarded in the carriage .
As the train pulled into Euston , Mr Purnell hurriedly pulled his papers together and rushed off .
Two women - on a business trip to France - picked up the documents he had left behind on the floor .
They tried to find Mr Purnell , but he had disappeared so they had to take the file to Paris with them .
Once there , one of the women tried to inform the authorities they had found government papers , but no one would take her seriously .
She said : " Even when I telephoned Mr Purnell 's department in London I was told that nothing had gone missing .
That obviously highlights some incompetence or deliberate lies ,
" In the end we simply put all the documents together and got them back to London early in the new week . "
It took three days for the papers to find their way back to Mr Purnell 's Whitehall HQ .
Last night , Mr Purnell denied he had been using his red box recklessly or was guilty of losing crucial info .
His spokesman said : " It was one file from an MP with the attached correspondence and was returned safely within three days .
" Obviously , James is very sorry for the mistake .
He has not broken any rules or guidelines . "
Very sorry that he got caught , probably .
James Purnell has broken the law , not just rules or guidelines .
The Data Protection Act 1998 applies to paper correspondence as well as to electronic documents , and specifically covers sensitive personal information , such as that of the MP 's constituent .
The Official Secrets Act 1989 section 8 Safeguarding of information , specifically applies to a " Crown servant " , a term which includes a Cabinet Minister .
Former Cabinet minister Peter Kilfoyle set out guidelines on carrying red boxes in 1999 .
He said : " Where it is necessary to carry red boxes by public transport , they should be effectively disguised . "
One former minister said : " It seems he has been very careless . "
With two such massive breaches in trust and security and privacy in his department , one of which he was personally responsible for , any Minister with any honour would offer his resignation , .
Will James Purnell resign with honour , or will he try to hang on to his position of power ?

While some are prone to speculate that Cuban is a scapegoat because of his politics , the facts of the case -- as initially laid out by the government , and certain to be contested by Cuban and his lawyers -- read like a textbook example of insider trading .
The government alleges that Cuban learned of an action that would lower the stock price of an Internet startup called Mamma.com in which he was a major investor , and he sold his stock to unwitting buyers before the news was made public , and at a higher price than it traded for after the move .
Nevermind , that Cuban 's transaction was more than four years ago , or that the money he saved by acting as he did , $ 750,000 or so , is a drop in the bucket compared to Cuban 's net worth -- shades of the Martha Stewart case -- or to the market cap of the stock ( at least at that time ) .
It would have been remarkably easy for the feds to look the other way and to ignore what Cuban is accused of doing .

“ You do n’t just suddenly lose $ 120 billion overnight , ” said Donn Vickrey of Gradient Analytics , an independent securities research firm in Scottsdale , Ariz .
Mr. Vickrey says he believes AIG must have already accumulated tens of billions of dollars worth of losses by mid-September , when it came close to collapse and received an $ 85 billion emergency line of credit by the Fed .
That loan was later supplemented by a $ 38 billion lending facility .
But losses on that scale do not show up in the company ’s financial filings .
Instead , AIG replenished its capital by issuing $ 20 billion in stock and debt in May and reassured investors that it had an ample cushion .
It also said that it was making its accounting more precise .
Mr. Vickery and other analysts are examining the company ’s disclosures for clues that the cushion was threadbare and that company officials knew they had major losses months before the bailout .
Tantalizing support for this argument comes from what appears to have been a behind - the - scenes clash at the company over how to value some of its derivatives contracts .
An accountant brought in by the company because of an earlier scandal was pushed to the sidelines on this issue , and the company ’s outside auditor , PricewaterhouseCoopers , warned of a material weakness months before the government bailout .
The internal auditor resigned and is now in seclusion , according to a former colleague .
His account , from a prepared text , was read by Representative Henry A. Waxman , Democrat of California and chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , in a hearing this month .
These accounting questions are of interest not only because taxpayers are footing the bill at AIG but also because the post - mortems may point to a fundamental flaw in the Fed bailout : the money is buoying an insurer — and its trading partners — whose cash needs could easily exceed the existing government backstop if the housing sector continues to deteriorate .
Edward M. Liddy , the insurance executive brought in by the government to restructure AIG , has already said that although he does not want to seek more money from the Fed , he may have to do so .
Continuing Risk
Fear that the losses are bigger and that more surprises are in store is one of the factors beneath the turmoil in the credit markets , market participants say .
“ When investors do n’t have full and honest information , they tend to sell everything , both the good and bad assets , ” said Janet Tavakoli , president of Tavakoli Structured Finance , a consulting firm in Chicago .
“ It ’s really bad for the markets .
Things do n’t heal until you take care of that . ”
AIG has declined to provide a detailed account of how it has used the Fed ’s money .
The company said it could not provide more information ahead of its quarterly report , expected next week , the first under new management .
The Fed releases a weekly figure , most recently showing that $ 90 billion of the $ 123 billion available has been drawn down .
AIG has outlined only broad categories : some is being used to shore up its securities - lending program , some to make good on its guaranteed investment contracts , some to pay for day - to - day operations and — of perhaps greatest interest to watchdogs — tens of billions of dollars to post collateral with other financial institutions , as required by AIG ’s many derivatives contracts .
No information has been supplied yet about who these counterparties are , how much collateral they have received or what additional tripwires may require even more collateral if the housing market continues to slide .
Ms. Tavakoli said she thought that instead of pouring in more and more money , the Fed should bring AIG together with all its derivatives counterparties and put a moratorium on the collateral calls .
“ We did that with ACA , ” she said , referring to ACA Capital Holdings , a bond insurance company that filed for bankruptcy in 2007 .
Of the two big Fed loans , the smaller one , the $ 38 billion supplementary lending facility , was extended solely to prevent further losses in the securities - lending business .
So far , $ 18 billion has been drawn down for that purpose .
For securities lending , an institution with a long time horizon makes extra money by lending out securities to shorter - term borrowers .
The borrowers are often hedge funds setting up short trades , betting a stock ’s price will fall .
They typically give AIG cash or cashlike instruments in return .
Then , while AIG waits for the borrowers to bring back the securities , it invests the money .
It 's a three - part question .
What is consciousness ?
Can you put it in a machine ?
And if you did , how could you ever know for sure ?
Unlike any other scientific topics , consciousness -- the first - person awareness of the world around -- is truly in the eye of the beholder .
I know I am conscious .
But how do I know that you are ?
Could it be that my colleagues , my friends , my editors , my wife , my child , all the people I see on the streets of New York are actually just mindless automatons who merely act as if they were conscious human beings ?
That would make this question moot .
Through logical analogy -- I am a conscious human being , and therefore you as a human being are also likely to be conscious -- I conclude I am probably not the only conscious being in a world of biological puppets .
Extend the question of consciousness to other creatures , and uncertainty grows .
Is a dog conscious ?
A turtle ?
A fly ?
An elm ?
A rock ?

As we know from the works of Cormac McCarthy , despair can be kind of gratifying .
And yet , as much as I hate to disturb our national mood of decline , I have some good news regarding the auto industry .
You may return to your comfort drinking presently .
The 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid , and its twin , the Mercury Milan Hybrid , are mid-to - full - size sedans that seat five in surprising comfort and offer a full - size trunk measuring around 12 cubic feet .
They measure 190.6 inches long and weigh a goodly 3,720 pounds .
The gas - electric output is 191 horsepower and zero to 60 mph acceleration is under 9 seconds .
The retail price of a nicely equipped Fusion Hybrid -- with blandishments such as rearview camera , blind - spot alert and 17 - inch alloy wheels -- is $ 27,270 .
With the applicable federal tax credit , the car should cost consumers about $ 25,000 , I estimate ( final numbers have not been announced ) .
On a test drive of a Fusion Hybrid last week in West L.A. traffic , I managed , without much trouble , to get 52 mpg in mixed city - highway driving .

Wait , so , has somebody invented the car of the future and did n’t tell us ?
It ’s a worthy question .
The scolding undercurrent of recent congressional hearings on the auto - industry bailout was the notion that Detroit had failed to invest in next - generation technology that could help wean us off foreign oil .
Not so .
What they did fail to do was sufficiently commercialize this technology so that it was ready and waiting at dealerships when people got stampeded this year by spiraling gas prices .
Had Ford made a few hundred thousand of these cars available in June -- along with the financing to sell them -- we’d be erecting 50 - foot equestrian statues of William Clay Ford and Alan Mulally in city squares , and the streets of Dearborn , Mich. , would be repaved with diamond cobblestones .
As it was , the meme of national incompetence and inferiority vis-a - vis the Japanese carmakers -- Toyota , Honda -- was again reinforced .
Of course , Detroit ca n’t build a desirable high - mileage car .
We ’re the country that bungled Iraq and bred a Bernard Madoff , that turned the mortgage market into three - card monte and put Britney back on top .
It would seem almost a shame to interrupt the soothing pleasures of such self - pity .
Advertisement
And yet , here we are , with a car that seemed purely theoretical -- a desirable , affordable , no - compromise sedan that gets 40 - plus mpg -- about to show up at Ford dealerships in the first quarter of 2009 .
Somebody ought to tell Thomas Friedman .
Now what ?
Now people have to buy them .
For all the game - changing glow around the Ford Fusion Hybrid , it ’s actually a fairly conservative and programmatic approach to gas- electric propulsion .
The system is an evolution of the hybrid system in the Ford Escape .
The battery is nickel - metal hydride , not lithium ( lithium chemistry batteries are lighter and more energy - dense , but they are also expensive and finicky , which is to say , flammable ) .
The nickel battery will please many in the green - car movement who argue that the search for the perfect battery -- a la the Chevy Volt -- has only delayed development of the good .
( Edmund Burke said the worst thing a man can do is do nothing because he can do only a little . )
Advertisement
The Sanyo - supplied battery pack -- 270 volts and 1.4 kWh , if that helps -- is 30 % smaller in volume and 23 % lighter than the one in the Escape .
The smaller battery is easier to cool , requiring only cabin air ducted from underneath the back seat .
The battery supplies enough glowing ponies to propel the car to speeds up to 47 mph on all - electric power .
This is key to the car ’s in - city mileage .
On my 50 - mile drive , I was able to feather - foot the throttle enough to accelerate to commuting speeds without waking the gas engine .
When I needed to accelerate faster , I could dip in to the engine horsepower briefly to overcome inertia , then maintain momentum with the electric motor .
At one stage I was getting 63 mpg .
To make a full - size car go fast on electric power alone , you need a boatload of voltage .
But high - voltage systems involve increased impedance and heat losses , which is wasted energy .
To unknot this problem , the Fusion uses a variable - voltage converter that temporarily steps up system voltage during peak demand or hard braking , when the battery is forcefully recharged .
This is actually one of two high - tech converters on board :
The second system provides juice to an array of high - voltage systems such as steering , air - conditioning and brakes .
Advertisement
There ’s a lot of other arcane technology that goes into a car , like reams of software code that allow all the various components to talk sweetly to one another .
But perhaps the most valuable bit of software is the wetware , the stuff between the driver ’s ears .
To that end , the Fusion Hybrid uses a delightful , LCD instrument cluster with modules that coach drivers on how to save fuel .
In one panel , the more lightly you drive , the more leaves that grow on a set of animated vines .
You can go from lead - footed , gas - bingeing knucklehead ( like me ) to abstemious hyper - miler in a matter of minutes .
Brilliant .
So , is this the better mousetrap we ’ve been waiting for ?
Well , there ’s a problem .
The price of gas has dropped by two - thirds in six months , thereby de-motivating buyers who might have been willing to bear the incremental cost of a hybrid .
What we really need is an increased federal gas tax , but the chances of that getting passed in Congress are comparable to my chances of being named Miss Universe .
Ugh .
I ’m getting depressed again .

The world 's biggest mining company BHP Billiton has pulled out of its $ 100 billion bid for its rival Rio Tinto .
The company says the global economic downturn and the drop in commodity prices are behind the collapse of one of the biggest takeover bids in history .
The board of BHP Billiton is abandoning its offer for Rio Tinto because it says the takeover is no longer in the best interests of shareholders .
The company says it understands the main regulator still needed to approve the bid , and the European Commission will ask it to sell assets to deal with competition concerns .
But BHP says it will not offer any remedies to the regulator , because of the difficulty of achieving fair values for those assets in the current climate .
BHP chief executive Marius Kloppers says cancelling the bid was a tough decision .
But he says after the fall in commodity prices , BHP cannot risk taking on Rio Tinto 's tens of billions of dollars of debt or the difficulty of selling off assets in the current climate to placate competition concerns .
" We can not go forward with this deal if we do n't create value for both sets of shareholders , and that 's the conclusion that we reached today , " he said .
He says even if Europe 's competition regulator were to approve the bid , the board would recommend shareholders vote against the deal .
But even though BHP says it is trying to protect shareholders , it will still write off almost $ 500 million in costs related to the bid process over the past year - and - a - half .
' High risk '
Mining analyst Gavin Wendt from Fat Prophets told ABC Radio's PM program he is not surprised BHP has pulled out of its bid for Rio .
" This was always a high risk , a highly uncertain strategy and basically financial markets as they 've panned out over the last six to 12 months , have basically knocked it on the head , " he said .
" Of course there was the uncertainty with regards to European Commission approval and the European Commission has expressed concerns over the takeover .
" At the end of the day I think for BHP to actually meet the European Commission 's concerns was going to lead to a sell - off of key iron assets that would have destroyed the whole rationale for the merger in the first place . "
He says the continued deterioration of global economic conditions and falling commodity prices have also played a part .
" There 's a lot of uncertainty around in financial markets and it's very , very hard to raise debt financing .
It just makes it very , very difficult to launch any sort of takeover bid , particularly at the big end of the market ; we 're talking about one of the biggest takeover bids in corporate history , " he said .
" We 're in uncharted waters and whilst BHP and Rio Tinto are amongst the world 's best managed companies , this has thrown a tremendous spanner in the works .
" I think the prudent course of action for BHP is just to sit tight and keep its powder dry and perhaps look at another tilt at Rio Tinto down the track once financial markets have improved and uncertainty has been removed from the market . "
He says only time will tell what impact the decision will have on confidence in the resources sector .
" Obviously confidence in the market generally has taken a big hit over the last couple of months , but at the end of the day , I agree with the comments of BHP and Rio Tinto , that longer term we 're going to see strong growth out of China , we 're going to see strong growth out of the emerging economies and the fundamental medium to longer term picture has n't changed , " he said .
" Although of course we 've seen a big short term deterioration in markets and commodity demand , that 's obviously impacted on BHP 's decision , but I think the longer term picture is still extremely sound . "
The moon will appear high in the night sky A full moon has occurred closer to the Earth than it has done at any time for the past 15 years .
The Moon 's elliptical orbit means its distance from the Earth is not constant .
It was a little over 350,000 km away as it passed over the northern hemisphere , about 30,000 km closer than usual .
Astronomers said the moon would appear brighter and larger than usual , but the sky in the UK was almost completely covered by cloud .
Closest path Friday 's full moon was predicted to appear up to 14 % bigger and 30 % brighter than other full moons this year , according to Nasa .
The Moon 's orbit is elliptical , meaning it does not follow a circular but rather an oval path .
It has reached the point where this oval orbit is nearest to the Earth .
" It 's only every few years that a full moon happens to coincide with the part of the Moon 's orbit when its closest to the Earth , " said Marek Kukula , an astronomer at the UK's Royal Observatory .
The moon appears largest as it rises and sets , but this is a psychological illusion , Dr Kukula said .
" When it 's close to the horizon , our brain interprets it as being bigger than it actually is , this is called the moon illusion , " he said .
" The size may be striking when it 's near the horizon , " said Robert Massey of the UK Royal Astronomical Society .
However , he cautioned against expecting too much .
" The Moon may be brighter and may appear somewhat larger , but it 's really quite hard for the eye to notice the difference ; the eye will compensate for the extra brightness , it 's not like going from night to day , " said Dr Massey .
The Moon 's brightness varies throughout its annual cycle , during the mid-winter in the northern hemisphere it can appear brighter simply because it is higher in the sky .

ANN ARBOR , Mich . -- Rich Rodriguez loves to win -- and he hates to lose as much as anyone .
Michigan 's coach , though , tries to keep as much perspective as he can .
Rodriguez has his wife and kids around him after practices , at the team hotel and on bus trips to the stadium .
His office door is always wide open , allowing visitors to say hello .
Heading into his first Michigan - Ohio State game -- where the Wolverines are expected to extend their dubious record with a ninth loss -- he tried to deliver a message to fans who have lost touch .
" It 's amazing some of the things that people would say [ on a message board ] or yell at you of a personal nature , " Rodriguez said Monday .
" You almost want to tell them , ' Get a life . '
" There 's a whole lot bigger problems .
Look at the economy . "
College football 's winningest team has tumbled like the stock market , losing a school - record eight games and getting beat a Michigan Stadium - record five times at home .
For the first time since 1974 , the Wolverines will be relegated to watching bowl games .

This is just one example of the menu at " Cuteness " a recently opened restaurant in the Los Angeles area that has caused a little controversy .
Each menu consists of a photo and a bio of each animal and reservations have to be made at the minimum of a month in advance .
The entrees vary from small cute bunnies , hamsters & ducklings to the larger family meals that consist of fawns & calves .
Menu 's have to be requested and are received in a gold envelope with a personalized touch .
Once the meal has been selected the future diners must put down a $ 500 deposit and return their selections .
Two weeks prior to the reservation the diners are required to travel 40 miles outside of the city to a farm .
This farm is where all of the animals reside and the diners are required to spend the day with their future meal .
Caring for , feeding , walking and bathing are a few of the activities that are scheduled for the day .
Once the day has been completed the future diners decide whether to keep the reservation or take the animal home .
A contract is signed prior to the farm visit that states a decision to either not keep the reservation or not taking the animal home will result in a $ 10,000 fine .
This allows the restaurant owners to protect themselves against those who may try and undermine their process and keep the animal activists at bay .
" There is nothing wrong with what we are doing .
There are many restaurants that do much worse .
We care for the animals and treat them with respect " says the owner Paulie Butcher .
" Our guests get a unique experience .
Many find it wonderful that they can bond with and even thank the animal before they dine .
It can be very emotional " .
Although many groups have been protesting it has n't stopped Cuteness from operating successfully and they are currently booked through June of 2009 .
Entree prices range from $ 450 - $ 9,200 and is given three - and - a - half out of four stars .
The children 's mother , who claimed she was asleep in another room at the time the video was made and was not charged , terminated her parental rights last year and the boys are now living with another family and awaiting adoption .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran ’s hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad congratulated U.S. President - elect Barack Obama on Thursday and called for “ fundamental and fair ” changes to U.S. policies in the region , Iran ’s official IRNA news agency said .
Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad answers questions at a news conference during the 63rd United Nations General Assembly at the U.N. headquarters in New York , September 23 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Chip East
“ I congratulate you for attracting a majority of votes ... I hope you will prefer real public interests and justice to the endless demands of a selfish minority , ” Ahmadinejad told Obama in a statement published by IRNA .
Iranian officials have said Obama ’s election victory on Tuesday showed the American people ’s desire for fundamental change in domestic and foreign policy from the policies of President George W. Bush , who labeled Iran part of an “ axis of evil . ”
“ The great Iranian nation welcomes real , fundamental and fair changes in America ’s behavior and policies , particularly in the Middle East region , ” Ahmadinejad said .
Tehran and Washington cut diplomatic ties shortly after Iran ’s Islamic revolution , which toppled the U.S. - backed Shah .
The two countries have since been at odds over various issues , including Iran ’s nuclear program , which Washington and its European allies say is a cover to build nuclear bombs .
Iran insists its aim is to generate electricity .
Washington has accused Iran of funding , equipping and training militants in Iraq .
Iran denies this and says insecurity is due to the presence of U.S. troops who should quit Iraq .
Ahmadinejad said he hoped Obama would put an end to the United States ’ “ war - oriented ” policies .
“ Other nations expect war - oriented policies , occupation , bullying ... and imposing discriminatory policies on them to be replaced by those advocating respect ... and non-interference in other countries ’ state matters , ” he said .
Obama has said he would toughen sanctions on Iran but has also held out the possibility of direct talks to resolve rows , including Tehran ’s nuclear dispute with the West .
The president - elect , like Bush , has not ruled out military action although he has criticized the outgoing administration for not pushing for more diplomacy and engagement with Iran .
Tehran has warned its response to any military action would be tough and would include targeting U.S. interests and America ’s ally Israel .
Iran ’s Prosecutor - General Ayatollah Qorban - Ali Dori- Najafabadi called on Obama on Thursday to show goodwill and remove sanctions against the Islamic Republic , the semi-official Mehr news agency reported .
“ Through the lifting of the past government ’s cruel sanctions against Iran , Barack Obama can demonstrate his goodwill to the Iranian people , ” he said .
“ Calling for forgiveness and remorse for the past U.S. government ’s deeds by the new government can bring about the great Iranian nation ’s forgiveness . ”
Iran ’s refusal to suspend its sensitive nuclear work has led to three rounds of U.N. sanctions since 2006 , as well as bilateral punitive measures by Washington .
Iran has rejected world powers ’ demand to halt uranium enrichment , a process that can have civilian and military uses , in exchange for trade and other benefits .
a season for everything and a time for every purpose under heaven
Before the dawning of 2017 , there were numerous assumptions and predictions as to how the economic state would unfold .
Aside from that , there was the highly anticipated Presidential Election where fortunately for the president - elect he or she would steer an already strong economy .
Nonetheless , regarding the California Construction Forecast for 2017 , Dodge Data & Analytics economists have several predictions as to this unfolding .
The forecast states a modest increase by a considerable 5 % following a significant anemic growth the previous year ( 2016 ) inspired by a series of continued solid growth over the years .
The forecast is outlined on Industry segments with the single family housing and commercial buildings set to witness a significant growth while multifamily is expected to maintain its considerably flat trajectory , according to a local California bond company .
Single Family Housing
Among the industry segments expected to experience a significant increase in growth is the single - family housing .
The figures are expected to take a vertical curve with a 12 % rise for 2017 which is equivalent to an increase of 9 % about units .
The home mortgage access is continually improving , and part of the caution and hesitance formerly exhibited by prospect homebuyers is expected to gradually decrease courtesy of continued growth in employment and subsequent low rates of a mortgage .
Millenial - generation older members are currently shifting towards the age bracket of 30 - 35 years - a factor that should continually skyrocket single family housing demand .
Multifamily Housing
The 2017 forecast expects a flat trajectory when it comes to the Multifamily housing with a down of 2 % about units .
The greatest year for this industry is probably back in 2015 which was inspired by a significant amount of activity which spread from New York and trickled down to California , but this seems to be slowly growing calm .
Contractor Bonding rates have remained low with should help to stimulate growth .
The growth of this sector even in other metropolitan regions coupled with healthy market particulars is set to maintain its curve at gradual .
Commercial Buildings
Commercial buildings - a segment of the construction industry is the sector that has been experiencing momentous growth over the years and with 12 % gain estimation back in 2016 , 2017 is expected to have the same momentum although with an increase of 6 % .
The most improved in recent years from significantly low gains is Office construction , and with the establishment of some signature office room towers coupled with significant development efforts at the downtown market level , the increase is justifiable .
Store construction is also expected to exhibit some improvement leaps coming off a dreadfully subdued 2016 together with a further growth for warehouses .
Nonetheless , for Hotel construction which has been on a steady curve , its solid 2016 numbers are expected to retreat .
Institutional Buildings
On the Institutional building , 2017 is a year where the growth is expected to shoot up to double figures ( 10 % ) .
This is characteristic of a comeback following paused growth both in 2016 and 2015 .
The category of educational facilities is set to have a boost with the continued increase in construction of standard K - 12 school coupled by the recent passing of bond measures for school construction .
The amusement segment ( sports arenas , conventional centers and casinos , etc. ) is also expected to add to the growth not to mention transportation terminals .
Manufacturing Plants
With steep declines for both years 2015 and 2015 , 2017 is set to see a wonderful 6 % increase overall and an indication of good recovery .

Current Obsession : Living Safely From Police
Lois Feldman Fired After Metrodome Sex Arrest ( Photos )
of Carroll , Iowa was enjoying a one sided college football game ( 55 - 0 ) between her beloved Iowa Hawkeyes and the Minnesota Gophers last weekend when she suddenly opted to engage in a quickie sex romp with a stranger in the Minneapolis Metrodome men's room and " ruined her life . "
The 38 year old fan and mother of three attended the game with her husband , who declined an invitation to accompany his wife to the restroom .
She set off on her own and the next thing she knew , she was being thrown around by police officers in a handicap stall of the men's bathroom after engaging in sex with a 26 year old stranger while more than a dozen people cheered them on .
The male half of the impromptu liaison was identified as Ross Walsh of Linden , Iowa .
He was at the game with his girlfriend , who took him home after police released him to her .
Feldman used a fictitious name but police were able to track down her husband in the facility and released her to him .
It was probably a long ride back to Iowa for both couples .
The newly bonded ' odd ' couple were each charged with misdemeanor indecent conduct .
Luke Huck , the first police officer on the scene , described them as upset , intoxicated and uncooperative .
The offense could result in a fine and a 60 day jail sentence .
Lois calls her behavior uncharacteristic and believes she was drugged .
Her husband blames himself for not realizing she was too intoxicated to head off to the bathroom on her own .
She was subsequently fired from her job as an administrator at a Carroll retirement home .
That bombshell was dropped on her yesterday .
Feldman , who describes herself as a light drinker , has consulted an attorney , Jeff Minnich , who believes she should fight the charges because she has no recollection of what took place and therefore is not responsible for her actions .
Minnesota law states that intoxication is not a defense for any crime .
We 've managed to locate a photo of Lois Feldman .

Analyst denies pushing recruit toward Notre Dame
By Thomas O'Toole , USA TODAY
WASHINGTON 
One of the nation 's top high school football players from last season says prominent recruiting analyst Tom Lemming told him he would be " showcased " and would increase his chances of being most valuable player in the annual U.S. Army All - American Bowl high school all - star game " if I kept a certain school on my ( recruiting ) list . "
Myron Rolle , a Princeton , N.J. , defensive back who already has enrolled at Florida State , made the remarks Monday morning to a public forum on the " Collegiate Athlete Experience " conducted at George Washington University by the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics .
They came in response to a question about the recruiting process and also were carried live on a webcast .
USA TODAY Rolle
Approached afterward by USA TODAY , Rolle said the school in question was Notre Dame and reiterated his comments about Lemming , a national recruiting expert from Chicago whose information is used extensively by this newspaper .
" He told me if I kept Notre Dame in mind , the NBC ( TV ) guy would interview me and they would showcase me during the game , " Rolle said .
NBC , which showed the high school game in San Antonio on Jan. 7 , also has a contract for Notre Dame home games .
Added Rolle : " He told me I 'd have a higher chance of being MVP .
I took it as having less of a chance of getting MVP if I did n't keep Notre Dame on my list . "
Rolle , who did not list Notre Dame among his six finalists , said Lemming told him this last spring .
He also said Lemming tried to interest him in schools other than FSU , something he originally told ESPN The Magazine last summer .
" He stepped out of the bounds of what he should be doing , " said Rolle , who added that recruiting analysts should simply be gathering information .
Lemming , contacted by cellphone as he prepares to do football signing - day commentary Wednesday on CSTV , flatly denied ever talking to Rolle about the all - star game or suggesting he could be MVP if he kept Notre Dame on a list .
Lemming
" Myron is the biggest media hound that I 've ever seen , " said Lemming , who is involved with staging the all - star game .
" I selected him for this game in September , and he played in the game .
" ( Criticism ) is part of the business when you select an All - American team .
Myron 's taking it to a new level .
It hurt his ego when he was n't first - team All - American . "
He also said if Rolle construed questions about other schools as an attempt to sway him , he concedes he could have phrased something differently but felt he was making a legitimate point .
Rolle is an outstanding student who has said wants to go to med school .
Lemming said he merely questioned his choice of FSU when Rolle had offers from Stanford and Duke among others and " told me he wanted to go to the best school possible .
... I took it as asking a legit question . "
Lemming says he had Rolle among his top recruits in the summer but dropped him to 28th as the season progressed because he said he did n't play well .
Rolle , whom newspapers in New Jersey said missed three games because of injuries , played in the U.S. Army game .

Alberta and Saskatchewan are determined to clean up coal and pump carbon dioxide back into the ground , two achievements that would turn the world 's dirtiest fossil fuels – coal and tar - sands oil – into a climate - friendly source of energy .
That 's the theory .
Last week , Edmonton - based Epcor Utilities filed two " expressions of interest " with the Alberta government in hopes of tapping funds from the province 's $ 2 billion climate - change action plan .
The power utility wants to build a new type of " clean coal " plant that turns coal into a hydrogen - rich gas .
Pollutants are then removed from the gas before it is burned to generated electricity .
Epcor touted the proposed plant , based on a technology called Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle , as the " first commercial - scale near - zero emission thermal power plant in Canada . "
Among the pollutants that could be kept out of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide , which would presumably be captured and piped underground for permanent storage — assuming such an option existed today .
The other filing was for a project that would retrofit an existing coal plant so that up to 10 per cent of carbon dioxide could be scrubbed from its flue - gas emissions .
Again , this greenhouse gas would presumably be piped underground somewhere , some day .
That 's right , just 10 per cent would be captured .
Just next door , the Saskatchewan government announced it , with partners Royal Dutch Shell and the University of Regina , had created the International Performance Assessment Centre for Geological Storage of CO2 – a mouthful to be sure , but the aim is to turn booming Saskatchewan into a global centre for research around clean coal and carbon capture and storage .
These initiatives have to take place , as there are no silver bullets to fighting climate change .
But we should n't do it to the exclusion of other options , including investments in energy storage , geothermal , biomass and solar .
The fossil - fuel folks often like to poke fun at wind , solar and conservation efforts by dismissing them as " playing at the edges . "
It also appears clear the federal government is putting disproportionate weight on the ability of clean coal and carbon - capture technologies to reduce Canada 's greenhouse - gas emissions .
Not everyone in the industry is convinced , including Alex Pourbaix , president of energy at TransCanada Corp. , a natural gas pipeline and power generation company headquartered in Calgary .
" The cost of these types of technologies are very , very uncertain , " Pourbaix told investors in Toronto last week , explaining that they do n't stack up well when compared to natural gas .
Natural gas is costlier than coal , but emits half the CO2 and very little sulphur dioxide .
" TransCanada has been heavily involved in researching and being involved in pilot projects for gasification and carbon sequestration projects .
Under a range of expected forward gas prices , I would say the vast majority of these projects , if not all , are not economic without vast subsidies from government . "
It 's why TransCanada is betting its future growth on natural gas pipelines and power plants .
In fact , the rush from coal to natural gas – what the power industry calls " dash to gas " – has led to concerns about the drain on natural gas supplies as more generators switch away from coal .
The North American Electric Reliability Corp. , a self - regulatory organization representing major utilities across the continent , says clean coal and carbon storage needs to be commercially ready by 2025 to become a viable alternative for electricity production .
The key word here is " viable . "
Its members , according to a report released today , cite an often - overlooked problem associated with gasification of coal and the capturing and storing of carbon : each of these processes creates its own demand for electricity .

Their electrical demand , or what 's often called parasitic losses , can range from between 10 per cent and 50 per cent of power being generated .
In the United States , that means if all existing coal plants were converted to clean coal and their emissions were captured and sequestered , it would require 320,000 megawatts of new electrical generation to compensate for the parasitic losses – that is , for the extra power required to capture the CO2 , compress it , and pipe it safely into permanent underground storage .
Yikes .
That 's about 10 Ontario electricity systems .
Or about 600 more coal plants .

The Dow logged its second best one - day point gain , 889 points , in its even more storied history yesterday :
Percentage wise , at 10.8 % , the rally ranks sixth .
The S&P and Nasdaq trundled alongside the old lady like puppies .
After finding a new “ credit crisis ” low on Monday , traders on Wall Street snapped back with vengeance .
But it ’s not the higher highs we ’ll be watching for the rest of the week — but lower lows .
During each sell - off since extreme volatility began three weeks ago , we ’ve reached all - new lows .
The Japanese market performed in a similar way through the entire decade of the ’90s .
It rallied at least 30 % higher five times since 1992 , before finding new lows again , and again … and again .
Extreme volatility is a good thing if you ’ve got the stones for it .

Despite yesterday ’s monster stock rally , the credit markets are still moving cautiously .
The rate at which banks lend to one another ( Libor ) did decline again today , the 13th day in a row , but only by a little .
The three - month dollar Libor fell just 4 points overnight , to 3.46 % .
Considering an all - but - certain rate cut from the Federal Reserve today , commercial banks had every excuse to relax lending rates significantly … but guards are still up around the world .
“ We are not going to say , ‘ Yahoo , this is over ! ’ ” explained JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon , “ and extend credit like we did without fear .
If you ’re not fearful , you ’re crazy . ”
That coming from the guy who was fearless enough to buy Bear Stearns with little more than a wink from Ben Bernanke over Sunday tea .
The Fed will announce its latest interest rate decision today around 2:15 .
Anything less than 75 point cut and we suspect a sell - off.
1 % or lower , here we come .
We ’re turning Japanese … we really think so .
After a decade and a half of practically free money , the Bank of Japan is considering its interest rate again , too .
It ’s already at the 0.5 % .
How much lower can the Japanese go ?
The reversal in the equity market yesterday reverberated in the currency world .
The dollar took a pretty good whack .
The dollar index fell two full points from yesterday ’s high , now at 85.5 .
Thus , the euro enjoyed a nice bounce , up 3 cents , to $ 1.27 .
The British pound is back up nearly a nickel , to $ 1.60 .
And yen traders took profits , bringing the Japanese currency back to 97 .
“ The eventual cost to the U.S. financial and economic system , ” says John Williams , “ will be much higher inflation .
“ The monetary base has seen an unprecedented surge , reflecting total reserves of depository institutions jumping from an average of $ 47.1 billion ( seasonally adjusted ) in the two weeks ended Sept. 10 to $ 328.6 billion in the period ended Oct. 22 .
“ Using the St. Louis Fed ’s adjusted monetary base ( effectively total reserves plus M1 cash in circulation ) , the year - to - year growth in the latest period was an unprecedented 38 % .
In the period since 1919 , the previous high growth rate was 28 % in September 1939 , as the U.S. was building up industry for the evolving war in Europe .
“ Back in the days when the Federal Reserve targeted money supply growth , the monetary base was the measure it adjusted .
The current surge in the base is a direct result of the ongoing , extraordinary actions taken by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury aimed at preventing a collapse of the U.S. financial system .
The higher monetary base growth will result in sharp spikes to domestic money supply growth and will intensify inflationary pressures in the year ahead , irrespective of wild gyrations and sell - offs in oil and of strength in the U.S. dollar , which otherwise should prove very short - lived going forward . ”
Meanwhile , the U.S. government is beginning to advertise for new bailout money : “ We are making it clear to sovereign wealth funds , ” Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Robert Kimmitt said yesterday , while seeking help in the Persian Gulf , “ that we are open to investments that are done on a commercial , not political , basis , and that do not raise security concerns . ”
Kimmitt hinted he may have found some takers already : " We think that they are continuing to look very closely at opportunities in the United States .
We have a number of cases before the Committee on Foreign Investment right now …
Every investor that I ’ve spoken with here and elsewhere had been in the United States within the past month , looking for opportunities . ”
Who would have thought even three months ago — besides your cranky editors of The 5 , I mean — that Wall Street would be holding a global garage sale this fall ?
Orders for durable goods , surprisingly , jumped in September .
According to the Commerce Dept. today , orders for things meant to last more than a few years increased 0.8 % , well above the expected fall of 1.2 % .
Before you celebrate ( we know how durable goods data get you percolating ) , the actual details were n’t so optimistic .
The Commerce Dept. revised August data to show a 5.5 % fall in orders , the worst month in almost two years .
And all of this month ’s improvement came from transportation equipment , a sector so depressed it hardly has any more room to fall .
Since the dollar has pulled back , commodities have pushed forward .
Gold continues to inch up this week , and has now struggled back to $ 760 an ounce .
Oil is creeping back up , too .

“ Energy development is exploding in Africa , ” reports Byron King .
Our energy adviser made the long trip to South Africa for a conference on African energy development .
“ In the past decade alone , the number of companies actively looking for energy deposits in Africa has soared from under 100 to over 500 .
By 2018 , there may be 800 or so companies exploring for and producing energy in Africa .
Expect to see $ 350 billion spent in Africa by 2020 , just on energy development .
“ There are over 100 billion barrels of discovered oil reserves in Africa .
And there may be as much as another 100 billion barrels left to be found .
And even more natural gas , in terms of energy content .
Plus , heavy oil .
And coal and coalbed methane .
Which makes Africa more of an energy development target than Russia , or the even the Arctic — without the weather issues that we find up north in such frozen climes …
“ For now , oil prices are down , but investment is still flowing into a lot of energy projects in Africa .
Some companies are having trouble with short - term credit , but this is not the biggest issue for the energy industry and its efforts in Africa .
When the economic logjam breaks up , among the first things that will happen is that worldwide energy supplies will tighten .
And eventually , the world will confront its long - term lack of investment in the energy industries . ”
Even though oil has perked up , gas prices are still plummeting .

Six percent of U.S. employers have cut 401 ( k ) contributions this year or plan to do so in the coming months .
According to a study by human resources firm Watson Wyatt , that number is likely to grow , as many firms surveyed refused to comment , as admitting to a 401 ( k ) slash stinks of fiscal weakness .
Notable companies that have already nixed their 401 ( k ) contributions include Goodyear , Frontier Airlines , commercial real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield , Entercom and rental car agency Dollar Thrifty .
“ I , for one — also a Reserve Member — am totally thrilled , ” writes a reader , responding to yesterday ’s inbox , “ that not one word of ‘ asset allocation , ’ ‘ time horizon , ’ ‘ risk tolerance , ’ ‘ cost averaging ’ or other such drivel and pablum of the financial industry is to be had among the Agora publications .
I hope it stays that way .
If it ’s advice on those subjects he ’s looking for , well , it ’s even more abundant than the rivers of worthless paper flowing out of the Fed .
Just ask for it from almost any investment adviser .
“ As Buffett aptly notes , those are all methods for how to be average — and average right now is downright scary .
The degree of risk that one assumes is directly proportional to how much one understands the fundamentals of an investment , sees the obvious and acts accordingly .
It was largely due to the steady stream of spot -on , if not conventional and frequently unpopular , commentary coming from the crew of Agora doomsayers , who often ran against the mainstream financial media and consistently pointed to the buildup of ugly economic data , that I became convinced to do the obvious .
“ Last year , I exited nearly all long positions and loaded up on puts in the financials and in the consumer stocks and indexes and barricaded myself with inverse market positions , with many of these either recommended or inspired by Strategic Short Report and the late Survival Report .
And yes , I even did this for my retirement account .
I could n’t be happier with the results .
“ While I ’m still waiting for gold to have its day , Mr. Bernanke and friends have been very hard at work ensuring my eventual returns there .
Had I asset allocated according to my time horizon and risk tolerance ( gag…cough … )
I would no doubt be enjoying the wonderful returns on bonds and cash , instead . ”

After Election Day , we ’ll charge more … so get your copy here .
P.P.S. Finally , a little controversy …
Dean Baker from the Center for Economic and Policy Research wrote a line - by - line critique of I.O.U.S.A .
It ’s odd because he ’s a gentleman we often agree with .
For example , his critique of the housing bubble and the Greenspan Fed over the past five years or so has been spot on .
But here , he calls I.O.U.S.A. “ anti-Social Security propaganda ” … excuses Congress for running deficits over the past 40 years because A ) we can handle deficits at a low percentage of GDP and B ) he thinks it ’s OK that the government overspends during times of stock market turmoil and during downturns in the economy .
Hmmmn … you can read his critique here .
His biggest beef is with the medical and health insurance industries and their lobbyists in Washington .
Upon introducing the film to The Huffington Post , he says busting up the health industry cartel is too difficult , so we — as filmmakers — “ went after old people , instead . ”
We ’ll hold our response until you ’ve had a chance to read the critique .
The Good , the Bad and the Ugly : Auto Bailout Alternatives Experts disagree on whether a bankruptcy would really cripple the industry .
Dec. 12 , 2008  --
What does the future hold for the American auto industry now that Congress failed to pass a bailout package ?
Will the White House be forced to reverse course and dip into the emergency TARP funds set aside for the banking and mortgage industry and divert some of it to the automakers ?
The White House signaled that door may be reopened when it released a statement Thursday night after the Senate had killed the congressional aid package .
" We will evaluate our options in light of the breakdown in Congress , " the statement said .
The White House released another statement this morning , this time specifically citing the use of TARP funds as a possible way " to prevent a collapse of troubled automakers . "
Even if TARP funds are made available to the Big Three , would that save the automakers from bankruptcy , or just delay it ?
Ford , General Motors and Chrysler have all predicted that without emergency loans or " bridge financing , " dire consequences would ensue for both the auto industry and the U.S. economy .
Ford has not requested emergency loans but supports the extension of such help to its rivals .
GM issued a statement Thursday night expressing disappointment that the Senate was unable to pass a rescue package .
" We will assess all of our options to continue our restructuring and to obtain the means to weather the current economic crisis . "
Chrysler also released a statement saying it would " continue to pursue a workable solution to help ensure the future viability of the company . "
Industry analysts and scholars , meanwhile , have differing opinions on what awaits the industry should bailout legislation fail .
The industry , they say , could follow several different paths .
Help Through TARP
Even without congressional approval , the White House has " full authority " to grant emergency loans to the automakers through the government 's $ 700 billion financial rescue plan known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif . , insists .
It 's a move that the Bush administration and Treasury rejected earlier but in a statement released this morning , the White House signalled that it was now open to the idea .
" Under normal economic conditions we would prefer that markets determine the ultimate fate of private firms , " the administration said .
" However , given the current weakened state of the U.S. economy , we will consider other options if necessary – including use of the TARP program -- to prevent a collapse of troubled automakers .
If the Bush administration does not make use of TARP , it 's uncertain whether the succeeding Obama administration would react differently .
The president - elect expressed support Thursday for an emergency loan package from Congress , but whether he would support using TARP money for an auto bailout remains unclear .
Without immediate aid , the automakers may not survive long enough to benefit from an Obama decision .
General Motors has said that it could go bankrupt before the end of the year , weeks before Obama takes office .
The same could be true for Chrysler , experts say .
Ford is widely regarded to be in better financial health than its crosstown rivals .
" If you take at face value what Chrysler and GM have said , I do n't know how they avoid a near - term bankruptcy , " said Craig Fitzgerald , an auto analyst at Plante & Moran PLLC in Southfield , Mich .
" They 've said they 're running out of money and can't access external capital markets . …
I do n't see any alternative if the bridge loan does not come through and the situation is as dire as GM and Chrysler have said . "
Not everyone is certain that bankruptcies by the two automakers will take place before Bush leaves office .
" It seems like we went from a mid-2009 estimated running - out - of - money to the end of December in a heartbeat , " said Edward Altman , a finance professor at New York University 's Stern School of Business .
Bankruptcy : A Road to Oblivion ?
The automakers predicted that if one or more of them filed for bankruptcy , the resulting effect on their businesses and the American economy would be devastating .
In a submission to Congress , General Motors said that without government support " the company will default in the near term , very likely precipitating a total collapse of the domestic industry and its extensive supply chain , with a ripple effect that will have severe , long - term consequences to the U.S. economy . "
While it 's not uncommon for a company to file for bankruptcy , reorganize its businesses and then return to financial stability , the companies and some analysts have argued that such a scenario would n't prove true for the automakers .
The companies , said Rebecca Lindland , an analyst with IHS Global Insight in Lexington , Mass. , would likely have to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection , which requires a company 's liquidation rather than restructuring .
" Part of the reason that we do n't see that recovery is really viable is that people have consistently said they would not buy a car from a bankrupt company , " Lindland said .
In its submission to Congress , GM said that market research showed more than 30 percent of consumers who had considered buying GM cars but ultimately decided to buy another brand cited the possibility of GM bankruptcy as their top reason .
Experts say that some consumers would worry that a bankrupt automaker would n't be able to honor its warranties or that parts needed for repairs would n't be available .
Ron Harbour , a Detroit - based auto industry analyst with the consulting firm Oliver Wyman , said it 's also about image .
" Let 's say that you buy that car from a company that is bankrupt , " he said .
" You drive it home and your neighbor goes , ' you bought a car from them ?
Why would you do that ? ' "
While experts say that , for now , Ford is less likely than GM and Chrysler to file for bankruptcy protection , they 're not ruling it out .
If one of its rivals files for bankruptcy , it would actually make Ford more likely to seek bankruptcy protection down the road , they say .
The company is dependent on many of the same auto parts suppliers as GM and Chrysler .
If a GM or Chrysler bankruptcy forces parts manufacturers out of business , Ford may find it difficult to continue making cars .
Ford has cited the parts issue as a reason why it supports aid for GM and Chrysler .
Ford may also suffer from a public relations problem if GM or Chrysler enters bankruptcy : Consumers could lose confidence in the U.S. auto industry overall , analysts said , and choose foreign automakers rather than Ford .
" If Chrysler and GM were gone tomorrow , " Harbour asked , " would people look at Ford and say ' they 're just like them ' ? "
Bankruptcy : A Road to Recovery ?
While Fitzgerald believes that consequences of an automaker bankruptcy are " unimaginable , " he said that Ford could actually benefit if GM or Chrysler went out of business .
With one or two rivals out of the way , he said , the automaker would grab a greater market share .
Meanwhile , scholars like Altman and Richard D'Aveni , a professor of strategic management at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College , say they believe bankruptcy is a better alternative to a government bailout .
" We are going to take the hit to the economy with the failure of the Big Three car companies sooner or later , " D'Aveni said .
" It 's much better to do it now when there 's something left to work with in the companies . "
D'Aveni said that filing for bankruptcy -- specifically , restructuring under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection -- would allow automakers the flexibility to dramatically renegotiate their labor contracts , eliminate redundant product offerings and improve the way they sell cars overall .
If GM and Ford were to file for bankruptcy , they would eventually emerge " smaller but stronger . "
D'Aveni was less optimistic about Chrysler , which he called " the weaker sister " in the U.S. auto industry .
Chrysler 's size and its products , he said , make it less competitive in the world auto market than Ford and GM .
Altman said that for a successful Chapter 11 restructuring the companies would have to find what 's known as " debtor - in- possession " or DIP financing that would fund the companies ' restructuring efforts and also backstop consumers ' warrantees .
Altman projected that such financing would amount to $ 40 billion to $ 50 billion in loans .
Because of the massive amount of money involved , he said , the only lender to provide such funding would have be the federal government .
Riding Out the Worst
Being the DIP would entitle the government to be the first in line when the automakers start repaying their creditors .
The government , said Jack Williams , a scholar in residence at the American Bankruptcy Institute and a business reorganization professor at Georgia State University , would be " a secured creditor with super - priority lien . "
That , he said , " would put taxpayers in the best case possible . "
Altman said that while such a plan would be an unprecedented move by the government .
It would be more successful than the less - expensive $ 14 billion emergency loan package now under discussion .
A Chapter 11 restructuring -- along with government DIP financing -- could help the automakers avoid liquidation and , in the long run , would result in fewer job cuts , Altman said .
The safety net of a bankruptcy , he said , could help the automakers ride out the worst of the recession .
" In two years ' time , when they come out of the bankruptcy , there 's a better chance that the economy is going to be in better shape and the credit markets will be flowing again to help the companies , " he said .
in those five states Democrats are now in a more advantageous position when it comes to the interpretation and administration of election law — a development that could benefit Barack Obama if any of those states are closely contested on Election Day .
Secretaries of state give Dem firewall
In anticipation of a photo - finish presidential election , Democrats have built an administrative firewall designed to protect their electoral interests in five of the most important battleground states .
The bulwark consists of control of secretary of state offices in five key states —
Iowa , Minnesota , Nevada , New Mexico and Ohio — where the difference between victory and defeat in the 2004 presidential election was no more than 120,000 votes in any one of them .

With a Democrat now in charge of the offices , which oversee and administer their state ’s elections , the party is better positioned than in the previous elections to advance traditional Democratic interests — such as increasing voter registration and boosting turnout — rather than Republican priorities such as stamping out voter fraud .
Perhaps more important , in those five states Democrats are now in a more advantageous position when it comes to the interpretation and administration of election law — a development that could benefit Barack Obama if any of those states are closely contested on Election Day .
The effort began in 2006 when a group of liberal California activists created an independent 527 group designed to elect secretaries of state .
The Secretary of State Project ran independent ads of its own and ensured that donors — many of whom were affiliated with Democracy Alliance , a network of wealthy fundraisers that channels money to liberal causes across the country — knew which candidates deserved donations .
They were frustrated by the ballot - counting actions of former Florida Republican Secretary of State Katherine Harris in 2000 , and former Ohio Republican Secretary of State Ken Blackwell in 2004 , both former campaign chairmen for George W. Bush who became prominent electoral boogeymen to the left .
“ We were tired of Republican manipulation of elections , ” said Michael Kieschnick , a founder of the group who is also the president of Working Assets , a company that provides credit cards and mobile phone services to progressive organizations .
“ It seemed like lots of decisions were made by people who were pretty clearly political operatives . ”
According to the group , it raised and bundled $ 500,000 for the 2006 races .
The group says it spent $ 30,000 on ads in Ohio , went on the radio in New Mexico and ran cable ads in Minnesota .
In all seven target states — which also included unsuccessful campaigns in Colorado and Michigan — the Democratic candidate received a larger proportion of their money from out - of - state donors than the Republican , according to a Politico analysis .
This year , the project is supporting Democratic candidates in four more states : Missouri , Montana , Oregon and West Virginia .
Secretary of state races still come with a much lower price tag than higher profile state races , but in recent years the increased scrutiny has upped the cost .
In Colorado , the 2002 candidates for secretary of state raised less than $ 120,000 combined .
Four years later , Republican Michael Coffman raised about $ 450,000 while Democrat Ken Gordon raised almost $ 600,000 .
In Michigan , the heavily self - funded Republican incumbent Terri Lynn Land outraised Democratic long - shot Carmella Sabaugh by a 4 - 1 ratio , but the margin would have been greater if not for the almost $ 30,000 Sabaugh received from out - of - state donors .
“ It was very uplifting to know that a progressive group is really interested in getting secretary of states .
It was very rewarding to see that , ” she said of the project .
“ I think they actually contacted me . ”
Along with Kieschnick , who gave the maximum $ 3,400 to Sabaugh ’s underdog campaign , the list of donors included California venture capitalists ( and Democracy Alliance stalwarts ) Debra and Andrew Rappaport and a Utah investor named Arthur Lipson .
An alumnus of Wall Street , Lipson gave more than $ 25,000 directly to the 527 and also donated to individual secretary of state candidates in Colorado , Minnesota and Ohio .
“ I would ’ve given zero dollars to secretary of state races without the Secretary of State Project , ” he told Politico .
Potential contributors who visit the site can either give directly to the group or send money to candidates through ActBlue , an online tool for liberal candidates .
In 2006 , ActBlue delivered more than $ 24,000 in small donations to New Mexico Secretary of State Mary Herrera ’s campaign , about 7 percent of her overall budget .
Republicans have recently criticized Herrera first for hiring the son - in - law of Rep. Tom Udall , the Democratic Senate candidate , as director of the state Bureau of Elections , and then replacing him with a former Udall chief of staff .
But the biggest lightning rod , for both cash and controversy , has been Ohio .
In 2002 , Kenneth Blackwell raised almost $ 1.6 million for his race while his Democratic challenger raised about $ 400,000 .
Four years later , Democrat Jennifer Brunner — who won the race — and her opponent each raised more than $ 2 million .
The Brunner candidacy emerged as a small cause célèbre on the left :
While only 20 percent of her funding came from out of state , 12 out of the 18 individuals who gave the maximum $ 10,000 — a list that included Teresa Heinz Kerry — hailed from outside Ohio .
“ It was extremely helpful in raising people ’s awareness on the importance of having good people occupy the office of secretary of state , ” Brunner said .
“ I received significant support from the SOS Project , which helped me toward the election . ”
Democrats keyed in on Ohio after Blackwell purged the rolls of longtime nonvoters , issued decisions that limited which provisional ballots would be counted , and allowed what some saw as suspiciously long lines in Democratic areas on Election Day .
Bush won the state that year by just over 100,000 votes out of more than 5.5 million cast .
Blackwell disputes the claims that his actions were politically motivated and said the elements of the left that accused him of election theft were attempting “ to exploit a situation where most people have superficial knowledge of how elections are managed . ”
Likewise , Brunner has spent the past several months embroiled in a series of legal battles with Republicans .
On Sept. 29 , the day before early voting began , the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed her decision to allow residents to register and vote on the same day , during the week - long window after early voting in the state begins , and before the voter registration period ends .
Republicans had objected to the window , which they said would open up the floodgates for one - stop voter fraud .
On Oct. 2 , the Ohio Supreme Court struck down her directive regarding 1 million absentee ballot applications that the McCain campaign had issued :
The campaign had included an extra , unnecessary checkbox on the form , and Brunner had ruled that a failure to check the box — even if the registrant signed the form — meant the application could be rejected .
The court said Brunner ’s interpretation , ostensibly to prevent voter fraud , served " no vital purpose or public interest . "
The next day , a local Republican official filed a lawsuit to allow outside observers at early voting sites —
Brunner had insisted that the election workers already in place would provide enough of a check .
“ Secretary Brunner ran on a platform that called for absolute independence come election time , ” former Ohio Attorney General Jim Petro said on a conference call organized by the McCain campaign .
Petro also criticized Blackwell for excessive partisanship in 2004 .
“ She ’s issuing directives that demonstrate a partisan tilt . ”
Earlier this week , Brunner called on the Ohio attorney general to investigate get - out - the - vote calls made by Republicans in 19 Ohio counties , which some voters had confused as calls from their local election board .
When asked about Brunner , Kieschnick was careful to qualify his praise .
“ Our view would be that Jennifer Brunner made decisions that opened up elections to more people , ” he said .
“ It ’s never quite what you want , but by and large she ’s so much better than Ken Blackwell . ”
“ I think you ca n’t separate partisan attacks from elections , ” said Nevada Secretary of State Ross Miller .

AMSTERDAM , Netherlands , Dec. 17 ( UPI ) -- A
Dutch dictionary company says Web visitors have voted " swaffelen " -- an English slang verb meaning to swing one 's exposed penis -- as the word of the year .
Van Dale Publishers said swaffelen , which more specifically requires the penis in question to swing toward or bump against another person or object to qualify , topped the list of nominees by receiving 57 percent of the 16,000 online votes , Expatica reported Tuesday .

Ton den Boon said that while the word originated in English - speaking areas , its origins are believed to be tied to Dutch translations of swing , sway and sweep plus German words for tail and penis .
The dictionary company said the second - place finisher for word of the year was " wiien " -- to play video games on the Nintendo Wii .
Third was " bankendomino , " an all - in - one metaphor for the recent economic phenomenon of banks falling like dominoes .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Three more banks - two in California and one in Georgia - failed Friday , bringing to 22 the number of institutions forced to close in the wake of the financial crisis .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said the banking operations of Downey Savings and Loan Association of Newport Beach , Calif. , and PFF Bank & Trust of Downey , Calif. , were acquired by U.S. Bank ( USB , Fortune 500 ) of Minneapolis .
The two banks , which will reopen as U.S. Bank beginning Saturday , have a total of 213 branches and 2,900 employees , according to the Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) , the banks ' regulator .
As of Sept. 30 , Downey Savings had total assets of $ 12.8 billion and total deposits of $ 9.7 billion .
PFF
Bank had total assets of $ 3.7 billion and total deposits of $ 2.4 billion .
Both banks have been hit hard by the mortgage meltdown , according to the OTS .
" The closing of these two thrifts once again demonstrates the tremendous impact of the housing market distress on the state of California , " said OTS director John Reich in a statement .
Under terms of the FDIC - arranged deal , U.S. Bank will assume the first $ 1.6 billion of the combined banks ' asset losses , with the FDIC sharing in any further losses .
The FDIC said U.S. Bank will implement a loan modification program similar to the one announced in August for IndyMac Bank of Pasadena , Calif. , which was seized by the federal agency the previous month .
The agency said both Downey and PFF customers should continue existing branches until U.S. Bank can fully integrate the deposit records of the organizations .
Depositors will have full weekend access to their money by writing checks or using ATM or debit cards .
Earlier , Loganville , Ga. - based Community Bank was shuttered by the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance .
The FDIC took over the assets and Tappahannock , Va. - based Bank of Essex will assume all Community Bank 's deposits .
Community Bank had total assets of $ 681 million and total deposits of $ 611.4 million as of mid-October .
Bank of Essex purchased $ 84.4 million of the failed bank 's assets and paid the FDIC $ 3.2 million for the right to take over the failed bank 's deposits .
The FDIC will hold onto the remaining assets to disperse at a later time .
The Community Bank has four branches , which will all open Monday as the Bank of Essex .
Through the weekend , customers of the failed bank will be able to access their funds by writing checks or using ATM or debit cards .
Checks drawn on the bank will continue to be processed and loan customers should continue to make their payments as usual .
The FDIC said that the cost of the acquisition would be between $ 200 million and $ 240 million , but as with other bank failures , the transaction was the least expensive resolution .
With Friday 's failures , five California banks and three Georgia banks have been among the 22 forced to shut down in the current crisis .
A bigger pool of bailout buyers
On Friday , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) broadened " the pool of potential buyers available to buy troubled institutions " by allowing groups of private investors , and not just other banks , to take over failed institutions .
Several investors , led by Hilltop Holdings Inc. , became the first group to qualify under the new " shelf charter " by agreeing Friday to take over Ford Group Bank , a Texas regional firm .
However , the OCC approval is still preliminary and final authorization will only come after all requirements are met within 18 months .
Banks have been struggling to keep afloat as choked borrowers have been unable to pay their loans back , especially mortgage payments .
The $ 700 billion bailout , signed into law in early October , was supposed to be used for buying up toxic mortgage debt from struggling financial institutions to free up lending .
But last week , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the funds would now be used for injecting capital directly into the banks .
Banks have also been criticized for not using the bailout cash to increase lending to consumers and businesses .
Banks and lawmakers went head to head over that very issue last week .
Lawmakers say that banks need to use the funds to make credit more available to consumers and borrowers .
Banks , however , said they were doing what they could to increase lending and to work with delinquent homeowners .
The Treasury department has been dolling out capital to qualified banks .
Monday , the government dispersed $ 33.56 billion to 21 banks in a second round of payments .
The government previously distributed $ 125 billion to nine banks in the form of stock purchase programs .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Lesbian , gay , and bisexual ( LGB ) teens in British Columbia are at a higher risk of pregnancy because of discrimination , sexual abuse and harassment compared to heterosexual teens , according to a University of British Columbia study .
The study , released today in the Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality , is based on the B.C. Adolescent Health Survey , which is conducted every five or six years in school districts across the province by the McCreary Centre Society .
The survey includes questions about sexual health and risk behaviours , as well as questions about sexual orientation .
B.C. is the only province that tracks trends in sexual health for both LGB youth and heterosexual teens
“ Teen pregnancy is declining , but the risk is still higher for LGB youth , ” says lead author Elizabeth Saewyc , an Associate Professor in the School of Nursing at UBC and Research Director at the McCreary Centre Society .
“ These results are linked to higher rates of discrimination and harassment among LGB teens at school . ”
According to the results , lesbian and bisexual teens involved in pregnancy were twice as likely to have experienced discrimination because of their sexual orientation .
They also reported more kinds of harassment at school than lesbian or bisexual teens who had n’t been pregnant or caused a pregnancy .
“ This issue is not unique to B.C. , ” says Saewyc , who also holds a Canadian Institutes of Health Research ( CIHR ) Applied Public Health Chair in Youth Health .
“ Population studies in other countries have also documented higher rates of teen pregnancy among sexual minority youth .
We expect other provinces in Canada would report similar results if they conducted similar surveys . ”
The study identified trends in risk behaviours that lead to pregnancy , such as lack of condom use and early sex ( before age 14 ) , which is often due to sexual abuse .
The pattern of these risk behaviours among LGB and heterosexual teens followed the same trends as pregnancy involvement .
Key findings :
-- Rates of early first sexual experience for bisexual male students increased in 1998 from 56.4 per cent up to 59.7 per cent , then down to 42.7 percent in 2003 .
Teen pregnancy rates followed the same trend , from 9.6 per cent up to 11.6 per cent before dropping to 7.4 per cent in 2003 .
-- Rates of early sex for lesbian students increased between 1992 and 1998 , from 64.6 percent up to 67.9 per cent , then dropped to 48.4 per cent in 2003 .
Teen pregnancy rates increased slightly from 6.9 per cent to 7.3 per cent , before dropping to 3.4 per cent in 2003 .
-- Among heterosexual teens , early first sex declined steadily from 1992 to 2003 .
Among this group , teen pregnancy rates also declined from 2.2 and 3 percent in 1992 to 1.2 per cent in 2003 .
“ Despite declining rates , the results of the study demonstrate that a gap between heterosexual and LGB teen pregnancy remains , ” says Saewyc .
In 1992 , LGB students were two to seven times more likely to have been pregnant or caused a pregnancy than their straight peers ; in 2003 , they were still more than twice as likely to be involved in a pregnancy .
“ Reducing the levels of stigma , harassment , and sexual violence that LGB youth face , and creating safer , more supportive schools for LGB youth is a key step , ” says Saewyc .
“ But sexual violence is linked to pregnancy for all teens , so interventions to reduce sexual harassment and sexual violence in adolescent relationships can have a positive effect for teens of every orientation . ”
“ Exposure to violence and discrimination poses serious health threats .
Dr. Saewyc's research underscores how these threats place LGB youth at particular risk , ” says Dr. Joy Johnson , Scientific Director , CIHR Institute of Gender and Health .
“ More must be done to protect the health of all youth . ”

The media and the Washington foreign policy elite breathed a sigh of relief when Barack Obama thumped John McCain in the election .
Had John McCain won , there was always the chance that the neoconservatives would have beaten out the Republican realists for his foreign policy soul .
With a victory by the liberal Obama , however , the stake would finally be driven into the heart of the " jingoistic " neoconservative vampire .
Yet even after Obama takes power , an evil foreign policy ghoul will still hover over the White House  this time wearing the benign clothes of a compassionate angel .
Obama ’s top foreign policy advisors include Susan Rice , a member of the " muscular liberal " crowd  you know , the same crew that includes the bombing progressives Madeleine Albright and Richard Holbrooke .
In a National Public Radio interview during the campaign , Rice decried President George W. Bush ’s invasion and nation - building adventure in Iraq , while at the same time advocating U.S. intervention and nation - building in Darfur , Sudan .
Muscular liberals and neoconservatives hate each other only because they are so much alike .
Although neoconservatives feel less favorable toward any U.N. or other multilateral veneer for the mailed U.S. fist than muscular liberals , they still love to invade other nations for righteous reasons  that is , to save the world or make it more like us .
But I should not criticize a president  whether Democratic or Republican  before he even takes office and actually does something .
Perhaps Obama will directly address the foreign policy demons in his own party .
He originally had good instincts about a rapid withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq , but over the course of the campaign , tempered his position as the U.S. surge seemed to " work . "
No doubt , behind the scenes , his foreign policy " experts " have warned him of all the alleged pitfalls of such an expedited exit .
By paying off , arming , and training the Sunni militias in Iraq ( the U.S. had previously done the same thing with the Iraqi forces , which had been infiltrated by Kurdish and Shi’a militias ) , the Bush administration has tamed down the violence until it is safely out of office , but this also likely will make a future civil war among the groups even more intense .
Obama should pay attention to his instincts  not his advisers  and take advantage of the lull in violence to get out while the gettin ’s good .
Also , Obama should avoid a confrontation with Russia over deploying a U.S. missile defense in Europe .
The ham - handed Russians have not made it easy .
Without even first publicly congratulating Obama on his election victory , the Russians threatened to deploy short - range missiles that have the range to hit the defense facilities in Poland .
This response from Russia seems to fulfill Vice President - elect Joe Biden ’s prediction that the young , inexperienced president would be rapidly tested in an international crisis .
Although Russia ’s reaction to the proposed deployment of missile defense is somewhat understandable given its suffering from repeated U.S. - led expansions of the historically hostile NATO alliance right up to its borders , the blustering Russia has now made it hard for the neophyte president to abandon the system without fulfilling John McCain ’s prediction of his foreign policy weakness .
Instead , the Russians should have quietly waited to see what the new president would do about such defenses ; Obama previously had expressed some skepticism about the need for rapid U.S. deployment of the costly and questionable system .
Publicly calling out Obama on the issue before he even took office made it hard for the new president to wisely terminate deployment plans without seeming to have backed down .
Nevertheless , Obama has many legitimate excuses to abandon the expensive and unneeded system without referring to Russian opposition .
The cutback of this unnecessary weapon system should be just one of many .
At minimum , the Defense Department should also cut the Army ’s Future Combat Systems , the Navy ’s new destroyer , and the Air Force ’s Joint Strike Fighter .
Barney Frank , the Democratic Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , is on the right track by advocating a 25 percent reduction in the defense budget .
More generally , two endless foreign quagmires and the U.S. financial and economic crisis have brought home , like a cold slap in the face , the fact that U.S. imperial and interventionist foreign and defense policies , advocated by both neoconservatives and muscular liberals , have brought strategic overextension that is unaffordable in times of yawning budget deficits and economic frailty .
Obama should fight off the ghosts of foreign policy past , even within the Democratic Party , and opt for " change . "
More restrained and affordable foreign and defense policies would be politically saleable to the nation in times of economic peril .
" Yes , we can " ( retract the empire ) .

Until I was 37 years old , I lived alone .
It never struck me as particularly odd .
If you ’ve been in New York for any length of time , you know from both intuition and daily observation that many people live on their own in this town .
But I never fully appreciated how many — and by extension , how colossally banal my own solitary arrangement was — until I checked with the Department of City Planning a couple of months ago .
How many apartments in Manhattan would you have guessed have just one occupant ?
One of every eight ?
Every four ?
Every three ?
The number ’s one of every two .
Of all 3,141 counties in the United States , New York County is the unrivaled leader in single - individual households , at 50.6 percent .
More than three - quarters of the people in them are below the age of 65 .
Fifty - seven percent are female .
In Brooklyn , the overall number is considerably lower , at 29.5 percent , and Queens is 26.1 .
But on the whole , in New York City , one in three homes contains a single dweller , just one lone man or woman who flips on the coffeemaker in the morning and switches off the lights at night .
These numbers should tell an unambiguous story .
They should confirm the common belief about our city , which is that New York is an isolating , coldhearted sort of place .
Mark
Twain called it “ a splendid desert — a domed and steepled solitude , where the stranger is lonely in the midst of a million of his race . ”
( This from a man who settled in Hartford , Connecticut . )
In J. D. Salinger ’s 1952 short story “ De Daumier - Smith ’s Blue Period , ” the main character observes that wishing to be alone “ is the one New York prayer that rarely gets lost or delayed in channels , and in no time at all , everything I touched turned to solid loneliness . ”
Modern movies and art are filled with lonesome New York characters , some so familiar they ’ve become their own shorthand : Travis Bickle ( in Taxi Driver , calling himself “ God ’s lonely man ” ) ; the forlorn patrons in Nighthawks ( inspired , Edward Hopper said , “ by a restaurant on New York ’s Greenwich Avenue ” ) ; Ratso Rizzo ( “ I gotta get outta here , gotta get outta here , ” he kept muttering in Midnight Cowboy … and died before he could ) .
Remember Miranda in Sex and the City , racing off to the ER from panic attacks over dying alone ?
And then there was Christina Copeman .
She famously did die alone in her apartment in East Flatbush .
Her skeletal remains were discovered around Christmastime last year , an estimated twelve to eighteen months after she ’d died , still neatly dressed in a beret and overcoat .
It ’s stories like Copeman ’s — terrifying in their every particular and , more important , real — that catch the attention of social scientists and have led some to the same conclusions as Mark Twain .
“ Every 20 or 30 years , we have a lament about the decline of community , and it ’s usually due to cities and urbanization , ” says Robert Sampson , the criminologist who chairs Harvard ’s sociology department , when I visit him one sunny morning this fall .
He mentions one of the classics of the genre , Louis Wirth ’s Urbanism As a Way of Life .
“ It ’s all about the impersonal way of life in the city — how it almost deranged people , led to this sort of schizoid personality , to psychosis and loneliness . ”
He smiles .
“ It ’s a fun piece , actually .
There ’s some great quotes in it . ”
He leans back in his chair .
“ But this idea that cities are bastions of lonely , despairing people is a myth , ” he says .
In American lore , the small town is the archetypal community , a state of grace from which city dwellers have fallen ( thus capitulating to all sorts of political ills like , say , socialism ) .
Even among die - hard New Yorkers , those who could hardly imagine a life anywhere else , you ’ll find people who secretly harbor nostalgia for the small village they ’ve never known .
Yet the picture of cities — and New York in particular — that has been emerging from the work of social scientists is that the people living in them are actually less lonely .
Rather than driving people apart , large population centers pull them together , and as a rule tend to possess greater community virtues than smaller ones .
This , even though cities are consistently , overwhelmingly , places where people are more likely to live on their own .
A couple of months ago , John Cacioppo , the director of the Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience at the University of Chicago , decided to spend his one free evening in New York indulging in a favorite out - of - towner ’s cliché , which in his business also qualifies as field research : watching strangers in Grand Central Terminal .
“ You ’d see these people walking in all these different ways and at different paces , and all of a sudden , they ’d be synchronized , ” he says .
Cacioppo has a mild presence , with a soft voice and a slim frame , but the second he starts talking about this stuff , he buzzes like a live cable .
“ If they were white dots on a black field , ” he continues , “ you could tell who belonged to who , just based on the synchrony of the white dots . ”

The traditional social - science gloss on a metropolitan node like Grand Central is n’t all that different from Stephen Sondheim ’s observation in Company : “ Another hundred people just got off of the train … It ’s a city of strangers / Some come to work , some to play . ”
Grand Central is a glorious space , but it ’s also vast and impersonal , teeming with solitary commuters rather than one ’s own kin and kind .
Might some people not come away from such a place feeling profoundly estranged ?
Like they had n’t a friend in the world ?
They could .
But in the sunshiny , low - crime New York of 2008 , Grand Central feels much more like a village green than the melancholy nowhereland of Sondheim ’s vision ( or worse , Travis Bickle ’s open - air asylum ) .
There are tourists asking other tourists to take pictures of them ; cops kibitzing with passersby ; friends meeting friends to go for drinks .
“ All these transient connections were forming , ” Cacioppo marvels .
“ These people were n’t even conscious of the many ways they were forming . ”
Cacioppo , co-author of W.W. Norton ’s recently published Loneliness , is part of the school of evolutionary psychologists — and certain biologists too — that believes our species would n’t have survived without a cooperative social instinct .
In their book , Cacioppo and his co-author , the science writer William Patrick , argue that loneliness , like hunger , is an alarm signal that evolved in hominids hundreds of thousands of years ago , when group cohesion was essential to fight off abrupt attacks from stampeding wildebeests .
It ’s nature ’s way of telling us to rejoin the group or pay the price .
“ Nature , ” they simply write at one point , “ is connection . ”
It ’s a controversial theory , certainly , not least because it ’s post - hoc and therefore ca n’t be proved .
But it has beguiling consequences for city dwellers .
From Cacioppo ’s point of view , our large brains did n’t evolve in order to do multivariable calculus or compose sonatas .
They evolved in order to process social information — and hence to work collaboratively .
“ And if you look at any city , ” he says , “ you see that we have the capacity , as a species , to do so .
They show we can work together , we can trust one another .
We could n’t even drive through city streets if we did n’t trust that people would follow rules that protect the group . ”
Cities , in other words , are the ultimate expression of our humanity , the ultimate habitat in which to be ourselves ( which may explain why half the planet ’s population currently lives in them ) .
And in their present American incarnations — safe , family - friendly , pulsing with life on the street — they ’re working at their optimum peak .
In Cacioppo ’s data , today ’s city dwellers consistently rate as less lonely than their country cousins .
“ There ’s a new sense of community in cities , an increase in social capital , an increase in trust , ” he says .
“ It all leads to less alienation . ”
A raft of papers and polemics have come out in the last decade that argue Americans are lonelier .
The starkest was a survey in The American Sociological Review reporting that the average number of people with whom Americans could “ discuss important matters ” dropped from three to two between 1985 and 2004 , and that the number of Americans who felt they had no confidants at all had more than doubled , from 10 to 24.6 percent .
But the most famous of the genre — the work that launched a thousand debates — was Bowling Alone , a meticulous chronicle of scary numbers by Harvard public - policy expert Robert Putnam .
It showed that almost every measurable form of civic participation , from church attendance to union membership to bowling leagues , declined in the waning decades of the last century .
The book had plenty of critics , who pointed out that Putnam focused too much on obsolescent activities and organizations ( card - playing , the Elks ) ; that he gave short shrift to new , emerging forms of social capital , like Internet groups ; and that the declines he documented were fairly modest .
It did n’t matter .
The book resonated , vibrantly , with laymen and politicians alike , becoming an instant best - seller and catapulting Putnam into the rarefied company of presidential contenders and world leaders .
He ’s worked with Bill Clinton , George W. Bush , and Tony Blair .
He also met with Barack Obama during his campaign .
There are good public - health reasons to be concerned about loneliness .
In the last couple of decades , researchers have started measuring the effects of social isolation , and they are n’t pretty .
There ’s been an avalanche of studies , for instance , showing that married people are happier and healthier , while the odds of dying increase significantly among the recently widowed , something known as the “ widowhood effect . ”
There ’s evidence suggesting that strong social networks help slow the progression of Alzheimer ’s .
There ’s even better evidence suggesting that weak social networks pose as great a risk to heart - attack patients as obesity and hypertension .
There ’s also evidence to suggest that the religious people who live the longest are the ones who attend services most frequently rather than feel their beliefs most deeply .
( It ’s not faith that keeps them alive , in other words , but people . )

Studies show that loneliness is associated with morning surges in cortisol , the stress hormone , and increased vascular resistance , which results in higher blood pressure .
They also show the lonely drink more , exercise less , get divorced more often , and have more family estrangements and run-ins with the neighbors .
And they ’re fatter .
In one of my favorite experiments described in Loneliness , students were divided into two groups and told to evaluate … bite - size cookies .
Specifically , researchers took aside each of the kids in one group and told them that no one wanted to work with them , so they ’d have to work on their own .
The others , by contrast , were each privately told that everyone wanted to work with them , but they ’d still have to work on their own because it would be impossible to work with so many people .
Then all of the participants were handed a plate of cookies and told to evaluate them .
On average , the ones who had been told they were universally liked ate 4.5 .
Those who had been told they ’d been universally rejected ate 9 .
“ Is it any wonder we turn to ice cream , ” the authors ask , “ when we ’re sitting at home feeling all alone in the world ? ”
Given how many New Yorkers live alone — in Manhattan , 25.6 percent of households are married , whereas the national average is 49.7 — one would think we ’d be at an increased risk for practically all these conditions .
But Cacioppo points out that loneliness is n’t about objective matters , like whether we live alone .
It ’s about subjective matters , like whether we feel alone .
To determine how satisfied people feel with their relationships , research psychologists generally rely on a twenty - question survey called the UCLA Loneliness Scale , which breaks down our connections into three groups : intimate ( whether we have a partner ) , relational ( friends ) , and collective ( church , colleagues , baseball teams , etc. ) .
The results of these surveys have crucial — and positive — consequences for urban environments .
Loneliness , it turns out , is relative .
Widows are likely to feel better in a community with more widows ( Boca Raton , Florida , say ) than a community with only a few single elderly women .
And singles are likely to feel better in a town with more singles … like New York .
It ’s true that marriage is still the best demographic predictor of loneliness .
But Cacioppo stresses it ’s a very loose predictor .
People can have satisfying connections in other ways , after all , and people in bad marriages might as well be on their own : Cacioppo ’s latest study , based on a sample of 225 people in the Chicago area , shows that those in unhappy marriages are no less lonely than single people , and might even be more so .
Nor do rotten marriages do much for your health .
A couple of years ago , Cacioppo teamed up with Linda Waite , co-author of The Case for Marriage : Why Married People Are Happier , Healthier , and Better Off Financially , whose conclusions about the health - positive effects of the institution drove feminists and fatalists like myself into a tizzy .
They recruited a new pool of sample subjects and more or less asked the same questions Waite originally did , but also inserted questions to see if their participants were lonely .
And what did they discover ?
That married people were indeed healthier — if they were n’t lonely in their marriages .
If they were , the health benefits were so negligible the researchers considered them statistically insignificant .
No one disputes the value of a good marriage , of course .
Andrew Oswald , an economist at the University of Warwick , in fact tried to calculate that value , based on tens of thousands of happiness surveys collected here and in the U.K. , and found that it ’s worth $ 100,000 — or roughly doubling your salary , because working Americans earn , on average , $ 46,996 per year .
But you know what else was worth $ 100,000 ?
A large circle of friends .
And it turns out that Aristotle was right when he wrote in The Nicomachean Ethics that friends are the glue that binds cities together .
In study after study , urban dwellers have a more substantial social network .
In his 1982 classic about Californians , To Dwell Among Friends : Personal Networks in Town and City , the Berkeley , California–based sociologist Claude Fischer found a 40 percent uptick in the size of friendship - based social networks moving from semi-rural areas into the urban core .
Even the recent study that found we had fewer confidants found better news for city dwellers .
“ Based on what I ’m seeing , ” says Matthew Brashears , one of the authors of the survey , “ networks in large communities may have gotten smaller , but people in large communities still appear to have bigger networks than people in small . ”
“ In our data , ” adds Lisa Berkman , the Harvard epidemiologist who discovered the importance of social networks to heart patients , “ friends substitute perfectly well for family . ”
This finding is important .
It may be true that marriage prolongs life .
But so , in Berkman ’s view , does friendship — and considering how important friendship is to New Yorkers ( home of Friends , after all ) , where so many of us live on our own , this finding is blissfully reassuring .
In fact , Berkman has consistently found that living alone poses no health risk , whether she ’s looking at 20,000 gas and electricity workers in France or a random sample of almost 7,000 men and women in Alameda , California , so long as her subjects have intimate ties of some kind as well as a variety of weaker ones .
Those who are married but do n’t have any civic ties or close friends or relatives , for instance , face greater health risks than those who live alone but have lots of friends and regularly volunteer at the local soup kitchen .
“ Any one connection does n’t really protect you , ” she says .
“ You need relationships that provide love and intimacy and you need relationships that help you feel like you ’re participating in society in some way . ”
Eric Klinenberg is a sociologist at NYU who ’s in the midst of writing a book called Alone in America .
He and his researchers have interviewed over 200 “ solitaires ” ( his term ) about their experiences , 160 of them from New York City .
“ I ’m concerned about poor and elderly people who live alone , ” he says .
“ I ’m concerned about the sick who live alone .
But we have to address the question of why , in other stages of their lives , people are opting to be alone , and we have to wrestle with the question of why many people who are elderly would rather live alone than move in with their children . ”
He offers a few hypotheses :
That living alone is a crucial rite of passage into adulthood .
That it ’s a sign of economic achievement .
That it ’s a form of self - cultivation and living authentically , a reaction to the stifling compromises made by the cornered souls of Mad Men .
In my own life , I ’d make the case that my single friends gave me the imagination to envisage a life without marriage , which meant I did n’t pair off too young .
I also do n’t think I ’m going out on too weak a limb when I stipulate that cities , in which we have a large network of companions and a wide variety of activities to do with them , are better for marriages generally .
The relationship researcher Arthur Aron has pointed out that new experiences , rather than repeated favorites , are the best way to keep romantic feelings alive in a marriage , based on a series of six studies of hundreds of couples .
Now seems like a good time to point out that New York State is tied for the fifth - lowest divorce rate in the nation .
Is n’t it possible our marriages are simply better here ?
And to the extent that suicide results from the tragic failure to socially integrate — one of the main ideas in Émile Durkheim ’s 1897 classic , Suicide — then New York City ’s suicide rate says something even more profound : New York State ’s suicide rate is currently the third lowest in the nation ( second if you discount Washington , D.C. ) , at 6.2 percent , and the city ’s rate is even lower , at 5.4 percent .
According to a report issued by the state ’s Office of Mental Health , in fact , suicide statistics in New York follow a simple formula :
The less populous the county , the higher the rate ( with superdense Kings County , or Brooklyn , boasting the second lowest , at 4.4 per 100,000 ) .
The United States follows the same pattern , with suicides rising the more rural the area becomes .
States with the worst suicide rates are the least dense .
( Montana , Nevada , Alaska , New Mexico , and Wyoming are ranked , respectively , one through five . )
In terms of ameliorating loneliness , “ friends substitute perfectly well for family , ” says Harvard epidemiologist Lisa Berkman .
In the last decade , urbanism has converged , to some extent , with another field of study : Internet use .
It ’s probably not an accident .
Both cities and the Internet are at once highly atomized and elaborately connected milieus that encourage both solitude and interaction with the diverse , bountiful unwashed .
And like city solitaires , Internet users were also once identified as antisocial loners , painfully awkward people who vanished into the green - gray light of their computer screens rather than joining the warm community of man .
In the beginning , studies even showed this to be true ( or that users were shy , anyway ) .
But not once three - quarters of the public started using the Internet .
“ The idea that you ’re isolated when you ’re online is , to me , just wrong , ” says Keith Hampton , a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania who did an extensive ethnography of “ Netville , ” a new , 100 percent wired community in suburban Toronto .
“ It ’s an inherently social medium .
What starts online moves offline , and what starts offline goes online . ”
Which explains why the people with whom you e-mail most frequently are your closest friends and romantic partners .
“ Online and offline life are inherently connected , ” he says .
“ They ’re not separate worlds . ”
In fact , many Internet and city behaviors we consider antisocial have social consequences .
Think of people who lug their laptops into public settings .
In 2004 , Hampton and his colleagues looked at just those people — at Starbucks , in fact , in Seattle and Boston — and concluded that a full third of them were basically using their laptops and interacting at the same time .
( Cafés , in other words , were like dog runs , and laptops were like pugs , encouraging interaction among solitaries . )
Hampton did a similar study of laptop users in Bryant Park , and the same proportion , or one - third , reported meeting someone they had n’t before .
Fifteen percent of them kept in touch with that person over time ( meaning that about 5 percent made lasting ties out of a trip to Bryant Park with a laptop ) .
It ’s easy to see the parallels here between attitudes toward online use and attitudes toward solitary living .
Perhaps there was once a time when living alone meant you were a hopeless shut - in .
But you ca n’t exactly say this if 50 percent of the households in Manhattan contain just one person .
Like Internet users , solitaires have a permanent and ambient sense of the world beyond their living rooms and a fluid sense of when to join it and when to retreat .
Klinenberg , the NYU professor who is writing about living alone , points out that single people are partly responsible for the vibrancy of New York ’s public life : “ We know from marketing surveys that single people go out more than couples , ” he notes .
“ They ’re more likely to go to restaurants , to bars , and to clubs .
A lot of people who live alone say it ’s very hard to enter their apartments and stare at the walls when there ’s so much going on outside . ”
Conversely , married people — women especially — have smaller friendship - based social networks than they did as single people , according to Claude Fischer .
In a recent phone conversation with the sociologist , I mentioned a related curiosity I came across in a paper about the elderly and social isolation in New York City :
The neighborhoods where people were at the greatest risk , it seemed , were in neighborhoods where people seemed very married — family neighborhoods , in fact , like Borough Park and Ridgewood .
“ That ’s not strange at all , ” he says .
“ They ’re the prime category of people to be isolated . ”
He explains that these people “ aged in place , ” as sociologists like to say , staying in the homes where they raised their own families .
Then their spouses died , and so did their cohort ( or it moved to a retirement community ) , and they ’re suddenly surrounded by strange families , often of different classes or ethnic backgrounds , with whom they ’re likely to have far less in common .
“ Unless they have children living nearby , ” he says , “ they ’re likely to be quite isolated . ”
I ’m familiar with a younger version of this .
When the New Yorkers I know feel lonely — single women especially — it ’s a product , too , of feeling asynchronous with their cohort .
I myself felt this way until fairly recently .
James Moody , a network guru at Duke University , notes that there ’s a time in the lives of young professionals when they retreat deep into their silos , trying to make partner , get tenure , write their books , complete their residencies , or whatever it is that they ’re hoping to do .
If they ’re lucky , they ’re married , which helps sustain them through the work isolation .
Then the next stage comes when they ’re working hard in their newly minted careers ( as partners , tenured professors , authors , doctors , or whatever it is they ’re doing ) .
And again , they ’re fairly cut off socially , but they ’re buoyed , one hopes , by the presence of a family at home .
But if someone is out of step with this pattern — not partnered off , say , while still working really hard — New York can be a challenging place .
But the fact remains that a city , New York especially , might be the best place to ride out that period of lonely toil .
Because New York , like the Internet , also offers a rich network of acquaintances , or what sociologists like to call “ weak ties . ”
There are sociologists who will argue that weak ties are the bane of modern life .
We are drowning in a sea of them , they ’ll say — networking with colleagues rather than socializing with friends , corresponding online with lots of people we know only moderately well rather than catching up with our nearest and dearest on the phone .
Bowling Alone is , to some extent , one long elegy for the strong ties we ’ve lost , whether they ’re the bowling leagues of Pittsburgh or the Hadassahs of New Jersey .
And there ’s no doubt that weak ties can distract and enervate us .
How many families sit down at dinner together with the best of intentions , only to find themselves drawn into their own individual worlds — texting on their BlackBerrys , yakking on their cells ?
( The cover art for Elsewhere , U.S.A. , the fine upcoming book by NYU sociologist Dalton Conley , says it all : a family sitting at the dining - room table , each member staring at his or her own laptop . )
But having lots of weak ties is also wonderful for many things — including finding stronger ties .
As Mark Granovetter wrote in his seminal 1973 essay , “ The Strength of Weak Ties , ” they ’re much better at helping us find jobs because they offer us diversity and breadth .
The same goes for love .
Think about it :
If you ’re single , you already know all your friends ’ single friends .
It ’s your acquaintances ’ single friends you do n’t know .
Viewed in this light , networking with acquaintances , of whom we all have many in New York , is hardly a shallow enterprise or waste of time .
It ’s through these people that we find husbands , wives , life partners , better jobs .
Why should we begrudge that any more than we ’d begrudge going on Nerve ?
Or Monster.com ?
Weak ties offer other advantages in cities .
They ’re crucial to collective political action — your closest friends are n’t enough to start a movement — and they ’re better than strong ties , believe it or not , for protecting neighborhoods , for the same reason : Banding together with those you know well is n’t enough to keep a whole community safe .
Weak ties are essential to the creative economy , as Richard Florida pointed out in The Rise of the Creative Class , because diversity breeds innovation ( and more diversity ) .
There is even evidence that weak ties simply make us feel better .
According to Loneliness , the advice your mother gives you when you ’re depressed —
Get out of the damn house , would you ?— turns out to be right .
For most people , being in the simple presence of a friendly person helps us reregulate our behavior if we ’re feeling depressed in our isolation .
We are naturally wired not just to connect with them but to imitate them — which might be a good idea , if our impulses at that moment are self - destructive .
Cacioppo and Patrick cite a range of studies showing that students in classes with the best rapport imitate each other ’s body language ; same goes for athletes on winning teams .
The presence of other human beings puts a natural limit on how freakily we can behave .
And where better to find them than in cities , where we have more ties ?
( Think about the sociopathic kids who shot other kids in Red Lake , Minnesota ; at Northern Illinois University ; at Virginia Tech — what do they have in common ?
They were living in isolated places . )
Robert Sampson , paraphrasing Durkheim , puts it this way : “ The tie itself provides health benefits .
That ’s where I started with my work on crime . ”
So now I ’m thinking back on all those connections Cacioppo witnessed in Grand Central .
“ Other species , like penguins , they rely on huddles for survival , ” he told me .
“ In terms of collective structures , they ’re pretty minimal and boring .
But people have the capacity to make all kinds of transient connections .
New York has an infinite number of them . ”
He was describing the ballet of the train station .
But his description could just as easily have applied to the Internet .
Think about it : Serendipitous encounters between people who know each other well , sort of well , and not at all .
People of every type , and with every type of agenda , trying to meet up with others who share that same agenda .
An environment that ’s alive at all hours , populated by all types , and is , most of the time , pretty safe .
What he was saying , really , was that New York had become the Web .
Or perhaps more , even : that New York was the Web before the Web was the Web , characterized by the same free - flowing interaction , 24/7 rhythms , subgroups , and demimondes .
Hampton says he views the Internet as the ultimate city , the last stop on the continuum of human connectedness .
I ’d argue that New York and the Internet are about the same , in the way that a large bookstore feels like it offers just as many possibilities as Amazon.com — maybe slightly less inventory , but more opportunities to stumble on things you might not have otherwise .
Whichever the case , what the Internet and New York have in common is that each environment facilitates interaction between individuals like no other , and both would be positively useless — would literally lose their raison d’être — if solitary individuals did n’t furiously interact in each .
They show us , in trillions of invisible ways every day , that people are essentially nothing without one another .
We may sometimes want to throttle our fellow travelers on the F train .
We may on occasion curse our neighbors for playing music so loud it splits the floor .
But living cheek - by - jowl is the necessary price we pay for our well - being .
And anyway , who wants to ride the subway alone ?
Authorities in Beijing unblocked the BBC's Chinese language site in July China appears to have banned a number of foreign websites , including the BBC's Chinese language news site and Voice of America in Chinese .
The sites had been unblocked after journalists attending the Beijing Olympics complained that the government was censoring sites deemed sensitive .
The BBC expressed disappointment at the apparent reinstatement of the ban .
But a Chinese government spokesman told journalists that some sites contained content that violated Chinese law .
Among the other sites blocked are Asiaweek , Reporters Without Borders and some Hong Kong and Taiwan sites .
China imposes strict controls on the dissemination of information through the web , employing teams of people to remove sensitive content , police bloggers and remove access to certain sites .
' Two Chinas '
In a news conference , foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao refused to confirm that the government was behind the censorship .
But he said some websites violated Chinese law .
It has been a source of great regret that audiences in China are unable to access BBCChinese.com as the rest of the world can
The BBC " For instance , if a website refers to ' two Chinas ' or refers to mainland China and Taiwan as two independent regions , we believe that violates China 's anti-secession law , as well as other laws , " he said , according to Reuters news agency .
He urged the websites to " comply with China 's concerns and not do things contrary to Chinese law " .
Mr Liu would not comment on why websites had been temporarily unblocked during the Olympic Games , or comment on the legal process followed to approve the blocking of sites .
In a statement , the BBC said it was disappointed that Chinese - speaking audiences in China were denied access to BBCChinese.com .
It said that except during the 2008 Games , the website had been blocked since its inception nearly a decade ago , and Mandarin radio broadcasts had been " subject to persistent frequency interference for decades " .
" It has been a source of great regret that audiences in China are unable to access BBCChinese.com as the rest of the world can , " the statement said .
Tough year ahead Just before the Olympics , foreign journalists complained that they could not access a host of websites which carried news or comment that Beijing deemed sensitive .
The spread of information is tightly controlled in China The Olympics led to an improvement in China 's controls of the foreign media , and not all the advances have been rolled back , reports the BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Beijing .
But the country is expected to face a tough year ahead - the dramatic slowing of economic growth and rising unemployment are expected to fuel social unrest , he says .
It is also the 20th anniversary of the brutal suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests , and 50 years since China took direct control of Tibet .
More censorship and increased internal security are expected in 2009 , our correspondent adds .

The annual Halloween ritual of candy , scary home - made costumes and trick - or - treating hearkens back to childhood innocence .
But while it's all harmless fun , Halloween is also a playground for myths and urban legends ranging from simple false beliefs to serious issues around children 's safety .
There are also some odd economic realities behind the curtains that are relevant during the nation 's current financial crisis .
So in the darkness of this strange holiday , here are five things you should know :
1 . Pure logic concludes that real - life vampires are impossible .
The percentage of Americans who believe in present - day vampires is at a dangerously high level , says University of Central Florida physicist Costas Efthimiou , who debunks pseudoscientific ideas in attempts to enhance public literacy .
Here is the outline of the belief : Legend has it that vampires feed on human blood , and once bitten , the victim also becomes a vampire and starts feasting on the blood of others .
This supposedly accounts for an exponential increase of these widely feared creatures .
Efthimiou 's debunking logic goes like this : On Jan. 1 , 1600 , the human population was 536,870,911 .
If the first vampire came into existence that day and bit one person a month , there would have been two vampires by Feb.
1 , 1600 .
A month later there would have been four , and so on .
In just two - and - a - half years the original human population would all have become vampires with nobody left to feed on , even if our entire species doubled each month .
So whatever you think you see prowling around on Oct. 31 , it most certainly wo n't turn you into a vampire and we wo n't be living in a real - life , B - rated zombie movie anytime soon .
2. Consuming Almond Joys and other Halloween chocolates does not ward off cancer .
Avoid any wildly simplistic rumors of chocolate sweets aiding in the prevention of cancer this Halloween season .
Turns out that it's not the chocolate candy per se that has anticancer properties :
The Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University finds that it's an ingredient in cocoa , from which chocolate is made , called pentameric procyanidin .
Research at the University of California , Davis , contributes to more delicious findings , that epicatechin , one of a group of chemicals present in cocoa known as flavanols , is directly linked to improved circulation by the relaxing of vascular tissues , and other hallmarks of cardiovascular health in humans .
These studies provide evidence that there are health benefits observed after the consumption of certain flavanol - rich cocoas , but it is still not recommended to inhale Milky Ways in attempts to lower blood pressure or fight cancer .
3 . You have a better chance of being hit by a car on a dark street than finding secret razor blades in candies .
Police and medical centers across the country annually take precautions to prevent candy tampering during the Halloween season .
Each year , X - ray equipment is overloaded to check Halloween items for harmful objects , such as razors , needles or other objects that might have been placed there to hurt or kill children .
However , few if any threatening foreign objects are found , with the " unfortunate victim " sometimes revealed as the culprit , in search of media attention .
Essentially , these precautions are wasting resources and fueling an urban legend , as well as children 's fears .
There have been only two confirmed cases of children being killed by poisoned Halloween candy , and in both cases the children were killed intentionally by one of their parents .
The best known , " original " case was that of Texan Ronald Clark O'Bryan , who killed his son by lacing his Pixie Stix with cyanide in 1974 .
With the exceptions noted above , no child has been killed or seriously harmed by contaminated Halloween candy .
4. Halloween wo n't save America 's consumer crisis .
Many people are under the impression that Halloween is the second - busiest retail holiday of year , beaten only by Christmas .
In fact , The National Retail Foundation ranks it sixth overall , behind Father 's Day , Easter , Valentine 's Day , Mother 's Day and the winter holidays .
So , as for the pumpkin - happy holiday offsetting the Dow Jones from its financial debacle , do n't count on it .
October is usually considered a vigorous month for heavy spending — between Halloween shopping and cooling weather driving consumers to search for winter gear — but it 's shaping up to be a nationwide letdown , according to The Wall Street Journal .
Consumers have clung so far to their newly modest spending habits .
What 's more , this year 's Fright Night comes on the heels of a back - to - school shopping season that was considered mostly a bust , the newspaper reported .
5 . There has not been a single case of any child being molested by a convicted sex offender while trick - or - treating .
Foremost , it is fairly implausible that a criminal could molest an elaborately dressed child in costume , outside the front door , in front of numerous witnesses and parents .
The " stranger danger " concern is a relatively recent phenomenon , and the emergence of sex offender laws across the country have resulted in thousands of convicted sex offenders abiding by a strict curfew and not answering their doors to trick - or - treaters on the night of Halloween .
However , Georgia , New Jersey and Indiana have recently overturned sex offender laws found to be unduly restrictive , according to JURIST , a Web - based legal news and real - time legal research service .
The fact is there is no evidence that indicates these laws actually make children any safer .
In 2007 , Human Rights Watch concluded in a report that it is unclear whether sex offender laws " do more harm than good , " noting that they might encourage harassment and ostracism of sex offenders who have served their time .
In addition , most released sex offenders do not re-offend , contrary to popular belief , and most attacks on children occur in their own home by someone they know .
There is no doubt these special considerations are well - intentioned , but there is no reason to think that sex offenders pose any more of a threat to children on Halloween than at any other time .

Do n't have the perfect gift for your sweetheart this holiday season ?
Do n't sweat it . . . unless your partner is a man .
Apparently , men are more sensitive than women when receiving gifts .
A team of psychologists published the findings this fall in the journal Social Cognition .
They surveyed 32 heterosexual couples on their gift preferences .
Then the researchers picked either someone 's least favorite choice or the perfect present , but made it seem like it was coming from that person 's partner instead .
Predictably , men who got bad gifts reacted more negatively than men who got good ones .
No surprise there .
But , oddly enough , women showed the opposite trend .
Women who got an undesired gift were actually more accepting of it than if they ’d received their ideal item .
They launched into a rational defense of their boyfriends .
Women saw themselves as more similar to their partners , which the authors use as a measure of relationship satisfaction .
And women viewed their relationship as having just as much long - term potential .
But be careful .
This study does n't mean that you should go around buying your lady holiday - themed sweaters and fruitcake .
The long - term effects of bad presents are still unknown .

Service dogs , invaluable companions providing assistance to physically impaired individuals , are an elite and desired breed .
Their presence in a home can make everyday tasks that are difficult - if not impossible - achievable , enhancing the quality of life for the disabled .
Yet with a cost averaging $ 16,000 per dog – not to mention the two years of training required to hone these skills – the demand for these canines ’ exceeds their availability .
But what if these duties could be accomplished with an electronic companion that provides the same efficiency at a fraction of the cost ?
Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have engineered a biologically inspired robot that mirrors the actions of sought - after service dogs .
Users verbally command the robot to complete a task and the robot responds once a basic laser pointer illuminates the location of the desired action .
For instance , if a person needs an item fetched , that individual would normally command a service dog to do so and then gesture with their hands toward the location .
The service robot mimics the process , with the hand gesture replaced by aiming the laser pointer at the desired item .
Employing this technology , users can accomplish basic yet challenging missions such as opening doors , drawers and retrieving medication .

“ It ’s a road to get robots out there helping people sooner , ” said Professor Charlie Kemp , Georgia Tech Department of Biomedical Engineering .
“ Service dogs have a great history of helping people , but there ’s a multi - year waiting list .
It ’s a very expensive thing to have .
We think robots will eventually help to meet those needs . ”
Kemp presented his findings this week at the second IEEE / RAS - EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics – BioRob 2008 – in Scottsdale , Ariz .
This technology was achieved with four - legged authenticity .
Kemp and graduate student Hai Nguyen worked closely with the team of trainers at Georgia Canines for Independence ( GCI ) in Acworth , Ga. to research the command categories and interaction that is core to the relationship between individuals and service dogs .
Betty , a Golden Retriever , was studied to understand her movements and relationship with commands .
Key to the success is Betty ’s ability to work with a towel attached to a drawer or door handle , which allows her to use her mouth for such actions as opening and closing .
The robot was then successfully programmed to use the towel in a similar manner .
advertisement
Her handlers were thrilled at the potential benefits of the technology .
“ The waiting list for dogs can be five to seven years , ” said Ramona Nichols , executive director of Georgia Canines for Independence .
“ It ’s neat to see science happening but with a bigger cause ; applying the knowledge and experience we have and really making a difference .
I ’m so impressed .
It ’s going to revolutionize our industry in helping people with disabilities . ”
In total , the robot was able to replicate 10 tasks and commands taught to service dogs at GCI – including opening drawers and doors - with impressive efficiency .
Other successes included opening a microwave oven , delivering an object and placing an item on a table .
“ As robotic researchers we should n’t just be looking at the human as an example , ” Kemp said .
“ Dogs are very capable at what they do .
They have helped thousands of people throughout the years .
I believe we ’re going to be able to achieve the capabilities of a service dog sooner than those of a human caregiver . ”
While the robot may not be able to mirror the personality and furry companionship of a canine , it does have other benefits .
“ The robot wo n’t require the same care and maintenance , ” Kemp said .
“ It also wo n’t be distracted by a steak . ”

A FUNGAL disease is decimating amphibian populations around the world , and so far the only way to save a species at risk is to remove individuals from the wild .
Is it time to try taking out the disease as well ?
So far the majority of amphibian conservation efforts have focused on identifying species at high risk of extinction , and establishing captive breeding programmes in biosecure units where they will be protected from Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ( Bd ) , the chytrid fungus that is …
So what do you do if you are the newly elected president of a small , relatively impoverished country whose greatest claim to fame , besides arguably the finest beaches in the world , is the fact that it is slowly sinking into the sea ?
You lose no time reminding the world of that fact , obviously .
And to underline the urgency of the problem , you reveal the startling news that you are seriously thinking about moving the whole nation somewhere else .
That at least is what Mohamed Nasheed , the first democratically elected president of the Maldives , did this week .
He aims to start setting aside a chunk of his country 's sizeable tourist revenue to set up a land - purchase fund .
" We can do nothing to stop climate change on our own , so we have to buy land elsewhere .
It 's an insurance policy for the worst possible outcome , " he told the Guardian on the eve of his inauguration .
" We do not want to leave the Maldives , but we also do not want to be climate refugees living in tents for decades . "
It is an intriguing , if deeply depressing idea : the first nation on earth to be forced to abandon its homeland because of the impact of global warming and steadily rising sea levels .
Nasheed is basically talking about relocating the Maldives ' 300,000 - strong population to nearby India , or Sri Lanka or , possibly , Australia .
But even if you accept the neccessity of such a grim scenario , is it actually feasible ?
Could an entire people simply move to a new country , set up home there and pick up their lives again as if nothing bar the unfortunate disappearance of their old base had actually happened ?
The current consensus seems to be that it is not .
" It would be very difficult for a state , as such , to move , " says Dr Gareth Price , head of the Asia programme at the Royal Institute of International Affairs .
" There can be ad - hoc migration , of course , even of quite large numbers .
But there are big jurisdictional issues here , issues of sovereignty .
That said , it is a real problem , and one we 're going to have to get used to .
Nasheed is saying to the rest of the world , we really have to think about this .
We want to stay together , we do n't want to lose our culture , and this is n't our fault . "
No one doubts the Maldives ' crisis is real .
Made up of nearly 1,200 islands and atolls - 200 of them inhabited - in the Indian Ocean , it holds the record for the country with the lowest high point on earth : nowhere on the Maldives does the natural ground level exceed 2.3 m .
Most of its land mass , which totals roughly one - fifth of Greater London , is a great deal lower than that , averaging around 1.5m .
So , climate change will affect the Maldives more than most places .
Sea levels in the area have risen by about 20cm in the past century , and the UN estimates that they will rise a further 58 cm by 2100 .
The country and its capital , Male , were inundated by unusually high tides in 1987 that caused millions of dollars worth of damage .
The Asian tsunami of Christmas Eve 2004 was even more devastating .
The wave that struck the Maldives was barely a metre high , but it killed 82 people , displaced 12,000 more and inflicted $ 375 m ( £ 240 m ) of damage ( including $ 100 m to the exclusive beachside resorts ) .
Tourists may be vital to the Maldives ' economy , but they are all but ignorant of its problems .
The country is known as one of the world 's most upmarket destinations , its luxurious beachside bungalows proving particularly popular with honeymooning couples .
Nearly 90 otherwise uninhabited islands have been turned into resorts that pull in more than 600,000 mostly European visitors each year .
But while the average visitor apparently spends around $ 300 a day , they will rarely come into contact with local Maldivians , transported to their atoll by speedboat or small plane , and never stepping off it except for the odd day cruise .
This industry , though , accounts directly for maybe one - third of the Maldives ' GDP and at least 60 % of its foreign exchange .
Import duties and tourism - related taxes generate more than 90 % of the government 's income ; there is precious little other economic activity on the islands except for fishing .
Few of those visitors are going to want to keep on coming once their accommodation risks slipping , at any moment , beneath the waves .
The Maldives has been working for some time on one possible solution : constructing a new island , Hulu Male , or New Male , to which it hopes to be able to transfer the populations of some of its lowest - lying atolls and , eventually , the capital , currently one of the most densely populated towns in the world .
" They 've been dredging the waters around the existing island to raise it to above the 2.1 m - mark , " says Saleemul Huq , head of the climate - change group at the International Institute for Environment and Development .
Some of the smallest inhabited atolls , Huq says , " are thinking in terms of relocation " , but only , at this stage , within the archipelago .
Longer term , though , " if the measures we are taking to counter global warming do not prove sufficient , then it may well be that people will have to be moved further afield . "
Such eventualities are being discussed already , Huq says , with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change providing an initial forum to talk through the " adaptation " of the most vulnerable countries .
The island of Tuvalu , for example , is in talks with Australia about much the same kind of idea .
" But it 's plain , " Huq adds , " that the relocation of entire populations is a source of major potential conflict . "
The Maldivian president mentioned India , Sri Lanka or Australia as possible hosts for his island people .
In the case of the first two , at least , cultural differences for Maldivians would be minimal ( many islanders already work there , and wealthy Maldivians have been buying themselves homes in Sri Lanka for years ) .
Amid India 's 1.13 bn people , 300,000 Maldivians would not be a lot .
But quite apart from the human cost of uprooting them , the international legal system is simply not up to the job .
" There is n't really a big plot of land in either country which you could say is available , " says Price .
" There 's a possible parallel with the case of the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal - the US has volunteered to take 60,000 of them .
But that is a group of people , not a nation .
And it's hard to see what the Maldivians would do wherever they were to go : all they have is tourism and fishing .
If they have money , I suppose somewhere in Africa might volunteer - maybe a place like Zanzibar could work ?
But the real problems would be constitutional : a state cannot play host to another state .
In the case of Sri Lanka at least , the whole cause of its civil war is precisely this kind of federal issue . "
Some experts see further legal problems down the line .
The Inventory of Conflict and Environment , based at the American University in Washington DC , foresees potential for conflict within and beyond the Maldives increasing as sea levels around the country rise .
" It is possible that the Maldives would seek to be compensated by polluting countries for the loss of their islands , " it suggests in an advisory paper .
" However , it is unclear whether the Maldives would seek new sovereign territory elsewhere .
Additionally , it is unclear whether the Maldives would seek that territory in neighboring countries or elsewhere , such as in countries that contributed to the climate change in the first place like the United States or China .
Will a country that is threatened or destroyed by global warming demand compensation for its loss ?
Would the Maldives try to claim Washington , DC - which is roughly the same size as the Maldives ' territory - as compensation for the United States ' role in contributing to global warming ? "
Tourism has made the Maldivians by far the wealthiest people in South Asia , with a GDP per head of more than of $ 3,000 .
But the wealth is relative and the riches are thinly spread : in Guraidhoo , Kaafu atoll , nearly four years after the tsunami , familes still live in bare breeze - block huts , within eyesight of the luxurious Kandooma Island resort .
" Longer term , the issue of these low - lying island nations could start to become very problematic indeed , " says Huq .

Now Steven Pearlstein of the Post wants to close financial markets for a week :
What we need to do is to stop making things worse by continuing to over - rely on financial markets and financial institutions that have proven to be incapable of performing their core missions : getting capital to where it needs to go and pricing that capital in a way that reflects the risks and underlying economic values .
We have to stop digging .
Another week like this one , and there wo n’t be much left to rescue .
To begin , the markets could use a timeout just about now , something that lasts longer than a weekend and gives policymakers around the world the chance to get a good nice sleep and evaluate their options without feeling like they have to respond to every movement flashing across their Bloomberg screens .
It would allow some time for passions to cool and for real investors to regain control of markets now dominated by the computerized short - term trading strategies of hedge funds and hot - shot money managers desperate to recoup some of their losses .
I ca n’t imagine Pearlstein suggesting closing newspapers for a week , or banning them from printing bad finance news for a few weeks .
So Pearlstein does n’t get it : financial markets are news institutions , just like newspapers !
The fact that newspapers report a lot less news on this crisis on weekends shows that most crisis news now comes via financial markets .
Do n’t blame the messenger for telling you bad news ; blame those who caused the bad news , and who keep you from learning sooner .
Aside from times when firms issue stock or buy it back , stock trades do not change a firm ’s total capital ; they just gives us news about its future prospects .
Sure some of of these stock " reporters " can have incentives to mislead us , but newspaper reporters can also have incentives to mislead us .
Systems for detecting and punishing misleading reporters are far stronger and more effective in financial markets than in newspapers .
Yes both kinds of reporters are human , and can succumb to fear , herd mentalities , and other human biases .
But I see no authority we could trust to ban or overrule news on this basis – better to let those who see our mistakes early be rewarded for saying so within our news institutions .
Yes financial prices do often effect more than just finance traders , but that is almost entirely because financial prices contain valuable news , and we have set up our institutions to respond to that news in many ways .
If some of these responses are poorly designed , then let ’s fix them , but do n’t blame the news itself .
To the contrary , we should want even more similar news institutions to inform us on topics , like public policy , where current financial markets do not speak clearly .
That is the prediction market vision which I ’ve been pursuing for two decades .
It turns out our banking system was in bad shape , and now we are finally learning just how bad .
Instead of sticking our head in the sand to block bad news , we should be grateful to those who have finally told us , be eager to learn more quickly , and be angry with those who kept us from learning sooner .
But do n’t ban news , bad or good ; we need news now , more than ever .

The technology is the same as that of the simple inkjet printer found in homes and offices , but Japanese scientist Makoto Nakamura is on a mission to see if it can also produce human organs .
The idea is for the printer to jet out thousands of cells per second , rather than ink droplets , and to build them up into a three - dimensional organ .
" It would be like building a huge skyscraper on a micro level using different kinds of cells and other materials instead of steel beams , concrete and glass , " he said .
" Ultimately I hope to make a heart , " said Dr Nakamura , professor at the graduate school of science and technology for research at the state - run University of Toyama .
While Dr Nakamura says it would take him some 20 years to develop a heart , the feat could pave the way to mass produce " good hearts " for patients waiting for transplants .
A heart made of cells originating from the patient could eliminate fears that the body would reject it .
In the emerging field of organ printing , Dr Nakamura bills his work as the world 's finest printed 3D structure with living cells .
The technology works a bit like dealing with sliced fruit : an organ is cut horizontally , allowing researchers to see an array of cells on the surface .
If a printer drops cells one by one into the right spots and repeats the process for many layers , it creates a 3D organ .
Much like a printer chooses different colours , the machine can position different types of cells to drop .
Dr Nakamura has succeeded in building a tube with living cells .
It measures one millimetre in diameter and has double walls with two different kinds of cells , similar to the three - layer structure in human blood vessels .
He has also made a smaller single - wall hydrogel tube that measures one - tenth of a millimetre , as narrow as human hair .
The tubes are made by a 3D inkjet bioprinter that Dr Nakamura 's team developed in a three - year project completed earlier this year at Kanagawa Academy of Science and Technology , a foundation based south - west of Tokyo .
The printer can adjust where to drop cells in the order of one - thousandth of a millimetre and produce a tube at a speed of 3 centimetres per two minutes .

Attention is a rare and precious resource .
It ’s arguably more difficult than ever before to demand someone ’s attention for any length of time .
Attention is now something that cannot be taken , only given .
As marketers it is crucial to understand these facts in order to better perform our jobs in a digital world .
We must now optimize on numerous fronts .
We must be witty , pithy , catchy , exciting , controversial , bright , unexpected , or some combination of all .
And so we come to understand these truths , brush up on our writing skills , and dive headfirst into the realm of social media marketing .
We educate ourselves and follow resources like Copyblogger , Problogger , and others .
We find many of the old persuasive writing rules still hold ( e.g. the purpose of the headline is still to get readers to read the first sentence ) .
Upon further research , we find a bevy of tips and tricks for optimizing social media efforts for Stumble , Digg , RSS , etc .
But in the wake of SEO-ing , SMO-ing , and all other types of O - ing we face the danger of falling into a trap .
We must always remember that the quality of the content is paramount and be vigilant not to sacrifice that quality upon the altar of optimization .
Certainly , the headline of your blog post is crucial and , of course , there are ways to tweak it for an increased likelihood of success on different social media channels .
I also agree that hooking readers with powerful opening sentences or images is integral to social media success .
But a fundamental tenet of social media is that you must engage your readers / viewers / consumers .
It is unfortunate and frustrating to find a blog post that is just a series of hooks with no real meat .
I have found more than one company blog attempting to play the social media game where each paragraph was just a teaser for the following paragraph .
There was no payoff at the end .
When methodically optimizing your writing for search engines , social news sites , social bookmarking sites , scanners , visual learners , and diagonal readers you might forget to optimize for the most important person of all : your reader .
Taken directly from the about page here at Copyblogger , copywriting is :
The process of writing words … with the ultimate intention of having the reader take some form of action .
If the purpose of your blog is to provide meaningful content on a subject , then do n’t forget that one of the main actions you want your readers to take is to keep reading .
Use your skills / tips / tricks at the beginning of your writing to snag the reader ’s attention but then do n’t be afraid to set those tricks aside and earn that attention with your quality content …. with your meat .
That is how to engage social media consumers and start to build a relationship with them that will lead to whatever ultimate goal you have .
Effective writing for new media is more than the sum of optimization efforts .
The internet is not a commercial , pamphlet , catalog , brochure , radio ad , or magazine spread .
Optimization is certainly key to your efforts , but remember that it might not always be best to sacrifice your quality content to the fickle gods of ( insert - your - favorite - qualifier - here ) optimization .

Part I : Zombies
Aside from the " holiday season " ( Christmas / Hanukkah / Kwanza / New Year 's Eve Revelry / New Year 's Day " oh god why did I drink the whole bottle of Cantaloupe Schnapps ? ? "
Celebration / etc. ) , no time of year is better suited for board gaming than Halloween .
So , here 's a comprehensive guide to horror - themed games in honor of the occasion .
Part I looks exclusively at zombie games , in part II we will cover vampires , and part III will showcase the rest of the best .
Please note that I am only featuring games that are currently in print and available in English , as this is intended to be a buying guide and not just my personal musings on the best horror games .
Which is a long way of saying : do n't email me and inveigh about the absence of The Slime Monster Game or whatever .
And so , ladies and ghouls , without further a - boo ...:
Though a relatively recent addition to the genre ( it came out last year ) , the growing consensus is that this is the best zombie game on the market .
LNoE puts some players in the role of Heroes and the rest as Zombies , fighting tooth and nail ( and , of course , chainsaw ) in the heart of a small town .
The best thing about LNoE is it 's replayability : the game comes with five different scenarios ( with more available online ) , each of the playable Heroes is unique ( the Hot Nurse can heal , the Sheriff always has a revolver , etc. ) , and the rulebook includes an " Advanced " section in case the basic game just does n't include enough dynamite for your liking .
Plus , an expansion was just released , ensuring enough variability for many Halloweens to come .
* * *
: HOLY SHIT THREE EXCLAMATION POINTS ????!!
Prior to Last Night on Earth this was indisputably the reigning king of Zombie boardgames , and many prefer it to the johnny - come - lately .
Feign off the undead hordes as you make your way to the helipad and rescue .
Note that , unlike Last Night on Earth , Z !!! is a cut - throat game of competition -- in fact , the other players are often more hazardous to your health than the monsters .
That 's why some people like Z !!!
better -- and why others , like me , find the cooperative aspect of LNoE to be vastly more enjoyable .
* * *
: And besides , if I 'm going to play a screw - your - buddy Zombie game , I want to play one that will sow discord and ill - will between me and my fellow players for decades to come !
You know , like Mall of Horror , in which you do n't fight the zombies , you just try to survive them .
Every player has three characters ; on each turn someone must die , and the unlucky victim is decided by popular vote .
That 's right : you decide the fate of your fellow players , and they decide yours .
A game that could have easily gone onto my list of Friendship - Enders ( and , in fact , is similar is spirit and mechanics to the game Lifeboats ) which was second on that list ) .
* * *
Part II : Vampires and Witches
and : Light , simple , inexpensive , and funny , Give me the Brain and Lord of the Fries differ from the games above in pretty much every respect save one : Zombies remain the stars of the show .
In this case , you and your undead companions are workers in a fast - food restaurant that specializes in the grisliest of fare .
Both titles are fairly straightforward card games despite the theme , and each has a significant luck component ( so steer clear if that 's not your thing ) .
Still , the ease of learning and playing make these the most " family friendly " of the games on the list , and the grotesque elements of the artwork are tempered with enough humor to make them palatable to almost anyone . :
Got no friends and / or money ?
Head over to Jay Is Games and read my review of Zombie in my Pocket , a free , solitaire zombie game that only requires a printer , a pair of scissors , and 15 minutes of your time .
Quite an addictive little pastime . :
Oh man , so fun .
This is my go - to title for Halloween frivolity .

: A two - player game , with one person as the Count and the other as Dr. van Helsing .
Each is searching London for their target cards ( Dracula seeks victims , while van Helsing looks for coffins ) , and must do battle the underlings of the other .
Dracula is unusual in that it has a strong memory - component : London is represented by a grid of face - down cards at which players may occasionally peek , but must simply remember what they are ( and where they are ) thereafter .
I 'll admit to liking the game despite the memory aspect , rather than because of it .
* * *
: Dude , what is it with memory games and vampires ?
Like Dracula above , this one is also better if you 're not a senile old man like me , though the mnemonic component in Dawn Under is more akin to the classic " Memory " game you no doubt played as a kid .
Open graves in search of vacant ones in which your vampires can rest .
But if you open a tomb in which another play has already placed a vampire ( or garlic ) , you suffer a penalty .
One of those games that you 'll feel slightly guilty playing since it 's obviously " for kids " , but will find immensely enjoyable nonetheless .
Nominated for the 2004 German Game of the Year award .

: Beautiful card game in which players strive to collect ingredients a cauldrons to create potions and cast spells .
A relatively simple and short game ( less than an hour ) , but with plenty of novel mechanisms you are unlikely to have seen before .
Nominated for the 2008 German Game of the Year award . :
Whenever I write posts recommending games , I inevitably get comments from people expressing enthusiasm for Set ; folks , this is the game for you .
Nine custom dice are thrown , and then everyone simultaneously searches the rolled symbols for specific patterns .
Do so quickly and your witch will advance on her broom , possibly winning the race and the game .
Requiring both memory and speed , this is another game you can play competitively against young children -- and lose .
* * *
Part III : Miscellaneous Malevolence
: Another witchly race , but these jet - setters ride state - of - the - art vacuum cleaners .
Indeed nearly everything about this game is untraditional , from the fact that it's a boardgame with no board ( wha - ? ) , to the programmatic nature of movement ( your witch does n't budge until you 've plotted out his next five moves -- and then he does them all at once , possibly crashing into the other players as his does so ) .
I 'm not the first to observe that this is essentially a Harry Potter racing game without the license . : Call of Cthulhu , the board game .
A massive game in almost every respect ( scope , game length , pages of rules , price tag ... ) , this cooperative game has all the players working as a team to stop an Ancient One from destroying the world .
Highly recommended for those who love H. P. Lovecraft or games that simulate the RPG experience without requiring a lot of prep work .
One downside , though : despite taking 4 + hours to play , the game is n't terribly difficult to defeat , which can lead to some anti-climatic endings .
Fortunately , the many expansions address this by considerably upping the challenge ( the Dunwich Horror expansion , in particular , has ben very well received ) . :
The newest offering from the guys who designed Last Night on Earth ( see my top pick in Part I of this guide ) , Touch of Evil has the players working separately to defeat one of four different villains ( the Scarecrow , the Horseman , the Werewolf , and the Vampire ) , and is very much a disciple of the Talisman school of game design : move around the board , bulk up your character , and then take on the Big Baddie .
Of course there 's a reason why Talisman is so wildly popular -- this type of game is crazy fun -- and ToE even improves on the formula by keeping the playing time down around an hour .
* * *
: If you 're the sort to shy away from games that require spatial reasoning skills , this might be the most terrifying horror game on this list .
First , players move their tokens on the board , racing innocent victims through a dungeon toward the exit .
Then the Monster moves , following a specific and unvarying algorithm : he moves forward until he " sees " one or more player tokens , at which point he turns and moves toward whichever is closest .
As the Monster may turn several times during his movement , much of the game depends on your ability to correctly extrapolate his course .
Played among analytical types the game can get bogged down in number - crunching , but in a casual group it's an exciting contest with lots of " oh crap , I did not see that coming " moments .
* * *
: I 'm no fan of " take that ! " games , in which the players are constantly playing cards on one another to hinder progress ( think : Killer Bunnies or Muchkin , neither of which I can abide ) .
That said , two aspects of Gloom serve as an antidote to my reflexive dislike .
First is the great theme , which turns the usual screw - your - buddy mechanic on it's head : the object is to be the most miserable , so you play horrible events on yourself and sic such things as " picnic in the park " on your opponents -- ha !
Second , the game features cool transparent cards , which allow you see the accumulation of various bonuses and penalties .
Not a game I 'd play often , but once a year before Halloween is just about perfect . :
A number of commercial versions have cropped up ( The Werewolves of Millers Hollow Do You Worship Cthulhu ? , etc. ) , but all you really need are the rules , a deck of cards , a bunch of friends , and a healthy dose of paranoia .
You can read my ruminations on the game here

Those are my recommendations for Halloween Gaming .

Have fun !
A couple weeks ago I launched a poll asking people which TV show they preferred : ‘ Chuck ’ or ‘ Big Bang Theory ’ .
The theory I put forward was that I believed geeks watched either ‘ Chuck ’ or ‘ Big Bang Theory ’ , but not both .
Well the people have voted , 115 people to be exact .
I wanted a good cross-section of fans , so I promoted the poll through several sites ( reddit , Digg , delicious , the Unique Gee listserv , the ChuckTV forums , and the CBS Big Bang Theory forum ) .
According to the people who took this poll , my theory was incorrect .
While many people like one or the other as I theorized , there were a number of people that liked both shows ( 21 % to be exact ) .
Which TV show do you prefer , ‘ Chuck ’ or ‘ Big Bang Theory ’ ?
Chuck ( 34 % , 39 Votes )
Big Bang Theory ( 28 % , 32 Votes )
I watch and like both shows ( 21 % , 24 Votes )
I do n’t watch either show ( 17 % , 20 Votes )
If nothing else , the results showed that of the people that voted , more people like ‘ Chuck ’ than ‘ Big Bang Theory ’ .
Since I ’m more of a ‘ Chuck ’ fan , I guess that ’s something .
My thanks to everyone that participated in the poll .
Be sure to vote in the new poll on Star Trek !
The Haskell system GHC has libraries that provide the ability to compile Haskell code and dynamically load it into a running Haskell program .
A library that provides this functionality is hs -plugins .
Unfortunately hs - plugins does n't work with the latest GHC release , 6.10.1 .
There is an API to the internals of GHC that allows implementing runtime compilation and loading .
The api is documented but there are n't very many usage examples that work with the latest GHC release .
I stumbled across a blog post which no longer exists describing an older version of the API , but managed to retrieve it from archive.org which provided a lot of help since the API 's are similar .
As a means to learn how to use the API I decided on a very simple use case of compiling and loading a very simple Haskell module containing a single function ' print ' that outputs a string .
The module looks like this :
module Test ( Test.print ) where print :: String -> IO ( ) print x = putStrLn x
To compile and load this code dynamically we need a compilation target .
This is created using the function guessTarget .
It 's passed a string that refers to the name of a module , or the name of a source file .
By using a source file we can tell the Haskell system to compile and load it .
The phase argument I set to Nothing as I have no idea what that is .
Once we have the target it needs to be added to the current compilation session .
This is done via the addTarget function .
When all the targets are added , a call to load will do the equivalent of a ghc -- make to build the module if needed .
So all the relevant target code looks like :
do target <- guessTarget " Test.hs " Nothing addTarget target load LoadAllTargets
Notice this is run within the ' do ' syntax .
This is because all these compiler functions must be called with a special Monad , called GhcMonad .
The way this works is described later but just imagine that the GhcMonad is implicitly passed to all the Ghc functions we are calling automatically .
' load ' returns a success flag that can be pattern matched on to determine if it succeeds or failed .
If it succeeds we can start using the new module .
To be able to access exported functions from the module we need to get a reference to the module using findModule and use setContext on it .
' setContext ' takes two arrays containing modules .
All modules in the first array will have their top level scope available .
All modules listed in the second array will have only their exports available .
In this example we want to access the ' print ' function of ' Test ' , which is exported .
The function compileExpr is used to compile a string containing a Haskell expression .
The result of this is an HValue which we can do things with .
The expression that is compiled can access any of the bindings available in the context we set up via ' setContext ' .
So passing " Test.print " to ' compileExpr ' will return the function ' print ' from the ' Test ' module that we dynamically built and loaded .
Code similar to this :
do r <- load LoadAllTargets case r of Failed -> error " Compilation Failed " Succeeded -> do m <- findModule ( mkModuleName " Test " ) Nothing setContext [ ] [ m ] value <- compileExpr " Test.print "
Unfortunately the result of ' compileExpr ' is of no use to us as an HValue if we want the actual function type so we can call it .
Haskell being strongly typed we have to ' cheat ' by telling Haskell 'yes , I know you think this is an HValue , but I can assure you , it 's really a function ' .
This is Haskell 's super dangerous Unsafe .
Coerce .
It allows us to coerce from one type to another and is , as the name implies , completely unsafe .
If the type you are coercing is n't really of the type you are coercing too then you 'll very likely crash your program and / or corrupt data .
It 's the reinterpret_cast <> of the Haskell world .
But for handling dynamic loading of code it seems exactly what we want .
I 'm not sure of any other way to convert the HValue type .
The type of ' print ' in the ' Test ' module is ' String -> IO ( ) '. ' unsafeCoerce ' can be called to convert the ' HValue ' to this :
value <- compileExpr " Test.print " do let value ' = ( unsafeCoerce value ) :: String -> IO ( ) return value '
The receiver of the result , value ' , can now call the function as it knows its type .
The complete code for this example is :
import GHC import GHC .
Paths import DynFlags import Unsafe .
Coerce main :: IO ( ) main = defaultErrorHandler defaultDynFlags $ do func <- runGhc ( Just libdir ) $ do dflags <- getSessionDynFlags setSessionDynFlags dflags target <- guessTarget " Test.hs " Nothing addTarget target r <- load LoadAllTargets case r of Failed -> error " Compilation failed " Succeeded -> do m <- findModule ( mkModuleName " Test " ) Nothing setContext [ ] [ m ] value <- compileExpr ( " Test.print " ) do let value ' = ( unsafeCoerce value ) :: String -> IO ( ) return value ' func " Hello " return ()
Build using :
$ ghc - package ghc -- make Api.hs [ 1 of 1 ] Compiling Main ( Api.hs , Api.o ) Linking Api ... $ ./ Api Hello $
You can test that it is dynamically compiling and loading by modifying ' Test.hs ' so the output is different .
Change the ' putStrLn ' to putStrLn $ x ++ " World ! " and rerun ' Api ' without recompiling it :
$ ./Api Hello World ! $
I mentioned previously the implicit ' GhcMonad ' that is passed to each GHC API function .
This is provided by the runGhc word .
It takes a pointer to the directory where GHC 's library files reside .
In this example I use the GHC .
Paths ( available from Hackage package to deal with this using ' libdir ' .
The second argument is the action to perform , the GhcMonad , and is built using the ' do ' syntax .
Haskell 's ' do ' syntax is syntactic sugar that does the magic of threading the GhcMonad state holding the targets , modules , contexts , etc through the various function calls .
Find a favourite Monad tutorial / explanation if you want to know more .
' defaultErrorHandler ' sets up the environment to handle compilation errors in a standard way .
The ' DynFlags ' related calls get and set standard flags that can be used to configure the compilation .
You can set the equivalent of GHC arguments to control extra features that GHC can use , or use the interpreter ( as used by GHCi ) rather than the compiler .
Hopefully that helps explain some of what is going on and how to use the current GHC api .
I 'd appreciate comments on better ways of doing things , and other examples of the API .
Milwaukee 's Dan Shelley Exposes How ' Conservative ' Talkers Create Their Phony Narrative on the Publicly - Owned Airwaves ...
Brad Friedman Byon
12/1/2008 , 3:36 pm PT
This article in Milwaukee Magazine was published last week , but I only had the chance to read it today .
It was written by Dan Shelley , the former news director / program manager at one of Milwaukee 's largest and most powerful radio stations , WTMJ .
The article offers a lot of inside skinny on how Rightwing Radio chooses its slanted topics , marches in lockstep with GOP talking points , sets up its " conservative " listeners as victims , and shuts out all but the most artfully selected opposing viewpoints .
Shelley points to the popular Charlie Sykes , who hosts one of the shows he 'd produced for years at WTMJ , and some others by way of examples of how the scam works .
" There is no way to win a disagreement with Charlie Sykes , " writes Shelley .
" Calls from listeners who disagree with him do n’t get on the air if the show ’s producer , who generally does the screening , fears they might make Charlie look bad .
I witnessed several occasions when Sen. Russ Feingold , former Mayor John Norquist , Mayor Tom Barrett or others would call in , but would n’t be allowed on the air . "
I 'll take this moment to mention , yet again , that this is all being done on the publicly owned airwaves , which we grant license to out of the kindness of our public hearts , and which the wingnuts enjoy as public welfare queens to bludgeon Americans into voting against their own self - interest .
There 's a reason guys like Hannity , Limbaugh and O'Reilly are so frightened of some form of restoration of the Fairness Doctrine .
It 's not because it would remove them from the air , as they like to lie about to their listeners , but because it would actually require them to be fair by carrying opposing viewpoints .
Ya know , that balance thing you 've heard so much about on Fox " News " where they 're just kidding about it .
If they were n't kidding about it , why would they be so terrified about restoring what Reagan did away with in 1987 , which then allowed for the Hannitys , Limbaughs and O'Reillys to go on air , on virtually every single station , in every single market , to freely lie to the public via its own airwaves ?...
Shelley writes that rightwing hosts " are popular and powerful because they appeal to a segment of the population that feels disenfranchised and even victimized by the media .
These people believe the media are predominantly staffed by and consistently reflect the views of social liberals .
This view is by now so long - held and deep - rooted , it has evolved into part of virtually every conservative ’s DNA . "
He goes on to give a few bullet point examples of the most egregious hypocrisy of the wingnut radio m.o. over the last 8 years or so , and how their narrative would have been completely different had the offenders in question been Democrats instead of Republicans .
See the excerpts posted below for some of that , but I 'd otherwise strongly recommend a full read of the entire article ...
A great talk show host is like a great college debater , capable of arguing either side of any issue in a logical , thorough and convincing manner .
This skill ensures their continuing success regardless of which political party is in power .
For example : •
In the talk show world , the line - item veto was the most effective way to control government spending when Ronald Reagan was president ; it was a violation of the separation of powers after President Clinton took office .
• Perjury was a heinous crime when Clinton was accused of lying under oath about his extramarital activities .
But when Scooter Libby , Vice President Dick Cheney ’s top aide , was charged with lying under oath , it was the prosecutor who had committed an egregious act by charging Libby with perjury .
• " Activist judges " are the scourge of the earth when they rule it is unconstitutional to deny same - sex couples the rights heterosexuals receive .
But judicial activism is needed to stop the husband of a woman in a persistent vegetative state – say Terri Schiavo – from removing her feeding tube to end her suffering .
To amuse myself while listening to a talk show , I would ask myself what the host would say if the situation were reversed .
What if alleged D.C. Madam client Sen. David Vitter had been a Democrat ?
Would the reaction of talk show hosts have been so quiet you could hear crickets chirping ?
Hardly .
Or what if former Rep. Mark Foley had been a Democrat ?
Would his pedophile - like tendencies have been excused as a “ prank ” or mere “ overfriendly e-mails ? ”
Not on the life of your teenage son .
Suppose Al Gore was president and ordered an invasion of Iraq without an exit strategy .
Suppose this had led to the deaths of more than 4,000 U.S. troops and actually made that part of the world less stable .
Would talk show hosts have dismissed criticism of that war as unpatriotic ?
No chance .
Or imagine that John Kerry had been president during Hurricane Katrina and that his administration ’s rescue and rebuilding effort had been horribly botched .
Would talk show hosts have branded him a great president ?
Of course not .
It was Katrina , finally , that made me truly see the light .
Until then , 10 years into my time at TMJ , while I might have disagreed with some stands the hosts took , I did think there were grounds for their constant criticism of the media .
I had convinced myself that the national media had an intrinsic bias that was , at the very least , geographical if not ideological , to which talk radio could provide an alternative .
Then along came the worst natural disaster in U.S. history .
Read the full story for Shelley 's outrage at what he witnessed from his rightwing talk show hosts as New Orleans drowned .
Hint :
It was all just an illusion of the " liberal media " and the " angry left " naturally ...

Well said , Jill C .

To characterize Donofrio 's lawsuit as " lunatic right " is silly and misleading .
He 's challenging both candidates - a fact which you conveniently hide until you 're almost done whining .
This is like everything else - if there 's evidence , let 's hear it , and if its poor evidence , let these people humiliate themselves so we do n't have to deal with them again in the next election .
But do n't go telling us what to think about it .
I agree with JEA in that we 're talking about the office of President here !
There needs to be no doubt about the legitimacy or trustworthiness of the person who holds that office .
And how is this racism ?
The dude is suing both men - one is white , and one is not .
There has been plenty of racism throughout the Presidential contest for sure .
A lawsuit against both men does not support that accusation , though .
Obama could show how great a leader he is , simultaneously saving the Supreme Court 's time and putting the plaintiffs in their place by producing the appropriate documentation in a bi-partisan ( if you still believe we have a two - party system ) forum .
His silence in such a simple issue is unreasonable .
Donofrio has just as much right to sue the Presidential candidates as you do to whine about it .
And maybe , because of Clarence Thomas , we 'll know soon whether to ignore just your rants , or yours AND Donofrio's .

Currently , Title 8 of the U.S. Code fills in those gaps .
Section 1401 defines the following as people who are " citizens of the United States at birth : " * Anyone born inside the United States
* Any Indian or Eskimo born in the United States , provided being a citizen of the U.S. does not impair the person 's status as a citizen of the tribe
* Any one born outside the United States , both of whose parents are citizens of the U.S. , as long as one parent has lived in the U.S .
* Any one born outside the United States , if one parent is a citizen and lived in the U.S. for at least one year and the other parent is a U.S. national
* Any one born in a U.S. possession , if one parent is a citizen and lived in the U.S. for at least one year
* Any one found in the U.S. under the age of five , whose parentage cannot be determined , as long as proof of non-citizenship is not provided by age 21
* Any one born outside the United States , if one parent is an alien and as long as the other parent is a citizen of the U.S. who lived in the U.S. for at least five years ( with military and diplomatic service included in this time )
* A final , historical condition : a person born before 5/24/1934 of an alien father and a U.S. citizen mother who has lived in the U.S.
Anyone falling into these categories is considered natural - born , and is eligible to run for President or Vice President Link

Although I did not vote for Mr. Obama , because not one of his issue is agreeable to me , I will accept him as my president by honoring my trust .
Mr. Obama believes that he can win in the courts and that his extreme arrogance will " shoo - away ' any nagging flies that may come his way .
The problem he has in with the American people who think and read and keep up with the issues ... what is called , " The Real America " .
I completely agree with JEA 's comments .
Mr. Obama only needs to be up front with us and we will accept him in our office of President , otherwise , it will be as if he does not exist .
As with the Senate , in 1998 , the Supreme Court lacked the courage to accept Mr. Donofrio 's charge that Mr. Obama is not eligible to become President in an effort to have Mr. Obama produce a document that each of us needs to get a Social Security Card , a drivers license , and in some cases a loan from a bank .
My fervent prayer is that the TRUTH will come into the light for all to see .
I close with this thought : Mr. Obama only does things that will result in political expediancy ... he is a cold and calculating operator ... we have learned through investigators ( Thank You Lord for the Internet ... curse you Main Stream Media ) many of the " mentors " of Mr. Obama and also his philosophical views ... the only thing that Mr. Obama does not realize is that this country is bigger than he is and the minute he turns in the direction that he has wanted to move this country the call of " impeachment " will go up and he will be recalled .
At this point in time , the electors have a sacred trust to uphold ... I will be praying for them ... Amen .

The documents have been produced ... and reviewed in person by various authorities ... and the far - right wingnuts still howled .
And the far - right wingnuts still howl , even in these comments , each demanding the impossibility of a genuine Obama birth certificate of their own for each one of them to scrutinize obsessively .
And the far - right wingnuts will still be howling no matter how many tons of evidence are produced .
The far - right wingnuts will still be howling as Obama is inaugurated .
And the far - right wingnuts will still be howling as Obama fails to vanish in a puff of brimstone - flavored smoke upon placing his hand on the bible .
And the far - right wingnuts will still be howling after Obama fails to immediately bomb the Pentagon .
And the far - right wingnuts will still be howling as the rethugs impeach him for something - or - the - other two seconds after his ass hits the chair in the Oval Office .
And the far - right wingnuts wo n't stop howling ... ever .
Why do they howl ?
Because if they stop howling for even a moment they 'll have to listen to themselves trying to think ... and that hurts too much for them to even contemplate .
Obama represents a problem , coming to power at this particular time of multiple global crises ... but the problem is not his race or his religion or his citizenship .
The problem is that he 's been shaped by a Democratic party that was beaten near - senseless by the corporations and their rethug tools ... to the point where what is now called " centrist " was once called " Republican " ... and he 's most probably not the leaader that 's needed now .
I 'd like to be proven wrong in that , but it seems unlikely .
But he is a natural - born citizen , and he will be President of the United States , and the alternative was the carefully - presented catastrophe of McCaine - Palin .
And that is all .

Commenter # 1 up there sounds so reasonable in a way .
Just let us see it , and all will be well .
But no matter what Obama produced , even if it was certified by God Himself , would only somehow prove that the conspiracy goes even deeper .
Responding will not make them go away .
Not responding wo n't either , unfortunately .
These people are going to be the barnacles on the ship of state until they take their medication or another Republican is installed .
At least it will keep them occupied and even further marginalized .

Jill C. , Zapkitty , et al , are right --- there is absolutely nothing that will satisfy or convince those who desperately cling to the debunked " Obama birth certificate " insanity .
At first it was just sad , but now the whole effort is increasingly funny and entertaining .
But it 's illuminating to see just who bravely eschews all evidence to the contrary to pursue their patriotic duty --- not least of which , as Jill C. points out in the blog item above , is Clarence Thomas , Supreme Court Justice for life .
Hey , " Obama Birth Certificate Truthers " : why is the evidence presented in the following links ( and elsewhere , ad nauseum ) insufficient for your needs ?
What would be sufficient evidence , in your eyes ?
What is it you believe reallllllly happpennnnnnned ?!?!?!1!
And specifically for JEA at # 1 , at what point does carrying on this birth certificate witch hunt in the face of much evidence to the contrary cross over to bearing false witness ?
Obama 's Birth Certificate Verified By State
HONOLULU ---
The state 's Department of Health director on Friday released a statement verifying the legitimacy of Sen. Barack Obama birth certificate .
The truth about Obama 's birth certificate .
FactCheck.org staffers have now seen , touched , examined and photographed the original birth certificate .
We conclude that it meets all of the requirements from the State Department for proving U.S. citizenship .
Claims that the document lacks a raised seal or a signature are false .
We have posted high - resolution photographs of the document as " supporting documents " to this article .
Our conclusion : Obama was born in the U.S.A. just as he has always said .
...
In late July , a researcher looking to dig up dirt on Obama instead found a birth announcement that had been published in the Honolulu Advertiser on Sunday , Aug. 13 , 1961 ...
Obama birth certificate truthers need to get deeply involved in the Republican Party and infiltrate at all levels , because only then can the GOP fully investigate this mystery , and only through a GOP investigation can the findings be legitimate .
The truth is out there and you must find it !!!!!1!!!!!

OK , I see the tie to the worker sit-in with Republic Windows and Doors ... but the article says Blagojevich has been investigated for 3 years - so where is the evidence for a setup by BoA ?
And I also read the stories about how Spitzer was behind fining BoA 675 million over illegal trading .
However , how does that justify either Spitzer 's actions , or Blagojevich 's statements ?

I guess the reality is that the adage about politicians is true - they 're all crooks and liars to some degree , and power corrupts .
This is why we have to demand accountability from Democrats as well as Republicans .
How can we demand this accountability from people like Pelosi and Obama when they are all tied into the corporate machine ?
Without popular revolution , I think we are generally screwed .
I was actually hoping for complete economic collapse , destruction of the status quo , at least then we can rebuild in a way that identifies and rejects the elements of the current economic and political structures that are patently undemocratic and oppressive .

I would n't raise the issue or religion , except that JEA already did .
JEA argues just like so many others who claim that " the world is only 6,000 years old , " and when you point them to SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE of objects considerably older than that , they explain that " God PUT those objects there . "
This type of circular logic is scary .
All I would tell the Rethuglican and theocratic nutjobs out there about Obama is " do n't worry ! "
He 's not going to be nearly as liberal as you were scared into thinking he would be .
He 's corporate - bought and paid for , just like the rest of them .

Both candidates were born to U.S. citizens .
Ergo , it does n't matter WHERE they were born .
If Obama 's mom had not been a citizen , then , fine , the question of his actual birthplace is salient , but she was , so stow it .
I 'd have loved to jump all over a technicality with McSenile 's birth in Panama , but his parents were citizens .
He 's a goddam natural born citizen , just as Obama would still be had he been born out of the country .
The fact that both he and Hawaii have been insisting he was born here does n't seem to penetrate , but , since his mother was a citizen , that means he could have been born on the moon and he 's still eligible to be president .

The purpose of this kind of thing is to control the news agenda , to keep us all from moving on to topics that would otherwise be even more damaging to the Republicans .
The Grumpy Old People party is great at this .
After all , it's what they have to be good at , since reality does n't really work for them .
This is just a source of smoke , and to deal with it at all just sucks you into their movie , crediting them , debating them , discussing them .
It 's like those the kind of " computer virus " where someone sends gets an email warning them that they may have been infected by a virus , and the way to tell is to go and look to see if a certain file is present .
If it is , then they have already been infected , and they should first send email to all of their friends that they may also have been compromised , and then remove the file .
Of course it 's the email itself that IS the virus , and removing the file harms your system making it hard to get back on the internet at all .
My brother fell for that one .
He probably heard from about 50 friends advising him that he was stupid , etc .
The damage done was mostly in the amount of time that was spent by everyone explaining the thing , etc .
Let 's not get so taken up with these mosquitoes that we lose our focus on draining the swamp .
As soon as this one dies down , there will be something else .
Count on it .
Roll your eyes , shake your head , and post about something else .
Like for example : Yesterday evening on NPR they reported about Don Siegelman , and ended by saying that the Bush administration had asked the Justice Department to investigate the situation .
And then they dropped it , without the slightest hint that this was the most incredibly ironic bomb that had just been dropped .
Anyone who is not already up to speed on all of it would thing , oh , good , they 'll be getting to the bottom of that , nothing to see here ...
We might talk about this for instance .

Multiprocessors with relaxed memory models can be very confusing .
Writes can be seen out of order , reads can be speculative and return values from the future –what a mess !
In order to impose some kind of consistency you have to use memory fences , and there are several kinds of them .
The x86 seems to be an oasis in the perilous landscape of relaxed memory multicores .
The Intel x86 memory model , detailed in Intel 64 Architecture Memory Ordering White Paper and the AMD spec , AMD64 Architecture Programmer ’s Manual , list a lot of memory ordering guarantees , among them :
Loads are not reordered with other loads .
Stores are not reordered with other stores .
Stores are not reordered with older loads .
In a multiprocessor system , memory ordering obeys causality ( memory ordering respects transitive visibility ) .
In a multiprocessor system , stores to the same location have a total order .
In a multiprocessor system , locked instructions have a total order .
Loads and stores are not reordered with locked instructions .
The x86 also has ( expensive–on the order of 100 cycles ) memory fence instructions , mfence , lfence , and sfence ; but , considering all those guarantees , why would anyone use them ?
The famous double - checked locking pattern , on the x86 , works just fine without any fences .
This is a very important question , because you do n’t want the compiler to over - fence your code and bring it to a crawl .
On the other hand , you do n’t want it to emit incorrect code .
I decided to look for some answers .
There is one important non -guarantee listed in the x86 spec :
Loads may be reordered with older stores to different locations
Here ’s an example from the x86 spec : x and y are in shared memory and they are both initialized to zero , r1 and r2 are processor registers .
Thread 0 Thread 1 mov [ _x ] , 1
mov r1 , [ _y ] mov [ _y ] , 1
mov r2 , [ _x ]
When the two threads execute on different cores , the non-intuitive result r1 == 0 and r2 == 0 is allowed .
Notice that such result is consistent with the processor executing the loads before the stores ( which access different locations ) .
How important is this example ?
I needed to find an algorithm that would be broken by this relaxation .
I ’ve seen Dekker ’s algorithm mentioned in this context .
There is a more modern version of it used in the Peterson lock .
It ’s a mutual exclusion algorithm that works for two threads only .
It assumes that each thread has access to a thread - local ID , which is 0 for one thread and 1 for the other .
Here ’s the version adapted from The Art of Multiprocessor Programming :
class Peterson { private : // indexed by thread ID , 0 or 1 bool _interested [ 2 ] ; // who 's yielding priority ?
int _victim ; public : Peterson ( ) { _victim = 0 ; _interested [ 0 ] = false ; _interested [ 1 ] = false ; } void lock ( ) { // threadID is thread local , // initialized either to zero or one int me = threadID ; int he = 1 - me ; _interested [ me ] = true ; _victim = me ; while ( _interested [ he ] && _victim == me ) continue ; } void unlock ( ) { int me = threadID ; _interested [ me ] = false ; } }
To explain how it works , let me impersonate one of the threads .
When I ( the thread ) want to take a lock , I set my _interested slot to true .
I am the only writer of this slot , although the other guy can read it .
I also toggle the _victim switch to point to myself .
Now I check if the other guy is also interested .
As long as he is , and I am the victim , I spin .
But once he becomes uninterested or turns himself into a victim , the lock is mine .
When I ’m done executing critical code , I reset my _interested slot , thus potentially releasing the other guy .
Let me simplify this a little , and partition the code between the two threads .
Instead of an array _interested , there are two variables zeroWants and oneWants corresponding to the two slots .
zeroWants = false ; oneWants = false ; victim = 0 ;
Thread 0 Thread 1 zeroWants = true ;
victim = 0 ;
while ( oneWants && victim == 0 )
continue ;
// critical code
zeroWants = false ; oneWants = true ;
victim = 1 ;
while ( zeroWants && victim == 1 )
continue ;
// critical code
oneWants = false ;
Finally , let me rewrite the initial part of the execution in pseudo assembly .
Thread 0 Thread 1 store ( zeroWants , 1 )
store ( victim , 0 )
r0 = load ( oneWants )
r1 = load( victim ) store ( oneWants , 1 )
store ( victim , 1 )
r0 = load( zeroWants )
r1 = load( victim )
Now look at the loads and stores to zeroWants and oneWants .
They follow the same pattern as in the x86 reordering example .
The processor is free to move the read of oneWants before the write to zeroWants ( and to victim ) .
Similarly , it can move the read of zeroWants before the write to oneWants .
We may end up with the following execution :
Thread 0 Thread 1 r0 = load ( oneWants )
store ( zeroWants , 1 )
store ( victim , 0 )
r1 = load( victim ) r0 = load( zeroWants )
store ( oneWants , 1 )
store ( victim , 1 )
r1 = load( victim )
Originally , both zeroWants and oneWants are initialized to zero , so both r1 and r2 may end up zero .
In that case , the spin loop is never executed and both threads march into the critical section .
Peterson lock on the x86 is broken !
Of course , there is a way to fix it .
An mfence will force the correct ordering .
It can be put anywhere between the store of zeroWants and the load of oneWants in one thread , and between the store of oneWants and the load of zeroWants in the other thread .
So here we have a real - life example that requires an actual fence on an x86 .
The problem is real !

Here are simple , easy ideas to begin building green habits in every part of your life .
They ’re easily impemented by anyone , and that makes them both practical and possible .
4 Painless Green Habits At Work
( Image via stephentrepreneur )
Get everyone recycling .
Everything can be recycled – from paper to plastic to glass to metal to food to cardboard to packing peanuts .
Designate bins and make sure everyone knows what to do .
Turn off all electronics .
Myths abound , but turning off computers and powering down the Xerox is most efficient .
Save extra energy by encouraging everyone to use surge strips and unplug battery charges and personal electronic devices .
Change thermostat settings .
Open the windows rather than turn on the A/C if the heat is not too unbearable .
Adjust the thermostat to a setting of two degrees warmer and two degrees cooler ( corresponding to temperature fluctuations ) and no one will even notice , yet the company will save and the planet will benefit .
Get to work via mass transit or carpooling .
Whether you bike , carpool , ride the bus or subway or walk , explore other options to reduce your carbon impact .
Lengthy commutes are responsible for massive pollution and , in part , for global warming .
At the least , encourage everyone to buy a hybrid for their next auto purchase .
4 Painless Green Habits At Home
( Image via tanakawho )
Recycle everything .
As stated above , there is virtually nothing you cannot actually recycle ( or reuse ) .
Change thermostat settings .
Just as you can do at work , you can also do at home .
Turn off lights and electronics .
Spend a little money ( under $ 30 ) on a wireless home remote control that can shut off lamps , televisions , computers , and any other electronics or appliances at the touch of a button .
This is a great way to ensure that your home is n’t using needless ( and expensive ) energy .
No more yelling at the kids to turn off the lights .
Buy natural , organic , safe .
Choose nontoxic cleaners that wo n’t harm wildlife , the groundwater supply or you .
Choose nontoxic paints , linens , carpeting , flooring and decor .
Some health symptoms can actually be alleviated by choosing organic options in your home , and it ’s just better for the planet .
4 Painless Green Habits At Meal Time
( Image via serenejournal )
Eat less .
Not only will you be healthier but the planet will benefit .
Be mindful of how much you eat .
Take your time chewing ; enjoy your food ; try to eat a bit less at every meal .
Save food or compost it .
Americans throw away nearly 1/3 of their food and this is unnecessary ( not to mention expensive ) .
Save leftovers – donate them , turn them into stews and soups , or compost them as a last resort .
Eat at home and make meals .
Brown bag your lunch to save hundreds every month .
Eat at home to reconnect with your food sources , appreciate nature , and naturally de-stress ( it ’s cheaper than a massage ! ) .
You will save a great deal of money eating at home , and avoid packaged , processed , ineffecient vending machine / takeout / restaurant fare .
Eat vegetarian 1 meal a day .
Meat is terrible for the planet because it is unsustainable as an every - meal choice .
You do n’t have to give up steak or chicken ( although it ’s wise to buy organic and free range ) , but eating vegetarian at one meal is a significant and meaningful way to help the planet that is just as effective as any other green habit .
4 Painless Green Habits With Others
( Image via Elenapaint )
Give home - made , vintage , green or intangible gifts .
Your friends and family value you – your time – more than anything you could possibly buy them .
Do n’t feel compelled to charge up the credit card at Christmas or on birthdays .
Make a meal , bake cookies , write a poem , create a hand - crafted card , donate to a good cause in their name , plant a tree or simply go on a walk .
Focus on creating quality memories , not buying a gift card for ever more stuff .
Encourage green habits by being a good role model .
You ca n’t preach to others about taking the bus or eating tofu when you drive a Range Rover and chow on T - bones .
Set a good example and that will cause much more change than all the talking in the world .
Educate yourself and fight the impulse purchase .
Focus activities on healthy things .
Rather than rapid consumption – wasteful meals , polluting sports and games , smoking and drinking – focus your activities with friends on healthy things that benefit you , your body , and the planet .
Volunteer for a green cause .
A great way to help the planet is to get into the habit of spending free time doing good for others and the land , rather than simply loafing off or playing video games .
There ’s nothing wrong with being a couch potato from time to time , but it ’s great to volunteer your time as well .
Look into road cleanups , beach cleanups , animal rescue , homeless shelter service , food collecting and other great green causes .
Go green !
Mr Steinbruck has not minced his words Germany 's finance minister has strongly criticised Gordon Brown 's plans for reviving the UK economy , describing them as a " breathtaking " and " crass " .
But sources close to the British government hit back , saying Berlin was " out of step " with most nations on how to handle the crisis .
Peer Steinbruck had criticised the UK 's decision to cut VAT and raise the national debt to record levels .
His attack came before EU leaders met for an economic summit in Brussels .
The two - day meeting on Thursday and Friday has been billed as one of the most important summits for years .
In addition to seeking agreement on a new climate change deal , leaders are trying to agree backing for the European Commission 's planned 200bn euros ( $ 267bn ; £ 178 m ) Europe - wide economic stimulus package .
Diplomatic breach French President Nicholas Sarkozy , who will be chairing the talks , said in a letter to fellow leaders : " We shall be required to take a series of decisions with highly significant implications for the future of Europe . "
Germany is less than happy with the direction being taken in the UK , and was expected at the summit to question the European Commission 's recovery package along similar lines .
Mr Steinbruck 's comments , in an interview with Newsweek magazine , represented an unusual breach of diplomatic conventions .
He questioned the effectiveness of the decision to cut VAT from 17.5 % to 15 % .
" Are you really going to buy a DVD player because it now costs £ 39.10 instead of £ 39.90 ? " he said .
" All this will do is raise Britain 's debt to a level that will take a whole generation to work off . "
' Tossing around billions '
Mr Steinbruck questioned why Britain was " tossing around billions " and closely following the high public spending model put forward by 20th Century economist John Maynard Keynes .
" The switch from decades of supply - side politics all the way to a crass Keynesianism is breathtaking , " he said .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne said the comments shattered Labour 's charge that only the Conservatives oppose the VAT measures .
BBC political correspondent Jo Coburn said sources close to Downing Street and the Treasury were unhappy about the comments .
But she said they dismissed them by saying that Germany " was in a minority position and out of step with most other countries on how to deal with the looming recession " .
Downing Street also pointed out that Germany has already introduced its own package of extra spending .
Chancellor Alistair Darling announced in last month 's pre-Budget report that the government would inject an extra £ 20bn into the UK economy in a bid to get it moving again .
Rescue package
And combined with the impact of the downturn on tax receipts , the chancellor said that the UK 's total annual public sector deficit would soar to £ 118bn next year .
While Mr Steinbruck has accused the UK of over - spending on the economic recovery , the German government has put 480 bn euros ( £ 370.4bn ; $ 645 bn ) into a rescue package for its banks .
Most other European governments have also increased public spending to try to ease the impact of the economic downturn .
France recently announced plans to spend 26bn euros .
A Treasury spokesman said : " There is a broad international consensus that a fiscal stimulus is the right thing for economies now . "

Complaints of choppy frame rates and graphical glitches are peppered throughout Bethesda 's forums for the game , with others complaining about random lock ups and various other issues - textures not loading , significant slowdown etc .
Two major bugs have already been addressed by Bethesda in the forums , one concerning the game freezing during the GOAT test earlier in the game , and another dealing with the game pausing whenever a PS3 notification occurs .
The first issue can apparently be solved by saving and restarting , while they suggest turning off notifications in the XMB for the second .
We 've contacted Bethesda regarding these issues , specifically inquiring as to the possibility of a patch to fix problem with the PS3 version .

Helicopter in dramatic near - miss with ' sinister ' UFO 1,500ft above Birmingham
A helicopter pilot said he nearly crashed with a UFO over Birmingham ( artist 's impression )
It was a cloudless night and the police helicopter was carrying out surveillance over Birmingham when the attention suddenly switched from ground to sky .
Beside it was a small aircraft beaming out continuous blue - green lights .
It came within almost 300 ft , forcing the pilot to swerve out of its path , and appeared to circle the helicopter in a cheeky gesture before flying off .
Initially the pilot and two police observers dismissed the near miss at 1,500 ft as a close encounter with a model plane .
But despite searching the area with a thermal camera , the pilot was unable to find any signs of radio - controlled activity .
The British Model Flying Association
also dismissed this possibility , saying the mystery object was flying too high to be a miniature craft , while gliders , kites , balloons and a laser light show were further excluded from the possibilities .
All of which leads UFO experts to believe that alien forces were at work .
Details of the incident , which happened at about 9.50 pm on May 2 , were revealed yesterday in a document compiled by experts from the Airprox Board , which records near misses and reports them to the military and air traffic control units .
The report describes the strange other aircraft only as ' small and probably non-metallic ' and its intent as possibly ' sinister ' .
It adds that the pilot informed radar operators but they saw nothing on their equipment .
He told the Airprox Board that he thought ' the intent may either have been sinister or just someone messing around ' .
Yesterday a West Midlands Police spokesman attempted to play down the incident , saying : ' As far as the pilot and the crew were concerned , nothing was picked up on Birmingham Airport radar and the object was probably a radio - controlled model aircraft .
' The helicopter was conducting a search at the time and was flying slowly at low level . '
Near miss :
The ' UFO ' incident happened 1,500ft over Birmingham
But Nick Pope , who worked for the Ministry of Defence 's UFO desk and is nicknamed the British Fox Mulder after the science - fiction character in The X - Files , favours a less complacent approach .
' A helicopter was nearly blown out of the sky , ' he said .
' This is a very disturbing incident which needs to be thoroughly investigated by the MoD and the Civil Aviation Authority as well as other near misses .
' The conclusion on the report is unsatisfactory especially when this aircraft came within seconds of a collision .
' It is a very interesting case especially when you look at the eyewitnesses .
They are credible and reliable sources who have experience in night - time flying .
' This sighting clearly illustrates that whatever one believes about UFOs , this incident raises important air safety issues and should be taken seriously . '
The government bailed out the financial industry because banks and insurers are too intricately involved with each other and the public at large to fail .
If AIG goes down , so goes much more .
This is not the case with the auto industry , or so the government reasons .
The auto industry on the other hand , disagrees .
They 've got a message for the government and the public at large :
Give us money or you 'll all be unemployed .
And then there will be no money for the government .
CNNMoney : If the Big Three carmakers were to cut U.S. operations by 50 % , 2.5 million jobs could be lost in 2009 , according to a study released Wednesday .
The Center for Automotive Research ( CAR ) , reported that the total employment impact includes nearly 250,000 jobs lost at the automakers and nearly 800,000 at auto industry suppliers .
In addition , CAR projects that there would be over 1.4 million additional job losses outside the industry , such as those lost from store closings in the community hit by a plant closing .
In economic terms , cutting operations in half would reduce personal income by over $ 125.1 billion in the first year , and $ 275.7 billion over three years , CAR said .
And the impact of this personal income loss would cost the government $ 49.9 billion in 2009 , and over $ 108.1 billion in total tax losses over three years .
The national fundraising committee for GOP congressional candidates has canceled its Twin Cities TV advertising for Rep. Michele Bachmann , who is using the flap over her comments about Barack Obama to raise money on her own .
The National Republican Congressional Committee pulled ads scheduled to begin running Monday through Election Day .
At just KSTP television , the canceled ads would have cost $ 50,000 from Oct. 27 through Nov. 4 .
A Republican source confirmed Wednesday that the NRCC is pulling its funding out of the Sixth District race .
The ads were canceled Tuesday afternoon , after several days in which Bachmann was the subject of criticism for her televised remark on Friday that Obama " may have anti-American views . "
Her DFL opponent , Elwyn Tinklenberg , reports receiving $ 1.3 million in donations since Bachmann made the comment in response to a question from Chris Matthews , host of MSNBC's " Hardball . "
In addition , the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has pledged $ 1 million to help Tinklenberg .
The Bachmann campaign held a $ 1 million advantage in cash over Tinklenberg at the end of September , and she moved quickly this week to use her " Hardball " appearance and its aftermath as a fundraising tool .
In a letter Wednesday to subscribers of a national conservative online newsletter , Bachmann wrote that her office has been deluged with calls " full of hate and anger " since her comments .
" Nazi . Psychopath .
Deranged .
Mentally ill .
Disgusting human being ... these are just a few of the names that my staff and volunteers have been called . ... "
" Chris Matthews did what Chris Matthews is paid big bucks to do :
Twist my words and set them up for full - fledged distortion when his next guest came on , " she wrote .
" And , when the liberal blogs got hold of little clips of my appearance , the spin machine really kicked into overdrive .
...
They 're motivated entirely by their hatred of me and my conservative beliefs . "
Writing that the " Far Left " has given large sums to Tinklenberg since her comments , Bachmann appealed to the online subscribers for contributions .
" Click here to let Chris know you play hardball , too ! "
Turn about
Bachmann 's spokeswoman , Michelle Marston , said the campaign had considered the NRCC ad buys to be " icing on the cake . "
Marston said the campaign already has scheduled ad buys of $ 700,000 and expects to buy more .
She said the new fundraising effort has brought money , but declined to be specific .
The impact of the NRCC cancellation was a matter of speculation Wednesday .
" The obvious theory to pull from this move is they think this race is a lost cause , " said David Wasserman , who analyzes House races for the non-partisan Cook Political Report in Washington .
" I do n't think that 's what Republicans believe at all , " he said .
Wasserman said Bachmann can raise enough money to " saturate Minneapolis television for the rest of the campaign . "
He said she has " one final path to victory : to portray her political opponents as East Coast elitists , including Chris Matthews , but also contributors to Tinklenberg 's campaign over the past 72 hours . "
Tinklenberg spokesman John Wodele said the campaign received about 20,000 donations from all 50 states , including 3,210 contributions from Minnesota , 2,405 from California , 1,150 from New York and 2,330 from Texas .
" This is not a response around the country from what the Bachmann campaign might call liberal elites , " Wodele said .

I just want to mention that I am TOTALLY digging David Morrissey 's costume , and even if he is n't the real next doctor ( and I realize he probably is n't ) , I hope they go for a similar look in the future .
Would that work on Paterson Joseph ?

I do n’t really go for anime / manga stuff typically .
However , when I came across these manga - style Peanuts characters , I simply had to post them .
The concept is that the Peanuts gang grew up to be teenagers in modern times .
For Snoopy , the artist was n’t sure which direction to go .
Here are his thoughts on the subject :
I still have n’t decided on a direction for arguably the most popular Peanuts character period .
So far it ’s an older Snoopy …. or Snoopy lives on through his off - spring .
I not certain the mother should be revealed and I do n’t want to have both Snoopy AND his kids around at the same time .
Snoopy ’s attitude would virtually remain unchanged .
Prince would represent Snoopy ’s pride , ego and his inherent ability to excel at most things he puts his effort into .
Penelope represents Snoopy ’s general good side .
The Snoopy that helps out Woodstock and participates in good causes .
Blockhead represents the side of Snoopy you do n’t mess with .
This is the Snoopy that dragged Linus around with his blanket , kicked the door of Charlie ’s house when he is hungry and fought when he had to .
New Study : Centauri B Planets Unlikely
Roughly twenty percent of all detected exoplanets are in binary systems , intensifying our interest in Alpha Centauri .
Recent work , however , has been less than encouraging to those hoping to find one or more terrestrial worlds around these stars .
Indeed , Philippen Thébault ( Stockholm Observatory ) , Francesco Marzari ( University of Padova ) and Hans Scholl ( Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur ) have shown that in the case of Centauri A , the zone beyond 0.5 AU is hostile to the accretion processes that allow planets to form .
Any terrestrial - class world that close to Centauri A would be excluded from the habitable zone , a region thought to extend from 1.0 to 1.3 AU around the star .
The same team now goes to work on Centauri B , having pointed out in the earlier paper that the mathematical modeling it used there was unique to Centauri A and could not be applied indiscriminately to other systems , not even to the second star of the Centauri binary .
The authors are targeting the phase of planetary formation when kilometer - sized planetesimals accrete , and examining the effect that perturbations and gas drag have on impact velocities within a test population of such planetesimals .
As with Centauri A , the results show that this early formation stage can take place only in a region within 0.5 AU .
That just might allow the needed accretion and hence planet formation to occur within the innermost part of Centauri B ’s habitable zone , which is estimated to extend from 0.5 to 0.9 AU .
But even here the limits are tight , and the authors believe that because planetesimals in this region would have such high relative velocities ( as opposed to a system unperturbed by the close binary Centauri A ) , planet growth would tend to occur much more slowly .
But let me quote the paper directly on this crucial matter :
Planetesimal accretion is marginally possible in the innermost parts , ∼ 0.5 AU , of the estimated habitable zone .
Beyond this point , high collision velocities , induced by the coupling between gas friction and secular perturbations , lead to destructive impacts .
Moreover , even in the ∼ 0.5 AU region , ∆v are increased compared to an unperturbed case .
Thus , ” classical ” , single - star like runaway accretion seems to be ruled out .
The case is strong — in order to arrive at the subsequent planet , you first have to let accretion go to work to build it , whether in or out of the habitable zone .
This work does not , then , contradict other findings that planets are feasible within the habitable zones of the Centauri stars , but does insist that they are highly unlikely to form there .
So are there other ways we could wind up with planets in the habitable zone ?
Two possibilities remain : Changes in planetesimal orbits as gas within the early system is dispersed , and greater separation between the two stars early in their history , which would make perturbations less pronounced .
Can either leave us hope for such worlds ?
The first seems dubious :
… we ﬁnd that later progressive gas dispersal reduces all ∆v to values that might allow accreting impacts .
However , we ﬁnd that the system has ﬁrst to undergo a long accretion - hostile transition period during which most of the smaller planetesimals are removed by inward drift and most bigger objects are probably fragmented into small debris .
Thus , the positive effect on planetesimal accretion is probably limited .
As to a wider initial separation of the Centauri stars reducing the perturbation effects , much work remains to be done .
The minimum separation for accretion processes to prove favorable to the formation of a planet in the habitable zone seems to be 37 AU .
Could the Centauri stars have once been separated by this amount or greater ?
Finding the answer to that question depends upon working out the likelihood of orbital changes in early open clusters .
In short , we do n’t know .
Thébault , Marzari and Scholl are doing significant work , examining as they do the crucial early stages of planet formation , and the authors point out that the even earlier phases , when the kilometer - sized planetesimals are themselves forming , have not yet been modeled .
Right now we can hold out hope for the region 0.5 AU or so around Centauri B , but it is chastening to reflect that this narrow region may offer the only realistic prospect for a habitable world in this nearby system .
The paper is Thébault et al. , “ Planet formation in the habitable zone of alpha Centauri B , ” accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and available online .
Thanks to andy for the pointer .

Findings reignite debate over genetically modified crops .
Mexico's ban on genetically modified maize has not stopped transgenes getting into traditional crops .
E. Ã *LVAREZ - BUYLLA
Transgenes from genetically modified ( GM ) maize ( corn ) crops have been found in traditional ' landrace ' maize in the Mexican heartland , a study says .
The work largely confirms a similar , controversial result published in Nature in 20011 and may reignite the debate in Mexico over GM crops .
The paper reports finding transgenes in three of the 23 locations that were sampled in 2001 , and again in two of those locations using samples taken in 2004 .
Written by a team led by Elena Álvarez - Buylla of the National Autonomous University of Mexico ( UNAM ) in Mexico City , the study will be published in the journal Molecular Ecology .
In 1998 , the Mexican government outlawed the planting of GM maize to protect its approximately 60 domesticated landraces and their wild relatives .
But newspaper reports suggest that farmers have planted at least 70 hectares of GM maize crops in the northern state of Chihuahua , and it is unclear what repercussions this may have .
Only about 25 % of the maize planted in Mexico comes from commercially sold seed ; the majority is saved from harvest to harvest .
That 's why , says Álvarez - Buylla , researchers need to pin down whether transgenes really have made it into local crops .
" It is urgent to establish rigorous molecular and sampling criteria for biomonitoring at centres of crop origination and diversification , " the team writes .
“ The importance of the study is not the impact of the transgenes themselves , but the fact that their spread has occurred so easily . ”
Allison Snow , a plant ecologist from Ohio State University in Columbus , led a team that reported2 in 2005 it could not detect transgenes in maize from regions sampled by the original Nature paper .
She calls the new work " a very good study , with positive signs of transgenes " .
" It is good to see this , " adds Ignacio Chapela , the ecologist from the University of California , Berkeley , who was senior author on the Nature publication .
" But it took seven years . "
Testing times
The original paper caused a storm of controversy3 , 4 , 5 .
Critics pointed out some technical errors , including problems with the type of PCR used to amplify the genetic sequences , although Chapela and his co-author David Quist stood by their conclusions6 .
Others questioned whether the critics were influenced by their association with the biotechnology industry , which they denied .
In the end , Nature published an editor 's note saying there was insufficient evidence to justify the original publication .
Advocates of GM crops widely , and erroneously , called this a retraction .
A second round of criticism was sparked in 2005 , after the Snow paper reported no evidence for transgenes in Mexican maize .
Some criticized this article as being statistically inconclusive and lacking representative samples7 , which the authors disputed8 .
Álvarez - Buylla 's team set out to resolve the issue by conducting genetic tests on thousands of maize seed and leaf samples for evidence of two transgenes : a gene promoter from the 35S cauliflower mosaic virus , and the nopaline synthase terminator , NOSt .
The team found transgenes in about 1 % of more than 100 fields it sampled , including some sampled by Quist and Chapela in 2001 .
Jose Sarukhán , a biologist at the UNAM and a member of the US National Academy of Sciences , recommended the Álvarez - Buylla article for publication in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
It was rejected ; in a letter to the authors on 14 March this year , the journal 's editor - in - chief Randy Schekman , a professor at the University of California , Berkeley , wrote that the biology and genetics did n't warrant publication , and that a reviewer had pointed out the report could " gain undue exposure in the press due to a political or other environmental agenda " .
Sarukhán responds : " I saw no reason why it should not be published . "
ADVERTISEMENT
Norman Ellstrand , a plant geneticist at the University of California at Riverside , called the study intriguing .
" The importance of the study is not in the impact of the transgenes themselves , " he says , " but in the fact that their spread has occurred so easily in a country where the planting of transgenic maize has not occurred for several years . "
However , the new paper does n't confirm an important conclusion from the original Nature paper — whether the transgenes had been integrated into landrace genomes and passed along to progeny plants .
Álvarez - Buylla suspects this may be the case , but she 's not interested in pursuing another round of politically charged battles — and will leave that work to others .
Yeah , I ’m kind of ashamed of this headline , but I swear this is what I thought right after watching the ad for Zyliss ’s new electric multipeeler .
Anyways , check out the commercial , I ’m sure you ’ll be running to your nearest convenience store right after to get one .

New research by Open Europe , a think - tank that supports EU reform , has found that so - called European “ information ” campaigns are one - sided and boast a budget that is bigger than Coca - Cola ’s total worldwide advertising account .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
One publication , entitled How the European Union works , described the EU as “ a remarkable success story ” .
Another English - language “ information ” pamphlet claimed the EU “ is delivering a better life for everyone ” and described the single market as “ a winning formula . ”
The researchers also found a European Commission document that admitted : “ Neutral factual information is needed of course , but it is not enough on its own .
Genuine communication by the EU cannot be reduced to the mere provision of information . ”
Lorraine Mullally , director of Open Europe , said : “ Taxpayers should not be footing the bill for vain PR exercises to make us love the EU .
The EU needs urgent and radical reform , not expensive campaigns to improve its image . ”
The research also found that projects , such as the EU ’s School Milk Scheme , come with propaganda strings attached .

Federal housing assistance budget authority has declined nearly 50 % since its peak in 1978 .
Public housing , Section 8 project - based rental assistance , and programs for the elderly and disabled , all of which tend to serve very low income households with incomes of 50 % or less of [ the area median income ] have all faced budget cuts and uncertainty in recent years .
Since the 1980s , funding for these programs has for the most part maintained existing buildings and contracts .
At the same time , the very low income renter population has grown from 10.7 million households in 1978 to 16.3 million in 2005 , due in part to the growth of the U.S. population in general but also as a result of stagnating or declining wages and benefits over this period .
As a result , the number of “ worst case needs ” households , very low income unassisted renters paying half or more their income for housing or living in severely substandard housing , has persisted and grown throughout the subsequent decades , rising from 4 million households in 1978 to 6 million households in 2005 .
Increasingly , the focus at the federal level has been on moving people into homeownership and on shifting resources to programs that serve households at higher rungs on the income ladder .
For example , the Low Income Housing Tax Credit has emerged as the most significant federal program producing affordable housing for low income Americans .
Yet more than 60 % of the units funded in 2005 were targeted at households with 50 % [ area median income ] or above .
Whether it was the desired or unintended result of policy , one de facto result of this declining federal commitment to housing the lowest income households has been the steady devolution of the responsibility for rental housing assistance to lower levels of government .
Unfortunately , states have not been able to close the gap left by the federal government .
In 2005 , the federal government spent just over $ 39 billion on housing assistance for low income Americans .
This figure is expected to be 19 % lower in 2011 , if plans to trim housing assistance are fully implemented .
Yet , the federal government also paid $ 121 billion in tax expenditures in 2005 - more than three times the amount spent on housing assistance - to subsidize homeownership through mortgage interest , capital gains , and property tax deductions .
These deductions disproportionately serve the homeowners with the highest incomes .
When both housing assistance and tax benefits are taken into account , the poorest one - fifth of American households - those earning less than $ 19,000 per year - will receive approximately $ 34 billion in housing subsidies in 2006 .
By way of contrast , the richest fifth of American households ( those earning over $ 92,000 ) will receive approximately $ 94 billion in subsidies , nearly three times more than the poorest fifth and accounting for roughly half of all housing subsidies distributed in 2006 .
In 2003 , there were nearly two million fewer rental units affordable at 30 % of the area median income , the top threshold for what HUD defines as extremely low income , than there were renter households in this income category .
This absolute shortage of apartments affordable to the lowest income Americans increased by more than 200,000 between 2001 and 2003 .
Because many units affordable to these households were occupied by households with higher incomes and therefore were not available to meet the housing needs of [ extremely low income ] households , the effective shortfall is actually closer to five million units nationwide .
In 2003 there were just 42 units of housing that are were both available for and affordable for to every 100 ELI renter households in .
When the demand for affordable housing exceeds the supply , low income households have no choice but to live in unaffordable units .
In 2003 , 5.18 million households - nearly 5 % of allhouseholds - with incomes below 50 % of their area 's median were unassisted renters living in severely unaffordable and / or inadequate housing .
The average ELI household spent 79 % of its income on housing costs in 2005 .
In the same year , roughly three - quarters of the 6.3 million ELI renter households spent more than half of their monthly income on housing costs .
Today , an individual working full - time , 40 hours a week 52 weeks a year , at the locally prevailing minimum wage cannot earn enough to afford the fair market rent of a one - bedroom apartment in any county in the U.S .
On a national basis , a person needs to earn a housing wage of $ 16.31 an hour , working 40 hours per week , 52 weeks per year , to afford a two - bedroom apartment at the fair market rent .
The estimated average wage of American renters was $ 12.64 in 2005 .
Roughly 86 % of metropolitan renters today live in areas where working 40 hours per week , 52 weeks per year at the mean renter wage is insufficient to cover the cost of a two - bedroom apartment at the fair market rent .
I have done a series of posts on Miranda Kerr ’s tactics to land a billionaire – I called it the Miranda Kerr schoole in landing a billion guess it works – because she just announced her engagement to the Snapchat nerd billionaire put at ring on the hooker – and they announced it with a snapchat filter …. which I guess is how he asked her…or how they communicate .
because when you have a god complex from creating snapchat – and lots of money – where you bang models who double as sugar babies – you can impress them pretty fucking easily … just show them your bank statement … and a reminder of what you created – with a snapchat filter …
It does n’t make sense to me why he would marry some mom , washed out model – when he could have anyone
She ’s obviously got her sales tactics down , she knows how to land a billionaire – and it works … .
The lessons are :
1- get out of your relationship with some has been actor , and the best way to do that is by fucking Bieber … because actors are n’t billionaires
2- to get fired from your million dollar contract with a lingerie company , because the billionaires you are trying to bed wo n’t want to pay your rent when they know you have work … they just like that you had work and that you ’re in a place of desperation that requires their help …
3- pull in some sporadic campaigns , so that she does n’t seen like a full mooch …. and the last thing is to do some media , get some red carpet pics , you know seem like an active member int he model world … because these billionaires want models , they do n’t want girls who once modeled …

Archaeologists discover 12,000 year - old grave of witch doctor
Archaeologists in Israel have unearthed an ancient grave of an elderly woman believed to have been a magical healer 12,000 years ago .
The grave was found in a burial ground for at least 28 people in a small cave in the lower Galilee region of present - day Israel .
The excavation is at the mouth of a cave in the Galilee region of northern Israel
It dates back to the Natufian people who were the first society to adopt a sedentary lifestyle .
At the time of burial , more than 10 large stones were placed directly on the head , pelvis , and arms of the woman whose body was laid on its side .
The legs were spread apart and folded inward at the knee .
The special treatment of the body and use of stones to keep it in a certain position suggests the woman held a unique position in the community .
50 tortoise shells were found at the site along with the pelvis of a leopard and a human foot
It is likely she was viewed as a magical healer or witch doctor , archaeologists from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said .
The grave of a 12,000 - year - old prehistoric shaman , or witch doctor , was found by a team from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
' It seems that the woman in the Natufian burial was perceived as being in a close relationship with these animal spirits , ' the team wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The Israeli team led by Leore Grosman found the human bones in a small cave in the lower Galilee region of present - day Israel .
The grave also contained 50 tortoise shells , and body parts from animals including a wild boar , eagle , cow , leopard and marten .
' The burial of the woman ... is unlike any burial found in the Natufian or the preceding Palaeolithic periods , ' Grosman 's team wrote .
' We argue that this burial is consistent with expectations for a shaman 's grave .
' Tortoises , cow tails , eagle wings , and fur - bearing animals continue to play important symbolic and shamanistic roles in the spiritual arena of human cultures worldwide today . '
Summit County residents show up to cast their early votes to find that they ’d already voted , when they actually had n’t .
Not a good surprise .
Salt Lake Tribune has the latest on this .
An apparent computer glitch informed poll workers that ballots could n’t be provided to several would - be voters at the Park City Library .
The problem has been corrected , said Summit County Chief Deputy Clerk Ryan Cowley .
Nobody was turned away without voting , he said .
And each vote will be counted .
But Park City resident Mary Cook said she became concerned when poll workers told her she could n’t vote again .
When she insisted the computer was in error , poll workers advised her to cast a paper provisional ballot .
Such ballots are not counted election night but later when they are determined to be legitimate .
Provisional ballots also must include name , address and identification information .
Cook , however , said poll workers apparently did n’t know that when telling the frustrated voters how to cast provisional ballots .
Without the identification information , ballots would not be valid .
“ I would n’t want people to think it ’s voter fraud , ” she said .
“ It suggests to me a training gap .
It ’s a systemic issue with equipment and training . ”
In the end , Cook said she filled out a provisional ballot .
Other voters , she noted , insisted on casting computer ballots .
It makes you wonder if they cancelled the first vote that these residents had n’t made …
Philanthropists for years have used the " prize model " to spark societal innovations -- from space ( the X Prize ) to the environment ( Goldman Prize ) .
The idea is to create a mercenary incentive to create broader social good .

Now a billionaire doctor has come up with what could arguably be the most unusual philanthropic prize of all .
It is called the Michelson Prize , named after billionaire inventor Gary Michelson .
The cause : pet contraception .
Specifically , he is offering $ 25 million to anyone who can come up with a feasible dog and cat contraceptive .
According to a post by Deb Wood on OregonLive.com , billionaire Gary Michelson -- who earned his fortune from orthopedic devices -- also is offering grants totaling $ 50 million for research in the area .
Before you start in with the doggie jokes , it should be noted that Michelson is serious about the issue , which goes by the name of " non-surgical sterilization " research .
He formed the nonprofit Found Animals Foundation in 2005 to use scientific and innovative thinking as part of the solution to pet overpopulation problems .

An Oregon couple recently let their kid die , and are now asking for the charges to be dropped , saying it was their religious right to do so .
My first question is :
Why does this church of theirs , which believes in faith - based healing , still have followers after something like this happens ?
Second :
What are religious rights , again ?
There seems to be an idea , or maybe a vague notion , floating around that religion supersedes law .
In twisted religious logic , this makes sense :
The law of god takes precedence over the law of man .
Of course , normally it ’s not a problem .
Religions usually have rules that are beneficial to both the individuals and the society , which is one of the reasons people follow religions , and also one of the reasons everyone else looks at them and says , “ Okay , believe what you want .
You ’re not hurting anyone . ”
Religious rights , as these negligent parents ask for them , do not exist in the United States of America .
Americans have the right to religion , which covers a whole lot of things , but not the right to pick and choose which laws to break .
Carl and Raylene Worthington , here ’s my advice :
Do what all the other nuts do , and plead insanity .
While you ’re at it , renounce the beliefs that got your daughter killed .

TASTELESS , colourless , odourless and painful , pure capsaicin is a curious substance .
It does no lasting damage , but the body 's natural response to even a modest dose ( such as that found in a chili pepper ) is self - defence : sweat pours , the pulse quickens , the tongue flinches , tears may roll .
But then something else kicks in : pain relief .
The bloodstream floods with endorphins — the closest thing to morphine that the body produces .
The result is a high .
And the more capsaicin you ingest , the bigger and better it gets .
Which is why the diet in the rich world is heating up .
Hot chilies , once the preserve of aficionados with exotic tastes for cuisine from places such as India , Thailand or Mexico , are now a staple ingredient in everything from ready meals to cocktails .
One reason is that globalisation has raised the rich world 's tolerance to capsaicin .
What may seem unbearably hot to those reared on the bland diets of Europe or the Anglosphere half a century ago is just a pleasantly spicy dish to their children and grandchildren , whose student years were spent scoffing cheap curries or nacho chips with salsa .
Recipes in the past used to call for a cautious pinch of cayenne pepper .
For today 's guzzlers , even standard - strength Tabasco sauce , the world 's best - selling chili - based condiment , may be too mild .
The Louisiana - based firm now produces an extra - hot version , based on habanero peppers , the fieriest of the commonly - consumed chilies .
But for the real “ heat geeks ” , even that is too tame .
Tesco , Britain 's biggest supermarket chain , recently added a new pepper to its vegetable shelves : the Dorset naga .
Inhaling its vapour makes your nose tingle .
Touching it is painful ; cooks are advised to wear gloves .
It is the only food product that Tesco will not sell to children .
By the standards of other chilies , it is astronomically hot .
On the commonly used Scoville scale ( based on dilution in sugar syrup to the point that the capsaicin becomes no longer noticeable to the taster ) it rates 1.6 m units , close to the 2 m score of pepper spray used in riot control .
The pepper that previously counted as the world 's hottest , the Bhut Jolokia grown by the Chile Pepper Institute at the New Mexico State University , scored just over 1 m .
That in turn displaced a chili grown by the Indian Defence Research Laboratory in Tezpur , which scored a mere 855,000 .
The hottest habanero chilies score a wimpy 577,000 .
The naga , originally from Bangladesh , was developed commercially by Michael Michaud , who runs a specialist online chili supply firm in south - western Britain .
Having spotted it in an ethnic - food shop in the coastal town of Bournemouth , he bred a dependable and much hotter strain and had it tested .
“ I sent the powder to a couple of labs .
They did n't believe the reading .
They thought they had made a mistake , ” he recalls .
Jonathan Corbett , the buyer who handles ( cautiously ) specialist chilies for Tesco says that the naga makes a standard hot curry “ taste like a bowl of breakfast cereal ” .
The naga has been a runaway success .
In 2007 , a Tesco outlet in Newcastle in northern England was supplied with 400 packs for a pilot period that was intended to last a month .
The entire stock sold out on the first morning .
According to AC Nielsen , a market - research firm , demand for hot chilies across all British retailers rose by 18 % in the last year .
At Tesco , the growth has been 29 % .
Demand for the naga has been so high that it has been forced to sell unripe green ones , intended for sale early next year .
Tesco 's supplier is Britain 's biggest chili farmer , Filippo Salvatore .
Based near Biggleswade , he is also a leading light in the Bedford Sicilian Association .
He is hurrying to grow more .
Tesco is one of the world 's largest retailers , with outlets in both continental Europe and North America .
But Mr Corbett says that his colleagues have no plans to stock the naga elsewhere , for example in the firm 's Fresh & Easy chain in America .
“ Tastes in the UK are hotter , ” he says .
That may be true , though the chili- eating milieu is certainly bigger in America , where the calendar is dotted with events such as the rumbustious Fiery Foods and Barbeque Show ( in Albuquerque ) and the more academic 19th International Pepper Conference ( which took place in September in Atlantic City , concluding with a barbecue ) .

From pain comes pleasure
For connoisseurs though , the macho hullabaloo about ever - hotter chilies is distasteful , even vulgar : rather like rating wine only according to its alcohol content .
Steve Waters , who runs the South Devon Chili Farm , says even the idea that the spectrum runs on a simple one - dimensional axis between “ hot ” and “ mild ” is misleading .
He prefers the more complex Mexican matrix , which categorises chilies both by heat , and whether they are fresh , dried , pickled , or smoked .
Any of these can produce big changes in flavour : he highlights the Aji ( pronounced ah - hee ) , a Peruvian chili , which “ ripens to bright yellow , with a strong lemony taste when fresh , very zesty .
When dried it picks up a banana flavour . ”
From this point of view , the most interesting trend is not in ever - higher doses of capsaicin for the maniac market , but in the presence of chili in a range of foodstuffs that previous generations would have regarded as preposterous candidates for hotting up .
Chili - flavoured chocolate , for example , has gone from being a novelty item to a popular mainstream product .
Mr Waters sells “ hot apple chili jelly ” as a condiment for meat , and chili - infused olive oil .
Adrenalin plus natural opiates form an unbeatable combination
The reason may be that capsaicin excites the trigeminal nerve , increasing the body 's receptiveness to the flavour of other foods .
That is not just good news for gourmets .
It is a useful feature in poor countries where the diet might otherwise be unbearably bland and stodgy .
In a study in 1992 by the CSIRO 's Sensory Research Centre , scientists looked at the effect of capsaicin on the response to solutions containing either sugar or salt .
The sample was 35 people who all ate spicy food regularly but not exclusively .
Even a small quantity of capsaicin increased the perceived intensity of the solutions ingested .
Among other things , that may give a scientific explanation for the habit , not formally researched , of snorting the “ pink fix ” ( a mixture of cocaine and chili powder ) .
A chili-eating habit may develop to a startling degree ( your author guzzled a packet of nagas while writing this article , and puts Tabasco in his coffee ) .
But indulging in capsaicin does not quite meet the formal medical definitions of addiction .
It is at most a craving , not a physical necessity .
It does not cause loss of control when taken to excess , or illness in those deprived of it : heavy users may develop remarkable degrees of tolerance , but they do not require regular doses simply in order to feel normal .
The preference does not wear off : ex-smokers , by contrast , may gag at the taste of a cigarette .
And the effect on the brain is different : with nicotine , the more you smoke , the more you want .
Indeed , capsaicin has useful medical effects .
By disabling a part of the nervous system called “ transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 ” it can stop the body registering the pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis , for example .
It can also be used to help patients with multiple sclerosis , amputees , and people undergoing chemotherapy .
With rather less scientific evidence , a capsaicin product is marketed as an alternative to Botox , a wrinkle - smoothing cosmetic treatment .
But does it do any harm ?
The use of pepper spray as a weapon , and chili powder as a means of torture , suggests that it must .
Certainly capsaicin can be painful , causing stress : in itself a potential health risk .
A big dose incapacitates .
But as far as permanent physical damage is concerned , the evidence is negligible to non-existent .
That seems to contradict common sense , which suggests that hot food causes an upset stomach — or what medical specialists call “ gastric mucosal injury ” .
A study in 1987 on the effects of ordinary pepper produced some signs of gastric exfoliation ( stripping away the stomach lining ) and some bleeding — though the effects were less than those produced by aspirin .
An alarming - sounding experiment a year later involved volunteers being fed minced jalapeño peppers through a tube , directly into the stomach .
The results , observed by an endoscope ( a camera on a tube ) revealed no damage to the mucous membrane .
Against that is a study of heavy chili-eaters in Mexico City , who appeared to have higher stomach cancer rates than a control group .
But the rate of illness had no correlation with the frequency of chilies eaten , leading to speculation that other factors may be at work .
Humans are the only mammals to eat chilies .
Other species apparently reckon that nasty tastes are a powerful evolutionary signal that something may be poisonous .
Paul Rosin , a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania , who is one of the world 's best - known authorities on the effects of capsaicin , has had no success in persuading rats to eat chilies , and very limited success with dogs and chimpanzees : the handful of cases where these animals did eat chilies seemed to be because of their strong relationships with human handlers .
That offers a clue to the way in which mankind comes to develop a chili habit .
In the same way as young people may come to like alcohol , tobacco and coffee ( all of which initially taste nasty , but deliver a pleasurable chemical kick ) , chili-eating normally starts off as a social habit , bolstered by what Mr Rozin calls “ benign masochism ” : doing something painful and seemingly dangerous , in the knowledge that it wo n't do any permanent harm .
The adrenalin kick plus the natural opiates form an unbeatable combination for thrill - seekers .
Just do n't get it in your eyes .

Police dash cam( Video released October 14/08 ) : A video of the April shooting of Roland Carnaby was released today to the Houston Chronicle by the lawyer for Carnaby 's widow .
Susan Carnaby has sued the city seeking damages and a change in police customs and practices in high speed chases such as the one that preceded her husband 's shooting .
Roland Carnaby , 52 , was fatally wounded after fleeing from a traffic stop and leading police on a chase .
He was killed after stepping out of his vehicle on a Loop 610 feeder road , turning around and reaching under the seat for a shiny object that turned out to be a cell phone .
Carnaby told the police who stopped him that he was a CIA agent .
He made several cell phone calls before and during the chase to people he knew in law enforcement .
The City of Houston asked that the homicide report and other materials , including this video recorded with an on - board camera in a patrol car , be kept secret , but U.S. District Judge Keith Ellison late Friday ruled that the report and other materials could be released , with some personal information redacted .
Susan Carnaby sued the city and Houston Police Department Sgt. Andrew Washington and officer Cecil Foster , who each fired at her husband .
A Harris County grand jury declined to indict Washington and Foster in late July .
An out - of - work banker who became a symbol of the looming financial crisis by trudging Manhattan streets wearing a sign advertising “ MIT grad for hire ” has landed on his feet – scoring a well - paying job at an accounting firm .

“ I liked his resume .
He had great business sense , great experience and great references , ” Elliot Ogulnick , his new boss at the Manhattan firm Weiser LLP , said yesterday .
As for his unique brand of self - promotion , Ogulnick said , “ I must admit , it was very innovative . ”
Persky was hired as a senior manager for Weiser as of last week , just about a year after he was laid off by the investment bank Houlihan Lokey and some six months after he started handing out his résumé to passers - by on Park Avenue .
The road from the streets to his new office on West 50th Street was longer and more winding than he expected – but he never gave up hope .
“ It just took more time than I expected , ” he said yesterday .
In his weeks as a walking classified ad , he got several job interviews .
“ The problem was , it was the time when Bear Stearns collapsed , ” he said .
“ I had a lot of interest , but then everybody stopped hiring . ”
So he tried a different tack .
“ The publicity I got from the sandwich board encouraged me to set up a blog to document my experience , ” said Persky , 49 .
A headhunter spotted the blog and brought it to Weiser ’s attention .
“ Obviously , I had vigorous interviews , but I think it was [ the blog ] which sealed the deal , ” Persky said .
“ It feels so great to be back at work .
I went through some frustrating times , but every day I tried to be optimistic . ”
He posted the happy news on his blog and got cheers from around the world .
Now the father of five – who declined to discuss his new salary – is looking forward to being reunited with his family .
His wife and youngest kids , 4 and 5 , had moved to her parents ’ home in Nebraska to save cash .
But they ’ll be returning to New York after the end of the school year .
“ We ’re looking forward to being back together , ” he said .
“ It ’s hard being a telephone dad .
“ There is all this holiday spirit around me , all these holiday parties , and I ’ve got such a lot to be grateful for myself .
It ’s like I ’m celebrating twice this year . ”

Gov. Rod Blagjevich ( D - IL ) Arrested for on Corruption Charges Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich was arrested by the FBI this morning on charges of trying to barter his appointment of Barack Obama 's replacement in the Senate for personal gain .
According to federal prosecutors , this is only the tip of the iceberg , as Blagojevich has been trying to shake down organizations receiving state contracts for years .
What with the conviction of Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) on corruption charges in October , it appears that criminal behavior of top elected officials is definitely a bipartisan affair .
The only problem here is that until Blagojevich resigns -- which is unlikely until he is actually convicted -- he has the sole power to name Obama 's replacement .
No matter who he chooses , that person will be tainted .
Probably the only thing he could do now to make sure the new senator gets a clean start is to ask Obama himself to make a suggestion and then follow it , but that is unlikely , especially since Blagojevich has not admitted to any wrongdoing .
Chris Cillizza suggests that Blagojevich 's best choice now is to appoint a placeholder who wo n't run in 2010 , but it remains to be seen if Blagojevich does this .
Ted Kennedy Lobbying for his Niece , Caroline Kennedy The NY Times reports that Sen . Ted Kennedy ( D - MA ) is lobbying Gov. David Paterson ( D - NY ) to appoint his niece , Caroline Kennedy , to Hillary Clinton 's soon - to - be- vacated Senate seat .
However , the late President 's daughter has always avoided the limelight and it is far from clear that she would do well in the rough - and - tumble world of national politics .
Women 's groups are supporting Rep. Carolyn Maloney ( D - NY ) for the job .
Furthermore , Paterson is no doubt aware that state attorney general Andrew Cuomo wants his job and appointing Cuomo to the Senate would not be controversial and would get Cuomo out of the way .
Furthermore , Cuomo has already been elected to statewide office and could probably hold the seat in 2010 .
Whether Kennedy could actually win a statewide election is far less certain .
The third open senate seat is Joe Biden 's seat in Delaware .
Gov. Ruth Minner ( D - DE ) has already appointed Biden 's long - time aide , Ted Kaufman , to the seat .
It is widely expected that Kaufman will not run in 2010 , allowing Biden 's son , Beau Biden , to compete for the open seat , Minnesota Gives Up on the 133 Lost Ballots
The fourth Senate seat in play is the close race in Minnesota .
In one Minneapolis precinct , 133 votes have vanished , that is , the total number of votes in the recount is 133 less than in the original count .
The precinct went heavily for Democrat Al Franken and he is complaining loudly about the missing votes .
The state has looked high and low for the missing envelope and can't find it anywhere .
It will be up to the canvassing board to determine what to do .
One option is to forget the recount for this precinct and use the original count .
Franken would like that but his opponent , Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - MN ) , will surely complain .
The Minneapolis Star Tribune currently puts Coleman's ' lead at 192 votes , but there are thousands of challenged ballots and absentee ballots yet to be dealt with .
Craig 's Appeal Is Rejected by the Court of Appeals Sen. Larry Craig , who was arrested in a Minneapolis mens room in a sex sting , has lost his appeal that playing footsie in a public mens room is constitutionally protected speech .
The court did n't buy this , so Craig 's guilty plea cannot be withdrawn .
However , Craig is retiring so his loss in court is not directly significant for the new Senate .
However , the Republicans are planning to attack Democrats as corrupt on the basis of Blagojevich 's arrest , so putting Craig back in the news will tend to neutralize their case .
People will think : " Both parties are immoral " even though the two cases are not comparable .

What we need is a Day Full of Atheists where more people come out .

She also adds that making fun of atheists — “ mocking ” them — is “ probably the second best solution ” ( not giving us attention is the first ) .

Marine ' jelly balls ' found off Australian coast could combat global warming
Large numbers of ' marine ' jelly balls ' that have appeared off the east coast of Australia could be part of the planet 's mechanism for combating global warming , scientists have said .
The jellyfish - like animals are known as salps , and feed on small plants in the water called phytoplankton ( marine algae ) .
The plants absorb the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the top level of the ocean .
A diver is pictured surrounding by large numbers of salps
Dr Mark Baird of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) said salps were notoriously difficult for scientists to study in the laboratory and little attention has been paid to their ecological role until recently .
Baird was part of a CSIRO and University of New South Wales marine survey carried out last month that found an abundance of salps in the waters around Sydney .
Scientists said their numbers were up to 10 times greater than when first surveyed 70 years ago .
Salps , which are transparent , barrel - shaped animals that can range from one to 10 cm in length , are usually found near the ocean 's surface and , as a result , can be washed up onto dry land .
A close up of salps , which are transparent , barrel - shaped animals that can range from one to 10cm in length
Their appearance in Australian waters is seasonal but scientists believe the increased numbers are a result of a strong East Australian current , which brings more nutrients to the surface waters for the algae that the salps prefer to eat .
Different species of salp have been found in waters around the world and attention is now being paid to what effect they may have on global warming .
Salps are also of interest because in the Southern Ocean near Antarctica they are thought to be displacing krill , an important food source for many marine animals .
By eating the algae , the salps turn the algae and their carbon dioxide into faeces which drops to the ocean floor .
They also take carbon to the floor with them when they die after a short two - week life cycle .
This is thought to be a natural form of carbon sequestration similar to what scientists are trying to do with carbon capture from emission sources such as power stations .
Dr Baird said Australian salps are biologically closer to vertebrates such as humans than to jellyfish because they have the rudiments of a primitive nervous system .
' They are interesting because they are the fastest reproducing multi-celled animal on the planet and can double their numbers several times a day . '
Salps had in the past been considered of little interest because they had fairly low nutrient value and were insignificant as a food source .
He said this was a concern because as the Antarctic ice melted , they were replacing krill , which is a high - nutrient food .
If failed green technologies are entertaining ( at least scientists are trying to improve the environment ) , greenwashed eco gadgets are at once baffling and bizarre .
With the rise of eco-friendly living and green awareness you can be sure companies are trying to cash in .
There are plenty of smart green gadgets that will help you hack your way to a lower energy bill and lighter carbon footprint .
These are not them .
Read on for some of the dumbest green gadgets in existence .
One of the biggest problems with “ green ” gadgets is that they are rarely fully green .
While they can ease consumer guilt , they may never actually help the planet .
Often the help is so trivial the benefit is of no consequence .
The best choice is counter - intuitive : buy high - end products that are n’t necessarily marketed as “ green ” , and buy them once .
One product that lasts a lifetime is far superior to the purchase of numerous marginally “ green ” products that may need to be replaced soon .
Green Means Green , Right ?

For example , this Samsung phone is encased in “ biodegradable ” plastic .
But that does n’t really help the planet – unless when you ’re done with the phone you take the time to safely bury the plastic rather than throwing the whole thing away .
Great .
So part of it can be thrown away in a * slightly * less wasteful manner than normal .
You ’re still going to buy another phone .
It sounds nice to say it ’s an eco-friendly phone , but it still used virgin resources to produce and it ’s also not fully recyclable .
While the green color is sort of cool , this is greenwash .

Mow the lawn with a manual push - mower and you ’ll not only be green , you ’ll be lean .
Besides , if your lawn is so big you ca n’t mow it yourself , a green mower is n’t going to “ cut it ” – you need to downsize the McMansion your megayard likely comes with .
Or consider goats .
They ’re fun , cheap , and pheening for your lawn .

TV maker Vizio made a big green deal about their supposedly amazing 50 % power saving flat panels .
Too bad Vizio uses toxic chemicals and materials in its manufacturing process .
Which takes place in China and Tawain – so claims about being an American company are a little misleading .
Vizio ’s products are also among the worst - ranked in consumer electronics , so even if you do save a little energy , it ’s not likely to be for very long since your Vizio TV will probably fall apart .
It ca n’t even be recycled , as its e-waste policy is years behind others in the industry .

… from all the toxic chemicals .
In a truly dazzling sweep of greenwash , the maker of the Swiffer claims that a nonbiodegradable plastic gadget that requires the use of chemical - soaked single - use cleaning cloths that cannot be reused or recycled is greener than …water and a regular old mop .
Why ?
Because mopping uses hot water , and all those gallons of hot water are surely far , far more harmful for the planet than the manufacture and use of nonrecyclable plastic mops and straight - to - the - landfill chemical drenched cleaning pads .

The Internet played an unprecedented role in rallying voters during this year ’s election .
In the aftermath of the election , Web 2.0 tools are continuing to play a role in other causes , astonishing long - time advocates with the power and speed with which it gets their message out .
The latest example is a series of international protests scheduled for Saturday in opposition to California ’s Proposition 8 , the gay marriage ban that passed on Nov. 4 .
Join the Impact , a Web site built the morning of Friday , Nov. 7 , has rallied hundreds of thousands of people who are gathering this weekend in eight countries , 50 states and 300 cities .
“ This is the potential of the Web , ” said Ben Elowitz , chief executive of Wetpaint , a company that builds Web sites for individuals and companies and built one for Join the Impact .
“ When Web 2.0 started , people started talking about giving ordinary people a voice online .
This is the pinnacle of giving people a voice online .
And people are taking that voice and making it meaningful with a megaphone . ”
Amy Balliett , one of the two original organizers of the movement , has organized local demonstrations and fund - raisers in the past the old - fashioned way , with fliers around town and word of mouth .
She said she was astonished at the momentum and speed that Join the Impact has picked up from the Web .
She contrasted it with the Stonewall Riot of 1969 , which was a turning point in the campaign for gay rights .
“ Had they had social media , had they had the Internet , we would have been able to accomplish a lot more already , because they would have been able to keep the message alive and keep the community going , ” she said .
A week ago , Ms. Balliett , who lives in Seattle , received a call from a friend , Willow Witte , who was trying to organize a local protest against the passage of Prop 8 in Cleveland but was not getting much traction .
They decided to form Join the Impact to rally people around the country , and set up a Web site Friday morning .
By Sunday night , it was getting 50,000 hits an hour and the server crashed , “ which was a bittersweet problem to have , ” Ms. Balliett said .
She found a new Web host , Hostdango , which gave Join the Impact a bigger server for free .
It crashed the next day , so Hostdango gave them an even bigger one .
On Monday morning , Ms. Balliett got a call from Wetpaint , offering to build her a new site where supporters could add their own information about protest locations and times .
Wetpaint lets individuals build Web sites for free and companies build them for a fee .
HBO , Dell and T - Mobile have all built sites on the network .
In four days , Join the Impact has become Wetpaint ’s most - visited site , with over 1 million views .
“ When I started this company , this is what I wanted to see , ” said Mr. Elowitz of Wetpaint .
“ This generation of 20 - and 30 - somethings is so plugged in online that they ’re really learning to use online as a platform for organization and activism . ”
His work has touched on marriage in the past — he is a co-founder of Blue Nile , the online diamond retailer that specializes in engagement rings , which is now a publicly traded company .
Join the Impact is also on Twitter and Facebook , which are also helping to “ drive the masses , ” Ms. Balliett said .
After the Saturday protests , the week - old organization will keep harnessing the power of the Web to fight for equality , she said .
Next up : they are planning a “ day without gays , ” when they will encourage gay people to stay home and not contribute to the economy .

In case you live in Philly and slept right through it , there was a huge celebration on the streets of the city last night as thousands of repressed white , 20 - something college aged students let loose after finally feeling like a winner for the first time in their lives .
For the first time since 1993 Phillies fan has something substantial to cheer about .
Now they just have to win the Series so we can get some serious videos .
The early morning selection from YouTube has been extraordinarily weak .
There were no repeats of such destruction like earlier this year in Montreal where the fans set cop cars on fire .
So congrats to Philly for not making national headlines by destroying your city .
It does n’t need much help anyway .

UNITED NATIONS , Nov 14 : A high - level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly has rejected the use of religion to justify the killing of innocent people and terrorist acts and voiced concern that serious instances of intolerance , discrimination and harassment persist between people of different faiths and cultures .
In a consensus declaration read out by the UN Secretary General , Ban
Ki-moon , at the conclusion of the two - day “ Culture of Peace ” gathering here on Thursday , participants called for mutual understanding through dialogue , and respect for human rights among proponents of various faiths , cultures and civilisations .
The special session was convened at the initiative of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia .
“ Concerned about serious instances of intolerance , discrimination , hatred expressions , and harassment of minority religious communities of all faiths , participating states underlined the importance of promoting dialogue , understanding and tolerance among human beings , as well as respect for all their diverse religions , cultures and beliefs , ” the declaration said .
“ Participating states affirmed their rejection of the use of religion to justify the killing of innocent people and actions of terrorism , violence and coercion , which directly contradict the commitment of all religions to peace , justice and equality , ” it added .
Mr Ban said the challenge now was to move beyond “ powerful , positive words ” to “ dialogue that delivers ” .
Heads of state , ambassadors and senior officials from some 70 countries addressed the meeting , including Saudi King Abdullah , US President George Bush , Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , Israeli President Shimon Peres , Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Jordan ’s King Abdullah .
In the declaration , the General Assembly reiterated its call for “ promoting a culture of tolerance and mutual understanding through dialogue , and supporting the initiatives of religious leaders , civil society , and states seeking to entrench the culture of peace , understanding , tolerance , and respect for human rights among the proponents of various faiths , cultures , and civilisations ” .
The participating states expressed their commitment to strengthening existing mechanisms within the United Nations for “ promoting tolerance and human rights , preserving the institution of the family , protecting the environment , spreading education , eradicating poverty , and fighting drug abuse , crime and terrorism , noting the positive role of religions , beliefs and moral humanitarian principles in tackling these challenges ” .
Mr Ban voiced deep gratitude to the Saudi leader .
“ King Abdullah ’s initiative has come at a time when the need for dialogue among religions , cultures and civilisations has never been greater .
It has brought together people who might not otherwise have a chance to interact .
Along with other initiatives , it will contribute to building a more harmonious world .
“ The challenge now is to go beyond the powerful , positive words we have heard these past two days .
I pledge my full support to this effort .
It may take time to see results , but I am convinced that this meeting was an important step forward . ”
On Wednesday , at the opening session , General Assembly President Miguel D’Escoto told participants that the world was facing its most difficult period since the founding of the UN .
He urged global leaders to use their “ moral strength ” to find solutions to some of the greatest problems plaguing the planet , including poverty , hunger and climate change .
OSLO ( Reuters ) - A “ lost ” type of deer has been found on a remote mountainside in Indonesia ’s Sumatra island 80 years after the last confirmed sighting , experts said Friday .
The Sumatran muntjac , about the size of a large dog , was photographed and rescued from a hunter ’s snare 6,400 feet high in mountains of the Kerinci - Seblat National Park .
The species was originally discovered in 1914 but had not been seen since 1930 , Flora & Fauna International , whose experts found the deer along with park officials , said in a statement .
Two more of the deer were later photographed elsewhere in the park .
The snared deer was photographed in 2002 but only recognized as a Sumatran muntjac this year , in a 2008 international “ Red List ” of endangered species , after scientists confirmed that it was a different species from the related red muntjac .
I should get a life , I know , but I ca n’t help myself , one of my favorite pastimes is figuring out new ways to wrangle information .
One of the reasons that IronPython had me at hello is that , my fondness for the Python programming language notwithstanding , IronPython sits in an interesting place : on Windows , side by side with Office , where a lot of information gets wrangled — particularly in spreadsheets .
There are now two interestingly different IronPython applications that marry Python and the spreadsheet .
The first , Resolver One , I wrote about last year and featured in a screencast .
In this case , IronPython runs the whole show .
It drives the user interface , and it also drives the recalculation engine .
More recently Blue Reference , whose Inference suite integrates statistical and analytical tools like MATLAB and R into Office , has taken a different tack .
Its Inference for .NET taps the general - purpose scripting capabilities of the dynamic .NET languages , including IronPython and IronRuby .
Now to be clear , I ’m not in Blue Reference ’s target market .
Their customers are doing scientific and technical work that benefits from the ability to embed live R or MATLAB analysis into documents .
I do n’t know , but would be curious to find out , how those folks — or others — might also want to leverage more general - purpose glue languages like IronPython or IronRuby .
In any case , there are clear tradeoffs between the two approaches .
With Inference , the IronPython engine is loosely coupled to the Office apps .
That buys you the full fidelity of the applications , but costs you Pythonic impedance .
With Resolver
One there is no impedance .
The application and your data are made of Pythonic stuff .
You give up a ton of affordances in order to get that unification , but it enables some really interesting things .
Here ’s one example : row- and column - level formulae .
This is a pretty handy idea all by itself .
Instead of putting a formula into the first row of a column and then copying it down , you put it into the column header where it applies to the whole column automatically .
Michael Foord has a nice example ( screencast , article ) that shows how to do some nifty data aggregation using Python list comprehensions .
He starts with a worksheet of People :
Name Age Country Job Stan 23 USA Blogger Wendy 66 AUS Analyst Eric 33 UK Developer
In a second worksheet , he aggregates by Country , like so :
Country People Number of People Average Age USA [< Stan > , < Kenny > , < Craig > ] 3 30.7 UK [ < Eric > , < Kyle > ] 3 41.3
Here ’s the column - level formula that does that :
= [person for person in < People >.
ContentRows if person [ ‘ Country ’ ] == # Name # _ ]
In other words , for each row make a list of People whose Country attribute equals the value in the Name column of the row .
And stick that value into the current cell .
If you ’re familiar with Python , you ’ll notice that the syntax — [ < Eric > , < Kyle > ] — looks like how Python prints out a list .
That because it really is a Python list sitting in that cell .
Now the other columns can refer to that list .
Here ’s Number of People :
=len( #People#_ )
Here ’s Average Age :
= AVERAGE ( person [ ‘ Age ’ ] for person in # People # _ )
This idea of having live Python objects sitting in a spreadsheet is what really grabbed me the first time I saw Resolver , and it still does .
Here ’s another little example of my own .
Yesterday I was revisiting some of the code I used in my crime analysis project .
These kinds of projects invariably turn into pipelines that transform data one stage at a time .
Typically I store those intermediate results in files , which tends to be awkward .
This time around , I did the pipeline as a Resolver spreadsheet like so :
The column - level formula on D combines the fields in A , B , and C into an URL - encoded string in D .
The formula on E calls a geocoding service with an URL made from the string in D and puts the XML result in E .
The formula on F parses the XML in E , creates a Python dictionary , and dumps that into F .
The formulae on G and H extract the lat and lon values out of the object in F and stick them into G and H .
I dunno , maybe it ’s just me , but I think that ’s cool .
The .tel addresses will be reachable via mobiles too From 3 December companies will be able to buy addresses associated with a new web domain .
Called .tel , the domain is intended to act as a universal contact point rather than as a hook on which to hang websites .
Owners of .tel domains will be encouraged to populate it with details about how they can be contacted .
The domain is designed to work on the web and with mobile phones such as the Apple iPhone and Blackberry .
" All other top level domains like .com use the net 's domain name system in the same way , " said Kash Mahdavi , head of Telnic which runs the .tel registry .
" They all store IP address and they are all about websites . "
By contrast , he said , . tel had been designed to act as a repository for all a company 's or individual 's contact details .
A .tel domain , said Mr Mahdavi , could feature phone numbers , e-mail addresses , GPS data or buttons that kick off a Skype call .
Mr Mahdavi said it had some similarities to the Enum projects that aim to bind phone numbers and e-mail addresses into a unified contact system .
The flaw , he said , with Enum was that it demanded people be on the web .
By contrast , . tel will work with many different devices such as smart phones .
Phase one Owners of . tel domains will be able to manage their contact details via a simple dashboard and surrender as much or as little information as they desire , said Mr Mahdavi .
He added that .tel domains have a " friending mechanism " that will grant close friends access to private areas that give more ways for a person to be contacted .
" It will become their place on the cloud , " said Mr Mahdavi .
Access to the domain is being granted in three phases .
The first begins on 3 December and is the " sunrise " phase for trademark owners to get domains related to their brands .
The second phase begins on 3 February 2009 and is a " landrush " phase open to anyone though domains will be on sale at a premium .
The final general availability phase starts on 24 March 2009 when the domain will be open to all comers .
Phil Kingsland , director of communications for Nominet , the firm that manages the .uk domain , notes that a number of new domains will go online when a new process for allocating them rolls out next year .
" Businesses will need to be aware of the potential uses of . tel and how it can work for them , " said Mr Kingsland .
" They should have a clear and robust domain name strategy in place , so that when new top - level domains such as these come onto the market , they are ready for them . "
Mr Mahdavi would not be drawn on the final price for a . tel domain but said it would be in line with that charged for other domains .

Two rare white lion cubs were born in Belgrade Zoo on Tuesday .
White lions are a rare mutation of a species found in South Africa .
Fewer than 100 are known to exist .
Charlie Rose :
And so when you look at where we are going , there seems to be two issues that are apparent to me at least , risk and leverage .
We just lost sight of risk and leverage of what was appropriate ?
Warren Buffett :
Yeah .
Again , because it pays off for a while .
You know , you can lose leverage , and it 's the only way a smart guy can go broke .
If you owe money , you can't pay them out .
You just pay for everything , you do smart things , you eventually get very rich .
If you do smart things and use leverage and do one wrong thing along the way , it could wipe you out , because anything times zero is zero .
But it 's reinforcing when the people around you are doing it successfully , you 're doing it successfully , and it 's a lot like Cinderella at the ball .
I mean you know at midnight everything is going to turn to pumpkins and mice ; right ?
But if the evening goes along , I mean , you know , the guys look better all the time , the music sounds better , it 's more and more fun , you think why the hell should I leave at quarter of 12 .
I 'll leave at two minutes to 12 .
But the trouble is , there are no clocks on the wall .
And everybody thinks they 're going to leave at two minutes to 12 .
Charlie Rose :
And you 're having a good time .
Warren Buffett :
Yeah , sure .
Charlie Rose :
So if this plan -- you hope it will do what ?
It will loosen credit .
It will stop the slide and the panic .
People will have more confidence --
Warren Buffett :
Confidence is key .
Confidence is key .
You 're not going to leave your money with me unless you 're confident I 'm going to give it back to you .
And at this point , when treasury bills , seven day treasury bills at 1/20th of one percent , it 's not because people want to earn 1/20th of one percent , it 's because they trust the fact the treasury will give it back to them next week .
And I 'm sitting with six and a half billion dollars we 're going to use to close the Mars - Wrigley deal on October 6 .
I 've got to hand over that six and a half billion on October 6 .
Now , I have to be very careful about who I leave it in between now and then , because they 're expecting that he show up .
But I lose confidence in other people , all kinds of institutions .
And there are plenty of them that I 've lost confidence in .
Then they get -- their funds are n't available .
They do n't have it for the next -- I mean the whole economy just comes to a grinding halt .
Competence in markets and in institutions , it 's a lot like oxygen .
When you have it , you do n't even think about it .
Indispensable .
You can go years without thinking about it .
When it 's gone for five minutes , it 's the only thing you think about .
And the oxygen has been sucked out of the credit markets , and confidence , and there has to be -- it '
And that 's what this --
Warren Buffett :
That 's what I hope gets done .
Charlie Rose :
And if it does n't work ?
Warren Buffett :
You turn the spigot .
But you --
I 've argued with the senators and congressmen I 've talked to .
You do n't want to be too little too late .
They 're being somewhat too late , in my view , and -- but that 's okay .
We 're going to argue for a few weeks after Pearl Harbor to decide whether the Japanese attacked or whether we should actually commit a few battle ships .
But the too little part , you know , it could be a mistake .
I mean this has to be done on a --
Charlie Rose :
Too little meaning in terms of dramatic steps , or the amount of money you 're spending --
Warren Buffett :
It 's whether people think it 's too little , when you get all through with it .
I mean in the end , 700 billion is a lot of money .
And it will buy a lot of distressed property .
And if you buy them at the right price , you may be buying two trillion of face value .
The one thing you do n't want to do -- [ unintelligible ] paid for it what you 're paying it from or what his carrying value is , you got to buy it at market .
And one way to do that is if some institution wants to sell you a billion dollars worth of mortgages , they might have to sell 100 million in the market , and then you 'll buy the other 900 million on the same terms .
Now , the very fact that this has been authorized or will be authorized , I hope , will firm up the market to some degree .
And that 's fine .
But you do n't want to have artificial prices being paid .
Charlie Rose :
What do you believe might never be the same ?
Warren Buffett :
Oh , I think confidence will come back .
I will tell you this .
This country is going -- be living better ten years from now than it is now .
It will be living better in 20 years from now than ten years from now .
The ingredients that made this country , you know , the miracle of the world -- I mean we had a seven for one improvement in the average American standard of living in the 20th century .
Now , we had the great depression , we had two world wars , we had the flu epidemic .
You know , we had oil shock .
You know , we had all these terrible things happen .
But something about the American system unleashed more and of a potential to human beings over that hundred years so that we had a seven for one improvement in -- there 's never been any -- I mean , you have centuries where if you 've got a 1 percent improvement , then it 's something .
So we 've got a great system .
And we 've got more productive capacity now than we ever have .
The American worker is more productive than he 's ever been .
We 've got more people to do it .
We 've got all the ingredients for a sensational future .
It 's just that right now the athlete 's on the floor .
But we -- this is a super athlete .
Charlie Rose :
And what 's the impact of the athlete being on the floor around the globe ?
Warren Buffett :
Plenty .
Plenty , and we 're finding that out .
And the same things happen to quite an extent around the globe .
I mean , the European banks were doing what the American banks were .
Charlie Rose :
And they 're failing now , too .
Warren Buffett :
Yeah .
I mean , they were getting the mortgage of some guy in Omaha , you know , securitized a couple of times .
I mean he had all these -- they had all these types from Wall Street , you know , and they had advanced degrees , and they look very alert , and they came with these -- they came with these things that said gamma and alpha and sigma and all that .
And all I can say is beware of geeks , you know , bearing formulas .
They 've heard that in Europe .
Charlie Rose :
Have we learned something about decoupling or the American economy in terms of its impact , for example , China , a place where you 've had investments , and you know well .
Warren Buffett :
Yeah .
We just made a new one a couple days ago .
Charlie Rose :
Where was that ?
Warren Buffett :
In a company called BYD , and they develop a really good electric car , I hope .
Charlie Rose :
Is there an operative narrative to the kinds of investments you are making other than you look at and you buy on value , look at advantagement [ spelled phonetically ] you look at a place that can absorbed the amount of money you want to invest , and you look at its prospects , and you look at price .
Warren Buffett :
Yeah .
They have to be pretty good size for us now to have -- to move the needle .
But we look for fairly large situations .
We look for things I can understand .
A lot of businesses I do n't understand .
So some guy may know how to make money in cocoa beans , but I do n't so I just let him have that .
But it 's got to be something I understand .
It 's got to be a business with fundamentally good economics .
It 's got to be a management that I like and trust and admire .
And it 's got to be a price that makes sense .
And lately the price --
Charlie Rose :
Prices make sense .
Warren Buffett :
Prices make a lot more sense now , yeah .
Charlie Rose :
Now , is it --
Warren Buffett :
And I 'm not worried they 're all about the investments we make .
I mean , listen , this country -- we 've got $ 46,000 or $ 47,000 of GDP per capita .
Now , we 've done pretty darn well .
We 'll do better in the future .
I am not worried about the country .
I 'm just worried about anything that gums up the potential of the country .
And right now , it 's pretty gummed up .
Charlie Rose :
Okay .
But we do this emergency , urgent rescue .
Warren Buffett :
Right .
Charlie Rose :
Come January , we have a new president .
We have a new treasury secretary .
Warren Buffett :
Right .
Charlie Rose :
We have a new legislature .
What 's there in parity ?
What will be the challenge for them because they then can take a little bit of a longer term , look , maybe the patient 's getting up off the ground .
And but you want to get him or her moving faster .
Warren Buffett :
Yeah .
Well , I think it will get moving faster .
I mean once you get it off the -- once credit flows -- now the recession is going to get worse .
I mean , I do n't want to hold out false hopes that the -- by some magic moment , that things will turn around in a couple months because they would n't , Charlie .
I mean , and it's a big mistake to try and mislead people .
They will turn around .
I do n't know whether it will be six months or whether it 'll be two years .
Charlie Rose :
It 's more likely two years than six months .
Warren Buffett :
I do n't know .
It is n't going to be one month or to months , no matter what happens .
All I can --
Charlie Rose :
Can you imagine six months from now , it 's beginning to turn around ?
With the condition that you know their --
Warren Buffett :
That 's sort of the best case , yeah .
That 's sort of the best case .
Charlie Rose :
And the worst case ?
Warren Buffett :
Worst case is a long time .
And I would say that if they --
Charlie Rose :
Worst case is five years or --
Warren Buffett :
If we do n't do the things we should do , it could be five years , sure .
Charlie Rose :
Okay .
We should do , though , beyond where we are now .
What are those things ?
Warren Buffett :
Well , I would say this , if it becomes evident that -- I understand the latest bill , they 're talking about 350 billion early and then going back .
Charlie Rose :
Right , right .
Warren Buffett :
But we need to throw the resources at this that are necessary .
But like I say , we are not spending money .
I mean , if we buy these assets intelligently , the United States Treasury will make money .
I mean , it 's borrowing money .
It 's just a few percent a year .
And these assets are better than that .
Charlie Rose :
Okay .
But that 's a very big if .
Warren Buffett :
And it makes a difference who the treasury secretary is .
Charlie Rose :
Okay .
So that 's the important question in terms of whether we buy these assets wisely .
Warren Buffett :
I would say it 's more important who the treasury secretary is than who the vice president is .
If you want to have a debate here , I 'd like a debate between potential treasury secretaries than the vice presidential debate .
Charlie Rose :
Well , might it be a good thing for the presidential candidates to tell it who it is they 're going to be listening to and who might be a potential treasury secretary ?
Warren Buffett :
Well , presidential candidates which I know listen to you .
Charlie Rose :
That 's because they tell you that , are n't they ?
Warren Buffett :
Well , no , but I mean it 's not their job to know the candidacy of people .
Charlie Rose :
When all these people call you up , what are they asking you ?
I mean , you ’re hearing from your friends and people at the Fed , you ’ve been through this before too I mean you were that long term capital , a lot of other times you have had to face difficult crisis .
Warren Buffett :
I ’ve seen a lot of things happen .
Charlie Rose :
So they come to you and they say “ You ’ve fought wars before , Warren , we ’d like to talk to you . ”
But what ’s the question they ’re asking ?
What is it they want to know ?
And I ’m talking about smart people who are charged with fixing it .
Warren Buffett :
Yeah .
Well , lately they ’ve been asking will this work .
Charlie Rose :
Right .
Yeah .
Warren Buffett :
And you ’re assuring them that if they do it --
Charlie Rose :
I will .
Warren Buffett :
-- if they do it , I -- I [ talking simultaneously ]
Treasury Secretary [ unintelligible ]
I would say this , I would -- they hate this term in Washington , obviously , but I would hand something pretty close to a blank check to a fellow like Hank Paulson to fight --
Charlie Rose :
Would you , really ?
Warren Buffett :
Yeah .
Well --
[ talking simultaneously ]
Charlie Rose :
A blank check , $ 700 billion , go spend it ?
Warren Buffett :
Yeah , go invest it .
Go invest it .
And maybe put up a little of your own money up beside it , I mean , I might ask Hank to go invest with me .
[ laughter ]
Charlie Rose :
That ’s right .
Warren Buffett :
But , no I think that trying to invest through 535 people is a tough job , you know , and so I would give more latitude .
That is n’t going to happen and I -- you know , I [ inaudible ] --
Charlie Rose :
-- go with oversight ?
I mean , that ’s what [ inaudible ] , go with oversight .
Warren Buffett :
[ inaudible ] , I think --
Charlie Rose :
But do n’t try to make the decision --
[ talking simultaneously ]
Warren Buffett :
No , I think the oversight is great , and I think that oversight ought to be devoted almost entirely to the question is this being done at market you know .
In other words , you want to make sure that the government is n’t investing foolishly .
But you do n’t want to care about which congressional districts it goes to or whether banks get favored over --
Charlie Rose :
But how do we determine whether it ’s being done wisely ?
Warren Buffett :
Well , I think --
Charlie Rose :
That ’s a big question .
Victoria Beckham and Son Cruz in a Santa Hat ( PHOTOS )
has been sporting a short dark hairdo since late September but we 're usually not treated to photos where the celebrity actually cooperates with the shots .
We are almost inclined to believe it is a photo shoot depicting the pair shopping at The Grove .
We can't imagine why Victoria 's young son Cruz Beckham would be wearing a Santa hat with a San Diego Zoo Jr. zookeeper uniform .... only in Hollywood .
Her little evergreen toned dress lends itself to the holiday color scheme .

In what must have triggered a collective moan of ‘ are you kidding me ? ’ from environmentalists and renewable energy advocates across the country and the world , Minnesota Representative Jim Oberstar , a Democrat , has asked the United States Coast Guard to delay its final recommendations on the proposed Cape Wind project .
If built , the project would be the first offshore wind farm in the United States .
[ social_buttons ]
Oberstar , Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee sent a letter to Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen this week requesting an extension of at least 60 days to conduct a public comment period to gauge opinion on the wind farm ’s potential impact on marine radar and safety .
>> More on Cape Wind
In a written statement released Friday , Clean Power Now Executive Barbara Hill condemned the move as a stalling tactic that directly contradicted the position of Massachusetts residents , as well as the position of the vast majority of his party , including president - elect Barack Obama .
Hill writes :
“ Congressman Oberstar asked for this extension at the 11th hour and after 8 years of regulatory review .
This is clearly a device to create further obstacles for Cape Wind at a time when the country needs and is ready to move toward wind power energy . ”
An overwhelming 87 percent of Massachusets voters recently voted to support the Cape Wind project which is awaiting final regulatory approval from the Minerals and Mining Service sometime before the end of the year .
Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne must then wait the required 30 days to make the decision official , which means the official decision will come after Barack Obama ’s term begins – and after Kempthorne has been relieved of his duties .
The project has been in regulatory pinball for the last eight years .

Your next wireless network could use light instead of radio waves .
Researchers funded by a National Science Foundation grant expect to piggyback data communications capabilities on low - power light emitting diodes , or LEDs , to create " Smart Lighting " that would be faster and more secure than current network technology .
This initiative , known as the Smart Lighting Engineering Research Center ( http://smartlighting.bu.edu), is part of an $ 18.5 million , multi - year NSF program awarded to Boston University , Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the University of New Mexico to develop the optical communication technology that would make an LED light the equivalent of a WiFi access point .
This innovative alternative may one day replace most of today 's lighting devices .

" Imagine if your computer , iPhone , TV , radio and thermostat could all communicate with you when you walked in a room just by flipping the wall light switch and without the usual cluster of wires , " said Boston University Engineering Professor Thomas Little .
" This could be done with an LED - based communications network that also provides light – all over existing power lines with low power consumption , high reliability and no electromagnetic interference .
Ultimately , the system is expected to be applicable from existing illumination devices , like swapping light bulbs for LEDs . "
Rensselaer and UNM will work on creating novel devices along with systems applications to better understand the proliferation of smart lighting technologies plus materials
needed for wireless devices to interface with the network .
Together with BU , the three partners will have 30 faculty researchers plus students , postdoctoral researchers and visiting industry engineers as regular contributors to the research conducted by the Smart Lighting ERC .
Boston University researches will focus on developing computer networking applications , notably the solid state optical technology that will form the network 's backbone .
Funding for the BU portion of the program is expected to total about $ 1 million per year for the next 10 years plus additional funding from industrial partners and possibly the formation of new businesses by entrepreneurs .
" This is a unique opportunity to create a transcendent technology that not only enables energy efficient lighting , but also creates the next generation of secure wireless communications , " Little added .
" As we switch from incandescent and compact florescent lighting to LEDs in the coming years , we can simultaneously build a faster and more secure communications infrastructure at a modest cost along with new and unexpected applications . "
Little envisions indoor optical wireless communications systems that use white LED lighting within a room – akin to the television remote control device – to provide Internet connections to computers , personal digital assistants , television and radio reception , telephone connections and thermostat temperature control .
With widespread LED lighting , a vast network of light - based communication is possible , Little noted .
A wireless device within sight of an enabled LED could send and receive data though the air – initially at speeds in the 1 to 10 megabit per second range – with each LED serving as an access point to the network .
Such a network would have the potential to offer users greater bandwidth than current RF technology .
Moreover , since this white light does not penetrate opaque surfaces such as walls , there is a higher level of security , as eavesdropping is not possible .
LED lights also consume far less energy than RF technology , offering the opportunity to build a communication network without added energy costs and reducing carbon emissions over the long term .

" The innovative LED - based networking research that Smart Lighting ERC is conducting has the potential to be extremely positive and disruptive to the market , " said Inder Monga , Leader , Advanced Networking Research at Nortel .
" Nortel believes the era of hyperconnectivity is upon us and the potential new applications that this visible light - based networking could enable with its energy efficient qualities , privacy and its ubiquitous nature is very exciting . "
The ability to rapidly turn LED lights on and off – so fast the change is imperceptible to the human eye – is key to the technology .
Flickering light in patterns enables data transmission without any noticeable change in room lighting .
And the technology is not limited to indoor lights ; its first real test may very well come outdoors , in the automotive industry .
" This technology has many implications for automobile safety , " Little said .
" Brake lights already use LEDs , so it 's not a stretch to outfit an automobile with a sensor that detects the brake lights of the car in front of it and either alerts an inattentive driver or actively slows the car . "

Advertisement Israeli air raids have pounded the Gaza Strip for a third day , hitting key sites linked to militant group Hamas .
Gaza 's interior ministry and Islamic University were the latest targets .
Hamas says 312 Palestinians have died since Saturday , of which the UN says 57 were civilians .
In Israel , a second person was killed by a militant rocket .
Defence Minister Ehud Barak said Israel was not fighting the people of Gaza but was in " a war to the bitter end " with Hamas , which has ruled Gaza since 2007 .
Israel has massed forces along the border and has declared the area around the narrow coastal strip a " closed military zone " .
GAZA CAMPAIGN DEATHS 312 - Official Gaza toll ( source : Hamas ) 57 civilians in Gaza ( source : UN , hospitals ) 2 civilians in Israel ( source : Israel police )
Are Israel 's war aims achievable ?
Israel looks for knockout blow
In pictures :
Third day of raids Correspondents say the move - in addition to the call - up of thousands of reservists - could be a prelude to ground operations , but could also be intended to build pressure on Hamas .
BBC analyst Jonathan Marcus says the 6,500 reservists called up would be insufficient for a knockout blow against Hamas , which would require nothing less than the re-occupation of the Gaza Strip .
Dozens of centres of Hamas strength , including security compounds , government offices and tunnels into Egypt , have been hit since Israel started its massive bombing campaign on Saturday morning .
As dawn broke on Monday , witnesses said a powerful explosion struck the interior ministry .
Earlier , a raid destroyed a science building at the Islamic University in Gaza .
Israel has claimed that facilities in the building have been used for weapons production .
Also hit was a house near the abandoned home of a senior Hamas leader in the southern town of Rafah .
The UN relief agency in Gaza says 57 civilians have been killed by Israeli fire so far , the latest being five girls who died in Jabaliya refugee camp when Israeli forces bombed a mosque near their home .
See detailed map of attacks Hamas officials say that 312 Palestinians have been killed in all , and more than 1,400 others wounded .
The latest fatality in Israel was reported to be a labourer at a building site in the city of Ashkelon , that was hit by a medium - range Grad missile .
Three people were reported seriously wounded .
' Changing realities ' A Palestinian doctor in Gaza told the BBC nearly all the casualties he had seen overnight and on Monday had been civilians .
He said the hospital where he worked had converted ordinary rooms into intensive care units to cope with the number of wounded and that essential medical supplies were running out .
Israelis in nearby towns have faced an escalated militant rocket threat
Grief and fear in Gaza Aid worker diary : Part two Rocket attacks plague Israeli towns A small number of wounded Palestinians have begun passing through the Rafah crossing into Egypt .
About 30 were expected to leave for treatment in the course of Monday , border officials said .
The Israeli action has sparked anger across the Arab world .
In the West Bank , a Palestinian reportedly stabbed at least three Israelis in a Jewish settlement before he was shot and arrested .
Protests have been held in countries including Syria , Jordan , Iraq and Lebanon , as well as in a number of European capitals .
At the UN , the Security Council joined international calls for restraint by urging an end to all violence between Israel and Gaza .
The US , Israel 's strongest ally on the council , said the onus was on Hamas to stop rocket fire first and commit itself to a truce .
Israel says Palestinian militants have fired more than 110 rockets from the coastal territory since Saturday .
RUN - UP TO GAZA RAIDS Shaky Egyptian - brokered six - month truce between Hamas and Israel agreed on 19 June Palestinian rocket fire and Israeli operations in Gaza reduced Violence resumes on 4 Nov as Israel launches incursion which it says targets Hamas tunnel ; Palestinians respond with rocket fire Hostilities increase ; Israel tightens blockade on Gaza Truce expires on 19 Dec ; both sides blame each other for its breakdown ; rocket fire increases Israel launches major air strikes on 27 Dec
The strikes began on Saturday less than a week after the expiry of a six - month - long ceasefire deal with Hamas .
Ehud Barak told a special parliamentary session that Israel was " taking all precautions " to avoid harming Palestinian civilians , but blamed militants for intentionally hiding in the civilian population .
His statement , and that of Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni on Sunday about " changing realities on the ground " in Gaza , have fuelled speculation about a sustained Israeli bombing campaign .
Analysts said Saturday was the single deadliest day in Gaza since Israel 's occupation of the territory in 1967 , although no independent confirmation is available of the numbers killed .
The violence began days after a six - month truce expired between Israel and Hamas , and as Israel was preparing for a general election in February .
The exiled leader of Hamas , Khaled Meshaal , has called for a new intifada , or uprising , against Israel , while the movement 's Gaza leader , Ismail Haniya , called the attack an " ugly massacre " .
Attacks over the Gaza - Israel border regularly put the truce under strain with both sides blaming each other for unprovoked violations .
From 1967 , Israel 's military occupied the Gaza Strip and Jewish settlers built communities within the territory .
Israel withdrew in 2005 but has kept tight control over access in and out of Gaza and its airspace .

Last week I was doing some performance work with a client , and one of the big improvements we made was making http requests in parallel .
If your server needs to hit two or three APIs before it can render ( the bane of the mashup crowd ) , then making sequential requests can be taking a huge bite out of your performance .
With the client , the solution needed to be in PHP , but this evening I decided to whip up a similar solution for Python ( someone might have suggested it as well ) .
Using the threading and urllib modules it turned out to be a fairly straight forward task .
My ( very basic ) strategy was to create a thread for each request , poll the threads until they finished , and then return the received data as a list of two tuples in the form of ( url , data ) .
The one other item on my wish list is that I wanted a timeout that applied to all of the threads ( again , to keep things feeling snappy ) .
My code ended up looking like this ( let 's say that it is stored in a file named multi_get . py for the following eample ) :
from threading import Thread , enumerate from urllib import urlopen from time import sleep UPDATE_INTERVAL = 0.01 class URLThread ( Thread ) : def __init__ ( self , url ) : super ( URLThread , self ) . __init__ ( ) self .
url = url self .
response =
None def run ( self ) : self .
request = urlopen ( self . url ) self .
response = self .
request . read ( ) def multi_get ( uris , timeout = 2.0 ) : def alive_count ( lst ) : alive = map ( lambda x : 1 if x . is Alive ( ) else 0 , lst ) return reduce ( lambda a , b : a + b , alive ) threads = [ URLThread ( uri ) for uri in uris ] for thread in threads : thread .
start ( ) while alive_count ( threads ) > 0 and timeout > 0.0 : timeout = timeout - UPDATE_INTERVAL sleep ( UPDATE_INTERVAL ) return [ ( x . url , x . response ) for x in threads ]
Usage looks like this :
from multi_get import multi_get sites = [ ' http://msn.com/' , ' http://yahoo.com/' , ' http://google.com/' ] requests = multi_get ( sites , timeout = 1.5 ) for url , data in requests : print " received this data %s from this url %s " % ( url , data )
I did some comparison testing against this straightforward sequential implementation ,
from urllib import urlopen import time results = [ ] sites = ( ' http://msn.com/' , ' http://yahoo.com/' , ' http://google.com/' ) for site in sites : start = time .
time ( ) req = urlopen ( site ) results .
append ( ( site , req . read ( ) ) ) end = time .
time ( ) print " took %s seconds " % ( end - start )
and the results were what one would expect .
On my connection it was taking MSN 1.14 seconds to load , while Yahoo and Google took between .1 and .2 seconds ( who knows , maybe they were rejecting the user agent with an error page ; ) .
The first script , executing the retrievals in parallel , was able to retrieve all requests ten or twenty miliseconds slower than the slowest result , while the sequential script took a good bit longer ( the sum of all response times ) .
As you build your next Django or TurboGears mashup -- or even plan your next doomed foray into screenscaping Google - - give parallel requests a try and see just how helpful they can be .
( You could also approach this problem using the asyncore module , but it started throwing some weird errors my way and I went with the threaded approach .
Given that the threaded approach performs admirably , I decided to leave it as it is ; using asyncore should be almost identical but you 'd have to write a bit more glue code for the HTTP aspects , especially if you wanted to get more complex than GET requests . )
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
After what is likely to be the last in a long series of interest rate cuts Tuesday , the Federal Reserve is expected to continue its new , perhaps more effective monetary strategy : printing lots of money .
The Fed traditionally uses its rate - cutting tool to encourage lending and boost the economy .
But despite a staggering 4.25 percentage points of cuts since September 2007 , the economy has not improved - in fact , it has gotten worse , drifting in to a recession last December .
Economists expect the Fed to produce one more cut to its benchmark funds rate at the conclusion of its Federal Open Market Committee meeting Tuesday , trimming the rate to 0.5 % , the lowest level on record .
Whether one last rate cut will help stimulate economic growth remains to be seen .
At any rate , the Fed will likely continue to use its new favorite tool , quantitative easing , " Fed - speak " for pouring new money into the economy .
In addition to lowering rates , the Fed has increased its lending to financial institutions and foreign central banks throughout the year to ease the credit crunch .
But when the financial markets exploded into crisis - mode in mid-September , the Fed 's reserve of Treasurys to support its lending began to run low .
As a result , the central bank began firing up the printing presses , financing drastically increased lending to banks , purchases of corporate debt and bailouts of troubled institutions like AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) .
As a result , the Federal Reserve 's balance sheet has exploded since mid-September , more than doubling to $ 2.3 trillion from less than $ 1 trillion before Lehman Brothers ' collapse ignited the lending crisis .
The huge increase in Fed lending has helped to ease credit , encouraging private institutions to lend on their own .
Perhaps the best example of this trend can be seen in the commercial paper market , which is short - term corporate debt that companies sell to investors .
That key market dried up after Lehman 's bankruptcy , but the Fed was able to restore it to health by purchasing more than $ 300 billion of paper .
Private investors have followed , outpacing the Fed 's weekly purchases for three weeks in a row .
The Fed may look to quantitative easing as a way of boosting the housing market .
By buying up 10 - year Treasurys in large volume - essentially the government buying up its own long - term debt - the Fed could help to lower mortgage rates for prospective homebuyers .
Thirty - year fixed rate mortgages , which have historically moved in step with the 10 - year note , currently hover around 5.5 % despite 10 - year Treasury yields of about 2.5 % .
Before the credit crunch , the rates were more typically within a range of 1.5 to 2 percentage points from one another .
Economists say printing more money to help lower mortgage rates may get at the crux of the problem facing the economy .
" The combination of low home prices and low mortgage rates will make home affordability so much higher , " said Bernard Baumohl , chief economist for the Economic Outlook Group .
" Ultimately , housing is the epicenter that 's holding back the banks and the economy from growing . "
Buying up droves of Treasurys may also help encourage banks to lend , as government yields dip even lower into already historic lows .
Gaining little return on those investments , banks may be forced to return to their traditional money - maker , issuing loans .
The downside : inflation
But there is a dark side to quantitative easing : inflation .
The government has backed all of this new debt by selling Treasurys , which have been the golden asset of the credit crisis .
They have been the only liquid security of late , reaching historic highs as their yields have hit all - time lows .
But there will come a time when the stock market bounces back and investors will no longer be satisfied with such low returns on their investments .
" Everybody and their brother knows this has to come down some time , " said Kim Rupert , fixed income analyst with Action Economics .
" It 's tough to continue to buy Treasurys at these unsustainable levels . "
That would mean huge amounts of government debt with little demand left to buy it , resulting in a devaluing of the dollar .
" The end result of all of this could be the next major problem : the crisis of confidence in the dollar , " said Baumohl .
" At some point , foreign investors are not going to come to the table to buy U.S. debt , leading to a dollar decline . "
The dollar has held up very well throughout the credit crisis despite very low interest rates .
But with countries like China and Middle Eastern countries with export - based economies facing a crisis of their own , those huge purchasers of U.S. government debt may start to ask for more return on their investment before they look elsewhere .
" That wo n't happen until about 2010 , " Baumohl said .
" Right now , people are just so nervous about the credit markets , they 'll continue to buy Treasurys even with rates at ridiculously low levels . "
Bonds rise , rates fall
Treasurys continued to rise Monday as industrial production slid again , a sign that the economy will not rebound from the recession any time soon .
The benchmark 10 - year Treasury was up 19/32 to 110 27/32 and its yield dipped to 2.51 % from 2.57 % from late Friday .
Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions .
The 30 - year rose 2 5/32 to 130 9/32 and its yield dipped to 2.95 % from 3.05 % , dropping below 3 % for the first time in its history .
The 2 - year note rose 1/32 to 100 31/32 and its yield dipped to 0.75 % from 0.77 % .
The yield on the 3 - month note was 0.02 % , and has been hovering around 0 % for days .
Yields near the zero mark on short - term bills are an indication that investors are completely risk - averse , putting safety at a priority above profit .
The Treasury Department said its auction of $ 27 billion of 6 - month notes Monday was well - received , with $ 73 billion in open interest .
The median yield for the notes was 0.17 % , and the yield traded at 0.2 % later in the afternoon .
Meanwhile , lending rates between banks continued to sustain record low levels .
The overnight Libor rate held 0.12 % , and the 3 - month Libor rate fell to 1.87 % from 1.92 % late Thursday , according to Bloomberg.com .
Libor , the London Interbank Offered Rate , is a daily average of what 16 different banks charge other banks to lend money in London , and is used to calculate adjustable - rate mortgages .
More than $ 350 trillion in assets are tied to Libor .
Two market gauges showed confidence edging higher .
The " TED spread " narrowed to 1.85 percentage points from 1.89 percentage points Thursday .
The TED spread measures the difference between the 3 - month Libor and the 3 - month Treasury bill , and is a key indicator of risk .
The higher the spread , the more unwilling investors are to take risks .
Another indicator , the Libor - OIS spread , narrowed to 1.55 percentage points from 1.62 percentage points .
The Libor - OIS spread measures how much cash is available for lending between banks , and is used for determining lending rates .
The bigger the spread , the less cash is available for lending .
Now Cheney Has Admitted Approving Torture ...
And Yet the ' Liberal ' Media Yawn ...
Jon Ponder Byon
12/16/2008 , 12:25 pm PT
Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
The myth of the " liberal media " has become such an article of faith these days that attempting to refute it is futile .
But if evidence against liberal bias were being collected , on top of the pile would go the scant coverage the liberal media are giving two stories about the approval of torture and prisoner abuse by the conservatives currently holding the offices of president and vice president of the United States .
Earlier this month , a bipartisan U.S. Senate committee put the blame for the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison squarely at the top of the chain of command .
Here 's Andrew Sullivan :
Last week , we reached some closure on a burning and controversial question that has occupied many for many years now .
That is the simple question of who was responsible for the abuse , torture , rape and murder of prisoners in American custody in the war on terror , most indelibly captured by the photographic images of Abu Ghraib .
The Senate 's bipartisan report , issued with no dissents , reiterates and adds factual context to what we already know .
And there is no equivocation in the report .
The person who authorized all the abuse and torture at Abu Ghraib , the man who gave the green light to the abuses in that prison , is the president of the United States , George W. Bush .
Again : there is no longer any reasonable factual debate about this ( hence to near total silence of the Republican right ) , and the Senate report finally holds the president responsible in bipartisan fashion .
On Monday , Dick Cheney admitted to ABC News that he approved torturing suspects in custody --- albeit with a quibble over the semantics of the word " torture " --- but his confession has received little notice on other channels .
The story ran on page A14 in the Los Angeles Times today , with the White House - approved euphemism in the headline , " Cheney Was Key in Clearing CIA Interrogation Tactics . "
In fact , of course , what he " cleared " was much more than " interrogation tactics , " it was , as the text of article makes clear , torture :
Cheney 's comments ... mark the first time that he has acknowledged playing a central role in clearing the CIA 's use of an array of controversial interrogation tactics , including a simulated drowning method known as waterboarding .
" I was aware of the program , certainly , and involved in helping get the process cleared , " Cheney said in an interview with ABC News .
Asked whether he still believes it was appropriate to use the waterboarding method on terrorism suspects , Cheney said : " I do . "
His comments come on the heels of disclosures by a Senate committee showing that high - level officials in the Bush administration were intimately involved in reviewing and approving interrogation methods that have since been explicitly outlawed and that have been condemned internationally as torture .
Soon after the Sept. 11 attacks , Cheney said , the CIA " in effect came in and wanted to know what they could and could n't do .
And they talked to me , as well as others , to explain what they wanted to do .
And I supported it . "
Waterboarding involves strapping a prisoner to a tilted surface , covering his face with a towel and dousing it to simulate the sensation of drowning .
CIA Director Michael V. Hayden has said that the agency used the technique on three Al Qaeda suspects in 2002 and 2003 .
But the practice was discontinued when lawyers from the Department of Justice and other agencies began backing away from their opinions endorsing its legality .
Cheney has long defended the technique .
But he has not previously disclosed his role in pushing to give the CIA such authority .
This news has not received a fraction of the coverage given to the scandal involving the alleged attempts by Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich --- a Democrat --- to sell Pres. - Elect Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat .
Statehouse corruption is certainly newsworthy , but as criminal enterprises go , it is far less consequential than the conspiracy by Bush , Cheney , and other top officials to create an illegal torture and prisoner - abuse regime inside the U.S. government .
Allowing Bush , Cheney , and company to escape justice now risks repercussions in the future .
It radically increases the likelihood that U.S. citizens will be tortured when they are captured .
It also sends the signal to future corrupt politicians like Bush and Cheney that they can get away with crimes such as these .
Equally as troubling is the media 's collective disinterest in these developments , and the eery similarity with their collective silence and lack of curiosity about Bush 's bogus rationale for invading Iraq --- a dereliction of duty that has cost the United States a steep price in both blood and treasure .
Pioneer just took the wraps off of its newest optical drive , the BDR - S03J .
Coming in January , the new Blu-ray capable unit will read and burn Blu-ray discs , DVD +/- RW and CDs .
The new Pioneer drive will record to Blu-ray write - once discs at 8 x speed , making it only the second drive ( after Sony ’s own unit ) to do so .
Even though no 8 x media currently exists for Blu-ray drives , the BDR - S03J will reportedly support burning 4 x and 6 x media at 8 x speeds .
Given just how much data ( currently up to 50 GB ) can be put onto one side of a disc , every increase in recording speeds helps that much more .
The drive is n’t so speedy at Blu-ray re-writeable discs , however , offering only 2 x recording speed .
At 50 GB , that ’s over an hour and a half ; for a more traditional 25 GB disc , it ’s still around 46 minutes .
The 8 x single - write discs can be burned in 23 minutes for a 50 GB disc and just over 11 for a 25 GB side .
Twenty - five gigabytes of data in eleven minutes is very impressive , considering how long it takes to burn a regular DVD .
Unfortunately , however , Blu-ray recordable discs are still heinously expensive , with the cheapest single layer disc I ’ve seen costing $ 5 .
That ’s also for a 2 x disc , which would be risky trying to burn to at 8x , given the cost .
4 x discs , compatible with the Pioneer drive ’s high - speed mode , cost around $ 11 , and a dual - layer disc still costs clost to a whopping $ 40 !
Pioneer is also marketing the error - correcting features of the drive , suggesting that both CDs and DVDs will play despite being scratched and dirty .
Given how easy it is to scratch those optical discs , this is a handy option to have .
The BDR - S03J will be available early next year , starting off in Japan .
It will be available both in white and black finishes .
The drive comes with a copy of PowerDVD 8 , to take advantage of the Blu-ray features .
No price point was set , though $ 399 was thrown around .

Noel Lee , CEO of Monster Cable Products has issued an official response regarding recent negative publicity related to trademark issues and corporate usage of the word " Monster " .
The following statement was sent to us directly from their legal department and we were issued permission to reprint it .
- Audioholics
There have been alot of rumors , misinformation , and false accusations spread on the web about Monster Cable and its trademark and brand protection efforts .
We have been wrongfully accused of suing any company using the " Monster " name , and as being a" corporate bully . "
Anyone who knows our company , or me personally , knows that we are not that kind of company , and I am not that kind of person .
The information out there is categorically untrue .
Being a champion of the entrepreneur , and having started Monster in a garage with no money myself , I would be the last person to want to stop someone who had a legitimate right to use a trade name for their business .
Those who know me and have met me , know that we have built a fantastic company from nothing through sheer hard work and a lot of sweat equity .
You can check out our story at : http://monstercable.com/company_info/ and http://www.monsterparksf.com/info/WhoIsMonster.asp
I have even spoken at several colleges about how to become an entrepreneur , and value these opportunities .
In fact , my parents were on one of the last boats out of China during its civil war .
I truly have lived the American dream , and I am not going to prevent others from achieving it .
I feel fortunate to have been born an American .
Some of the negative press you have read may have started with some newspaper articles that have mistaken information in them , or others who have found this opportunity to spread negative press for their own agendas .
Snow Monsters mistakenly portrayed that our objection to their attempt to register trademarks was a lawsuit , which is n't true .
We have not sued Snow Monsters .
We would never try to harm a company whose focus is on ski education programs and products for children .
In fact , Monster is a big supporter of programs for children .
You can see what we have recently done with kids at MonsterPark .
http://www.monsterparksf.com/fun/Photos.asp
.
The videos with Yomi Agunbiade , director of Recreation and Parks , that is up on our web site shows our compassion for kids at the opening of MonsterPark .
http://www.monsterparksf.com/fun/Movies.asp?MovieName=MCP04tailgate_12MB
Before you form any negative impressions of my company or how I have directed it , permit me to straighten out some of the misconceptions .
1 ) We do not have any trademark infringement lawsuits pending , and we do not object or take action against businesses just because they sell products that have " Monster " in their names .
If we did , we would never be able to run our business , not to mention the financial burden would crush us .
We have better things to do than spend this kind of money and time .
2 ) There are over 1,100 registered " Monster " trademarks in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office , and probably hundreds more that are unregistered .
We do n't have any intention of suing them or taking any action against them .
These marks have been allowed by the Trademark Office , just as our 50 + marks in the various classes listed below .
3 ) We have not sued or filed actions against the hundreds of companies that are using the word Monster .
So if anyone is representing this to you , they are not right and should be corrected .
What I think has happened , is people are misinterpreting the U.S. Patent and Trademark office 's database .
When you do a search on the USPTO database for Monster , it brings up a bunch of records dating back to 1983 ; like a Google search does .
It appears people are seeing the search results and assuming they are lawsuits .
They are not lawsuits .
In fact , most of the search results are duplicate listings or merely requests for 60 day extensions ( which allow us to do further investigation to see if there are any potential conflicts ) .
The database shows Monster has opposed about 80 trademarks over the last twenty years .
That 's about 4 trademark oppositions a year , which is n't very many for a company that has over 50 +
Monster trademarks and is af amous brand .
Do n't just take my word for it , please search the database for yourself .
( Click on the linksand you will see the words " Extension of Time " on many of them ) .

& propno= & propnameop= & propname= & pop= & pn= & pop2= & pn2= & cop= & cn =
4 ) Trademark registrations and trademark oppositions are decided by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office , not us .
Even if we do object to a particular filing to register a trademark , it is the Trademark office that determines if the business or person filing for the trademark registration is entitled to it , NOT US .
5 ) Our examination and investigation of businesses filing trademarks with our name Monster is normal processes forany company having a trademark that they want to protect .
We know we do n't own the word Monster ; however like any other trademark holder we do have the right and need to protect our Monster brand when it is in danger of being diluted , tarnished , or infringed .
6 ) The federal trademark law says that we are required to police our marks and enforce them or we will lose them , or risk weakening them .
We did n't make these rules .
Congress and years of Supreme Court rulings have determined the rules of the game .
This type of protection is authorized by federal and state statutes ( referred to as anti-dilution laws ) designed to prevent the weakening of a famous mark 's reputation .

7 ) Anyone can use a trademark without having the trademark registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office , as long as it does n't infringe or dilute someone else 's trademark .
This is referred to as a common law trademark .
There are many trademarks that exist under common law rights .
In the case of Snow Monsters , we have NEVER sued them , and we are not trying to harm their company .
I think that their products are great and do n't cause us any problems , I have written them and told them so .
They are also using the word " monster " for characters , not as a brand , which is how we use Monster .
Please , see the list of our trademarks below that I have provided for you .
8 ) I hate frivolous lawsuits as much as the next person , and would never engage in a lawsuit that was frivolous .
They are a waste of the public 's money , and the time of the parties involved .
In fact , the courts do not allow " frivolous " lawsuits to proceed .
The courts have procedural safeguards to eliminate frivolous lawsuits , as well as penalties ( like Rule 11 ) that can be levied against attorneys and parties who bring such suits .
We have never been accused by a court of filing frivolous lawsuits .
9 ) The newspaper articles and other rumors that said we sued the Chicago Bears , Boston Red Sox , Fenway Park , or a Cajun restaurant are all untrue .
We have NEVER filed any lawsuits or other actions against them .
Do n't just take our word for it , do a search of the court records , and the USPTO database , and we can guarantee that you will find that we have not sued ( or even filed trademark oppositions ) against these companies .
10 ) There are millions of Monster fans who love our company and love our products .
My passion for the products and unrelenting drive to innovate and create the highest quality products is well known in the industry and with consumers .
Where most companies find out how to take quality out of something to reduce costs , we find how we can " improve " products and make them the best of class .
That 's why our customers love Monster products .
I am very sad indeed to see misinformation out there as it wrongfully portrays the company to be a corporate bully , when nothing could be further from the truth .
If anyone wants to talk with me about this , or if this email does not answer your questions , please email me at [ email protected ]
Although I may not get back to you immediately since I am currently on travel , I will get back to you .
In the meantime , I ask everyone not to prejudge until you know all of the facts .
Hope this clears things up for you .
We merely want to protect the trademarks that it has taken me 25 years of hard work to build .
If anyone else is under a wrong impression about our intention otherwise , please feel free to pass this on .
Monsterously yours ,

In a nation originally founded on personal liberty , almost two and a half million Americans are behind bars .
No doubt , violent criminals should be in jail , but most Americans are not aware that well over half of the inmates are jailed for non-violent offenses , many of which are extremely petty : possession of marijuana , public intoxication , street hustling , prostitution , loitering , bouncing checks , failure to produce identification , and even writing graffiti .
Consider this fact :
The United States has less than 4 percent of the world ’s population but almost 25 percent of the world ’s prisoners .
Amazingly , the US has a higher incarceration rate than China , Russia , Iran , Zimbabwe and Burma .
Out of 1,000 people , more Americans are behind bars than anywhere in the world except in Kim Jong - Il ’s Neo -Stalinist North Korea , which is basically one giant Gulag .
Why is this happening ?
Inmates have become the raw material for a prison - industrial complex , shoring up perpetual profits for McJails .
Corporate prisons are paid on a per-prisoner / per-day basis , and thus they lobby hard for longer mandatory sentences .
Inmates also provide cheap labor , and they are about to become , once again , guinea pigs for pharmaceutical trials .
All of this signals the conversion of people into valuable “ bio-mass . ”
Incarceration makes sense , politically .
Prisons provide jobs to rural and small town Americans who would otherwise be unemployed .
These workers and their families represent votes , especially in the South , where electoral majorities are White and electoral minorities are Black .
The drug war is , in large part , a race war by other means .
Study after study documents the following : African Americans are disproportionately stopped and searched ; African Americans are disproportionately arrested ; African Americans are disproportionately charged ; and African Americans are disproportionately convicted .
And all felons are disenfranchised , never to vote again .
Texas is the most enthusiastic jailer in the nation .
The Lone Star State has become the Lock - Down State .
It has the highest incarceration rate in the nation ( which in turn has the highest rate in the world ) .
Texas insists upon locking up people like Rodney Hulin , a 16 year old African American who was convicted of setting a dumpster on fire .
His sentence was 8 years in an adult prison .
Despite pleading to be removed to another section , prison officials refused to extract him from the general population .
Hulin was repeatedly raped and infected with HIV , and he ended the nightmare by hanging himself in his cell .
But what is a 16 - year - old doing in an adult prison ?
It is not that uncommon :
The United States has 2,225 adolescent offenders incarcerated and serving life without the possibility of parole .
The United States is the only country in the world that continues to sentence children to life without the possibility of parole … .
Florida has 713 child inmates who have received adult sentences of 10 years or more for crimes committed before their 17th birthdays .
Even “ progressive ” states like California are pushing mass incarceration , locking up the hapless and the marginal .
Billy Ochoa , for example , is serving 326 years in a “ Supermax ” ( super maximum security ) prison for welfare fraud .
Billy is an addict , an inept burglar , and not -very - good trafficker of food stamps .
Under California ’s “ Three Strikes and You Are Out ” law he is locked up in a tiny cell for 23 hours a day .
In Arizona , among other places , incarceration fits into a Blood - and - Soil subculture : anti-immigrant , anti-minority and neo -fascist .
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio , for example , delights in humiliating inmates , making them wear pink and sleep in tents in 100 degree weather .
Arpaio even reduced inmate food intake to sub -human levels :
Arpaio makes inmates pay for their meals , which some say are worse than those for the guard dogs .
Canines eat $ 1.10 worth of food a day , the inmate 90 cents , the sheriff says .
“ I ’m very proud of that too . ”
Arpaio , as America ’s Uber - Jailer , even puts women in chain gangs and then boasts about obtaining “ free labor ” for the State .
Stalin would have been proud .
Instead of being jailed for human rights abuses , Arpaio enjoys high approval rates in the Phoenix area .
So the prison - industrial complex gets fatter and the prisoners get thinner .
Both private and public prisons are cutting corners on guard training , libraries , education centers and even food .
From Florida :
Mushy bland broccoli stems accompanied by a greasy mystery meat endowed with undercooked rice is as good as it gets for inmates behind bars …
The Senate has proposed slicing $ 6 million from the current prison food budget , while the House wants to cut $ 11 million .
Basically , Florida wants to lower the quality of prisoner food from this already - miserable level :
‘ The quality of the food is substandard , ’ said a relative of an inmate at Marion Correctional Institution in Lowell , who asked not to be named because she feared retaliation against the prisoner .
‘ The preparation is haphazard .
They ’re supposed to wear hairnets and gloves .
You find hair in your food and you find a Band - Aid in your food .
Things are so overcooked it ’s mush , or it ’s not cooked at all . ’
Texas , Florida , California and Arizona have vast quantities of prisoners .
Of course , we ’ll never know how many prisoners are even guilty .
They ’ve been locked up through mass “ plea bargaining ” agreements .
Here ’s the deal : Plead guilty to a lesser crime ( to something you might not have done ) and go to jail for 3 years or risk a trial and the chance of doing 10 years .
It ’s a no -brainer .
Plea bargaining runs against the grain of the Fifth Amendment ’s right to a fair trial .
It specifically contradicts the US Constitution , Article III , Section 2 : “ The trial of all crimes , except in cases of impeachment , shall be by jury . ”
That seems pretty clear .
Theoretically , an individual can choose to forfeit his or her own civil liberties , but the Constitution is degraded when plea bargaining becomes standard operating procedure , when it becomes a conveyor belt for mass incarceration , feeding inmates to hungry corporate prisons .
At this pace , the US is in danger of witnessing the development of a Gulag to jail the entire lumpenproletariat , the flotsam of society , a large and growing segment of the population , under - educated and under -employed .
( But do n’t fret too much , since news about jails seldom makes the mainstream press . )
Women are now the fastest growing population of inmates , and many of them are young mothers with babies .
Sarah B. From , with the Women ’s Prison Association , explains :
Nearly two - thirds of women in state prisons are there for nonviolent offenses ; most are mothers .
Their children face the emotional and developmental effects of separation , and the public incurs additional costs related to the child welfare system .
Most women in prison report histories of substance abuse , mental health issues and past trauma — factors that contribute to the crimes they commit .
Prison does little to address these issues or to decrease the likelihood of recidivism .
Immigrant women and their children are beginning to experience long - term detention .
This too has been privatized , as Steve Watson and Paul Watson report :
The federal government is accepting bids on the contracts from county governments or private companies to build and run the “ family detention centers …
The T. Don Hutto detention center , which is privately run by a company called Corrections Corp. of America , currently interns political asylum seekers who came to the U.S. on legal visas .
Most of them are families including pregnant women and children who have never been accused of any wrongdoing but are forced to endure squalid conditions inside literal internment camps …
Every major human rights group condemns family detention centers as sites of “ collective punishment ” ( which might be classified as “ concentration camps ” under international law ) .
Of course , the federal government promotes a sanitized image of detention centers in order to hide the fact that the Hutto center , for example , is a retro - fitted prison .
The Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) is selling the concept of detention centers as miniature cities , models of healthy living .
As Anna Gorman reports for the Los Angeles Times :
The agency calls for minimum - security residential facilities that would provide a “ least restrictive , nonsecure setting ” and provide schooling for children , recreational activities and access to religious services .
This ICE propaganda is reminiscent of the Nazis , literally .
Several years before the Nazis began their extermination campaign , they invited film crews onto concentration camps to show how happy the residents were with their schools and facilities …
Work Shall Set You Free
In the 1970s , a Supreme Court Justice , Warren Burger , proselytized for more leeway as to what kinds of “ projects ” prisoners could work on .
Before too long , Congress amended the laws .
In a Great Leap Backward , the US Congress has repealed two federal laws ( the Hawes Cooper Act and the Ashurst - Sumner Act ) that virtually outlawed prison labor , making it a felony to move prison - made goods across state boundaries .
Stamping state license plates for cars was generally acceptable , but these Acts tried to end the leasing out of prisoners to private companies ; they tried to eliminate prison - plantations and “ factories with fences . ”
By 1990 it was permissible for prisoners to produce products entering the stream of interstate commerce .
Many of the largest corporations in America have exploited prison labor in what might be called “ Operation Sweatshop . ”
Starbucks , Microsoft , Boeing , Victoria ’s Secret and other companies have participated in prison labor programs .
Now , the federal government is taking the entire concept of prison labor to a new level : The Federal Inmate Labor Program .
Details of the program can be found on the Pentagon ’s own website .
Documents released as far back as 2005 establish “ Procedures for establishing a civilian inmate prison camp on Army installations . ”
Sample text from the Federal Inmate Labor Program :
b. The Army is not interested in , nor can afford , any relationship with a corrections facility if that relationship stipulates payment for civilian inmate labor …
( 3 ) No photograph , film , nor video may be taken or made of any inmate labor detail or member for any reason without prior written permission from both ( name of the Army organization ) PAO and ( name of local federal corrections facility ) officials .
In other words , the federal government is seeking unpaid laborers from among the pool of prisoners who would not be incarcerated long - term in other nations — non-violent and petty offenders who do not need constant guard .
Just as in the Third Reich , federal authorities wish to convey their good intentions ; in this case , they seek to enrich the life of prisoners :
“ ( 2 ) Providing meaningful work for inmates … ”
So it is not surprising that inmates are becoming guinea pigs for medical experiments and drug testing .
Big Pharma faces a shortage of experimental subjects .
Ian Urbina , in the New York Times , explains how the pharmaceutical lobby is on the verge of changing — or reversing — federal law :
An influential federal panel of medical advisers has recommended that the government loosen regulations that severely limit the testing of pharmaceuticals on prison inmates , a practice that was all but stopped three decades ago after revelations of abuse …
The discussion comes as the biomedical industry is facing a shortage of testing subjects …
In fact , it is precisely because of pharmaceutical experiments that federal law began to protect prisoners in the late 1970s .
Technically , under a Department of Health and Human Services regulation ( 45 CFR 46 ) , prisoners are supposed to receive the same “ protection of human subjects ” as children and pregnant women .
As the law currently stands , the only research that may be conducted with prisoners has to be material to their lives .
Prisoners may not be used , under current law , as a “ population of convenience . ”
But all this may soon be rolled back .
The profit motive worms its way into all aspects of prison life .
The executives of these for - profit prisons sponsor “ tough - on - crime ” legislation and even line the pockets of politicians who back “ mandatory sentencing ” laws .
It ’s all profitable .
On correctionscorp.com there is a separate section for investors .
Corrections Corporation of America is the nation ’s largest owner and operator of privatized correctional and detention facilities and one of the largest prison operators in the United States , behind only the federal government and three states .
A recent analysis of the prison industry by Leslie Berestein is telling :
The industry leaders ’ stock prices have rebounded .
Since 2001 , CCA shares have split twice and multiplied tenfold , closing recently at $ 26.17 .
The GEO Group , which changed its name from Wackenhut Corrections in 2003 , has also completed two stock splits and seen its stock value jump from roughly $ 2.50 a share in early January 2001 to $ 26.76 recently .
Meanwhile , the industry has broadened its political influence , spending more to lobby agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security and the Bureau of Prisons .
A nation that once represented personal liberty , the United States , has become the world ’s most ardent incarcerator , turning the hapless and marginalized into inmates , cheap laborers , and guinea pigs for pharmaceutical trials .

Zoo elephants have a very repetitive , boring lifestyle A new study comparing wild , captive and working elephants has found that living in zoos can significantly shorten the animals ' lives .
Writing in the journal Science , researchers say obesity is a major cause of death in adult zoo elephants .
They also cite stress as the key factor in the death of young captive animals when they are moved from zoo to zoo .
They say ideally zoos should not take on new elephants if they cannot provide suitable environments .
Still births
The study focused on the lives of female elephants , comparing more than 4,500 individuals .
The researchers looked at wild elephants in Kenya 's Ambosseli National Park , working elephants in the Burmese logging industry , and zoo elephant populations in Europe .
For African elephants , the average lifespan in captivity was only 19 years compared with 56 years in the wild .
Rates of mortality amongst zoo - born Asian elephants were two to three times higher than for those born in the logging camps .
Ros Clubb from Britain's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( RSPCA ) says diet and lifestyle are the key factors influencing elephant lifespan in zoos .
" The vast majority are overweight in zoos , this could explain the high still - birth rates and why they 're dying early .
Bigger mothers have bigger calves and more of these are still - born , " she said .
Wild elephants live in herds made up of family groups
Early death was also more likely to occur in captive animals born in the wild or transferred between zoos .
Dr Clubb says this is probably caused by the stress of being taken away from their herd , mothers or family group .
" In the wild they live in large stable groups , separation does cause stress ; we know this from studies of other species , " she said .
Working elephants Khyune Mar , now at the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences at Sheffield University , used to work for Myanma Timber Enterprise , the commercial arm of Burma 's forest ministry .
The company uses elephants to haul logs from the forests .
Analysis of the lives of these working Asian elephants was based on data Dr Mar collected in Burma .
She says their longer life expectancy - more than 40 years compared with less than 19 in zoo elephants - can be put down to their lifestyle ; for half the time the Burmese working elephants are allowed to act naturally .
" We keep working elephants in the workforce for no more than six to eight hours a day .
For the remaining hours we let them loose in the forest , they live like wild elephants , they can meet and mate with wild elephants , they have a full elephant life , good exercise and good food , " she said .
Burmese logging elephants can roam free in the forest for some of the time Dr Mar says there are lessons from the treatment of these working elephants that could be taken on board by zoos .
" They have a very monotonous lifestyle , every day is the same for zoo elephants , they have to live in the same compound , with limited roaming , this makes them more stressed , " she said .
" They need a huge home range , more systematic enrichment , bigger compounds , grooming areas , mud wallows , hills . "
She says its important to allow them the freedom to behave naturally and has a straightforward message for zoos .
" If the zoo does not have space , its simple - do n't take elephants . "
The report 's authors say transfers of elephants between zoos should be avoided , calves should be kept with their mothers for as long as possible to avoid stress - related death , and there should be regular screening for signs of obesity .
UK zoos A separate study looking in detail at all the elephants in UK zoos has found significant health problems and evidence of widespread psychological distress .
Researchers from Bristol University studied 77 animals in 13 zoos and found that almost half of the elephants displayed abnormal behaviour .
This included repeatedly swaying the trunk , pacing backwards and forwards and retracing their steps over and over again .
" Some of the animals were born in the zoos and must have developed it there , " said Chris Sherwin , from Bristol University 's Department of Veterinary Science .
" It 's possibly their way of coping with stress , but almost certainly indicates they 're in an environment which is inappropriate for their needs .
This is not behaviour you see in the wild . "
The report says unless the animals ' health and psychological suffering can be addressed , the ethics of keeping elephants in zoos must be questioned .
" In my opinion , given the correct housing and care it would be ethically acceptable to keep a few elephants in a few zoos , but certainly not the numbers we have in all the zoos we have now , " Dr Sherwin added .
The Zoos Forum , the UK government 's independent advisers on zoos , will consider the new findings and report to the Department of Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) within six months .

The Black Swan : Quotes & Warnings that the Imbeciles Chose to Ignore
Nassim Nicholas Taleb : The Black Swan : The Impact of the Highly Improbable ( April 2007 )
For the last 12 years , I have been telling anyone who would listen to me that we are taking huge risks and massive exposure to rare events .
I isolated some areas in which people make bogus claims -- epistemologically unsound .
The Black Swan is a philosophy book ( epistemology , philosophy of history & philosophy of science ) , but I used banks as a particularly worrisome case of epistemic arrogance -- and the use of " science " to measure the risk of rare events , making society dependent on very spurious measurements .
To me a banking crisis -- worse than what we have ever seen -- was unavoidable and NOT A BLACK SWAN , just as a drunk and incompetent pilot would eventually crash the plane .
And I kept receiving insults for 12 years !
Quotes From the Black Swan ( written b. 2003 - 2006 ) that the IMBECILES did not want to hear
Globalization creates interlocking fragility , while reducing volatility and giving the appearance of stability .
In other words it creates devastating Black Swans .
We have never lived before under the threat of a global collapse .
Financial Institutions have been merging into a smaller number of very large banks .
Almost all banks are interrelated .
So the financial ecology is swelling into gigantic , incestuous , bureaucratic banks – when one fails , they all fall .
The increased concentration among banks seems to have the effect of making financial crises less likely , but when they happen they are more global in scale and hit us very hard .
We have moved from a diversified ecology of small banks , with varied lending policies , to a more homogeneous framework of firms that all resemble one another .
True , we now have fewer failures , but when they occur …. I shiver at the thought .
Banks hire dull people and train them to be even more dull .
If they look conservative , it 's only because their loans go bust on rare , very rare occasions .
But ( ...) bankers are not conservative at all .
They are just phenomenally skilled at self - deception by burying the possibility of a large , devastating loss under the rug .
The government - sponsored institution Fannie Mae , when I look at its risks , seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite , vulnerable to the slightest hiccup .
But not to worry : their large staff of scientists deemed these events " unlikely " .
There is no way to gauge the effectiveness of their lending activity by observing it over a day , a week , a month , or . . . even a century !
(...) the real - estate collapse of the early 1990s in which the now defunct savings and loan industry required a taxpayer - funded bailout of more than half a trillion dollars .
The Federal Reserve bank protected them at our expense : when " conservative " bankers make proﬁts , they get the beneﬁts ; when they are hurt , we pay the costs .
Once again , recall the story of banks hiding explosive risks in their portfolios .
It is not a good idea to trust corporations with matters such as rare events because the performance of these executives is not observable on a short - term basis , and they will game the system by showing good performance so they can get their yearly bonus .
The Achilles ’ heel of capitalism is that if you make corporations compete , it is sometimes the one that is most exposed to the negative Black Swan that will appear to be the most ﬁt for survival .
As if we did not have enough problems , banks are now more vulnerable to the Black Swan and the ludic fallacy than ever before with “ scientists ” among their staff taking care of exposures .
The giant ﬁrm J. P. Morgan put the entire world at risk by introducing in the nineties RiskMetrics , a phony method aiming at managing people ’s risks , causing the generalized use of the ludic fallacy , and bringing Dr. Johns into power in place of the skeptical Fat Tonys .
( A related method called “ Value - at - Risk , ” which relies on the quantitative measurement of risk , has been spreading . )
Please , do n’t drive a school bus blindfolded .
Owing to [...] misunderstanding of the causal chains between policy and actions , we can easily trigger Black Swans thanks to aggressive ignorance — like a child playing with a chemistry kit .
Warning hedge fund imbeciles about the next blowups : at 100 Women in Hedge Funds lecture , 2004 , “ Long - Term Capital Management is a picnic compared to what ’s going to happen to you guys " .
My war against " Value at Risk " started in 1996 in this interview .
Pablo Trianas ’ comment
Phonies in Academia
EN FRANCAIS
Comme si nous n’avions pas assez de problèmes comme cela , les banques sont aujourd ’hui plus que jamais sujettes au Cygne Noir et à l’erreur ludique , tandis que des « scientifiques » appartenant à leur personnel gèrent leur exposition éventuelle à ces phénomènes .
dans les années 1990 , le géant J. P. morgan mit le monde entier en danger en introduisant Riskmetrics , méthode de gestion des risques bidon , entraînant la généralisation de l’utilisation de l’erreur ludique et portant au pouvoir non pas de Gros tony adeptes du scepticisme , mais des dr .
Johns ( depuis , se répand une méthode liée à celle - là , baptisée la vaR [ de l’anglais « value at Risk » – mot à mot : « valeur sous risque » – N.d.T. ] – fondée sur la mesure quantitative du risque ) .
Quand je regarde les risques encourus par Fanny mae , une institution de prêts hypothécaires sponsorisée par le gouvernement , elle semble assise sur une poudrière , sujette au moindre soubresaut .
mais il n’y a rien à craindre : les nombreux « scientifiques » qui en font partie ont jugé ces événements « improbables ».
LA MONDIALISATION : elle génère une fragilité qui se répercute en cascade tout en diminuant la volatilité et en créant une apparence de stabilité .
En d’autres termes , la mondialisation produit des Cygnes Noirs foudroyants .
Nous n’avons jamais vécu sous la menace d’un effondrement général .
Jusqu’à présent , les institutions financières ont fusionné , donnant naissance à un nombre plus restreint de très grandes banques .
maintenant , les banques sont pratiquement toutes liées entre elles .
ainsi l’écologie financière est - elle en train d’enfler pour former des banques bureaucratiques gigantesques , incestueuses ( souvent « gaussianisées » en termes d’évaluation des risques ) – la chute de l’une entraîne celle de toutes les autres .
La concentration accrue des banques semble avoir pour effet de rendre les crises financières moins probables , mais quand elles se produisent , c’est à une échelle plus globale et elles nous frappent très cruellement .
Nous sommes passés d’une écologie diversifiée de petites banques , avec différentes politiques de prêt , à un ensemble plus homogène de sociétés qui se ressemblent toutes .
Certes , nous enregistrons maintenant moins d’échecs , mais quand ils se produisent …
Cette pensée me fait frémir .
Je reformule mon idée : nous allons avoir moins de crises , mais elles seront plus graves .
Plus un événement est rare , moins nous connaissons les chances qu’il a de se produire .
autrement dit , nous en savons toujours moins sur les possibilités qu’une crise a de survenir .

One weight loss diet fad is the “ morning banana diet ” .
Japan , a nation known for following some pretty wacky fads , is suffering a banana shortage because of it .
From ABC
News :
Akihiro Takenaka , a produce manager of a Tokyo supermarket , Ozeki , said the demands for bananas are still high and the supply simply cannot catch up .
“ I have been in the produce business for almost 20 years and I have never seen this kind of phenomenon , ” said Takenaka .
“ We usually purchase 15 cases of bananas every day , but we have not been able to secure that amount for the past few months .
We are lucky if we get five cases . “
The basic rules of the morning banana diet are simple :
Eat as many bananas as you want in the morning .
Eat a normal lunch and dinner .
Eat dinner before 8 p.m
Go to bed before midnight .
Snacks between meals are allowed in moderation .
Drinking alcohol is allowed in moderation .
The man who started the craze in Japan is Hitoshi Watanabe , who lost 38 pounds in less than a year by following the diet .
His wife , a pharmacist , came up with the plan as a way to help Watanabe lose the weight he gained from eating late dinners and no exercise .
Bananas fit the bill for a filling , nutritious food relatively low in calories .
As Watanabe lost weight , he began posting the diet information on Mixi , the largest social networking service in Japan .
“ I did not know so many people would show an interest .
The response was just overwhelming . ”
He was then approached with book offers , and now over 900,000 copies of the banana diet book have been sold , mostly in Asia .
According to ABC News , Dole Japan has had to increase banana imports by over 25 % to cope with the demand .
Grocery stores are selling bananas as fast as they can stock them , and people show up early just to score some .
What ’s the truth about the morning banana diet ?
Well , truth is where you find it .
If people can lose weight eating lots of bananas , then it works …
From my perspective , filling your belly with wholesome natural raw fruits all morning is a great way to change your eating habits .
I know several people who are strong supporters of a raw food diet , and a few who eat a fruitarian diet , and it works for them .
Obviously , diet is only part of the equation , and without adding exercise to your life , you probably are not going to experience lasting health or weight loss .
Just my humble opinion …
Are there any raw foodists or fruitarians out there ?
Are you willing to comment on the banana diet ?

Michael Moore : ' It 's the end of capitalism as we know it ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday November 20 , 2008
Print This Email This Following Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's admission that there is currently little chance of a federal bailout for the country 's beleaguered automakers , things are looking bleak for the industry and the possibility of a complete collapse does not seem out of the question .
CNN 's Larry King spoke about the causes of the failure with Michael Moore , who first made his reputation 20 years ago with a film about the decline of General Motors in his home town of Flint , MI .
Moore was emphatic in blaming the automakers ' problems on their own bad decisions over many years and not on the current economic crisis .
" General Motors has had this philosophy from the beginning that what 's good for General Motors is good for the country , " he told King .
" So their attitude was we 'll build it and you buy it . "
" Eventually , the consumer got smart , " Moore continued , " so they started to buy other cars .
General Motors still would n't change .
They still kept building the wrong cars , and more and more people stopped buying them . "
Moore was equally certain that union demands for higher wages are not at the root of the problem .
" I 'm stunned , actually , at how much they 've given back , " he said of the unions .
" This is not the workers ' fault .
The workers do n't design these cars .
The workers do n't have this arrogant attitude that the public will buy whatever we make for them . "
But Moore did see a " hypocritical " reluctance to do anything to help workers as being behind the inability of Congress to act .
" [ Reid ] can't get the votes to bail out the auto companies because that 's going to help a lot of blue collar people , people that do n't have a voice , " he told King .
" As soon as the banks or the financial institutions or the people that just gambled the money away -- as soon as they were wanting some dough , boy , the trough just was laid out for them , " complained Moore .
" But when it came time , now , to help the people , the working class of this country , it 's like , ' Ah , I do n't know about that . ' "
However , Moore himself is not in favor of a Congressional bailout .
He acknowledged that " if General Motors collapses , then there goes hundreds of thousands of jobs , if not millions of jobs . "
But he also insisted , " I do n't think these companies , with these management people , should be given a dime , because that 's just going to be money going up in smoke or off to other countries . "
" I 'll tell you what it really has proven to me , " Moore observed .
" These guys , after all of that stuff they 've been telling us all these years about capitalism , free market , free enterprise -- they do n't believe in any of that .
They do n't believe in free enterprise or a free market .
They want -- they want socialism for themselves .
...
To hell with everybody else , but give it to them .
And I think , really , what we 're seeing here right now with them , with the banks , we 're seeing the end of capitalism -- the end of capitalism as we know it .
And I say good riddance . "
Moore 's preferred solution is that " President - Elect Obama has to say to them , yes , we 're going to use this money to save these jobs , but we 're not going to build these gas - guzzling , unsafe vehicles any longer .
We 're going to put the companies into some sort of receivership and we , the government , are going to hold the reins on these companies "
" There 's a catastrophe about to happen , " Moore emphasized , " and the government has to step in and say , just like Roosevelt did , this is what you 're building .
This is how it 's going to be built .
We 're going to have a mass transit system in this country .
We 're going to bring back light rail .
We 're going to build more subways .
We 're going to build more buses .
And we 're going to employ not only the people that are currently employed , but a lot of the people who have lost their jobs .
...
That 's what the country needs .
That 's what the world needs . "
One centrist defender of the free market took objection to Moore 's central argument that the automakers had failed because they were n't building the fuel - efficient , well - engineered cars Moore believes Americans want .
" Those gas - guzzling vehicles ( SUVs and large trucks ) have been the only thing propping up the U.S. automakers , " argued Alan Carl Stewart .
" Until gas hit $ 4.00 this summer , Americans loved their gas guzzlers and GM and Ford were the companies meeting the markets demand . "
" What Moore is suggesting is a step away from nationalization of industry , " Stewart continued .
" What s really amazing is that hes advocating that the government should do exactly what he says caused GM to fail in the first place .
Read this quote from the interview ...
' Their attitude was well build it and you buy it .
Well tell you what to buy .' ...
But I guess its different if the U.S. government is telling people whats good for them . "
A full transcript of Moore 's interview is available here .

Inspired by Dr. Slammy ’s insightful and illuminating piece , Is America ready for an honest conversation about abortion yet ?
My wife ’s wise words notwithstanding , they ’re representative of those who view abortion as a women ’s rights issue .
But to pro-lifers , that concern is dwarfed by one much larger : preventing murder .
Furthermore , to them , a woman ’s right to control her own body not only palls before the need to save a life , but is indicative of the me - first syndrome that threatens to rend the fabric of society as sure as abortion does .
As an unambiguous proponent of abortion , I feel that I can afford to give pro-lifers the benefit of the doubt .
Let ’s assume that they actually are more interested in saving lives than keeping women in their place .
Also , out of respect to pro-lifers , let ’s drag out that old war - horse of a question –- is abortion murder ? — and flog it again .
My personal spiritual exploration has led me to conclude that life may begin at conception , but strictly as a seed .
Pro-lifers need to give their deity more credit : Would a just God insert a soul into an undeveloped body and brain ?
What do pro-lifers think a soul would be doing in a fetus that size during the first two trimesters ?
Twiddling its thumbs ?
Maybe , if they were more developed .
Life in a fetus is the equivalent of a coma .
Second , pro-choicers , however , need to cede that there really is a “ cide ” side to abortion , as in infanticide .
A hint of abandoning the newborn on the steppes .
However , the extinguishment quotient is less than in euthanizing a pet .
Running from it only encourages that tiny seed of denied guilt over abortion to grow like the aborted fetus does n’t .
Of course , making the case to pro-lifers that “ It ’s just like putting a sick dog to sleep ” will only add insult to injury .
But it ’s of immense benefit to those pro-choicers who like to think that the issue of human life is entirely extraneous to abortion .
The Real Reason
It ’s Called a Mothership
Meanwhile , aboard a mothership on the edge of our solar system , an alien version of an ob - gyn wields a long pipette .
To an attending doctor , he transmits : “ Are n’t earthling abortion quarrels quaint ?
The energy earthlings squander over them would be better spent saving their ecosphere from the same kind of certain destruction that ours suffered .
“ Otherwise , within a generation , the whole abortion argument will be moot .
Earth ’s spoiled environment will ravage their females ’ ovaries and render them sterile , just as happened with ours . ”
Bending to his task , he asks , “ Is the earth woman sufficiently distended ? ”
When his assistant nods , he inserts the alien sperm .
Once the doctor removes the pipette and straightens , his assistant turns to him .
“ Wait a minute .
Then who ’s going to supply us with eggs and carry our fetuses to full term ? ”
After having several campaign videos removed from YouTube for alleged copyright violations , Republican presidential candidate John McCain wants the video - sharing web site to consider special takedown privileges for politicians and their ilk .
McCain '08 general counsel Trevor Potter yesterday sent a letter to YouTube execs claiming the site is too quick to remove their campaign videos based on " overreaching copyright claims . "
He wrote that on numerous occasions that the material in question was " clearly " privileged under the US fair use doctrine .
The letter ( available here as a PDF ) comes by way of Larry Lessig .
YouTube routinely removes content based on the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) takedown provisions , which grants safe harbor to web sites that promptly remove content if someone alleges it infringes on their copyrights .
McCain was among the Senators that voted in favor of the provision in 1998 .
" We fully understand that YouTube may receive too many videos , and too many takedown notices , to be able to conduct full fair - use review of all such notices .
But we believe it would consume few resources — and provide enormous benefit — for YouTube to commit to a full legal review of all takedown notices on videos posted from accounts controlled by ( at least ) political candidates and campaigns , " Potter wrote .
The letter was addressed to YouTube founder , Chad Hurley ; YouTube General Counsel , Zahavah Levine ; and Google Senior Copyright Counsel , William Patry .
It also CC'd Barak Obama campaign General Counsel , Rober Bauer .
Potter argues the videos taken down by YouTube are " paradigmatic examples " of fair use , because they are non-commercial , factual , extremely brief , and have no conceivable effect on the market for the allegedly infringed work .
" As you know , the DMCA ( and YouTube 's policies ) do not contemplate re-posting of the video until at least 10 and up to 14 days following the receipt of a counternotice — even where the notice is frivolous and the counternotice entirely sound , " Potter wrote .
" But 10 days can be a lifetime in a political campaign , and there is no justification for depriving the American people of access to important and timely campaign videos during that period , " he added .
Warner Music Group , CBS , Fox News , and other media conglomerates have all sent YouTube takedown notices for McCain videos .
Warner Music Group demanded YouTube remove a McCain video that uses the 1967 Frankie Vallie song " Ca n't Take My Eyes Off You . "
CBS wanted a YouTube video removed that used a clip from Katie Couric .
And Fox News had a similar complaint about a McCain video that used a clip about the financial crisis .
Obama has also had YouTube campaign videos removed for mashing - up clips from CBS .
While it 's certainly nice to see a politician advocate against abuse of DMCA takedown policies from copyright holders without a valid claim or even as a tool to discourage free speech , perhaps these complications should have been considered before passing the law in the first place . ®

Kenneth City delays decision on neatness ordinance [ FL ] [ Private Property Rights ]
St. Petersburg Times ^ | 30 Nov 2008 | Anne Lindberg
Posted on by BGHater
Council members caved in to demands from an angry crowd and delayed approving a neatness ordinance until officials explain every word of the 26 - page document to Kenneth City residents .
In what was estimated to be the largest crowd to ever attend a Kenneth City Council meeting , an outraged group of residents railed at the proposal that would regulate the upkeep of both the exterior and interior of all property in the town .
The proposal basically sets standards for upkeep and appearance and gives town officials the right to enter homes .
If the owner refuses to allow the official to enter , the town can go to a judge for an " administrative search warrant " to allow access to the interior of buildings .
Violations would cost up to $ 250 a day .
Angry residents likened the proposal to rules created by Communist or Nazi dictatorships .
One person said the result would be to create a network of spies to snitch on neighbors to council members and other town officials .
Someone suggested the town should change its name from Kenneth City to " Petty City . "
Still others said town attorney Paul Marino was overstepping his bounds .
Marino , who drafted the ordinance at the urging of the mayor and council , defended himself , saying he felt the audience was trying to shoot the scribe and that he was only doing his job .
One person in the audience claimed that council member Al Carrier had driven by his house as a way of threatening him to drop his opposition to the ordinance .
Carrier did not respond to the charge that he was abusing his office .
Others said the council needs to explain every part of the ordinance to residents and that after that , the residents should be consulted about redrafting the new rule , if necessary , to tailor it to Kenneth City 's needs .
As it is , the ordinance is a virtual copy of others in places like Fort Walton Beach and Belleair Beach .
Residents will get their chance to hear the ins and outs of the proposal at 7 p.m. Wednesday in the Community Hall , 4600 58th St. N. The meeting is not only open to the public , but Kenneth City officials seemed to challenge residents to attend .
" Let 's see if you all show up for a workshop , " Marino commented , adding he would go through the document paragraph by paragraph if that 's what the council wished .
And Carrier said , " If you are not here , you have nothing else to say . "
Council members will not be able to make a final decision at Wednesday 's workshop .
But they can decide whether the proposal needs to be sent back to the drawing board , totally dismissed , or scheduled for a vote .
Election is coming
Until the November meeting , passage seemed to be a slam dunk .
But with an election in the offing , it is unclear how officials who may want to be re-elected will react to a large crowd of dissatisfied residents .
Up for possible re-election are Mayor Muriel Whitman and council member Phil Redisch , neither of whom has indicated future plans .
Council member Harold Jividin's seat will also come open , but Jividin cannot run for re-election because of term limits .
Qualifying opens Dec. 12 and closes at noon Dec. 19 .
Candidates for the council must have been registered voters and residents of Kenneth City for at least two years before qualifying to run .
Candidates for mayor must have been registered voters and residents of Kenneth City for at least three years before qualifying to run .
Council members earn $ 300 a month .
The mayor is paid $ 500 a month .
Council members serve a term of two years and the mayor serves for three years .
The election is at - large and nonpartisan .
For information or to pick up a packet , call Town Clerk Nancy Beelman at 544-6655 or go to Town Hall , 6000 54th Ave .

The election is March 10 .

There 's something strange happening in a corner of a west London gym .
To the tune of Britney Spears 's " Womanizer " , two men and a woman are pedalling like crazy on exercise bikes – their legs a blur of stripes , swooshes and sweaty socks .
Unlike the rowers and runners who have half an eye on flat - screen TVs showing Sky News ( or stare into space looking bored ) , the pedalling trio are so focused that the veins throbbing on their foreheads look as if they might burst .
They are also , inexplicably , throwing their upper bodies left and right at random intervals .
What possesses these stationary cyclists ?
Last time I used an exercise bike I was bored out of my brain , giving up after a few virtual miles to head for the steam room .
But it turns out the machines whirring away today are not your average stationary cycles .
From a distance they look pretty standard , but up close it 's clear the X - dream , which is spinning its way into gyms and homes ( well , some – it costs £ 6,000 ) , is something different .
It is , its makers claim , the most sophisticated exercise bike in the world .
And , in a winter that 's getting wetter and colder , the X - dream 's British designer hopes the new machine will attract more of us to the warm embrace of the gym .
I 've come to Virgin Active near Shepherd 's Bush to meet the X - dream 's creator , Mike Rice , and to race the champion mountain biker Scott " Boom Boom " Beaumont .
Once I 'm perched on the saddle for a practice run , the differences become clear – rather than show MTV or a mile counter , the X - dream sports a full - size computer screen playing what looks more like a PlayStation game than something you would expect to see in a gym .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
First , using controls on the handlebars , I have to pick from a range of courses , from desert to forested highlands .
I choose a winding circuit through woodland .
As soon as I start pedalling , so does my computer - generated doppelgänger and we 're soon rattling through the gears .
The pedalling gets harder with each change until I 'm up to speed .
As realistically rendered trees and boulders flash by , I 'm soon approaching the first bend .
It 's here that the X - dream comes into its own .
To turn a corner , you steer – the bike 's handlebars move like the real thing .
Soon , the virtual riders behind me gain ground and then I take a wrong turn .
I have to get out of my seat to power up the last hill and regain the lead at the finish line .
The " warm - up " race has taken me about 10 minutes , yet I 'm dripping with sweat and desperate for water .
This , Rice says , is what makes the X - dream not only more fun than your standard gym bike but better for you ; according to his calculations a rider can burn up to 55 per cent more calories on the X - dream than on a standard gym bike .
" Motivation levels are so low on normal bikes , " he says .
" You look at people in gyms and they 're pedalling gently or walking on a treadmill .
OK , it 's better than nothing , but no exercise programme is going to work if you can't sustain it at a good level and boredom is why people give up . "
Achieving results is what compelled Rice , 37 , to take up cycling .
" When I was 15 , I weighed almost 17 stone , " he says .
" I was n't going to get a girlfriend that way , so I went on a severe mountain - bike training regime and lost about seven stone . "
Later in life , when Rice had become a businessman , seven - day weeks meant he started piling on the pounds again .
Then , after a company sell - off in 1999 , he found himself with time on his hands .
" I was living in Bath , but it was so wet the trails were too muddy to go mountain biking .
I was n't short of money so I bought every cycle trainer [ exercise bike ]
I could and tried them all .
I thought , my God , is this the best that we can do in this day and age ? "
At the same time , Rice saw around him a generation growing up with computer consoles such as Sony 's PlayStation .
He wanted to use the potential of video games to " make people addicted to achieving something " to revolutionise the exercise bike , which had n't evolved significantly since a French medical student called E Bouny put a mechanical brake on the back wheel of a jacked - up bicycle to create the first " bicycle ergometer " in 1896 .
Working in a garden shed , Rice founded his own company , Trixter , in 2000 and launched the X - bike , a variation on the spinning bikes that have become a gym staple .
He then spent two years in the computer games industry to help realise his next project – the X - dream .
At Shepherd 's Bush , one of the first centres to include the bikes , Corinna Javitz , a local reflexologist , has just finished her race .
" It 's so much more interesting than the other machines , " she says between breaths .
" You 've got to concentrate and it works your arms as well as your legs . "
To prove the point , Javitz , who surprises everyone by telling us she is 51 , holds up a well - toned bicep .
The six bikes here are busy but one wonders whether the X - dream will be the latest in a long line of gym fads .
" As soon as something new comes in there 's a queue for it and then within six months it does n't impress them any more , " says Andrée Deane , chief executive of the Fitness Industry Association .
" In the early days it was steps – you could n't get enough step classes on the timetable and now you do n't see them .
It 's the same with gimmicks like Power Plates , which do n't seem to be used as much now . "
Rice is certain he has invented more than just a gimmicky fad .
Unlike other exercise machines , X - dreams can be linked so that riders can race each other as well as computer - generated cyclists .
At some gyms , informal race nights have been set up , complete with leagues .
Last month , Rice flew to Switzerland to meet the president of Union Cycliste Internationale , cycling 's world governing body .
" We 're looking at linking up local leagues and staging national events with a governing body to make it an official indoor sport . "
The X - dream already has high - profile fans , including Beaumont , a former world champion BMX rider .
" I have one at home and think all the pro riders will be after one soon , " he says .
" We have to do a lot of indoor training and there 's no other machine that comes close to getting out on a ride . "
So how will I , a keen road cyclist but some way short of a pro , fare against this champ ?
We synchronise our bikes , choose the forest course and focus on the screens as the countdown begins .
Before I 've dropped through the gears on the first stretch , Beaumont has sprinted into a big lead .
Soon , he appears only as a yellow dot half a mile ahead on the little map in the corner of the screen .
I push harder and the gap begins to close .
But I suspect Beaumont is humouring me .
As the final bend comes into view I can see his back wheel and we cross the line side by side .
The computer says I 've won , but as I shake hands with Beaumont , it 's clear what has happened .
I'm a wheezing , perspiring wreck after a 10 - minute race , while Beaumont 's breathing has barely increased and there is n't a drop of sweat on him .
" It works , does n't it , " he says .
I 'm too breathless to respond .
The gym , but not as we know it :
Hi-tech training gear
Power Plate
By holding positions while standing on a vibrating footplate , users aim to achieve the equivalent of a 60 - minute workout in 10 minutes .
The machines have been called the " microwave of fitness " and are reckoned to be ideal for toning muscles .
Concept2 plus RowPro
Few piece of gym equipment work the body as comprehensively as a rowing machine .
Concept2 leads the field and hosts the annual British Indoor Rowing Championship .
At other events , RowPro software means rowers can race each other on virtual lakes using big screens linked to Concept2 machines .
Life Fitness 95T Engage
The highest - tech treadmill on the market includes the standard touch - screen TV and will link up to mp3 players .
But at the flick of a switch it will show a choice of courses , from a 400 m track to a nature trail .
A USB port allows runners to plan workouts online and download data to the machine .
Hydroworx 2000
Swimming - pool machines , in which jets of water allow swimmers to stroke against the flow without going anywhere , are not new , but the Hydroworx 2000 also offers an underwater treadmill for low - impact walking , as well as remote control and underwater cameras to monitor swimming technique .
It ’s bad enough to see basic scientific misinformation about evolution getting tossed around these days .
USA Today apparently has no qualms about publishing an op - ed by a state senator from Utah ( who wants to have students be taught about something called “ divine design ” ) claiming there is no empirical evidence in the fossil evidence that humans evolved from apes .
I ’m not sure what we ’re supposed to do with the twenty or so species of hominids that existed over the past six million years .
Perhaps just file them away under “ divine false starts . ”
But history takes a hit as well as science .
Creationists try whenever they can to claim that Darwin was directly responsible for Hitler .
The reality is that Hitler and some other like - minded thinkers in the early twentieth century had a warped view of evolution that bore little resemblance to what Darwin wrote , and even less to what biologists today understand about evolution .
The fact that someone claims that a scientific theory justifies a political ideology does not support or weaken the scientific theory .
It ’s irrelevant .
Nazis also embraced Newton ’s theory of gravity , which they used to rain V - 2 rockets on England .
Does that mean Newton was a Nazi , or that his theory is therefore wrong ?
Creationists are by no means the only people who are getting history wrong these days .
Yesterday in Slate , Jacob Weisberg wrote an essay in which he claimed that evolution and religion are incompatible .
He claims to find support for his argument in Darwin ’s own life .
That evolution erodes religious belief seems almost too obvious to require argument .
It destroyed the faith of Darwin himself , who moved from Christianity to agnosticism as a result of his discoveries and was immediately recognized as a huge threat by his reverent contemporaries .
I get the feeling that Weisberg has yet to read either of the two excellent modern biographies of Darwin , one by Janet Browne and the other by Adrian Desmond and James Moore .
I hope he does soon .
Darwin ’s life as he actually lived it does not boil down to the sort of shorthands that people like Weisberg toss around .
Darwin wrestled with his spirituality for most of his adult life .
When he boarded the Beagle at age 22 and began his voyage around the world , he was a devout Anglican and a parson in the making .
As he studied the slow work of geology in South America , he began to doubt the literal truth of the Old Testament .
And as he matured as a scientist on the journey , he grew skeptical of miracles .
Nevertheless , Darwin still attended the weekly services held on the Beagle .
On shore he sought churches whenever he could find them .
While in South Africa , Darwin and FitzRoy wrote a letter together in which they praised the role of Christian missions in the Pacific .
When Darwin returned to England , he was no longer a parson in the making , but he certainly was no atheist .
In the notebooks Darwin began keeping on his return , he explored every implication of evolution by natural selection , no matter how heretical .
If eyes and wings could evolve without help from a designer , then why could n’t behavior ?
And was n’t religion just another type of behavior ?
All societies had some type of religion , and their similarities were often striking .
Perhaps religion had evolved in our ancestors .
As a definition of religion , Darwin jotted down , “ Belief allied to instinct . ”
Yet these were little more than thought experiments , a few speculations that distracted Darwin every now and then from his main work : of discovering how evolution could produce the natural world .
Darwin did experience an intense spiritual crisis during those years , but science was not the cause .
At age 39 , Darwin watched his father Robert slowly die over the course of months .
His father had confided his private doubts about religion to Darwin , and he wondered what those doubts would mean to Robert in the afterlife .
At the time Darwin happened to be reading a book by Coleridge called Friend and Aids to Reflection , about the nature of Christianity .
Nonbelievers , Coleridge declared , should be left to suffer the wrath of God .
Robert Darwin died in November , 1848 .
Throughout Charles ’s life , his father had shown him unfailing love , financial support , and practical advice .
And now was Darwin supposed to believe that his father was going to be cast into eternal suffering in hell ?
If that were so , then many other nonbelievers , including Darwin ’s brother Erasmus and many of his best friends , would follow him as well .
If that was the essence of Christianity , Darwin wondered why anyone would want such a cruel doctrine to be true .
Shortly after his father ’s death , Darwin ’s health turned for the worse .
He vomited frequently and his bowels filled with gas .
He turned to hydropathy , a Victorian medical fashion in which a patient is given cold showers , steam baths , and wrappings in wet sheets .
He would be scrubbed until he looked “ very like a lobster , ” he wrote to his wife Emma .
His health improved , and his sprits rose even more when Emma discovered that she was pregnant again .
In November 1850 she gave birth to their eighth child , Leonard .
But within a few months death would return to Down House .
In 1849 three of the Darwin girls , Henrietta , Elizabeth , and Anne suffered bouts of scarlet fever .
While Henrietta and Elizabeth recovered , nine - year old Anne remained weak .
She was Darwin ’s favorite , always throwing her arms around his neck and kissing him .
Through 1850 Anne ’s health still did not rebound .
She would vomit sometimes , making Darwin worry that “ she inherits I fear with grief , my wretched digestion . ”
The heredity that Darwin saw shaping all of nature was now claiming his own daughter .
In the spring 1851 Anne came down with the flu , and Darwin decided to take her to Malvern , the town where he had gotten his own water - cure .
He left her there with the family nurse and his doctor .
But soon after , she developed a fever and Darwin rushed back to Malvern alone .
Emma could not come because she was pregnant again and just a few weeks away from giving birth to a ninth child .
When Darwin arrived in Anne ’s room in Malvern , he collapsed on a couch .
The sight of his ill daughter was awful enough , but the camphor and ammonia in the air reminded him of his nightmarish medical school days in Edinburgh , when he watched children operated on without anesthesia .
For a week –Easter week , no less–he watched her fail , vomiting green fluids .
He wrote agonizing letters to Emma .
“ Sometimes Dr. G. exclaims she will get through the struggle ; then , I see , he doubts .
–Oh my own it is very bitter indeed . ”
Anne died on April 23 , 1851 .
“ God bless her , ” Charles wrote to Emma .
“ We must be more & more to each other my dear wife . ”
When Darwin ’s father had died , he had felt a numb absence .
Now , when he came back to Down House , he mourned in a different way : with a bitter , rageful , Job - like grief .
“ We have lost the joy of our household , and the solace of our old age , ” he wrote .
He called Anne a “ little angel , ” but the words gave him no comfort .
He could no longer believe that Anne ’s soul was in heaven , that her soul had survived beyond her unjustifiable death .
It was then , 13 years after Darwin discovered natural selection , that he gave up Christianity .
Many years later , when he put together an autobiographical essay for his grandchildren , he wrote , “ I think that generally ( and more and more as I grow older ) , but not always , that an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind . ”
Darwin did not trumpet his agnosticism .
Only by poring over his private autobiography and his letters have scholars been able to piece together the nature of his faith after Anne ’s death .
Darwin wrote a letter of endorsement , for example , to an American magazine called the Index , which championed what it called “ Free Religion , ” a humanistic spirituality in which the magazine claimed “ lies the only hope of the spiritual perfection of the individual and the spiritual unity of the race . ”
Yet when the Index asked Darwin to write a paper for them , he declined .
“ I do not feel that I have thought deeply enough [ about religion ] to justify any publicity , ” he wrote to them .
He knew that he was no longer a traditional Christian , but he had not sorted out his spiritual views .
In an 1860 letter to Asa Gray — a Harvard botanist , the leading promoter of Darwin in America , and an evangelical Christian–he wrote , “ I am inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws , with the details , whether good or bad , left to the working out of what we may call chance .
Not that this notion at all satisfies me .
I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for human intellect .
A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton . ”
In private Darwin complained about social Darwinism , which was being used to justify laissez - faire capitalism .
In a letter to the geologist Charles Lyell , he wrote sarcastically , “ I have received in a Manchester newspaper rather a good quib , showing that I have proved ‘ might is right ’ and therefore that Napoleon is right , and every cheating tradesman is also right . ”
But Darwin decided not to write his own spiritual manifesto .
He was too private a man for that .
Despite his silence , Darwin was often pestered in his later years for his thoughts on religion .
“ Half the fools throughout Europe write to ask me the stupidest questions , ” he groused .
The inquiring letters not only tracked him down to Down House but reached deep into his most private anguish .
To strangers , his responses were much briefer than the one he had sent to Gray .
To one correspondent , he simply said that when he had written the Origin of Species , his own beliefs were as strong as a prelate’s .
To another , he wrote that a person could undoubtedly be “ an ardent theist and an evolutionist , ” and pointed to Asa Gray as an example .
Yet to the end of his life , Darwin never published anything about religion .
Other scientists might declare that evolution and Christianity were perfectly in harmony , and others such as Thomas Huxley might taunt bishops with agnosticism .
But Darwin would not be drawn out .
What he actually believed or did n’t , he said , was of “ no consequence to any one but myself . ”
Darwin and and his wife Emma rarely spoke about his faith after Anne ’s death , but he came to rely on her more with every passing year , both to nurse him through his illnesses and to keep his spirits up .
At age 71 , a few weeks before his death , he looked over the letter she had written to him just after they married .
At the time she was beginning to become worried about his faith and urged him to remember what Jesus had done for him .
On the bottom he wrote , “ When I am dead , know that many times , I have kissed & cryed over this . ”
It is a disservice to Darwin , and to history , to turn his tortured , complex life into a talking point in a culture war .
