Planet Smash - Up Sends Vaporized Rock , Hot Lava Flying
PASADENA , Calif. -- NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope has found evidence of a high - speed collision between two burgeoning planets around a young star .
Astronomers say that two rocky bodies , one as least as big as our moon and the other at least as big as Mercury , slammed into each other within the last few thousand years or so -- not long ago by cosmic standards .
The impact destroyed the smaller body , vaporizing huge amounts of rock and flinging massive plumes of hot lava into space .
An artist 's animation of the event is at http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/multimedia/spitzer-20090810.html .
Spitzer 's infrared detectors were able to pick up the signatures of the vaporized rock , along with pieces of refrozen lava , called tektites .
" This collision had to be huge and incredibly high - speed for rock to have been vaporized and melted , " said Carey M. Lisse of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory , Laurel , Md. , lead author of a new paper describing the findings in the Aug. 20 issue of the Astrophysical Journal .
" This is a really rare and short - lived event , critical in the formation of Earth - like planets and moons .
We 're lucky to have witnessed one not long after it happened . "
Lisse and his colleagues say the cosmic crash is similar to the one that formed our moon more than 4 billion years ago , when a body the size of Mars rammed into Earth .
" The collision that formed our moon would have been tremendous , enough to melt the surface of Earth , " said co-author Geoff Bryden of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" Debris from the collision most likely settled into a disk around Earth that eventually coalesced to make the moon .
This is about the same scale of impact we 're seeing with Spitzer -- we do n't know if a moon will form or not , but we know a large rocky body 's surface was red hot , warped and melted . "
Our solar system 's early history is rich with similar tales of destruction .
Giant impacts are thought to have stripped Mercury of its outer crust , tipped Uranus on its side and spun Venus backward , to name a few examples .
Such violence is a routine aspect of planet building .
Rocky planets form and grow in size by colliding and sticking together , merging their cores and shedding some of their surfaces .
Though things have settled down in our solar system today , impacts still occur , as was observed last month after a small space object crashed into Jupiter .
Lisse and his team observed a star called HD 172555 , which is about 12 million years old and located about 100 light - years away in the far southern constellation Pavo , or the Peacock ( for comparison , our solar system is 4.5 billion years old ) .
The astronomers used an instrument on Spitzer , called a spectrograph , to break apart the star 's light and look for fingerprints of chemicals , in what is called a spectrum .
What they found was very strange .
" I had never seen anything like this before , " said Lisse .
" The spectrum was very unusual . "
After careful analysis , the researchers identified lots of amorphous silica , or essentially melted glass .
Silica can be found on Earth in obsidian rocks and tektites .
Obsidian is black , shiny volcanic glass .
Tektites are hardened chunks of lava that are thought to form when meteorites hit Earth .
Large quantities of orbiting silicon monoxide gas were also detected , created when much of the rock was vaporized .
In addition , the astronomers found rocky rubble that was probably flung out from the planetary wreck .
The mass of the dust and gas observed suggests the combined mass of the two charging bodies was more than twice that of our moon .
Their speed must have been tremendous as well -- the two bodies would have to have been traveling at a velocity relative to each other of at least 10 kilometers per second ( about 22,400 miles per hour ) before the collision .
Spitzer has witnessed the dusty aftermath of large asteroidal impacts before , but did not find evidence for the same type of violence -- melted and vaporized rock sprayed everywhere .
Instead , large amounts of dust , gravel , and boulder - sized rubble were observed , indicating the collisions might have been slower - paced .
" Almost all large impacts are like stately , slow - moving Titanic - versus - the - iceberg collisions , whereas this one must have been a huge fiery blast , over in the blink of an eye and full of fury , " said Lisse .

An example would be base pi , like this :
3021 pi = 3pi3 + 0 + 2 pi + 1
You might be asking yourself : what 's the use of that ?
Would n't any useful number have an infinite pi-cimal representation ?
Well , yes and no .
0 and 1 are still 0 and 1 in any base .
And if you 're working with circles , spheres , and " spheres " in more than 3 dimensions , base pi is fairly useful .
But it 's true that most rational numbers would have an infinite number of digits in base pi .
Base sqrt ( 2 ) is even more useful , since it becomes base 2 ( binary ) if you set every other digit to 0 .
Think about it :
( a i x 2i ) + ( a i- 1 x 2 i - 1 ) + ... + ( a 1 x 21 ) + ( a 0 x 20 ) ...
is really the same as
( a i x sqrt ( 2) 2i ) + ( a i- 1 x sqrt ( 2 ) 2( i - 1 ) ) + ... + ( a 1 x sqrt ( 2) 2x1 ) + ( a 0 x sqrt ( 2)2x0 ) ...
and so you have a system that can comfortably be used for rational numbers , by skipping every other digit , and can also be used to express numbers that have more to do with fractional powers of 2 .

Homes are shrinking in America .
After doubling in size since 1960 , the national average dropped for the first time in nearly 15 years ( by 9 % , the size of an average room ) .
But far from this new average of 2,000 plus square feet are the so - called tiny houses .
Also called wee homes , mini dwellings , or microhomes , their definition is not exact , but they run as small as 65 square feet .
And yes , people really live in them .
Why ?
Those at the Small House Society - calling themselves a voice for the Small House Movement– explain the reasons range from environmental to economic .
“ The movement is the result of concerns about what we are doing to the environment , and what the environment is doing to us ( wild fires , flooding , hurricanes ) , as well as a shifting economy .
Some people just desire to live simply so that others can simply live “ .
Jay Shafer builds and designs small houses ranging in size from 65 to 837 square feet for his Tumbleweed Tiny House Company .
He ’s also spent the past decade living in his tiny creations .
In this video , he gives us a tour of his 89 - square - foot home on wheels parked in Sebastopol , California .
Surprisingly , there ’s plenty to see : living room , kitchen , bathroom , sleeping loft and some decent storage .
We also have an article on the Tiny House Movement .

The planned universal electronic identity for all European citizens has moved a step closer - the technical interoperability standard has been agreed .
The full details will be unveiled 18 November at a conference in Malmo .
But following a 14 - country , 12 - month trial , Brussels has agreed a common specification .
The project , which breaks every rule of acronym club , is called STORK - Secure idenTity acrOss boRders linKed .
In essence the scheme will allow you to use your UK electronic identity , for example , if you needed to access an electronic government service in any other member state .
So once you have a guaranteed identity to get into the UK Government Gateway you could use it to pay French property taxes or a Spanish speeding fine .
The UK side of the project is run by the Identity and Passport Service - although it makes clear STORK has nothing to do with ID cards or the National Identity Register .
STORK 's Miguel Alvarez Rodriguez said , as reported by PublicTechnology .net : “ The main objective now is to test the model in real - time , with real people .
Usability is critical to the success of the framework , so during the pilots we are expecting to refine and improve elements where necessary .
" Although it was a key factor in the conceptual design , scalability is also a challenge to be addressed in any future extensions of the project . ”
There are five projects in the next stage :
- Providing universal access to some British , Belgian , Austrian , Estonian , Catalan and Portuguese government portals .
- Safer access to chat services by kids and young people .
- Making it easier for students to study in other European countries .
- Electronic delivery of documents across borders .
- Dealing with changes of address for people moving to another country .
The other joy of the project of course is that it spreads the British government 's world - beating ability to lose data across the continent .
In fact the British government got in early - it lost a USB stick containing 12 million Government Gateway access codes back in 2008 .
The stick was found two weeks later in a Brewers Fayre pub carpark near Cannock , Staffordshire . ®
We 've heard this before , but it 's always nice to get a refresher from a person in the know .
As a retired Minneapolis optician I can tell you first hand that we bought our lenses in bulk and most single vision lenses cost less than $ 2.00 a pair , Bifocals and progressives cost us as much as $ 6.00 a pair .
Frames .. Name brand , up to $ 10.00 , same quality generics cost us much less .
Online is the way I buy all of my eyewear , New glasses in under two weeks !!

Even if you simply consider the lenses ( throwing the frames out of the equation ) , you can see the screw - job .---- Note : I 'm working on a lengthier piece based on an email exchange I had with an optometrist last week .
He had many points I 'm trying to work through -- fairly .
Take Your Aspirin
Here 's the secret they do n't tell you about space travel :
It hurts .
Spacesickness is common , particularly for first - timers and anybody who launches into a bunch of fancy spins or soaring across the station before they 've had time to get acclimatized .
And trust us , hurling in zero - G is no fun .
Worse , the effects of weightlessness can really do a number on your body .
One symptom is lower back pain , caused by your spine stretching as the fluid within it floats .
You get taller , but you also get achier .
Headaches are another major issue .
Without gravity , it 's harder for your heart to do its job .
Blood pressure drops and your blood does n't reach your feet as reliably .
Instead , it flows to your head , turning your face puffy and red and giving you a headache , just as if you 'd been hanging upside down on the monkeybars .
Embrace Grubbiness
Hygiene is , shall we say , " difficult "  in zero gravity .
Baths are a laugh and showers non-existent — the water would just ball up and float away .
Instead , each person on the International Space Station is rationed one pre-moistened wet towel , a couple of dry towels , and several wet - wipes each day .
These invaluable supplies are used to give yourself what basically amounts to a sponge bath .
As for hair , well , there 's a reason most astronauts keep their locks short .
Space shampoo is dry and rinsing it out of your hair means carefully gathering a ball of floating water around your head inside a plastic bag .
Drink Your Friend 's Sweat
Water is a precious commodity on the International Space Station and every drop is recycled via the Station 's water conduction unit .
And when we say every drop , we mean " every "  drop .
When astronauts are done exercising each day , they leave their damp towels to float around the station , where the sweat can evaporate , be collected by the conduction unit , and turned into drinking water .
Learn A New Language
With missions stretching as long as six months at a time , astronauts on the International Space Station learn a lot about each other , including how to speak in their partners ' native language .
In fact , most veteran American astronauts can speak Russian and most veteran cosmonauts can speak English .
Do n't Ask , Don't Tell
That 's the official NASA stance on whether anyone 's ever had sex in space .
We may never know for certain whether astronauts and / or their international peers are hooking it up up there , but we do know that , if they were , it would come with some less - than - sexy challenges .
For one thing , there 's no natural convection in zero gravity , so any heat you work up stays with you .
At the same time , however , you also tend to sweat more in zero G , making outer space sex both hotter and wetter than that on Earth — and not in a good way .
Another problem is that , in zero G , you naturally push away from anything you touch .
That means anybody wanting to have sex in space would probably need to be strapped down and strapped together .
Oh , and that drop in blood pressure we already mentioned ?
That would have dire effects on male " egos "  galaxy wide .
Enjoy a Drink , If You Are Russian
Alcohol — in small , non-mission - threatening quantities — was always welcome in the old Soviet space station Mir ( natch ) .
But , when the Ruskies joined the crew of the International Space Station they found that American prudery reigned supreme over the heavens .
From it 's opening in 2000 , the ISS was , officially , dry .
This sort of thing was not acceptable to the cosmonauts and in January of 2006 , they managed to talk Russian mission control into changing their rules .
Good cognac — to be drunk by the thimbleful , as alcohol packs a bigger wallop in zero - G—returned to Russian supply kits , to , we presume , great fanfare .
Americans , however , had no such luck .
Officially , they 're supposed to just watch in jealous sobriety when their Russian pals break out the drink .
( CNN ) -- Lars and Jens Rasmussen were broke and jobless -- with only $ 16 between them -- when they made it big in the Web world by selling their idea for Google Maps .
Years later , after finding cushy employment at Google Inc. , the Rasmussen brothers flew in May from Sydney , Australia , to California where they would debut their sophomore product , a Web application called Google Wave , which they say , quite audaciously , will kill e-mail and forever change online communication .
But their lives did n't depend on its success -- not like before .
Strange as it may seem , that worried them .
With Google Wave , the Danish brothers are trying to recreate the kind of near - ruin stress they experienced when they came up with the product that made them wildly successful .
In doing so , they 're trying to prove that innovation , a somewhat magical and ethereal happening , can be engineered just like software .
But , as they prepared to take the stage to unveil Google Wave at a Web developers ' conference in San Francisco , their faith in that hypothesis started to slip .
Was Wave too ambitious ?
Would the glitches come back ?
Was it too soon ?
Were they under enough pressure ?
And , worst of all : Would they become one - hit wonders ?
A case of nerves
The night before Wave 's big debut at the Google I/O conference in San Francisco , Lars Rasmussen laid in bed from 2:30 to 5 a.m .
It was n't restful sleep .
His wife , Yarima , caught him practicing his pitch for Wave during the fretful slumber .
He waved his hands in the air as if he were pointing at a projection screen .
She knew he had n't been sleeping in months as he prepared Wave for this presentation .
The next morning at the conference , Lars stood offstage , trying to calm his nerves by listening to Eminem on an iPod while a co-worker gave him a glowing introduction .
" The engineering leadership behind what you 're about to see is the work of two brothers and an amazing engineering team with them , " said Vic Gundotra , a Google vice president of engineering .
He spoke in a coolly excited tone , like that of a school guidance counselor .
" Those two brothers are Lars and Jens Rasmussen .
You might remember those names because those were the same amazing people that did another magical app , called maps ... Google Maps . "
The stage at the conference had a game - show feel to it : A big logo -- all vertical stripes , just like " The Price is Right " -- served as a backdrop to two Jeopardy - looking podiums in the center of the stage .
Lars looked like he'd just gotten off a shift at the Gap .
A microphone headset was stuck to his ear and he wore jeans and an untucked blue T - shirt with the Google Wave logo on it .
He fidgeted with a water bottle , opened his laptop and nervously began the biggest pitch of his life .
' Let 's start a Wave '
Lars has always been the pitchman .
Jens is the quiet older brother : the eccentric , the idea guy .
When he 's onto a big idea , Jens almost never writes it down .
Words confine good thoughts and kill them , he says .
He mulled over his idea for Google Maps for years before putting it into a written proposal .
But with Wave , he did n't have that luxury .
When the brothers joined Google together after selling Jens ' idea for Google Maps , they already knew he had to come up with something new -- something bigger .
So Jens set to work .
He shuttered himself in his Copenhagen , Denmark , apartment , tuned his television to MTV , watched some music videos and let his thoughts drift .
By the end of a weekend , he had come up with Google Wave , his idea for an e-mail killer .
He sent the idea to Lars in an e-mail .
" I remember being immediately sold , " Lars said .
" He 'll claim it took a couple of days , but that 's entirely untrue . "
In theory , the idea for Wave is simple .
It 's e-mail updated for the Internet age , Jens says .
E-mail as we know it is based on the snail - mail format : you send a message ; your friend receives it .
Wave makes mail collaborative and instant .
When you type a message to a friend , he or she sees what you 're typing as you type it .
You can jump in and start drafting a reply before the initial message is complete .
Wave also lets users collaborate on editable documents , called Wikis , share photos , update blogs , set appointments and chat in big groups .
You can add conference calls to a Wave .
A translation function called Rosy will translate chat messages between languages as you write .
Watch a conversation about how Google Wave works
Jens hopes the product 's name will replace " e- mail " in English vernacular .
So , after Wave 's public release later this year , you might say to a friend , " Let 's start a Wave " instead of " I 'll send you an e-mail . "
Wave is free and runs through the Internet , meaning that , like Gmail , you do n't have to download a program to use it .
This also makes
Wave highly ambitious from a technical perspective .
Lars and Jens are almost performing magic tricks with Internet browsers .
Asking a developer to create a stellar piece of software that runs through the Web is somewhat like asking a composer to write a symphony on a smartphone .
The Rasmussens admit their product is confusing to explain and is trying to make a massive leap forward into uncharted technological territory .
For these reasons , Jens , the idea guy , considered proceeding more slowly with Wave 's release .
Maybe he and Lars should wait another year , or put off some of its more complicated features , he suggested .
But Lars is the risk - taker .
And Jens folded to his vision .
The e-mail killer
On stage at the conference in San Francisco , Lars started his spiel .
" When we started this project more than two years ago , we asked ourselves the question :
What would e-mail look like if it was invented today ?
" And obviously there are about a million ways you can try to answer that question .
What you 're going to see today , Google Wave , is our attempt . "
Lars struggled to explain Google Wave to the audience .
He pulled out all kinds of comparisons to try to get the message across :
Wave is like mobile texting , it 's like a Wiki , it 's like instant messaging , it 's like a blog .
It 's like e-mail -- well , kind of .
It 's something new , he said .
At first , it was difficult to tell if the audience was buying it .
Some demos of Wave 's features rolled by with scant reaction from the crowd .
" Do n't be shy , you guys , " Lars said .
" If you like something , do n't be shy in letting us know .
We can handle any amount of applause . "
Soon things started to pick up .
When Lars typed a Wave message to Wave 's group product manager , Stephanie Hannon , it showed up on both screens of their computer monitors simultaneously , character by character .
When they both started typing at the same time , the streams of moving text looked like furious ants crawling around on the screen .
The audience cheered in excitement .
Twelve minutes into the presentation , Jens made his entrance , if you could call it an entrance .
He looked about as comfortable as a spokesman for a hemorrhoid cream .
His job was to demonstrate the way that Wave will play back the history of a message if someone enters a conversation late .
The audience loved it .
It seemed like they were going to be sold on these new ideas .
But it was still early .
" So , now that I 'm caught up on this Wave , I 'm just going to add my reply , " Jens said .
" ' Me ... too , ' " Jens said , speaking the words he was typing into a message .
" Oh ! " he said , surprised .
The program had crashed .
Recipe for risk
When the dotcom bubble burst in the early 2000s , the Rasmussen brothers were laid off within weeks of each other , both from a company called Digital Fountain .
There were virtually no jobs to look for in technology .
So the brothers cashed in one of their pensions , sapped bank accounts and put their lives on the line to chase a kooky idea Jens had about map - making on the Internet .
Without the risk and the pressure , they would n't have been able to do it , the brothers said .
" I do believe that you can achieve more if you 're willing to take risks , " Lars said in a recent phone interview .
" There 's almost a total correlation between the amount of risk you 're willing to take and then the amount of stuff you then potentially can get done . "
The Rasmussen brothers have done their best to recreate the high - stakes situation that produced Google Maps .
They wanted to make a stress incubator , to start a fire under their team that would propel its creativity to new heights .
This was their formula :
• Google Wave would operate as a start - up company within the corporate giant of Google .
• The 60 - person Wave team would be based in Sydney , Australia , far away from Google 's corporate headquarters in Mountain View , California .
Watch a CNN exclusive video from the Wave team in Sydney
• Google employees who wanted to work on Wave would have to take a risk to join the brothers , a diluted version of what the Rasmussens faced when they started Google Maps .
The team took cuts to their bonus pay , with the hopes of a big payout if Wave were to succeed .
• And their project would be secret .
The rest of Google 's project files , codes and other documents are accessible to anyone in the company .
Not Wave's .
The Rasmussens felt good about their recipe for success through risk - taking .
But it also made them more nervous .
Along the way , they found another form of motivation : the fear of failure .
Just a dress rehearsal
" Did you notice how quickly it reloads ? "
Jens said with a laugh , trying to recover from the crash in the middle of his presentation .
Throughout the rest of the Rasmussen brothers ' pitch for Wave , Jens and Lars pulled out a number of pre-planned jokes to deflect attention from the shortcomings and crashes of their fledgling product .
Lars started dancing and humming elevator music to make up for one lull in the demo , much to the horror of Yarima , his Cuban wife , who says Lars is an adroit Latin dancer .
" Inside my Wave I 'm going to write ' check this out ' and then I 'm going to copy the link in there , and then ...
I 'm going to dance a little while the system spectacularly fails , " Lars said , trailing off as Wave crashed again .
The brothers continued in this awkward way for what seemed like an eternity .
But when the presentation ended , the audience had loved it .
Behind the Scenes blog :
The reporter on writing from afar
When Lars demonstrated Wave 's ability to translate between languages , in real - time , as a person types , the audience cheered so loudly and for so long that it felt like they were calling for an encore at a music festival .
At the conclusion of the show , Jens remembers the developers giving them a standing ovation , shaking their laptops above their heads .
Lars and Jens were elated .
But the May demo was only a dress rehearsal , one held in front of a friendly audience that understands
Wave 's technical ambitions .
The real show will come when Wave is released to the public , when Google 's army of users decides if it wants to take this leap beyond e-mail with the Rasmussen brothers .
Or if they 're up for that risk .
New insights on the origins an social role of Kuhnian concepts
Ludwik Fleck : Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact *
Fleck uses history of the medical concept of syphilis to show the historically ‑conditioned nature of all knowledge .
The figure is a syphilitic nobleman , by Albrecht Duhrer .
A review essay [ 1 ]
Dieter Wittich
University of Leipzig ( GDR )
Translated by Henry F. Mins†
In 1935 the Basel publishing company and bookselling firm of Benno Schwabe and Co. published a 150 ‑ page book with the title , Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact : Introduction to the Theory of Thought Style and Thought Collectives [ Denkstil und Denkkollektiv ] .
The book had been completed the previous summer .
Its author , Ludwik Fleck , was a Polish physician and scientist who headed the bacteriological laboratory of the sickness fund in Lvov ( Lemberg ) during the 1930s and also had the experience from " several years of working in the venereal disease section of a large city hospital " [ 2 ] .
In addition to this book , Fleck published a number of papers on bacteriology and immunology in important medical journals [ 3 ] .
Thus he was not only an experienced physician but also a scientist active in several fields and with a strong interest in theory .
Fleck 's medical investigations finally led to a concern with questions of scientific theory and the theory of knowledge , with which he first became acquainted in their logical positivist versions .
Positivism was influential in the university of his city in the 1930s when many internationally ‑recognized logic studies of the Warsaw ‑Lemberg school were closely related philosophically with the Vienna Circle current of thought .
Even before then , however , Fleck must have had more than a superficial knowledge of the positivist orientation in scientific theory and the theory of knowledge since he came out as an opponent of it not later than 1930 .
His first main objection to the positivism of the time was that it ignored the history of human thought , an ignorance that stood in profound contradiction to Fleck 's knowledge and experience as a scientist .
" Biology taught me , " he wrote , " that a field undergoing development should be investigated always from the viewpoint of its past development .
Who today would study anatomy without embryology ? " [ pp. 20 ‑21 ] .
Precisely this mode of procedure is required in order to understand today 's science objectively .
" It is nonsense to think that the history of cognition has as little to do with science as , for example , the history of the telephone with telephone conversations .
At least three - quarters if not the entire content of science is conditioned by the history of ideas , psychology , and the sociology of ideas and is thus explicable in these terms " [ p. 21 ] .
For Fleck , " Concepts are not spontaneously created but are determined by their ' ancestors , ’ ” and , from the historical nature of knowledge , he would " argue that there is probably no such thing as complete error or complete truth " [ p. 20 ] .
For these and many other reasons an " epistemology without historical and comparative investigations is no more than an empty play on words or an epistemology of the imagination " [ p. 21 ] .
Fleck 's second main argument against the positivism of the time was its gross disregard for the historical , collective nature of human knowledge .
Even for reasons of language alone , cognition " is the result of a social activity " rather than " an individual process of any theoretical ' particular consciousness ' . . . since the existing stock of knowledge exceeds the range available to any one individual " [ p. 38 ] .
Individuals can perform the act of knowing only within a specific cultural milieu , within the framework of a specific " thought collective . "
The social character of any knowledge also appears in the fact that " scientific activities " always have a recognizable " social structure " [ p. 42 ] , and in many other ways .
Thus Fleck arrives at the conclusion : " Every epistemological theory is trivial that does not take this sociological dependence of all cognition into account .
. . " [ p. 43 ] .
Thirdly , Fleck 's criticism of the positivism of the time relates to its shallow empiricism .
In opposing this , he constantly stressed how the theoretical reacts on the empirical and the observed , seeking to substantiate this concept with many facts .
" Consequently , " he observed , " it is all but impossible to make any protocol statements [ Proktokollsätze ] based on direct observation and from which the results should follow as logical conclusions " [ p. 89 ] .
Fleck 's insight , that the fundamental presuppositions and assertions of the positivism of his time are incompatible with actual scientific research and its history , enabled him to develop a number of hypotheses for understanding the history of science and the nature of scientific research .
The most important are :
1 ) A scientific collective is characterized above all by an historically determined " thought style " which is common to all its members .
2 ) The thought style specific and characteristic for a scientific collective at any time puts its stamp in a basic way on all of its research activity .
3 ) Once formed , thought styles and the theories corresponding to them have a " tendency to persist . "
Consequently , every scientific thought collective passes historically through two phases : a ) one in which the thought style , once formed , leaves its imprint on all research activity ( because of its " tendency to persist " ) ; and b ) one in which the thought style gradually breaks down and is replaced by a new one .
4 ) Since any scientific investigation practices a definite thought style , training for science consists necessarily in training for the thought style obligatory in the scientific community concerned .
We now proceed to a closer examination of Fleck 's fundamental concepts : " thought style , " " tendency of theories to persist , " and " training for science , " the objects corresponding to these concepts , and the way in which they operate as Fleck saw it .
Thought style , for Fleck , is always a collectively formed " intellectual mood " or attitude which manifests itself " as the readiness for directed perception and appropriate assimilation of what has been perceived " [ p. 142 and cf. p. 104 ] .
The direction of the perception is essentially determined by the ideas dominant in a thought collective , corresponding to its mental attitude .
Fleck sought to prove this assertion in many ways , in particular from the history of medical ideas on syphilis .
Here , as in scientific work [ sic ] , he concludes : " The dependence of any scientific fact upon thought style is therefore evident " ' [ p. 64 ] .
For the thought style followed at a given time dominates the “ active elements " of knowing , which Fleck distinguishes from the " passive " ( objective ) elements .
The two elements cooperate so closely in the process of knowing that they " cannot be separated from each other completely either logically or historically " [ p. 95 ] .
Even though the formation of individual results of thought already bear the imprint of the thought style , their distribution within the thought collective is again subject to the action of the thought style .
For example , he says : " Words which formerly were simple terms become slogans ; sentences which once were simple statements become calls to battle " and thus attain the " socio‑cognitive value " specific for the style of the given thought collective [ p. 43 ] .
The domination of individual thinking by a collective thought style is such that the individual " is never or hardly ever , conscious of the prevailing thought style , " although that style " almost always exerts an absolutely compulsive force upon his thinking and with which it is not possible to be at variance " [ p. 41 ] .
According to Fleck , the tendency to persist possessed by scientific theories and by " systems of opinion " in general , which are arrived at by a definite thought style , is manifested in their enduring immunity to any deviant assertions :
" Once a structurally complete and closed system of opinions consisting of many details and relations has been formed , it offers constant resistance to anything that contradicts it " [ p. 27 ] .
This " is not so much simple passivity or mistrust of new ideas as an active approach which can be divided into several stages : ( 1 ) A contradiction to the system appears unthinkable .
( 2 ) What does not fit into the system remains unseen ; ( 3 ) alternatively , if it is noticed , either it is kept secret , or ( 4 ) laborious efforts are made to explain an exception in terms that do not contradict the system " [ p. 27 ] .
Deviations are seen by adherents of the classical school " as technical mistakes to be simply passed over in silence or rejected " [ p. 93 ] .
To a certain extent the collective thought style is always imbued with a " harmony of illusions " [ p. 28 ] for , he says : " What we feel to be an impossibility is actually mere incongruence with our habitual thought style " [ p. 48 ] .
Conversely : " Good work , done according to style , instantly awakens a corresponding mood of solidarity in the reader .
It is this mood which , after a few sentences , compels him to regard the book highly and makes the book effective .
Only later does one examine the details to see whether they can be incorporated into a system , that is , whether the realization of the thought style has been consistently achieved and in particular whether procedure has conformed to tradition ( = to preparatory training ) .
These determinations legitimatize the work so that it can be added to the stock of scientific knowledge and convert what has been presented into scientific fact " [ p. 145 ] .
As a result : " The thought style , developed in this particular way , made possible the perception of many forms as well as the establishment of many applicable facts .
But it also rendered the recognition of other forms and other facts impossible " [ p. 93 ] .
To this extent , discovery is " inextricably interwoven with what is known as error " [ p. 30 ] .
Moreover , " The more developed and detailed a branch of knowledge becomes , the smaller are the differences of opinion " [ p. 83 ] .
Fleck concludes that : " Cognition proceeds in this and no other way .
Only a classical theory with associated ideas which are plausible ( rooted in the given era ) , closed ( limited ) , and suitable for publication ( stylistically relevant ) has the strength to advance " [ p. 30 ] .
It follows that no style of thought can permanently suppress the matters of fact that are not in agreement with it .
" In the end there are often more exceptions than normal instances " [ p. 29 ] , and we have the " bursting " of one thought style with the formation of new one .
[ Editor 's note : Wittich here refers to p. 9 . of German‑language edition ; no passage has been found in the English ‑language edition describing the process by which a transformation of thought style occurs . ]
In Fleck 's view , scientific training has an essential function in the tendency to persist of a thought style and systems of opinion consistent with it .
" Any didactic introduction to a field of knowledge passes through a period during which purely dogmatic teaching is dominant .
An intellect is prepared for a given field ; it is received into a self - controlled world and , as it were , initiated , " with the textbook serving as a sort of " catechism " [ p. 54 ] .
In this connection , Fleck ascribes an important role to popular science and , even 40 years ago , deplored its epistemological deficiencies [ cf. pp. 112‑116 ] .
It is easy to see that many of the concepts made familiar by Thomas S. Kuhn clearly resemble those put forward decades earlier by Fleck .
For example , Kuhn 's doctrine of the paradigm has a close parallel in Fleck 's concept of thought style ; what Kuhn designates as the " theory ‑charged " nature of observations was similarly stressed by Fleck ; Kuhn 's distinction between normal and revolutionary phases in the development of science is at least very closely adumbrated by Fleck ; both have almost identical views as to the role of scientific training , and of textbooks particularly , in preserving and furthering the practice of an established thought style or paradigm .
It is true that these assertions have nothing sensational about them .
Kuhn himself , in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions [ Chicago 1970 , p. vii ] , referred to Fleck as a thinker whose work " anticipates many of my ideas . "
Further , W. Stegmüller , for decades head boy and keeper of the Grail in Germany for a variant of positivism , has only recently learned ( from the example of Ludwig Fleck ) that his renunciation of positivism , published in 1973 , did not need a Kuhn to bring it about as he had believed .
L. Schäffer [ 4 ] , reporting the Stegmüller conversion , cites other bourgeois philosophers ( besides Fleck ) to show that the historical and social dimensions of scientific work had been known and discussed long before Kuhn .
Unfortunately , Schäffer himself " overlooks " the authorities most important for his purpose , namely , K. Marx and F. Engels .
Many of the ideas found in Fleck and Kuhn on scientific research and its history were expounded by Marx and Engels much earlier and on a sounder philosophical basis ; moreover , here the ideas were not a matter of chance but were rooted in the structure of their philosophical thought .
That any state reached by science can be understood epistemologically only if seen in its historical movement , that the history of a science presents revolutionary and evolutionary stages , that science is social in nature and is in a necessary connection with society as a whole , with the practical ‑material basis in particular is there any Marxist who does not know that these insights have been known at least since Engels ' Dialectics of Nature and that they are supported there by copious material ? [ 5 ] .
Furthermore , Marx and Engels developed these findings philosophically on a much more solid basis than Fleck and Kuhn .
For example , Fleck and Kuhn , while correctly stressing the social character of scientific work , are content with documenting this merely by pointing to striking instances .
Yet Karl Marx gave the basis for this as early as 1844 : " But also when I am active scientifically . . . then my activity is social because I perform it as a man .
Not only is the material of my activity given to me as a social product ( as is even the language in which the thinker is active ) , my own existence is social activity " [ 6 ] .
And Marx had already derived the fact that his " own existence is social activity " from the social character of the material production on which the entire process of mankind 's life and history is based .
It is not my purpose to start a dispute over priority , over whether Marx , or Engels , or Fleck , or Kuhn , or anybody else was the first to see certain connections between scientific research and history .
I wish rather to point out how much difference there is among them in the basis given for properties of science that they all noted , and which hence were conceived differently .
A further question of fact should be considered .
To some people , just beginning to find their way out of the metaphysics of traditional positivism , a concept such as the " theory ‑charged nature " of observations may seem an intuition of almost epoch ‑making significance .
At best they will see Karl Popper 's so ‑called searchlight theory [ the view that science itself throws new light on things ] as a " milestone " on the road to this appreciation .
They must certainly have no knowledge of a statement such as : " The senses have therefore become directly in their practice theoreticians " [ 7 ] , an insight published by Marx in 1844 .
Undoubtedly , thoughts expressed by Marx and Engels , often in quite general terms , sometimes only in the margin of discussion with a different orientation and , of course , within the limits of 19th ‑century science and its history , could often be elaborated by Fleck and Kuhn in more detail and more comprehensively in the light of the results and the experience of many more decades of scientific research .
My concern is the consideration and appreciation of the historical achievement in the contributions of Marx and Engels toward the philosophical understanding of objects in the theory and history of science .
I will show , from the case of Fleck and even more so from the case of Kuhn , that superficiality in philosophical thinking and ignorance of the history of philosophy , in places where philosophical understanding is required , led each of them to ideological Weltanschauung positions that undermine their aims and achievements in the theory of science [ 8 ] .
This is why we have to take Schäffer 's " oversight " so seriously and cannot pass over it as just the usual attitude towards Marxism of bourgeois thinkers .
We return to the views of Fleck and Kuhn concerning historical connections in the theory of science .
Having seen how similar their views are in many respects , the question arises :
What made it possible for Kuhn to become the center of a much respected and much discussed movement of bourgeois thought , a movement hailed as a " new approach " compared to positivist ‑oriented traditional theory of science , whereas 30 years earlier Fleck was hardly noticed [ 9 ] and soon quite forgotten ?
To explain this , we must consider the positivist ‑impregnated state in which Kuhn found the theory of science .
This traditional theory of science , generally accepted until the sixties , was labeled by Hilary Putnam in 1960 as the " received view " in an article with the provocative title , " What Theories Are Not " [ 101 .
Later , Stegmüller referred to it as the " statement view " and the " micrological mode of consideration " [ 11 ] .
Theory of science had lost itself more and more in constructing and reflecting on models of science that gradually revealed , even to their advocates , two basic defects :
1 ) Not only were these models inadequately oriented to actual scientific research but their sweepingly formal character stood in the way of any penetrating view of the actual content of scientific theories , the origin of such content , its formation and practice .
" Positivist theory of science , confined for the most part to study of the logical characteristics of theory , hypothesis , scientific law , explanation and prediction , never gets down to the specific content and contributes little to our understanding of the phenomenon , science " [ 12 ] .
Accordingly , the practicing researcher and even more the practicing research collective could hardly find answers to these questions in the received view ( or even expect to find them ) , though such questions of the theory of science presented themselves to scientists with ever greater frequency and urgency in connection with the nature of their specific theoretical tools , the organization and planning of their work , and the practical application of their results .
The received view was belittled as " uninteresting " [ 13 ] , and D. Pears went so far as to call it a " crude theory , interesting only for its footnotes " [ 14 ] .
2 ) The received view also suffered from internal difficulties , contradictions , and absurdities which , despite decades of effort , the positivists have been unable to eliminate .
Serious defects in the philosophical and theoretical foundations of traditional positivist‑oriented theory of science were revealed by the efforts of its own adherents :
 to find a secure basis for all knowledge within the idealization itself ( the so‑called " protocol sentence " problem ) ;
 to reduce all the concepts and assertions of science to those of physics ( the so‑called physicalism problem ) ;
 to find especially a criterion making it possible to present any philosophical proposition as non‑scientific ( the so‑called " sense criterion " problem ) ;
 to reduce completely the specific quality of scientific theories to their empirical basis ( the so‑called “ empiricism " problem ) ;
 to interpret cumulatively the relation of a more developed theory to its predecessors , i.e. , trying to deduce the predecessors logically from the more developed theory ( the so‑called " cumulation " problem ) .
Until about 1960 , the received view , because of its positivist mode of procedure and the impregnation of its content with positivist ideas , continued to perform an ideological service for bourgeois class interests because it deliberately refrained from theoretical examination of the basic structures of social life in general and capitalism in particular .
It was thereby inhibited from considering the social determination of all scientific work , including that under capitalism .
The closely related subjective­idealist and relativist tendencies implicit in the received view provided an ideological opening to influence people so that capitalism and its science would appear to them naturally superior , compared to a way of thought with materialist , dialectical and critical content that is damaging to capitalist ideology .
So long as the received view could be considered scientifically attractive or at least theoretically sound , its ideological influence increased .
In the end , however , it became hard to conceal the fact that the received view was in a desperate state , its ideological usefulness seriously impaired both theoretically and practically .
Hence , the bourgeois ideological interest in this theory of science could only tend to decline , no matter how faithfully and well the received view had served its class ideologically in previous decades .
A further factor was that scientific research , especially in the natural sciences , had become of great practical importance throughout the world , including the capitalist sector , with major economic , political and military impact in the universal struggle waged today between socialism and capitalism for the future of mankind .
The bourgeois system , though neither willing nor able to dispense with the ideological influence provided by the received view , nevertheless objectively requires that its theory of science supply more energetically the theoretical advances that provide a basis for practical procedures to make capitalist science more effective .
This includes the organization and planning of scientific work , as well as the development of bold theories and the training of a new scientific generation capable of thinking and acting creatively for capitalism .
Bourgeois thinkers have long since posed this task for the theory of science .
For example , L. Krüger , editor of the German edition of Kuhn 's book The Essential Tension , wrote : " since the survival of mankind depends on it [ science ] which requires rapidly growing expenditures , it must be at least in part planned .
The relation of science to society and politics , and their history , has thus become an inescapable theme " that calls , among other things , for " theoretical ideas of the ' mechanism ' by which science develops " [ 15 ] .
These , more or less , are the conditions under which Kuhn , through his book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions , was able to launch , within the bounds of bourgeois theory of science , the well ‑known movement against the received view .
These conditions must be viewed as a whole if we are to understand why it is precisely Kuhn who got and is getting so much attention .
The point is that a mere denunciation of the theoretical defects of the received view , which ( aside from Marxist criticism of it ) Ludwik Fleck had already performed in part , could hardly have sufficed to make positivism abandon one of its favorite offspring .
Kuhn 's ideas and initiatives promised three things : a ) a theoretical analysis of the distressing condition into which traditional positivist‑oriented theory of science had fallen , with the reasons for its fall ; b ) the gradual erection of a theory of science that meets the needs of ' capitalist ‑dominated science today more comprehensively , more consciously , with a better theoretical foundation and greater practicality than the received view could ; and c ) conservation or even reinforcement of the bourgeois ideological potential inherent in the received view .
As a trained physicist and experienced historian of science , Kuhn vigorously demonstrated the deep discrepancy between the theoretical content of the received view , on the one hand , and the objective needs of modern capitalist research , on the other [ 16 ] .
He was able to point out two main sources , within the framework of bourgeois theory of science , for the impotence of the received view , namely , its general neglect of both the social character and the historical character of scientific work .
Kuhn developed a series of hypotheses in the history of science which take into account the social and historical dimensions of scientific research , reflecting closely research procedures as they really occur or have occurred in history .
In this way , he provoked methodological discussion of how ( under capitalism ) a theoretically grounded and practically useful science can , should , or must be conducted [ 17 ] .
Yet , despite all his theoretical innovations contrary to the received view , he managed not only to conserve the ideological content of this traditional positivist‑oriented theory of science but also to increase its actual or potential social influence , since the new approach , with which that content was now linked , grew in scientific standing or interest .
Only because Kuhn accomplished the last task was he able to win the eminence in bourgeois thought that he enjoys today .
Much of what has been noted here about Kuhn could , at least in its trend , be said about Fleck as well .
There are clear parallels between Fleck and Kuhn in their Weltanschauung and ideological conceptions .
For this reason , it must be the changed historical situation of capitalism that provides the decisive reason why it was Kuhn and not Fleck who initiated so powerful a movement within bourgeois thought .
Permit me to make a tentative historical comparison as follows :
Fleck had the ill fortune of trying to reform the original positivist theory of science at a time when the bourgeoisie was first becoming aware of the great ideological potential in this child of theirs and had hardly begun to exploit it .
Ludwik Fleck could not but fail , as Otto Liebman would certainly have failed in 1840 if he had begun then instead of in 1865 , with his sensational book Kant und die Epigonen , to recast the work of the Königsberg philosopher as Neo‑Kantianism .
Kuhn , on the other hand , had the good fortune of being a " Liebmann " for the traditional positivist‑oriented theory of science because historically he operated at a time when the bourgeois system had the objective need for such a reformer .

So far as I know , reviews of Fleck 's book appeared in Germany only in two publications , one not a philosophical journal ( Carl Haeberlin , Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift 63 : 244 ; 1937 ) and the other preaching a Nazi‑vulgarized monism ( Prof. Dr. M. H. Baege , in Monatshefte f. Wissenschaft , Weltanschauung und Lebensgestalt ( founded by H. Schmidt , Jena ) 12 : 380 f. ; 1937 ) .
Both reviews spoke favorably of Fleck 's work , stressing particularly his notion of the collective nature of scientific work .
However , neither review was capable of even indicating Fleck 's concepts in theory of science , philosophy and the history of philosophy .
I have found only one review of Fleck 's book in a professional philosophical journal : H. M. Féret , in Revue des sciences philosophiques et théologiques ( Paris 1937 , No. 26 ) .

Editor 's Comment : On Fleck Versus Kuhn
There is another historical aspect that may help explain why Fleck was ignored while Kuhn gets attention from the establishment .
In the 1979 foreword , Kuhn seeks to put distance between himself and Fleck by rejecting the concept of " thought collective , " pleading instead for the formulation of thought processes strictly in terms of " individual psychology " [ pp. x‑xi ] .
Following the same philosophical bent , Kuhn in 1965 went out of his way to agree with Karl Popper in denying the scientific content of Marxist historiography , at the same time claiming that his historical approach ( by which he lumped Marxism with psychoanalysis and , by implication , with astrology ) was superior to Sir Karl 's approach [ Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge ( Note 16 ) , pp. 7‑8 ] .
Note how far this separates Kuhn politically from Fleck who , in the repressive Poland in the 1930s , for an example of collective thinking chose to compare " the effects of terms such as ' materialism ' or ' atheism , ' which in some countries at once discredit their proponents but in others function as essential passwords of respectability " [ p. 43 ] .
( This book could not be published in Poland because Fleck was a Jew , and the year it came out he was dismissed " as an anti-Jewish measure " from the bacteriological laboratory he had headed [ p. 150 ] ) .
Mark Kac , who , as a graduate student in Poland during the 1930s , met Fleck at university gatherings , reports that Fleck was much respected by a Marxist‑oriented faculty member ( private communication ) .
A philosophical gulf between the two is also revealed in the different ways they treat the category of truth .
Kuhn , in his effort to refute the charge of relativism , struggles vainly to escape from the confusion of a positivist formal approach in which a theory or a paradigm is ( logically ) either true or false ( cf. Structure of Scientific Revolutions , pp. 168‑173 ] .
Fleck , on the other hand , matter ‑of ‑factly asserts its relative nature : " there is probably no such thing as complete error or complete truth " [ p. 20 ] .
The difference in the materialism of their philosophical outlooks may reflect the fact that Fleck was a hands‑on practitioner of science while Kuhn switched to history of science in graduate school .
From such evidence , one may question the extent to which Fleck belongs in the same category as Kuhn , for whom the characterization as reformist seems more apt since his whole thrust has been to save the idealist formulations while seeking to remedy the methodology .
To see Kuhn as a reformer , however , does not imply a simplistic rejection of his historically ‑based concepts such as paradigm and scientific community , since these have already proved useful to practitioners of science .
What is needed is materialist interpretation of what is valid in Kuhn 's methodology , together with criticism of his idealist formulations from the standpoint of Marxist theory of knowledge .
For the purpose of criticizing Kuhn , it is very worthwhile to read Fleck who , without benefit of Marxist terminology , provides nevertheless an excellent description of science as a special form of consciousness .
And This Comment From Irving Adler
Wittich begins well by showing that some of Fleck 's concepts anticipated Kuhn , that Marx and Engels anticipated Fleck , and that Marx and Engels put these concepts into a unified setting on a strong philosophical basis .
However , I find the rest of the essay feeble .
Here Wittich raises the interesting question :
Why did Kuhn become the center of an influential movement while Fleck was hardly noticed and soon forgotten ?
However , Wittich 's attempted answer , that Kuhn wrote at a time when the bourgeoisie needed his theory , has these serious weaknesses :
1 ) It makes it sound as though a bourgeois executive committee chose a theory that would be useful to it .
2 ) It is unsupported by any significant evidence .
3 ) It ignores the fact that most scientists have little or no interest in philosophical questions and are completely uninvolved in the discussion of Kuhn 's theories .
4 ) It ignores this question :
How much of the attention given to Kuhn is a consequence of the accident that Harvard had as president a chemist ( Conant ) who , because of personal interest , strongly encouraged the study of history of science at the university .
5 ) It ignores the fact that Marxists , especially in England , prepared the ground for increasingly serious attention to history of science : Did not Kuhn 's views , just as Popper 's , develop in relation to and as a reaction to the views of Bernal , Hogben , Haldane , etc . ?
History , the Matrix of Logic
The concept " historical " means objective reality in a state of motion and development .
The concept " logical " means the necessary connection of thoughts reflecting surrounding reality in man 's consciousness .
The historical [ in knowledge ] is primary to the logical , which reflects the former . . .
The logical does not fully coincide with the historical . . .
The logical must not and cannot reproduce all [ the ] zigzags of history .
Its sole objective is to reflect the necessary changes , the necessary tendency to pass from one qualitative state to another . . .
The logical thus reproduces the historical that is free of fortuity .
Engels stressed the agreement between the logical and the historical when proceeding from the abstract to the concrete .
He wrote : " The chain of thought must begin with the same thing with which this history begins , and its further course will be nothing else but the reflection of the historical course in abstract and theoretically consistent form ; a corrected reflection but corrected according to laws furnished by the real course of history itself . . .

WASHINGTON –
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's zigzagging and slips of the tongue , mainly on the Israeli - Palestinian issue , have been causing anger in the Middle East and complicating the peace process , sources in the White House told the New Republic magazine on Tuesday .
In May , Clinton revealed at a press conference that US President Barack Obama ’s call for an Israeli settlement freeze included any “ natural growth ” within existing settlements .
Two sources with detailed knowledge of the US - Israeli relationship told New Republic that the Obama team was not yet prepared to make public this departure from Bush - era policy .
Rather than leave his secretary of state twisting in the wind , one of the sources said , Obama wound up repeating her formulation a few days later , touching off months of tension with the Israelis .
Change of Mind ?
Clinton : Israel must do more on settlement issue News agencies US secretary of state moderates her praise for Jewish state 's offer to restrain , but not stop , its building of settlements in Palestinian areas Clinton : Israel must do more on settlement issue
saying that a proposal by the Netanyahu government that falls short of the freeze Obama has sought nevertheless amounts to an “ unprecedented ” concession by Israel .
The formulation – which infuriated Arab leaders and made it seem that Obama had surrendered to Netanyahu – had not been endorsed by the White House , which was not pleased with the statement .
Clinton was forced to " fold " immediately , stating several days later during a visit to Morocco that there was no change in the American policy .
It 's not her , it 's the advisors
White House officials believe that Clinton 's zigzagging reveals in public things which the American policy makers would rather say in closed talks .
Making public the American demand of Israel to stop the construction eventually sabotaged the US effort to bring the Palestinians to the negotiating table before Israel freezes the construction .
It also damaged Obama 's reliability among the Israelis .
The secretary of state 's second slip of the tongue , which expressed the American withdrawal from its demands on the settlement issue , after realizing that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would not be able to meet the demands , practically and politically .
According to the sources , the White House 's Middle East team was busy minimizing the damages Clinton had caused days after she had made the remarks .
Throughout her political career , Clinton has been considered a calculated , responsible person with a lot of knowledge on the matters under her responsibility .
The secretary of state is also considered a loveable personality , both in internal meetings and in meetings abroad , thanks to her personal charm and warmth .
These were he main reasons for Obama 's decision to appoint her as his secretary of state .
Therefore , it is unclear whether her remarks are made intentionally or are really slips of the tongue .
Sources involved in the State Department have a different opinion .
One of them told Ynet that Clinton 's zigzagging " is not her fault , but her assistants ' fault .
She receives contrasting advice before going to press conferences , and that 's the source of the problem .
She has to be smart enough to know what to do when she receives contrasting advice . "

What improvements , big or small , have made the greatest difference in your workspace health ?
Pass on the knowledge in the comments .
Washington ( CNN ) --
Health care reform backers won a key victory Saturday night as the Senate voted to move ahead with a floor debate on a sweeping $ 848 billion bill .
The 60 - 39 vote to prevent a Republican filibuster against the start of debate on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's legislation broke down along strict party lines .
All 58 Senate Democrats -- along with independent Sens. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- supported bringing the measure to the floor .
Thirty - nine of the 40 Senate Republicans opposed the motion .
Sen . George Voinovich , R - Ohio , did n't vote .
" Tonight 's historic vote brings us one step closer to ending insurance company abuses , reining in spiraling health care costs , providing stability and security to those with health insurance and extending quality health coverage to those who lack it , " White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said in a statement .
The polarized vote set the table for a holiday season now virtually certain to be marked by acrimonious deliberations on President Obama 's top domestic priority .
Top Senate Democrats , who are trying to pass a bill before the end of the year , spent much of the day tarring their Republican colleagues as defenders of a broken status quo benefitting rich insurance companies at the expense of ordinary American families .
Republicans , in turn , slammed Democrats for pushing a bill that conservatives insist will force millions of Americans to drop insurance plans they like while boosting premiums , raising taxes and leading to government rationing of care .
Read the health care bill ( PDF )
" Today we [ decide ] whether to even discuss one of the greatest issues of our generation , " Reid , a Nevada Democrat , said shortly before the vote .
" Whether this nation will finally guarantee its people the right to live free from fear of illness and death , which can be prevented by decent health care for all . "
The Republicans " are frightening people , " said Sen . Tom Harkin , D - Iowa .
" Now is not the time to go wobbly in the knees .
Now is the time to stand strong ... and move this country forward . "
" This bill ... is a massive monument to bureaucracy and spending , " replied Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Kentucky .
It " imposes punishing taxes on almost everyone .
...
A vote in favor of proceeding to this bill is a vote in favor of adding to the tax burden of the American people in the midst of double digit unemployment . "
The bill " does worse than nothing , " said Sen.
Chuck Grassley , R - Iowa .
It " threatens the economic recovery .
...
Changes to the health care system must be responsible and not break the backs of the taxpayers . "
The procedural vote represented another milestone in what has become an epic battle over the future of America 's health care system .
The House of Representatives narrowly passed a more than $ 1 trillion bill this month .
If the Senate also manages to pass a bill , a congressional conference committee will then need to merge the House and Senate proposals into a consensus version requiring final approval from each chamber before moving to Obama 's desk to be signed into law .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that Reid 's 2,074 - page bill would extend health insurance coverage to 31 million additional Americans .
The agency estimates that the proposal would reduce the federal deficit by $ 130 billion over the next 10 years , through 2019 .
Any effect on the deficit in the following decade would be " subject to substantial uncertainty , " but probably would result in " small reductions in federal budget deficits , " according to budget office analysts .
A minimum of 60 votes is required to break a filibuster in the 100 - member Senate .
The outcome of the Senate vote was unclear before Saturday afternoon , when Sen. Blanche Lincoln , D - Arkansas , announced her intention to back a floor debate on the measure .
Lincoln , a key moderate probably facing a tough re-election campaign in 2010 , said the issue deserved further debate and consideration .
She made clear , however , that she opposes several aspects of Reid 's bill , including a controversial government - run public option .
" Although I do n't agree with everything in this bill , I believe it is important to begin debate , " Lincoln said .
" The issue is very complex .
There is no easy fix . "
Republicans wasted no time tearing into Lincoln 's vote , issuing a news release while she was still announcing her decision , proclaiming that she had caved to " pressure from the left wing of her party . "
" There 's no doubt that this vote will be a critical issue for Sen .
Lincoln as she embarks on her uphill re-election bid , " said Amber Wilkerson Marchand , a GOP spokeswoman .
" The people of Arkansas will have an opportunity to hold her accountable when they cast their ballots next November . "
Two other Democratic moderates whose support was considered to be in doubt -- Nebraska 's Ben Nelson and Louisiana 's Mary Landrieu -- also announced their decision to back a full debate shortly before the vote .
Reid 's bill , projected to ensure coverage for 94 percent of Americans , includes a range of tax increases and new fees .
The Medicare payroll tax on individuals earning $ 200,000 a year and couples earning $ 250,000 a year would increase by half a percentage point , from the current 1.45 percent to 1.95 percent .
In addition , insurers providing costly health coverage -- known as Cadillac plans -- would face a 40 percent tax on policies worth more than $ 8,500 for individuals and $ 23,000 for families .
The bill also includes a 5 percent tax on the cost of elective cosmetic surgery , as well as new fees for insurers and pharmaceutical manufacturers .
The total projected revenue raised by all the taxes and fees would exceed $ 200 billion .
The bill would require individuals to buy health insurance , with a fine for non-compliance of $ 95 in the first year that would escalate to $ 750 by 2016 .
Unlike the plan recently passed by the House , the Senate bill does not mandate that all employers offer health care .
Businesses with more than 50 workers , where at least one employee qualifies for government subsidies , would face a penalty of $ 750 for every full - time employee if it does not offer health care coverage .
Reid 's bill also would expand government - run Medicaid coverage for the poor to everyone making less than 133 percent of the national poverty level .
Democratic leaders in both chambers have been wrestling with the most contentious issues , including abortion and immigration , as well as how to pay for reform .
The House bill has more restrictive abortion language and includes a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge on individuals making more than $ 500,000 and couples earning more than $ 1 million .
Both bills include a government - run public option , but the Senate version allows states to opt out before the national program would go into effect in 2014 .
The two bills are virtually identical on a broad range of changes , including creating health insurance exchanges , expanding Medicaid , subsidizing insurance for low - and some middle - income families , and capping out - of - pocket medical expenses while preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions .
Insurers under both plans would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person 's gender or medical history .
• Improve employer - based coverage for 452,000 residents .
• Provide credits to help pay for coverage for up to 153,000 households .
• Improve Medicare for 112,000 beneficiaries , including closing the prescription drug donut hole
for 12,200 seniors .
• Allow 16,700 small businesses to obtain affordable health care coverage and provide tax credits
to help reduce health insurance costs for up to 14,400 small businesses .
• Provide coverage for 51,000 uninsured residents .
• Protect up to 700 families from bankruptcy due to unaffordable health care costs .
• Reduce the cost of uncompensated care for hospitals and health care providers by $ 14 million .
Let 's not let this Republican off the hook .
Remember the name Joe Pitts , Republican Rep from PA - 16 .
On Saturday night , the House passed the Health Care plan with a narrow 220 to 215 majority .
Before passage , an amendment was added to the bill making it virtually impossible for private insurance companies that participate in the new system to offer abortion coverage to women .
This could have the affect of restricting women 's right to use even their own money to obtain coverage for abortion as a medical alternative .
The amendment passed by a vote of 240 - 194 with every single Republican and 64 Democrats forming the majority .
it remains to be seen if this amendment can be removed in the Senate bill or in a subsequent conference committee .
While our anger is rightly directed at the Blue Dog and anti-choice Democrats , lets not let the Republicans off the hook for their role in adding a prohibition of funding for abortion in private as well as public plans .
Let 's remember that 176 Republicans including some who call themselves pro-choice , helped to add the amendment to the Health bill .
It serves progressive interests to hold Republicans accountable especially in districts where pro-choice progressive champions are ready to run effective campaigns against the Republicans .
While we challenge Blue Dog Democrats in 2010 , let 's keep our eye on Republican held seats where there is an opportunity to turn a district from Republican to progressive Democrat .
The restrictive abortion amendment was co-sponsored by Bart Stupak Democrat of Michigan and Joe Pitts , Republican from Pennsylvania .
Joe Pitts led the fight on the floor for the Republican side while Stupak rounded up the Democrats .
In the week leading up to the vote he spoke at Michelle Bachman 's rally at the Capitol .
You may never have heard of Representative Joe Pitts .
He represents the 16th district in southeastern Pennsylvania and is seeking an 8th term in 2010 .
Pitts is a hard - line Republican right winger from the an area of Pennsylvania known better for its Amish farmers and farmland .
The district has had a registered Republican majority until this year when registration fell under 50 % .
Election statistics are changing .
In the 2008 election , President Obama received 48 % of the vote an astonishing increase over Kerry 's 38 % total in 2004 .
The district is moving away from the politics of Joe Pitts .
In addition to his strong opposition to women 's rights , Pitts voted against increasing the minimum wage , expanding SCHIP , against expanding protection for LGBT members in the workplace , and against the hate crimes bill .
He opposes the Employee Free Choice Act , supports the Don't Ask do n't Tell policy , opposes changes in environmental policy , in other words a hard right Republican who is financed by corporate and right wing interests .
And women are n't the only ones he seems eager to prevent from getting health care .
Fanatically opposed to meaningful health care reform , the bill that Pitts voted again Saturday night would have done a great deal for the residents of PA - 16 :
In 2010 there is a choice in PA 16 .
Lois Herr is the Democratic candidate in the district and she has exact opposite positions to those offered by Pitts .
She has fought for women 's rights and progressive issues her whole life .
Herr is not afraid to say she is prochoice and that she will lead the fight not only for women 's health but for progressive health care reform .
Herr supports single payer or a strong public option .
Lois is a native of the district .
She has been an executive , a farmer , a teacher , a leader of the Democratic party and in many community based organizations .
She has written two books , the latest dedicated to her father who was a loved coach at Elizabethtown College .
I 've known Lois for over 30 years .
When she worked for Bell Labs in Illinois and I lived in Chicago , and we worked together in the National Organization For Women , fighting for employment rights , reproductive rights and the Equal Rights Amendment .
She organized women to fight for equal justice inside AT & T.Lois is running in a district that is not yet targeted by national organizations .
It is a district moving toward progressive politics .
It needs our help getting there .
Our community investing in this district would help expose the Pitts record , build progressive organizing and yes , winning a new member of Congress in 2010 .
So often when a district goes from Republican to Democrat we find ourselves with a Blue Dog .
Not in this district , Lois is a progressive .
Please consider helping her through ActBlue , especially if you 'd like to send Joe Pitts a message , a retirement message .
Most Americans never heard of The Family until John Ensign 's sexscapades wound up on the front pages of the nation 's newspapers .
It 's a bizarre religionist cult with immense political power and , predictably , Joe Pitts is a member .
( Stupak is still denying he 's also a member . )
The best information about Pitts ' extremist cult can be found in Jeff Sharlet 's startling and disturbing book , The Family , The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power

Tatsumaki , my tiny Perl port of Tornado using Plack and AnyEvent originally started as a proof of concept to test and demonstrate PSGI 's streaming interface but its chat app using a simple long - poll Comet got a lot of attentions from people :
Audrey Tang used the MessageQueue and comet interface to build multi-person SocialCalc , Daisuke Maki packaged the chat app , gugod is building an iPhone IRC client and jshirley is doing some interesting to stream content with YUI .
Actually , by " tiny port " I mean Tatsumaki does most of the things Tornado does , but in a very limited but simple way : simple embedded Perl templates , non-blocking I/O for everything including built - in HTTP clients , long - poll Comet ready MessageQueue API , simple server side push ( aka firehose ) and Digg 's multipart XHR push as a Comet replacement .
Yes , it is really simple but exciting :)
I really did n't want to increase the number of modules / applications i maintain but now it has proven very useful when last night I wrote a new PubSubHubbub hub Subfeedr using Tatsumaki , Plack , AnyEvent and Redis in 3 hours : it 's a polling PuSH proxy and everything works in the single process in the event loop non-blockingly ( so nice ) .
So anyway , it 's now on CPAN as well as on github , which makes it a little harder for me to change APIs and what not , but no worries , everything is undocumented , so you still have to peek at the code to do what you want to do :)

The average price of a PC fell to $ 761 in the first half of this year , according to research firm Gartner .
DIRT CHEAP PCS DIRT CHEAP PCS With Microsoft 's new Windows 7 operating system due Oct. 22 , PC prices have never been lower .
Which raises the question :
If you 're in the market for a new PC , should you wait for the software giant to roll out the latest version of its dominant computer operating system ?
Probably , say PC industry analysts .
Any favorable pricing wo n't get much cheaper , " And we do n't expect to see any price increases as Windows 7 comes on board , " says Stephen Baker , analyst at The NPD Group .
If you do find an irresistible deal on a Windows Vista machine , do n't worry .
Microsoft is making Windows 7 upgrades for little to no cost for most recently purchased Vista PCs , Microsoft 's current operating system .
Either way , you 'll get a hefty PC that 's dirt cheap by historical standards .
The average price of a PC ( both desktops and laptops ) hit $ 761 in the first half of this year , down from $ 941 in 2008 ; it was $ 1,364 in 2003 , according to research firm Gartner .
That 's because U.S. households , with an average of 2.5 PCs , are saturated with technology , and the economy remains soft .
Consumers are n't willing to shell out big bucks , says Baker , which explains the surging popularity of pint - size netbooks .
In this environment , PC makers and major retailers have had to get smarter about managing inventories .
Several big vendors cut back on the number of Vista PCs they usually order from Asian factories in July and August to clear the decks for PCs with Windows 7 , says IDC analyst Jay Chou .
No. 2 PC maker Dell has been keeping merchants in step via collaborative planning programs that manage inventory flows on a weekly basis , says Michael Tatelman , Dell 's consumer business vice president .
Best Buy has a team of experts assigned to tweak inventory constantly , says Jason Bonfig , vice president of notebooks .
Best Buy 's inventory specialists are now riveted on making sure the Windows 7 rollout goes smoothly .
" We 've committed a lot of time and effort to getting this right , " Bonfig says .
All of this means PC pricing is likely to remain more or less stable .
" The economic environment has made PC suppliers more cautious with inventory levels , so the bargains are less prevalent , " says Gartner analyst Charles Smulders .
Still , the bargains are out there .
Hewlett - Packard is offering up to 60 % off clearance models at hpdirect.com .
Costco 's average PC prices are down from a year ago , and sales are up .
The warehouse retailer plans to remain aggressive on pricing through year 's end , says Tim Farmer , Costco 's vice president of merchandising .
" It should be a very strong computer season through the fall . "

Kamui Kobayashi says he feels ready to make his grand prix debut at this weekend 's Brazilian Grand Prix , although the Japanese admits it will not be an easy task .
Kobayashi will be racing for the Toyota team at Interlagos after it was discovered Timo Glock had a crack vertebrae following his crash at the Japanese Grand Prix , where the German was unable to race .
The Japanese driver already replaced Glock in practice at Suzuka , which means he has some experience with this year 's car .
" This is an incredible opportunity for me to make my Grand Prix debut but of course it is a pity for Timo as I know how much he was looking forward to getting back to racing , " said Kobayashi in a team preview .
" Fortunately for me I had some time in the car on Friday in Suzuka and , even though that was in the wet , it will be very helpful for me this weekend .
I have never driven at Interlagos before but I know the layout from computer games and television so I do n't think it will take too long to learn .
" It 's going to be a tough weekend but I feel ready for the challenge and I know the team is supporting me 100 % .
" A few days ago I was n't even expecting to be racing this weekend so it 's impossible to set any targets .
I just want to do myself proud and complete the race without any problems ; anything after that is a bonus . "
Team - mate Jarno Trulli is also hopeful for the Interlagos race , where he is hoping to do well again after his second - place finish at Suzuka .
" Toyota has usually been quite strong at Interlagos and I 've generally been very quick there too so I 'm hopeful that will be the case again this year , " he said .
" It was fantastic to be on the podium in the last race , especially in front of all our Japanese supporters , and I hope to be fighting at the front again this weekend .
" Last year I was on the front row in Brazil and I believe this year 's car will also be quite well suited to the track so I am optimistic .
I am determined to end the season as we started it ; on a high note . "
GENEVA , Switzerland , Nov. 23 ( UPI ) -- Physicists at the Large Hadron Collider , located underground near the French - Swiss border , say proton beams have collided for the first time in the machine .
The scientists told the BBC the event occurred Monday as two beams were circulated simultaneously around the 16 - mile - long ringed tunnel that 's located nearly 330 feet beneath the ground in Switzerland .

When fully operational , the LHC will smash together numerous beams of protons to shed light on what conditions existed in the universe less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang .
" It 's a great achievement to have come this far in so short a time , " Rolf Heuer , director of the European Organization for Nuclear Research , told the BBC .
" But we need to keep a sense of perspective -- there 's still much to do before we can start the LHC physics program . "
The LHC is the world 's largest machine .
HTC U 11 is one of the next flagship phones that got everybody ’s attention recently .
Judging by some recent benchmarks that got published on Geekbench , it is going to be a handset to kill for once it gets unveiled on May 16 .
Benchmark Specs
The device that got to light there is featured under the name HTC CBP and it obtained interesting scores : 1912 for a single core performance and 6137 for the multi-core one .
These results place the phone on the same rank with the S8 and S8 Plus devices released by Samsung .
The posting has shown that it will run on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor , together with 4 GB RAM and the latest Android Nougat 7.1.1 .
All these specs seem to confirm all the rumors we have been recently hearing , so this is all the more reason to believe that this is indeed the HTC U 11 .
New Features
HTC itself teased a new feature that they are going to implement for the HTC U 11 .
The new feature seems to be a new squeeze control , which allows you to hold the sides of your devices and gripthem in order to scroll through menus or to make selections .
People also expect the company to make some significant improvements to the audio hardware that should be built in .
According to other rumors that are going around , the device will feature a 5.5 inches screen and perhaps we might even see a secondary display .
In fact , the secondary display was also present on the HTC U Ultra device that was presented earlier this year .
However , there are no details about these speculations on the Geekbench device log .
Even so , we know for sure that the team will need to bring something unique and impressive if they want to gain success with their new model .
Why am I publishing an anarchist review of books ?
This is certainly a reasonable question .
After all , there are a few out there , and several major anarchist publications have extensive review sections .
But they generally limit themselves to reviewing specifically political ( mostly anarchist ) books , as if anarchists had only a single interest .
But anarchists are not mere political animals .
I was attracted to anarchist perspectives due to my hatred of politics and my desire to grasp the fullness of my life as my own .
Thus , I do n’t just read political texts , but rather a wide variety of books on every topic : history , philosophy , art , science , travel and so on .
In addition , I read poetry and fiction .
As a critical reader , I can find ways to use the contents of these books to expand my understanding of the reality I am facing and to sharpen my critique both theoretically and practically .
I also tend to like to do things my own way .
So , though I am willing to write reviews for other people 's projects , I also like to have my own space where I do n’t have to answer to anyone and can feel free to wander down whatever paths of passion , convoluted reason , poetic reverie , sarcasm and humor I like .
There is so much to explore , so many tools , toys and weapons to discover …
My own anarchist perspectives could be categorized as “ post - left ” , anti-political , non-primitivist anti-civilization , insurrectionary and egoist .
From the Armchair is certain to reflect this .
But I have no interest in feeding sectarian dogmatism .
I do n’t need to set up a personal political cult for myself in order to figure out who I do and do n’t want to be involved with ( and I have learned all too well that in this world where most people just have opinions and beliefs , not living ideas in conflict with what exists , the fact that someone talks with words like mine does n’t mean that I want to have anything to do with them ) .
As in the world in general , so among anarchists , there are for too many parrot - like fools whose words are empty of meaning .
I have nothing to say to them .
I would rather talk with genuine rebels against the ruling order , whatever color or shape their rebellion may take .
So the central aim of this review is to make more tools available to anarchists of all sorts in their project of taking back their lives through the revolutionary destruction of the ruling order .
And the armchair where I sit and read is also one of my weapons .
Everything on this site is anti-copyright .
Feel free to use it as you see fit .
Apple today announced that Google CEO Eric Schmidt has resigned from Apple 's Board of Directors due to increasing competition between the two companies and its impact on his effectiveness as an Apple Board member .
" Eric has been an excellent Board member for Apple , investing his valuable time , talent , passion and wisdom to help make Apple successful , " said Steve Jobs , Apple 's CEO .
" Unfortunately , as Google enters more of Apple 's core businesses , with Android and now Chrome OS , Eric 's effectiveness as an Apple Board member will be significantly diminished , since he will have to recuse himself from even larger portions of our meetings due to potential conflicts of interest .
Therefore , we have mutually decided that now is the right time for Eric to resign his position on Apple 's Board . "
Following Google 's announcement of Chrome OS last month , Schmidt acknowledged that he would discuss the future of his role with Apple .
Even before the Chrome OS announcement , the U.S Federal Trade Commission had begun taking an interest in the apparent close ties between Apple and Google .
At that time , both Schmidt and former Genentech CEO Arthur Levinson held positions on both companies ' Boards of Directors .
Levinson continues to hold Board positions with both companies .
When most people think of testosterone , words like “ aggression , ” “ dominance , ” and “ violence ” usually come to mind .
Those words are memetically linked with testosterone the way “ expensive ” is linked with diamonds , and most of us have adopted the linkage without thinking much about it .
Collectively , we ’ve adopted a “ folk hypothesis ” about testosterone–a generalized presupposition grounded in folk wisdom assumed to be correct .
What makes folk hypotheses noteworthy is that they ’re hard to challenge– not because they are fact - based , but because they are so deeply entrenched in collective thinking .
So I was intrigued to come across a study in the journal Nature that takes on the testosterone folk hypothesis directly , and also manages to illustrate something important about the power of belief .
A fair amount of evidence has surfaced that testosterone is a key ingredient in social relations , not by increasing , but by decreasing conflict .
With that in mind , researchers wanted to know what would happen if they gave a group of female subjects a sublingual dose of testosterone before playing the ultimatum game ( the bargaining game in which one subject must negotiate with another about how to divide a sum of money .
If an agreement is reached , both parties get the money as agreed .
If an agreement is n’t reached , neither get the money ) .
The subjects were not told whether they were receiving a placebo or true testosterone , only that they were getting a dose that could be either .
The folk hypothesis about testosterone predicts that it will increase unfair bargaining by making one of the parties more conflictual and less willing to negotiate .
In the ultimatum game , unfair bargaining means offering significantly less than 50 % of the sum .
Typically if less than 50 % is offered , the other party will not agree because he or she would rather that neither party receive the money than accept the indignity of being treated unfairly .
If someone with a testosterone boost is experiencing heightened feelings of dominance and aggression , it makes sense that fairness would n’t be top of mind .
The results , however , were exactly the opposite .
Overall , those subjects that actually did receive testosterone were not less fair but significantly more fair in their dealings .
So much for the folk hypothesis .
But that result , though compelling , is not the most telling part of this study .
After the games were played , researchers asked the subjects if they believed they had received a dose of testosterone or a placebo .
Subjects who believed they were receiving a dose of testosterone , whether they actually did or not , acted the part .
Thinking they were negotiating under the influence of a notorious hormone , their bargaining behavior followed suit and was significantly less fair than that of those who thought they had only received a placebo .
So as much as this study showed that the folk hypothesis about testosterone is flawed , it also showed that belief is a powerful enough agent to induce effects presumed to be true .
It ’s even more powerful than the infamous chemical in question .
Time and time again , belief proves itself the strongest bully on the cognitive block .

The interconnected web of our friends , family , neighbors and acquaintances may dominate our lives more than we know .
They 've always been there , making up our social support systems .
But now , largely thanks to the burgeoning popularity of online social networks like Facebook , researchers are discovering what a powerful influence our connections — both online and off — really have over our lives .
" Those of us who study social networks believe they matter — that things do spread along social networks , " says Claude Fischer , a sociology professor at the University of California - Berkeley .
Because social networks online are much more clearly defined than offline connections , they have been a boon to researchers .
And studies are finding that despite dire predictions from naysayers who warned that spending too much time online would be damaging to real - life relationships , the opposite appears to be true .
The findings , trickling in from early research , suggest health and psychological benefits for those who " friend " and are " friended . "
But as with all new media , critics say it 's much too soon to know about all the possible long - term effects online social networking might have — from growing obesity and musculoskeletal problems to loss of privacy and overwhelming commercialism .
" Social networking sites have brought social networks into people 's consciousness , " says Barry Wellman , a sociologist at the University of Toronto in Canada who started analyzing social networks in the 1960s and has expanded his studies to online .
For the most part , being part of a social network is good for you , research suggests .
For example , a study in this month 's Scientific American Mind finds that social support and social networking offer benefits , from additional resilience to greater life satisfaction to reducing the risk of health problems .
Other studies in the past two years have found that feeling like a part of a larger group helps in stroke recovery and memory retention and boosts overall well - being .
" In many ways , human beings behave like flocks of birds or schools of fish , " says Nicholas Christakis , a physician and Harvard University sociologist who is co-author of a new book , Connected : The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives , out today .
" So many things we normally think of as individualistic — like what our body size is , or what we think about a political topic , or whether we are happy — are actually collective phenomena , " says Christakis , 47 .
Whether they 're face - to - face or virtual , social networks influence human behavior and shape everything from finances to the way people vote , say Christakis and co-author James Fowler , a social scientist at the University of California - San Diego .
The authors suggest that the world is governed by what they call " three degrees of influence " — that is , your friend 's friend 's friend , most likely someone you do n't even know — who indirectly influences your actions and emotions .
For example , when a friend starts exercising more , " I change my mind about how much I should be exercising or I share stories with my other friends who are influenced to do the same .
You either change your behavior or you transmit information about the behavior to others , who change their behavior , " says Fowler , 39 .
Their studies , published since 2007 , have suggested that happiness is similarly " contagious , " and so is obesity and quitting smoking .
But not everyone agrees .
Papers co-written by economist Jason Fletcher , an assistant professor at the Yale University School of Public Health in New Haven , Conn. , have tried to replicate it for conditions that do not appear to be within a person 's control , including acne , height and headaches .
" If you use their method on health outcomes you think are n't contagious , you will get contagion because of the limitations of their method , " he says .
Christakis says they do n't always find contagion , such as happiness between co-workers .
And he says other researchers have replicated their findings .
Much of the work by Christakis and Fowler is based on research using the Framingham Heart Study , a key group of 5,124 adults within a larger network of 12,067 people in Framingham , Mass .
Each had an average of 10.4 ties to others — totaling 53,228 ties .
" We 're able to trace the flow of influence using mathematical tools from person to person to person , and you can see it spreading through the network and reaching you , " Christakis says .
' The nature of the beast '
Among those concerned about the Internet 's effect on relationships are Michael Bugeja , director of the Greenlee School of Journalism and Communication at Iowa State University , and author of the 2005 book Interpersonal Divide : The Search for Community in a Technological Age .
Although he maintains a Facebook page that he says he checks for about 20 minutes a week , " because you have to know the nature of the beast , " Bugeja says his concerns have only increased .
" Most of the studies that have been done have been biased from the start , " he says .
And now , his unease is focused more on the social networking sites themselves , saying it 's time to " step back from the hype about social networks " and look at the question from a computer science perspective .
" They are essentially data mining what you are putting on that page , " he says .
" The application is not programmed to bring you a friend .
The application is programmed to make money , and they make money by data mining and by selling virtual ads . "
He 's also troubled because he says educators are shortchanging kids by not warning them about the potential dangers , including Facebook addiction .
The first U.S. residential treatment center for Internet addiction opened this summer in Washington state .
" Unless we cover both sides of social networks and the Internet , all we 're doing is helping the revenue generation of these pre-programmed technologies , " Bugeja says .
Wellman , whose research points to positive outcomes for social networking sites , nevertheless shares the concern about privacy .
" I analyzed my ( Twitter ) followers and was amazed at what you can find out about me and who my networks are with .
You ca n't escape your past .
That 's a real danger of social networking sites , " he says .
Nancy Baym , an associate professor of communication studies at the University of Kansas in Lawrence , suggests that at least when it comes to relationship effects , fears are not backed up by the research so far .
" There 's not compelling evidence that spending time on social networking sites and expanding our social circles damages the close relationships we have , " she says .
" People think if you 're hanging out on Facebook , you 're not having quality face - to - face time .
That is not supported . "
Measuring friendships Sociologist Duncan Watts , a research scientist at Yahoo !
Research in New York City , says social networking sites are for the first time giving us a way to measure our friendships .
" The perception is you have a lot more friends than you used to .
All these not - real friends you have on Facebook — you had them before , you just did n't count them , " he says .
" A lot of this is the measurement effect .
We can measure things we could n't measure before , and that changes our perception . "
A study co-written by Wellman , to appear next year in the journal American Behavioral Scientist , finds that heavy Internet users have the most friends , both offline and online .
" In general , Internet users do not have fewer offline friends than non-users , " the study says .
" The more people are online , the more they are relating to everyone else , " he says .
The study of 1,178 adults ages 25 to 74 is based on data collected at the Center for the Digital Future at the University of Southern California in 2002 and 2007 .
In both years , the study found adults on average had about 10 friends they meet or speak with at least weekly and a few additional friends who are online only , or who began friendships online and then met in person .
" The mythology we have is that people used to spend whole days hanging around community — like the bar at Cheers , " Wellman says .
" They did n't .
They stayed home .
If we switch from television to social networking sites , it 's a switch toward sociability — not away from it . "
Research by social psychologist Robert Kraut , a professor of human - computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , published last year in the journal Information , Communication & Society , found that those who used the Internet to meet people online more than to communicate with friends and family increased their depression and feelings of isolation .
But research has shown that most people communicate online with someone they already know — and those who did that actually reduced depression , the study found .
" The Internet in general seems to be taking time away from TV watching , but we do n't know in particular about these social networking sites , which themselves are social activities , " Kraut says .
Jeri Saper , 52 , of Austin is a fully immersed user of Twitter and Facebook , on both her computer and her phone .
" I definitely feel more connected to people , " she says .
" But I 'm more connected to people I had n't had close ties with for a long time .
It does not make me closer to the people I 'm already close friends with . "
People are reorganizing their lives to expand their communication media , says Keith Hampton , an assistant professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia .
" We 're not replacing everyday personal social networks with everyday online social networks , " he says .
" That 's not the way it works .
We 're not substituting online for offline .
We 're augmenting . "
Wellman , who more than 30 years ago founded the professional society for the field of social network analysis , agrees .
" We have more means of being in touch , and we seem to be using all of them . "

This is n't the first time Christmas lights have met Guitar Hero on the pages of Gizmodo , but this former Disney employee 's efforts are definitely the best use of the game that I 've ever seen .

Interview With the Guitar Hero Christmas Lights Guys ( With Bonus Videos ) Giz :
How did you come up with this idea ?
For several years , Kyle has done an automated Christmas … Read more
Using 21,268 lights and LEDs , ex-Disney imagineer and special effects specialist Ric Turner turned the front of his house into the perfect setting for a Guitar Hero Christmas lights spectacular .

As he explains :
Christmas Light Hero is using 7 light controllers from Light - O - Rama built from kits to control 21,268 lights and LEDs .
Each controller has 16 outputs and 2 - 3 TTL level control inputs that are used by the game system to fire different programmed light sequences depending on what happens in the game .
It relies on the fact that the game sequence is very consistent .
If the game and the lighting sequences start together , they will stay in very good sync through the length of the song .
The light program allows branching and overlays for fail , star power and " ready . "
I have some ideas to automate the initial show / game sync , but for now you have to push doorbell buttons at the right moments .

Can someone please explain why Mr. Bove noted on CNBC that Wells Fargo is proving " itself to be a standout " in the banking industry ( 2:30 into the clip ) , that it " would help push the market higher , " and that is it the big winner in today 's earnings derby , a mere nine hours before he ends up downgrading the company to a SELL ?
Perhaps , the SEC can advise on that particular conundrum .
Jon Ostendorff reports for the Asheville Citizen - Times that the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigations ’ senior polygraph examiner , Special Agent Chris Smith , who supervises all the Bureau ’s polygraphers , was arrested and charged with assault in August 2009 .
Smith is currently free on $ 200,000 bond :
SYLVA — The State Bureau of Investigation ’s top polygraph agent is charged with assaulting a man suspected of molesting a child in Jackson County .
The SBI put Special Agent Chris Smith on administrative duty Sept. 8 while internal affairs investigators looked into allegations that he pushed Whittier resident Kenneth Rhinehart into a wall , a spokeswoman for the agency said Monday .
He remains on that assignment , which means he can’t participate in investigations .
His court date is scheduled for Dec. 1 .
The agency gave its report on the incident to District Attorney Michael Bonfoey in October .
The state assigned Cleveland County District Attorney Rick Shaffer to handle the prosecution after Bonfoey recused his office because it has worked closely with Smith as a police witness in the past .
The allegation could have ramifications in other sex crimes cases in Jackson County , where Smith performed lie -detector tests .
He is the SBI ’s polygraph coordinator , overseeing all of the state ’s lie detector agents .
He has been with the agency since 1997 .
One defense attorney has asked the state for information about Smith ’s credibility as a witness .
Another has asked the state to continue his client ’s case , saying he is expecting investigative material on the interrogation of witnesses .
Smith did not immediately respond to a message left at his office in Asheville .
Rhinehart did not immediately respond to a message .
Rhinehart swore out the misdemeanor charge before Magistrate A.O. Reagan , who issued a criminal summons for Smith on Nov. 5 .
The warrant alleges that Smith on April 23 assaulted Rhinehart by “ grabbing ( him ) with his hands , pulling him out of a chair and pushing him into a wall . ”
The court papers do n’t say why the two men were together that day .
Reagan declined to discuss the reason he issued the warrant .
Rhinehart is charged with first - degree sex offense on a girl younger than 13 between January 2006 and March 2008 who was living in his home at the time .
He was arrested in August and released on $ 200,000 bond .
Part of Smith ’s duties , according to court papers , is to perform lie - detector exams on suspects for law enforcement agencies across the state .
Shaffer said he is reviewing the file and will either try the case or dismiss it .
There ’s a number of options for distributed processing and mapreduce in python .
Before execnet surfaced , I ’d been using Disco to do distributed NLTK .
Now that I ’ve happily switched to distributed NLTK with execnet , I can explain some of the differences and why execnet is so much better for my purposes .
Disco Overhead
Disco is a mapreduce framework for python , with an erlang core .
This is very cool , but unfortunately introduces overhead costs when your functions are not pure ( meaning they require external code and / or data ) .
And part of speech tagging with NLTK is definitely not pure ; the map function requires a part of speech tagger in order to do anything .
So to use a part of speech tagger within a Disco map function , it must be loaded inline , which means unpickling the object before doing any work .
And since a pickled part of speech tagger can easily exceed 500 K , unpickling it can take over 2 seconds .
When every map call has a fixed overhead of 2 seconds , your mapreduce task can take orders of magnitude longer to complete .
As an example , let ’s say you need to do 6000 map calls , at 1 second of pure computation each .
That ’s 100 minutes , not counting overhead .
Now add in the 2s fixed overhead on each call , and you ’re at 300 minutes .
What should be just over 1.6 hours of computation has jumped to 5 hours .
Execnet FTW
execnet provides a very different computational model : start some gateways and communicate thru message channels .
In my case , all the fixed overhead can be done up - front , loading the part of speech tagger once per gateway , resulting in greatly reduced compute times .
I did have to change my old Disco based code to work with execnet , but I actually ended up with less code that ’s easier to understand .
Conclusion
If you ’re just doing pure mapreduce computations , then consider using Disco .
After the one time setup ( which can be non-trivial ) , writing the functions will be relatively easy , and you ’ll get a nice web UI for configuration and monitoring .
But if you ’re doing any dirty operations that need expensive initialization procedures , or ca n’t quite fit what you need into a pure mapreduce framework , then execnet is for you .
In an Italian court , a murderer has just had his sentence reduced because the judge agreed that the man 's genes predisposed him to violent behavior .
Abdelmalek Bayout , an Algerian immigrant to Italy , admitted to stabbing and killing Walter Felipe Novoa Perez , a Colombian , when the two men got in a fight over the kohl eye make - up that Bayout was wearing .
At trial , the defense team argued that Bayout was mentally ill at the time of the murder ; the judge agreed that his psychiatric condition was a mitigating factor , and gave him a reduced sentence of 9 years .
But at an appeal hearing , Bayout 's lawyers argued that his sentence should be shortened further based not just on psychiatric evaluations , but also brain scans and genetic testing .
Pietro Pietrini , a molecular neuroscientist who worked on the new evaluations , explains that the brain scans showed abnormalities , and the genetic test revealed irregularities in five genes that have been linked to aggressive behavior .
One of those genes codes for an enzyme called MAOA , which helps control the levels of certain brain chemicals .
Previous studies have
found low levels of MAOA expression to be associated with aggressiveness and criminal conduct of young boys raised in abusive environments .
In the report , [ the researchers ] concluded that Bayout 's genes would make him more prone to behaving violently if provoked .
" There 's increasing evidence that some genes together with a particular environmental insult may predispose people to certain behaviour , " says Pietrini [ Nature News ] .
Based on this evidence , the appeals court judge knocked another year off of Bayout 's sentence .
But many scientists say that singling out a few genes from a person 's vast genome tells you very little about their complete biochemical makeup .
In addition to questions of the genetic tests ' scientific relevance , bioethics experts also say that our society has n't yet decided to what extent criminal behavior can be excused by biology .
Some worry that cases like Bayout's
could lead to the acceptance of genetic determinism — the idea that genes determine the behaviour of an organism — in criminal cases .
" 90 % of all murders are committed by people with a Y chromosome — males .
Should we always give males a shorter sentence ? " says geneticist Steve Jones [ Nature News ]
.
Others note that from such a legal precedent , it 's a small step towards preemptively labeling someone " bad " because of their genes .
Gattica , anyone ?

*** Update ***: Ray Comfort has agreed to do an email interview for this site .
Please leave your questions in the comments and I ’ll pass them along to him .
…
Ray Comfort lied about when he would be distributing his anti-evolution version of On the Origin of Species on college campuses .
He had said he would be doing the deed today .
But ….
We had a change of plans .
We went in on the 18th .
Was it pre-planned or a last - second change ?
I do n’t know .
This really should n’t have been a surprise since Comfort distorts the truth for a living .
In any case , copies of his book are out and we ’ve learned quite a bit :
…
It seems he ( and his followers ) appeared at number of campuses which were not on his original list of 50 schools .
…
The font size of Comfort ’s section is far larger than Darwin ’s words :
Is it significant ?
Not necessarily , but there ’s no reason you could n’t have kept the same font size throughout .
The only reason I can think of to increase the font for Comfort ’s section is so it stretches to 50 + pages .
…
Comfort included several pictures in his section of the book .
The single picture that Darwin included in his original version of On the Origin of Species was omitted .
…
Many of the Secular Student Alliance ‘s affiliates had planned counter - events to this campaign .
The date change meant some groups had to either revise their plans or hold their activities a day later .
So I ’m particularly pleased with the SSA ’s press release regarding this issue :
“ We ’re sorry that Mr. Comfort felt he had to mislead everyone just to avoid the counter - efforts of our campus groups , ” said August Brunsman , Executive Director of the Secular Student Alliance .
“ Apparently he thought his deception would only work if nobody was around to tell the truth ” … …
In an attempt to prevent the ministry from tricking college students , the Secular Student Alliance national office assisted affiliated college groups to schedule protests , host speakers , write letters to the editor , show films , and distribute the original version of Darwin ’s 150 - year old masterpiece .
Their plans will go forward despite Comfort ’s sudden , unexplained change of dates .
The Secular Student Alliance has collected resources to counter Living Waters ’ efforts at http://www.secularstudents.org/originintoschools.
“ The best way to defeat misinformation is with education , ” said Brunsman .
“ We would have loved to have a peaceful exchange of ideas with the ministry , but we ’ll settle for having the last word in students ’ minds . ”
…
Some people , like Atticus Hannah , found ways to pick up several copies of the book :
I set out to do all I could to keep this immorality away from youngling college students .
So I put on my hat , grabbed two bags , tossed on a sweatshirt and headed out to the Ray Comfort people handing out free books at the U .
I walked past the first group of people and got a book .
I walked past the second group , got a book .
I walked past the third group , got a book .
Fourth group , book .
Fifth , book .
Then I doubled around , took off my sweatshirt and hat , and repeated … I walked away with 22 books .
One of which is actually for one of my roommates , one of which is for me .
Stitch , in the picture , is posing with all 22 of them .
…
Even some Christians are embarrassed by Comfort :
So , congrats to you Ray Comfort .
You have truly surpassed all previous Attie award winners .
You have publically slandered a man ( Darwin ) , you have made all Christians look like ignorant boobs , and worst of all , you have caused people to question the validity of Christ through your dishonesty .
You were in the zone today , my friend .
…
This just creeps me out … ( with Spencer Fern , secretary of the [ UCLA ] Bruin Alliance of Skeptics and Secularists secretary ) .

Any other thoughts ?
CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) --
Authorities arrested a man accused of secretly taping ESPN sports reporter Erin Andrews in the nude and posting the videos on the Internet , the FBI said Friday .
ESPN reporter Erin Andrews claims someone videotaped her while she was nude and posted video online .
Authorities arrested 48 - year - old Michael David Barrett at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Friday .
Barrett faces a charge of interstate stalking , the FBI said .
Barrett is accused of taping Andrews while she was nude in two hotel rooms .
He then made eight videos that he posted on the Internet , the FBI said .
Barrett allegedly filmed seven of the eight videos at a hotel room in Nashville , Tennessee , in September 2008 .
FBI agents said they found evidence that a peephole to the door of Andrews ' hotel room had been altered .
The FBI learned that Barrett checked into the same hotel at that time and asked for a room adjacent to Andrews using his home address to register for the room .
According to a criminal complaint , Barrett tried to sell the videos to celebrity gossip Web site TMZ.com .
Employees at the Web site also helped in the investigation providing Barrett 's information to Andrews ' attorney .
Andrews works as a sideline reporter traveling around the country covering college football games .
Barrett will have his first court appearance in Chicago at 10 a.m. ( 11 a.m. ET ) Saturday , authorities said .
The maximum penalty for the charge of interstate stalking is five years in federal prison , the FBI said .
CNN 's Greg Morrison contributed to this report .
All About Erin Andrews
Those people who can't " swallow " ecology unless it 's served with a sugary coating of optimism do n't generally appreciate what Dr. Garrett Hardin has to say .
You see , this University of California ( Santa Barbara ) biologist seems to have a penchant for tackling the most controversial subjects around — such as human overpopulation , abortion , and evolution — and his conclusions are often intended to shock people into realizing that there are few , if any , easy answers to the question of human survival on an increasingly overcrowded and ecologically ravaged earth .
Though Hardin 's career has spanned a third of a century ( and shows no signs of slowing down yet ) , it was n't until December 13 , 1968 — when his revolutionary article , " The Tragedy of the Commons , " was published in Science magazine — that he achieved a position of prominence ( some would say of notoriety ) among American ecologists .
That single essay ( subtitled " The population problem has no technical solution ... it requires a fundamental extension in morality " ) raised a number of topics that are being hotly debated to this day .
Many other publications have followed the 1968 landmark article ( Hardin has a authored or coauthored upward of a dozen books that are now in print ) , and there is a unifying theme that runs through all of these works :
It is time for humanity to plan for the future and to abandon many of our present political and social policies ... courses of action that the ecologist compares to " a man [ jumping ] off the World Trade Building with a bag of hardware in the hope that he [ will ] figure out how to build a parachute on the way down . "
What exactly is the " tragedy of the Commons " ?
How does our established morality — especially in the form of humanitarianism — lead to further overpopulation and ecological disaster ?
Is it , in fact time for the ' ' rich " nations of the world to decide which poor countries will be given enough aid to survive , and which must be left to the fates dictated by their deforested and hopelessly over - crowded lands ' ?
MOTHER EARTH NEWS felt that her readers deserved answers to these questions , especially if those explanations could come from Hardin himself , a man who possesses ( in Paul Ehrlich 's words ) " one of the most analytical minds " among living biologists .
So staffer Bruce Woods visited Garrett Hardin ( in the scientist 's southern California home .
The discussion that took place during their meeting — presented here in edited form — may , at times , anger you .
But it might also cause you to think about the changing demands of human responsibility in our finite world .
PLOWBOY : Dr. Hardin , your writings — which have caused some people to refer to you as the " black sheep " of American biology — often demonstrate a clear understanding of the capabilities , and limits , of the land that feeds us all .
Would I be correct in assuming that you were raised in a rural environment ?
HARDIN : You could say that , although I was actually brought up all over the Midwest .
You see , my father worked on the railroads and in the course of his job had to move from one place to another every few years .
So , on the one hand I had the sort of childhood that could make a person somewhat alienated ; that is , I never lived in an established family home .
On the other hand , however , I spent every summer during those early years on a farm owned by my grandparents and two uncles .
That experience was very important to me , as it not only provided me with the sense of a fixed , permanent place , but also gave me some appreciation of what it really means to be a farmer .
Now , I never farmed for a living myself , but I did have a number of responsibilities around my relatives ' place .
For instance , I was put in charge of the chicken flock — which numbered anywhere from 500 to 1,000 birds in any given summer — and I helped with the wheat harvest and so forth .
I think many of the ecological concepts I 've developed and expounded can be at least partially attributed to that rural experience .
After all , a good farmer is — by necessity — a kind of ecologist .
PLOWBOY : When did you decide to make biology your field of study ?
HARDIN : I did n't really settle upon a career as a biologist until my sophomore year at the University of Chicago .
Up to that point I 'd just diddled around with one subject or another , as most students do , debating the advantages of several possible fields .
But , in my second year in college , I committed myself to the study of zoology and came under the influence of Professor W.C. Allee .
He is a very important figure in American ecology , one of our true pioneers .
I would have gone on to do my graduate work with Allee in fact , but I felt the need to move to another area .
So the professor kindly lined up a position for me at Stanford .
While I was at that institution , I did my doctoral studies on the ecology of protozoa .
Then , with my Ph.D. in hand , I went to work for four years with the Carnegie Institution , which maintained its private Division of Plant Biology lab on the Stanford campus .
I became involved with a program to research the potentials of algae as a human food source .
This work occupied me from 1942 to ' 46 when , because of the background in population studies that I 'd picked up from Allee , the algal research began to seem like a " no win " situation to me .
After all , even if we did succeed in producing more food , we would in the end only feed more people ... which would cause the population in question to increase and , in effect , only make the problem worse !
PLOWBOY : So you left your position with the Division of Plant Biology ?
HARDIN : Yes , because I realized that my heart was n't in the research .
And — since Stanford was short - handed at that point — I was able to get a temporary teaching job with the university .
Incidentally , the " algae for food " program continued for another two years after I left , only to be dropped when it was found to be economically impractical .
- Advertisement -
At any rate , my dissatisfaction with the algal studies had reawakened my interest in population problems , and it was n't long before I was actively writing and lecturing about the hazards of overpopulation .
PLOWBOY : Did this work lead to the creation of your course in human ecology at the University here in Santa Barbara ?
HARDIN : Not directly , no .
I joined the staff of this college in 1946 and spent the next 10 years , more or less , establishing the university 's first course in general biology and writing a textbook for the class .
Eventually , that biology course developed some population problems of its own — we were swamped with more students than we could handle — so we began offering the class over closed - circuit television .
I learned a good bit from that experience , and when I did establish the human ecology course in the early 1960 's — I limited the number of students to between 50 and 100 per term .
PLOWBOY : While you were limiting enrollments in your classes though , your writings were beginning to reach a great many people .
HARDIN : Yes , in 1968 I finished " The Tragedy of the Commons , " which was n't my first publication but has certainly turned out to be among my most important works .
It was one of those lucky situations .
I happened to be saying the right thing at We right time .
PLOWBOY : Could you summarize the theory of the Commons as it was developed in that article ?
HARDIN : Let me describe the thesis as I 've refined it with the passage of time .
First of all , there are three basic politico - economic systems used by mankind to distribute the earth 's resources .
We have , first of all , privatism — or private enterprise — in which a person or group owns the resource and harvests it , just as a farmer owns , tills , and profits from his or her piece of land .
The other obvious system is socialism , where the community holds joint ownership of the resources and harvests them jointly , but appoints a manager to handle the distribution .
Now , either of these two systems — privatism or socialism — will work .
Each has its faults , and both have intrinsic advantages , but either form of government can function without destroying it 's resources .
However , there is a third system of distribution that cannot work in a crowded world , and that 's the system of the Commons : the resource is jointly owned but harvested by individuals .
The classic example of this politico - economic system is a pasture area — tsuch as the Commons of preindustrial England — that is open to , say , 10 different families .
Let us assume that the field is large enough to support 100 cows or 10 per household Now , as long as there are fewer than that number of cattle grazing the pasture , no harm is done .
But as soon as the area holds its full '' quota " of 100 cows , the problems begin .
If at that point another animal is added to the Commons , there will not be enough forage to adequately feed any of the cattle .
When one individual ignores the field 's capacity and does add an eleventh cow to his or her herd , however , the loss in meat growth and milk productivity per animal caused by the shortage of food is shared by everyone who uses that common field ... while the transgressor reaps all the profits in the form of an extra — though slightly underfed — - beast .
In a short time all of the farmers will have to move in and take as big a share as possible of the rapidly diminishing forage by adding additional cattle of their own in self defense .
Of course , during periods of low population — such as in America 's pioneer days — the system of the Commons works fine .
But , as the number of people in any given area increases , this particular politico - economic system becomes more and more dangerous and will ultimately result in the destruction of the resources in question .
So , in a more populous world , we must go to privatism , or socialism , or a mixture of the two , because it is inviting disaster to allow a Commons to exist under heavily crowded conditions .
PLOWBOY : But ca n't we assume that most men and women have enough social responsibility to avoid overexploiting the shared resources ?
HARDIN : Yes , we can probably predict that the majority would not knowingly take too great a share from the Commons , but the assumption does nothing to alter the course of events .
You see , the tragedy of the Commons comes about because the end result is dictated by what I call the " overwhelming minority . "
In other words , if just one or two people are scoundrels , those individuals will do their best to bleed the jointly owned resource dry .
Then , as these greedy men or women become richer and richer , others will be forced to follow their lead .
We cannot , you see , rely on voluntary responsibility to control the distribution of a resource , because this always gives a selective advantage to people who elect not to be responsible !
PLOWBOY : It 's difficult to imagine a government being run on a Commons basis in the twentieth century .
Can you give me some examples of this type of distribution system that are still in existence ?
HARDIN : Well , there are a number of Commons around , but they 're " silent . "
That is , we do n't always recognize them for what they are .
For example , the ocean fisheries are still distributed on a Commons basis .
Any person — or nation — can take as many fish from the noncoastal seas as he or she wants .
There are already too many groups grabbing oversized shares of that jointly owned resource .
We 're beginning to see that the " open seas " system wo n't work , that — without any legislation to control them — the ocean fisheries will be ruined
There are attempts being made to manage , through international agreements and so forth , the ocean Commons .
It is to be hoped that a solution will be found in time .
PLOWBOY : You 've also used the Commons metaphor to discuss world pollution problems .
Can you explain how this system applies to the destruction of our environment ?
HARDIN : Certainly .
The problems of pollution represent almost a reversal of the traditional Commons because this situation is aggravated when people put things into the shared resources .
The air is , of course , a Commons .
We can't get away from that .
There 's no way to make our atmosphere private property .
So , as long as it's less expensive for a manufacturer to pour smoke into the air than it is for that person to install antipollution devices , then he or she will pollute unless an enforced law prohibits that action .
PLOWBOY : Then , just as in the jointly owned pasture we discussed earlier , the polluter is able to distribute the dangers of foul air among many people , but personally reaps the full benefits of that contamination in the form of increased production , lower costs , and so forth ?
HARDIN : That 's right .
Take , for example , the paper mills that have been terrible polluters of our rivers and streams .
If one such firm elects to install a million dollars ' worth of equipment to " clean up " its operation , then that company can only recover the money by adding , say , a penny or two to the cost of a roll of paper .
So , when the products reach the stores , customers — who usually pay attention to prices — will buy the less expensive paper produced by polluting firms that were n't forced t o raise the cost of their products .
The point is , it does n't do a manufacturer any good to be public - spirited unless all of his or her competitors are , too .
That 's why the answer to a Commons is to get rid of it .
In other words , the solution comes when people band together to enforce rules and regulations that apply to everyone .
Which is why we now demand that industries have pollution control devices and fine those firms that do n't comply .
PLOWBOY : So antipollution regulations are examples of what you 've referred to as " mutually agreed - upon coercion ' '
HARDIN : Exactly .
PLOWBOY : Would it be fair to say that pollution — or any problem that might occur in a Commons — can be reduced to a question of population ?
HARDIN : That 's right .
In fact , the concept of " Commonsism " — as I 've developed it — is a result of my study of the hazards of overpopulation .
You see , many of our population problems stem from the great increase over the last 150 years or so in what might be called humanitarianism .
The growth of compassion — as indicated by the emergence of humanitarian groups and the passage of humanitarian legislation — has been one of the most striking bits of social evolution in the last couple of centuries .
And , on the whole , this sort of public concern speaks well of the human race .
But it also carries dangers with it , the worst of which show up in the form of overpopulation .
For example , as recently as 200 years ago there was n't much public concern over the fact that many children died of starvation .
The usual attitude was something like this : " Well , that poor family should n't have produced more children than it could support . "
So , if a couple had six offspring and could only feed two , four would starve .
In this way , local populations were largely self - controlled .
However , as the humanitarian trend grew , communities became concerned about the welfare of children born into such poor families .
Eventually , the group took over the responsibility of feeding tots whose parents could n't support them .
Now , that 's fine , but when the impoverished parents insist upon their rights to have more and more babies , the shared burden on the community of caring for them grows .
The irresponsible breeders are taking too much out of the Commons both in terms of the aid that the community gives to their children and in terms of the greater share of all resources that those " extra " people will consume .
And , though our public - spirited actions are the result of the best intentions in the world , we end up with overpopulation .
Of course , this does n't present a serious problem in a country like the United States ... at least not at the present time .
But the humanitarian organizations that want to make the whole world , in effect , a Commons — by pledging that we 'll prevent the starvation of children anywhere on earth — are following a course that could lead to serious consequences .
Consider this :
There are — using a loose definition of the term " poor " — about four times as many impoverished people in the world as there are men and women who have adequate food , clothing , etc .
And the rate of increase of these poor populations — which are mostly centered in technologically impoverished countries — is about three times as great as the growth of population in " rich " lands .
This means that — in effect — poor people are increasing their numbers 12 times as rapidly as are those folks who are well off .
And — as long as we continue to accept responsibility for children whose parents are unable to support them — that rate of increase can only go up .
The solution , of course , sounds somewhat harsh :
We must simply decide that the right to bear children hinges upon the ability to care for those children .
Therefore , a couple should not produce any child that the family cannot support .
If too many poor babies are born , we — as individuals or as a country — can't accept responsibility for them .
As I said , this may seem cruel , but I think the time has come when we must direct our humanitarianism toward future generations even at the expense of poor children today .
There 's another , less obvious , factor that enters into this problem , too .
The impoverished countries of the world are — by and large — already overdevelop from an ecological , rather than a technological , point of view .
There are exceptions , of course , but all around the Mediterranean basin , and throughout southeast Asia , we see poor lands that have been deforested .
In some cases the damage was done thousands of years ago
The people living in these areas have already surpassed the " carrying capacity " of the land , which can be defined as the number of beings that an area can support , year after year , without degrading its environment .
Now , when you exceed that number — as did the farmer in our example , who put an extra cow on the public pasture — you do damage the environment and thus reduce its capacity !
So , by saving the lives of children in these areas , we increase the overload and insure that the ability of the land to support human life will decrease more rapidly .
The situation is even worse in the tropical highlands , as Erik Eckholm has pointed out .
Such areas only contain about 10 percent of the world 's population , yet the events that transpire in the highlands affect 30 percent of the people on this earth !
The deforestation that took place in the foothills of the Himalayas , for example , resulted in a loss of topsoil .
That soil ran down to the lowlands , where it clogged irrigation systems and caused flooding .
So the folks in the lowlands suffer for the sins of the highlands .
And the greater the populations in those mountainous areas grow , the more serious and far - reaching that lowland suffering will become .
Which is another good reason for not keeping people alive beyond their own ability to survive , especially in the highlands of the world .
PLOWBOY : But is n't there a popular theory which states that a society will produce fewer children as it rises — presumably with the help of foreign aid — to a higher economic level ?
HARDIN : Yes , and that 's a theory without any factual backing at all .
The notion is based upon a correlation that can be seen in the history of Western civilizations .
In general , as these cultures moved up the economic scale over the last 300 years or so their fertility rates did go down .
However , the causal connection between the rise in income and the drop in fertility is very obscure .
It could be argued , for instance , that the populations became richer because they produced fewer children
PLOWBOY : You contend , in your book The Limits of Altruism , that we should make carrying capacity rather than human life our primary ethical consideration .
Now , that 's a shocking statement on the surface , and some reviewers have reacted to it at that level .
However , suppose carrying capacity were given central importance in ethical decisions .
Would n't the effect of that change of focus actually save more human lives — in the long run — than our established policy of concern for individual life , which does n't take into account the planet 's ability to sustain such life into the indefinite future ?
HARDIN : That 's right .
If we could , for example , stop the trend toward deforestation in poor countries and allow the environments to " mend " themselves , those nations would be able to support reduced populations indefinitely rather than one great lump of humanity today and then fewer and fewer people as the topsoil is gradually washed away .
Again , the simple statement — that carrying capacity should be more ethically valuable than human life — appears to be cruel .
But it is only so if you do n't take the needs of posterity seriously .
PLOWBOY : Have n't you speculated — in your writings — that the lack of concern for ancestry in our Western civilizations is one of the reasons that we seem unable to feel concern for a future that we wo n't live to see ?
HARDIN : I have and I base my feelings about the matter on a statement by Edmund Burke : " People will not look forward to posterity who never look backward to their ancestors . "
The idea seems plausible to me , and ignorance about the past may be one of the weaknesses of our society here in the United States .
We 've grown so fast and become so mobile that most of us know very little about our forefathers and mother .
In Burke 's day , on the other hand , it was not uncommon for people to live in family homes : ancestral dwellings that had probably been around for 200 years or more !
There were pictures on the walls of Great - Aunt Gertrude or Great - Uncle Harry , and these paintings represented real people , individuals whose life stories were familiar to succeeding generations .
Nowadays , of course , many children do n't even have contact with their grandparents .
Yes , a lack of concern for the past may well be one of our failings — a kind of catalyst that aggravates many of out - social problems — but I 'm afraid there is n't much we can do about this one .
PLOWBOY : Perhaps , if we can learn to live within our energy " budget , " we will find ourselves in a world that allows for more contact between the generations .
HARDIN : That may well be the case .
When we have to make do on reduced amounts of energy , we will certainly become a less mobile society if for no other reason than the fact that travel will be expensive enough to negate many of the now common reasons for changing one 's location .
PLOWBOY : There is , as you know , a growing " back to the land " movement in the United States , and in other nations as well .
Do you feel that this trend could lead to a greater concern for the future ?
HARDIN : It could .
At least it offers that potential .
The course of history , though , is so unpredictable that it's hard to guess what the hell will happen even in the next 10 years .
But large numbers of people are opting to live in more rural locations , and that change in itself is important .
PLOWBOY : And , if you also consider the increasing numbers of Americans who are attempting to produce some of their own food — even in limited quantities — with backyard gardens and so forth , it does seem that we might be moving away from the ' ' milk comes from the store ' ' mentality .
HARDIN : I think that this trend is , at least , providing many people with valuable experience .
After all , one of the first tasks that a beginning gardener has to face is crop thinning .
He or she sees all those wonderful seedlings come up and wants to raise every single one of them .
Yet if the garden is to thrive , the novice '' farmer " has to learn to destroy some life in order to allow other life to flourish .
Should that lesson not sink in , the garden will produce — for example — radishes the size of pinheads if the plants survive at all .
PLOWBOY
And raising a crop no matter how small , can also give a person a gut understanding of such otherwise abstract phrases as ' ' carrying capacity . '.
HARDIN : That 's true .
Many of the ecological concepts that seem vague to a city dweller can become very clear - cut when that individual tries his or her hand at raising food .
Farming — or gardening — tends to force one to look to the future , to accept responsibility for the long term results of his or her actions .
PLOWBOY : You 've used the word '' responsibility " several times , Dr. Hardin .
Can you give me a precise definition of this somewhat vague term ?
HARDIN : Put in the simplest way possible , responsibility is accountability .
Or , as Charles Frankel has defined it , " A decision is responsible when the man or group that makes it has to answer for it to those who are directly or indirectly affected by it . ''
There is , of course , another interpretation of responsibility which relates to an inner feeling , almost a private religion .
That second definition often determines how a person lives his or her life , but the first meaning — that of responsibility as accountability — should be a matter of public policy .
Especially when we 're dealing with a Commons , or with actions that could limit the carrying capacity of the planet .
PLOWBOY : In your own estimation , where do we stand with respect to the carrying capacity of the earth .
HARDIN : That 's an impossible question to answer .
You see , the concept of carrying capacity was developed to deal with domestic and wild game animals .
In such applications , the limits can be very precisely worked out .
We simply ask , " How many deer can forage in a given section of grass - and - woodland without damaging that piece of land 's ability to feed the same number of animals in the future ? "
The answer , which can be arrived at through field studies and so forth , will equal the maximum carrying capacity — in terms of deer herd — for the piece of land .
Human beings , however , require much more than physical nourishment to live what is considered a ' ' good life . "
Let me put it this way :
In the United States , the average person consumes about 3,000 calories ' worth of food every day .
That same typical American , however , accounts for nearly 150,000 calories a day in other ways by using electric lights , appliances , fuel , and so on .
So we require 50 times more energy for nonfood items than we use for nourishment .
Now , calories can , in principle , always be converted from one use to another .
In other words , we could support a much larger population if we cut down on our use of nonfood calories .
Therefore , an area 's carrying capacity — in human terms — depends entirely upon the kind of life its populace wants to lead , and the simplest way to express those differing lifestyles is in terms of calories .
If a society wants to live a 150,000 - calories per-person - per - day life , then the carrying capacity of that culture 's territory will be far smaller than if the group would be satisfied with a 50,000 - calorie life .
And many people are becoming convinced that we could lead a better existence , if we had the willpower to manage the transition , by using far less energy than we consume now .
PLOWBOY : Would it be correct to say that energy is one of the basic units of carrying capacity ?
HARDIN : It 's certainly the easiest to measure or to talk about .
Any other means of measuring carrying capacity tends to be hard to pin down , and these alternate '' scales " are largely based upon personal feelings .
I , for instance , have a very high regard for the value of wilderness to the quality of human life .
But some people would n't agree with me on that .
The point is , though , that if you do make the availability of wilderness experience one of the standards for carrying capacity , you drastically limit that capacity .
You also run into the problems of defining " wilderness " and so forth .
Energy , on the other hand , is easy to measure .
However , I personally believe that the opportunity to enjoy the beauties of nature should be part of the " formula " for carrying capacity .
PLOWBOY : But would n't such " wild " areas have to be controlled ?
HARDIN : Of course .
You can't just open the wilderness up to everybody at once — as our national parks were doing until recently — because that creates a Commons and guarantees the eventual destruction of the forest , desert , or what have you .
PLOWBOY : In your attempts to explain the concept of the Commons and other such ideas to the public , you 've come up with a number of little slogans called " pejorisms . "
Could you perhaps give us an example of these ?
HARDIN : Well , yes .
Pejorisms — the word is taken from " pejoration ' : a change for the worse — are tough little statements , usually negative , that force people to look at old problems in new ways .
One of my favorites — which I can't take credit for — is a reworking of the laws of thermodynamics .
You see , a physicist — who regards these rules as the tools of his or her science — would probably state the laws something like this : [ 1 ]
When mechanical work is transformed into heat , or vice versa , the quantity of work will always equal the amount of heat .
And [ 2 ] it is impossible — in a self - sustaining process — for heat to move from a colder to a hotter body .
Ecologists , however — wanting to emphasize different implications of these laws — reworked them into pejorisms which state : [ 1 ]
You can't win , [ 2 ] you are sure to lose , and [ 3 ] there 's no way to get out of the game .
The meaning of the rules is n't really changed by this transformation , but they hit harder because they 're phrased in everyday language .
And the pejorisms are true .
We can't get out of the energy game , we always have to have a source of power — which is primarily the sun — and that source is sure , one day , to burn out .
PLOWBOY : The trick , then , is to see how well we can utilize that finite resource .
HARDIN : Sure .
We have no control over the sun , so all we can do is make good use of its energy as it comes to us day by day
That 's all the freedom we have : to make the best possible use of each day 's sunshine .
Of course , we 've cheated considerably by using fossil sunlight : oil , coal , and gas .
We 're still doing so , but those resources will soon come to an end , leaving us with only sunlight and perhaps nuclear energy .
The latter is , of course , a problem of a different sort .
I feel that it 's a terribly dangerous source of power .
PLOWBOY : There are many people who claim that civilization can't survive without developing nuclear resources .
HARDIN : A civilization that can't survive without atomic energy can't survive with it !
The proponents of nuclear development are actually saying that we are unable to live on a constant energy level .
And — once their contention is put in these terms — I think it becomes plainly ridiculous .
Most societies , in most times , have lived on a constant energy level .
We 've only started escalating our power consumption in the past 200 years .
Are we to believe , then , that there were no civilizations in existence more than 200 years ago ?
No , our race has lived within an energy " budget " in the past , and we can do it again .
But the transition is going to lead to terrible political battles , some of which may well be going on by the time this interview reaches your readers !
PLOWBOY : In recent years many ecologists have tried to explain the earth 's limited energy resources by comparing the planet to a spaceship , using Kenneth Boulding 's '' Spaceship Earth " metaphor .
In your writing , however , you 've developed the image of a group of lifeboats as opposed to a single spaceship .
Would you explain the significance of these two different metaphors ?
HARDIN : My intention , when I wrote '' Living on a Lifeboat , " was to subdivide the world again , so to speak .
It seemed to me that the phrase " spaceship earth " was dangerous , as it implied that we were all passengers on one ship and had an equal right to the ship 's resources .
Which , of course , sets up a picture of a worldwide Commons .
By adopting the metaphor of a number of lifeboats — one for each nation — I was able to imply that the people on each of these small crafts are responsible for themselves and should not expect handouts — even if those donations mean survival itself — from the other boats around them .
PLOWBOY : In his review of The Limits of Altruism Paul Ehrlich proposed an alternate image with the rich countries on luxury liners and the poor nations in lifeboats that may soon be equipped with nuclear torpedoes .
HARDIN : I 'd have to disagree with the value of that metaphor because it is , I think , misleading .
For one thing , the threat in that image — posed by the torpedoes — seems to imply a danger of war or terrorism .
These two possibilities are not the most significant hazards that we face .
It is virtually impossible , today , for a poor nation to afford an invasive war .
Which is , I assume , the danger that Paul 's metaphor alludes to .
After all , the United States got clobbered when it tried to fight within the territory of the impoverished country of Vietnam .
So how is a poor nation to successfully attack the shores of a wealthy land ?
We do n't , in fact , have to worry about the possibility of attack from the poorer countries , " nuclear torpedoes " or not .
Terrorism , however , is another kettle of fish .
An act of terror only requires a few people with limited funds , and it can do great harm ... as we 've all too often seen .
The only answer to this sort of attack is police action .
In other words , you cannot buy a terrorist off any more than you can pay a blackmailer , because he or she will come back again and again .
Instead , you must simply institute whatever safety measures are necessary , like the inspections that are held at airports today .
And , if the problem continues , the passenger checks will have to be made more stringent .
These are police measures :
They 're all objectionable and none of them works perfectly , but they do function well enough to allow us to survive the threat of terrorism .
No , the dangers ahead are not primarily those of either war or terrorist attack .
The greatest risk we face lies in not making each lifeboat responsible for its own occupants .
PLOWBOY : Yet there must be some instances when we can come to the aid of another country without doing some irreparable damage .
HARDIN : Yes , there are , and I can best discuss this matter in terms of the concept of triage , which was first described by a physician in the Napoleonic army and can probably be best defined by using a military example .
An army doctor might — during a period of extreme crisis — divide his or her cases into three groups .
That three - part division is what is meant by triage .
The physician will not treat the " walking wounded , " those with injuries that — though they may be terribly painful — are not debilitating .
Neither will the doctor care for casualties who are so severely wounded that they would require hours of treatment — under the hands of several physicians — to survive .
Instead , the healer concentrates his or her efforts upon the " middle group " : soldiers for whom a limited amount of medical care will mean the difference between life and death .
Now , the military institutes triage for purely practical reasons , in order to save the maximum number of soldiers for the next battle .
But I think a compassionate doctor — under similar circumstances — would end up following much the same course of action even if he or she were n't concerned about the pursuit of the war .
PLOWBOY : Simply because , by instituting triage , a greater number of lives could be saved ?
HARDIN : Yes , and I admit that it 's a harsh - sounding means of establishing priorities .
PLOWBOY : Is it possible to make a connection between the use of triage in wartime and the world food shortages and overpopulation that mankind faces ?
HARDIN : Yes , it is .
However , I want to refer to the work of William and Paul Paddock on this matter , because they were responsible for applying the system of triage to such problems .
The Paddocks have said , essentially , that though we were able to give away quantities of grain in the 1950's and ' 60's , those days of surplus are over .
From now on we 'll probably have to sell most of our spare grain to get the money to buy oil .
We may have a little bit left — a few million tons or so — that can be used to aid poor countries , but this will be a limited amount of food and there will be many nations asking for it .
At that point , the Paddocks suggest we use the system of triage in order to make sure that the grain goes where it will do the most good .
We should n't give it to a country that is going to survive without it , and we can't afford to waste such a limited food supply on nations that are hopelessly overcrowded .
Instead , we ought to give the wheat — or whatever — to the intermediate lands : those to whom the gift may mean the difference between maintaining civil order — and surviving as a nation — or not !
PLOWBOY : You 've also expressed that idea in terms of aiding a country that is in a crisis , but not helping a nation that is in a " crunch . "
HARDIN : That 's right .
Exactly .
For example , when Guatemala had an earthquake , it did no harm to send them some food and blankets and so forth because that event was a crisis .
It was n't Guatamala 's public policy to have earthquakes .
Whereas Bangladesh — with its 86 million people in an area the size of Iowa — is really a hopeless case .
That nation is in the middle of a continuing crunch , and so we can't possibly keep Bangladesh afloat .
To even attempt to do so would be — in effect — forcing greater suffering upon those future generations that will inhabit the same territory .
PLOWBOY : A concern for the future of mankind seems to be at the center of most of your ideas .
Yet many people — folks who are concerned about ecology — will , when pushed very hard , fall back upon the theory that the human race itself is expendable as long as life on earth — in the form of some other species — continues .
HARDIN : Sure , I 've heard that argument many times .
You know something , though , I 'm not ready to surrender the future to that " other species . "
I happen to be egotistically — if that 's the right word — interested in the human race .
I rather have an affection for humanity .
I 'd like to see us continue for a while .

This time , it seems , the boulder has moved .
We have made a difference that could be worth at least 1000 jobs , created by the companies under fire for potentially sending thousands of jobs to china using US stimulus dollars .
Two companies that encountered political backlash for their plans to use Chinese - made wind turbines to build a giant wind farm in west Texas have announced plans to build a new turbine factory — in the United States .
The U.S. Renewable Energy Group , a private - equity firm , and A - Power Energy Generation Systems , a Chinese turbine maker , said in a statement on Tuesday that they had signed an agreement to build " a new production and assemby plant in the United States that will supply highly advanced wind energy turbines to renewable energy projects throughout North and South America . " -- Article
You may recall news that a 600 megawatt wind farm is going to be built in Texas .
BUT the 2000 manufacturing jobs to build the turbines are likely to go to China while the US gets but 30 permanent jobs and 300 temporary ones .
That news in itself was a little irritating , but the insufferable part was that the companies responsible for the wind farms were also likely to receive $ 450 million in Federal stimulus money ... money set aside to create US jobs .
Money that was instead likely to go toward creating jobs outside the US .
This is n't an isolated case .
Thisis all too common .
Many people in the blogosphere joined to express outrage .
Soon , Senator Chuck Schumer picked up the story and got into the fray sending a letter to Obama and Energy Secretary Steven Chu , demanding that Federal stimulus dollars be withheld from contracts that do not create jobs here in the United States .
Mr. Schumer said he had sent a letter on Thursday to Energy Secretary Steven Chu , urging him to " reject any request for stimulus money unless the high - value components , including the wind turbines , are manufactured in the United States . " -- Article
Two weeks later the US and Chinese companies involved in the Texas wind farm , who were looking down the barrel of losing half a billion dollars in subsidies signed an agreement to build a US assembly plant that could employ 1000 people .
The companies say that the plant would would employ about 1,000 American workers in addition to creating construction jobs .
Is there a direct correlation ?
Did the blogosphere move Schumer to demand that companies getting federal stimulus create US jobs ?
Did Schumer 's demand prompt these companies to sign an agreement to create a manufacturing facility in the US ?
I do n't know .
I do know that I felt the boulder move , however .
Our demands and our voices matter .
And they are heard .
And they make a difference .
We 're not doormats .
We 're not here to support business interests at any cost and hope and pray the businesses some day return the favor and our money .
We 're not helpless players in the Economy waiting for the benefit of our investment to trickle down to us .
We ARE in a position to make demands , and as long as we do , maybe we at the bottom wo n't forever be the last in line .
And by the way , if anybody 's looking for a place to put a 1000 person factory .
Check out Muskegon .
I 'm feeling pretty darn good .

Editorial : With a Great Review Comes Great Responsibility
By : Ryan Gan , Reviews Editor
A problem has been brewing in the blogosphere regarding the usefulness of video game reviews .
During the past year , I ’ve come to realize that there ’s a little uncertainty regarding how you should approach a video game review .
For example , my roommate lives and dies by the reviews he sees on Gamespot .
He finds their reviews to be hard on games and only buys games that score above a 9 on their review scale .
On the other hand , I have another friend who believes that game reviews are useless these days ; he thinks that they only represent the views of the writer , not necessarily that of the readers .
I ’ll be the first to admit that I ’m a frivolous spender when it comes to games .
In the past , I ’ve been guilty of loading up Wikipedia on my Blackberry as I walk to the local video game store to quickly read up on a certain game ’s reception section .
I can understand what my latter friend says about reviews being unnecessary , but it ’s so easy to plop down $ 40 dollars for a used game that scored a 95 on Metacritic .
Reviews are the voice that talk me into buying games .
I find it hard to stay away from them .
Are video game reviews dependable ?
In the gaming community , it ’s easy to fall to peer pressure .
Are the opinions presented in a video game review relevant to what you want in a game ?
The problem becomes more apparent when you see comment sections of game reviews turn into a war zone .
Readers begin bickering and arguing amongst one another about the validity of a certain review .
All too often , you see people complaining about how terrible a review is , how a certain score ( or letter grade , if you swing that way ) is lower or higher than it should be , and that the writer ’s opinions can not be trusted .
This is usually followed up by a dog pile of supporters and attackers of the writer and / or game .
People then make fun of each other for making grammar and spelling mistakes .
At this point , it does n’t take long for someone to accuse someone else of being fat ( which is one of the best things you can do if you ’re arguing with someone on the internet , by the way , because they ca n’t prove you wrong ) .
Clearly , there ’s no such thing as a universal opinion .
A misunderstanding lies in what some readers think game reviews are .
Some readers would benefit from knowing how they should actually approach a review .
More importantly , they should understand that a review is not necessarily the judge , jury , and executioner of a certain video game .
Readers have to understand that they ( should ) have a more active role in the review process than they think .
Video game reviews are never going to go away .
Since restaurants , movies , and electronics are assessed and evaluated using reviews ( and review scales ) , it ’s in our nature , as consumers , to look for something that will either recommend or dissuade us from buying a certain product .
This should n’t be any different in the video game industry .
Of Words and Numbers
Gaming is not a cheap habit hobby .
At $ 60 dollars a pop , you want to make sure you ’re making the right decision when you ’re out buying a certain game on its launch date .
You ’ve tried the demo , and you ’re still a little unsure as to whether or not the rest of the game will live up to your expectations .
You want to make sure that purchase really counts .
And it should , right ?
Your favorite gaming site gave it a 9/10 , so why would n’t it be good ?
What could go wrong ?
More often than not , everything goes according to plan , and you ’re very pleased with your purchase .
However , there are instances when people are disappointed .
“ It got a 9 .
What happened ? ”
Unfortunately , the review ( read : words ) often takes a back seat to the score ( read : number ) .
It ’s a shame because it takes a lot of time to write a coherent , palatable , and thoughtful review that keeps the reader / consumer in mind .
Gaming sites that have review scores or compile these scores onto one post are helpful , but they unintentionally “ glamorize ” scores .
You should know that when you make purchases according to these scores , it ’s easy to feel like you should n’t be held responsible for whether you enjoy the game or not .
Therefore , the writer is unjustly held accountable for what you do .
This is usually when forum fights occur .
Giving a game a score is a form of summarization .
Summarization is also in our nature , as learners .
However , you have to understand how these scores came to be and where they came from .
A lot of information is lost when converting an 800 - word review into a score .
In skipping to the score , you miss a lot of important notes that the writer meant for you to read .
It takes between hours to a few days to write a good review .
Once the review is written , it takes seconds to assign a score .
It takes more thought for the reviewer to remember and write about the experiences he / she had with a game .
Gamers have to do some critical thinking when researching a game by reading a review .
How Did this Review Get Here ?
Of equal importance ( and often overlooked ) is the name that appears on the byline .
When the writer goes to work on their review , they are making a collection of notable experiences they ’ve had with the game .
Do you relate to these experiences ?
Do you relate to the writer ?
It ’s important to ask these questions because you have to understand where this review is coming from .
This is where the reader should be taking a more active role in the reviewing process .
It ’s not a matter of trusting the writer * .
It ’s a matter of finding a writer you relate to .
This is especially hard for casual gamers because this often takes a lot of time ; it involves finding a writer , listening to their podcast ( if there ’s one available ) , and keeping up with all the pieces they publish .
The goal here is to find someone who writes in a voice that you enjoy reading and enjoys the same games that you do .
Once you find this person , you ’ll find that it ’ll be a lot easier to read what they have to say .
Of course , it ’s important to note that sometimes there will be discrepancies between one of your favorite writer ’s tastes and your own , so do n’t take all of their recommendations as a “ go ahead . ”
For example , one of my favorite video game writers seems to love point - and - click adventures .
Personally , I ca n’t stand them , so I do n’t buy them .
And that ’s fine , because he ’s always spot - on when it comes to other genres .
Use your best judgment , be responsible .
You Know You ’re Right
It ’s worthwhile to be mindful of the reviews you come across and the scores that come with them .
Since review scores are presented as numbers and letter grades , they appear to be objective .
However , they were written by another human being and are full of opinions .
You , as the reader and consumer , have more power and should n’t act solely on a score .
You should identify the writer and the gaming community you belong to as the judge and jury , respectively .
In the end , it ’s your job to execute on that purchase .
As consumers , we usually feel like we ’re at the mercy of video game publishers .
We should feel empowered when we decide to make a purchase or not .
Therefore , when researching a game before purchase , read reviews , play demos , and look at scores , just do n’t half - ass it .
As long as the writing is honest , video game reviews are dependable .
In fact , one of the only truthful things that can be said about a review is that it is written by another person .
Can you relate to this person and the paragraphs they ’ve laid out for you ?
After you ’ve asked yourself this question , then feel free to act accordingly .
This is called being responsible , and responsibility is a very good thing .

In debates over the fate of the U.S. dollar there appears to be a need for clarification .
While since last spring the dollar has declined about 15 % in value compared to a basket of other major currencies , on the domestic front a dollar today buys about 30 % more common stock than it did two years ago at the peak , and the dollar also rose substantially in value vs. real estate during the same period .
This distinction is critical because for most people the value of the dollar in terms of foreign currencies is probably not a day - to - day concern .
Any change the dollar ’s purchasing power in terms of domestic assets , however , is very important both now and when planning for the future .
Tens of trillions of dollars of credit - from - nowhere now in existence fuel demand for goods and services , bidding up asset prices across the entire world economy .
This mountain of credit was built on three pillars .
Fractional reserve banking .
Government debt issuance .
Packaging of collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) into " securities . "
The third pillar , CDOs , required a phenomenal collective delusion for sustenance , and that level of delusion is gone .
It comes around once every several centuries , so we probably should n’t hold our breath awaiting its return .
The banking pillar is full of cracks as the banks ’ overreliance on real estate loans is increasingly recognized .
With their weakness revealed , banks cannot offset credit destruction due to collapsing mortgages and multiplying loan defaults .
Amazingly , the pillar of government debt issuance remains the strongest .
This revolving door of taxes paid , massive borrowing , and government payments ( direct and indirect ) to nearly every citizen is now the sole whirlwind supporting the greatest faux economy since John Law ’s Mississippi Scheme or the South Sea Bubble .
Whereas it required all three pillars to leverage the growth of credit to these dizzying heights , only one remains to hold the forces of credit collapse deflation at bay .

As long as collective " suspension of disbelief " provides the music , this vast game of musical chairs continues .
The above - cited trends , however , leave us sharing the sense that when the music stops there will be very few chairs left in the game for the multitudes to find a seat .
We know that this catastrophe , when it arrives , will make instant losers out of the vast majority of people residing in the USA .
So what is a prudent person to do to preserve capital in our chaotic times ?
No one knows for sure .
The money supply sustaining prices at current levels is made up of a little currency plus an ocean of credit .
The credit supply is teetering on a three - legged stool where one leg is gone , another is on the verge of disaster , and the last is mainlining anabolic steroids in an effort to look like Atlas holding the world on his shoulders .
Obama , Geithner , and Bernanke do n’t remind me of Atlas .
Neither does their Uncle Sam .

If one believes that the failure of the Federal Debt system is imminent , then one should be preparing for TEOTWAWKI .
In this event , prudent preparation includes quitting the job , selling the house , moving the family to a temperate rural area and converting all assets to guns , food , ammo , farmland , livestock , barter goods , and books on how to live an 18th century lifestyle .
The trouble is that preparing for TEOTWAWKI renders one in a very poor position should things not be quite so catastrophic .
People are incredibly resourceful and the history of communism shows us that even unsustainable systems do n’t necessarily collapse all at once .
If the federal government system survives for a period of time after the Federal Reserve banking cartel crashes ( or more likely , is seized by an Act of Congress ) , instead of an immediate dollar collapse , surviving dollars would soar in value .
Ironically , the closer any dollar credit exists to the U.S.
Treasury , the longer it may survive .
The idea in this case would be to hold the last surviving dollar credits , stepping off that boat to the dry land of hard assets when all vulnerable credits have disappeared and asset values have declined about as far as they ’re going to .
Then will be the time to flee dollars in fear of the appearance of ever - larger denominations of currency , the hallmark of currency hyperinflation .
Can people lose faith in the banking system but maintain trust in Uncle Sam ( and the legal tender illusion ) for a time , despite the unsustainable binge of central government borrowing and certain train wreck of entitlement programs ?
To me the answer is yes , they can .
No one knows the future , but a resumption of the domestic surge in the value of the dollar ( attended by price declines for stocks , real estate , and other assets ) is among the possibilities , and each person must decide which among those paths to prepare for .

The reputation of Russia 's police force has been further damaged , with three officers detained on suspicion of beating a man to death .
Russian media has reported the officers were involved in a fight with two men in Moscow on Monday night .
One of the men died , and the officers , who were reportedly drunk , were detained soon after .
One officer has been charged .
The trio , along with a supervising officer , have been dismissed from the police department .
Allegations of Russian police seriously flouting the law are frequent .
The issue was highlighted earlier this month when a policeman posted a video appeal to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on YouTube , accusing senior officers of being corrupt .
Authorities dismissed not just the accusations but also the whistleblower officer .
AUSTRALIA has the second - best quality of life in the world and could pip Norway for top spot , the author of a UN report on migration and development says .
Australia was ranked second among 182 countries on a scale measuring life expectancy , school enrolments and income in the United Nations Development Program 's Human Development Report 2009 , released yesterday .
The US slipped a spot to 13 , while Britain remained steady at 21 , based on the most recent internationally comparable data from 2007 .
Niger ranked lowest , followed by Afghanistan .
In Australia , life expectancy was extended three months and income rose 4 per cent on a year earlier , report author Dr Jeni Klugman said .
But the scale does not account for inequality within a country and is not a direct representation of its allure to migrants .
Instead , the human development index ranks countries into tiers of development .
Most international migration is contained within those tiers .
For instance , less than 1 per cent of Africans have moved to Europe , and just over a third of the world 's 200 million international migrants moved from a developing country to a developed one .
For the majority , the move is a more subtle one in search of greater opportunity .
'' Most migration , internal and international , reap gains in the form of higher incomes , better access to education and health , and improved prospects for their children , '' the report said .
While Australia is largely a migration success story , the toll on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders has been high , Dr Klugman said .
'' It clearly had large and unacceptable costs for indigenous people , '' she said .

Britain was accused of " genocide denial " today after the disclosure of Foreign Office documents revealing the government 's refusal to recognise the so - called Armenian massacre of 1915 , in which up to a million people died .
The documents , dating back over the last 15 years , say Anglo - Turkish relations are too important to be jeopardised by the issue because " Turkey is neuralgic and defensive about the charge of genocide " .
One Foreign Office briefing for ministers conceded that the British government " is open to criticism in terms of the ethical dimension " , but goes on to say : " The current line is the only feasible option " owing to " the importance of our relations ( political , strategic and commercial ) with Turkey " .
The 1999 briefing said : " Recognising the genocide would provide no practical benefit to the UK . "
Britain 's stance , stretching back over Labour and Tory administrations , was called a cynical " genocide denial " by Geoffrey Robertson , the QC who served as first president of the UN war crimes court for Sierra Leone .
Robertson was commissioned by Armenian expatriate groups in London to review the foreign office files , obtained in heavily redacted form from freedom of information requests .
He published a report today which says : " Parliament has been routinely misinformed by ministers who have recited FCO briefs without questioning their accuracy . "
The allegation that the Armenian massacres during the first world war were a form of genocide , carried out by the Ottoman empire , is a bitterly contested issue that has soured relations between Turkey and Armenia .
The border between the two countries was re-opened last month after being closed since 1993 , thanks to an accord which includes a promise to set up a commission of historians to re-examine the affair .
Turkish and Armenian parliaments still have to ratify the accord .
The Foreign Office documents include advice in 1995 to the then Tory foreign minister , Douglas Hogg , that he should refuse to attend a memorial service for the victims , and attempts to encourage the idea that historians were in disagreement over the facts .
The government refused to include the Armenian massacres as part of holocaust memorial day .
Robertson 's report says : " There is no doubt that in 1915 the Ottoman government ordered the deportation of up to 2 million Armenians … hundreds of thousands died en route from starvation , disease , and armed attack . "
The1948 genocide convention was drawn up with the specific case of the Armenians in mind , he says , and most scholars and European parliaments have described their fate as genocide .
" But recent British governments … have resolutely refused to do so , " resorting instead , he says , to the legally meaningless expression that " insufficiently unequivocal evidence " of genocide exists .
Britain is a keen supporter of Turkey 's attempts to join the EU .
But the Armenian question has become a touchstone for critics , who argue that Turkey should not be allowed into the EU until it admits the truth about its past .
Turkey refuses to allow any of its citizens to call the Armenian massacres genocide .
When Nobel prize - winning writer Orhan Pamuk did so , he was charged with " insulting Turkishness " in 2005 , although the justice ministry refused to let a trial proceed , following an embarrassing international outcry .
Three scholars , Ahmet Insel , Baskin Oran and Cengiz Aktar , and a journalist , Ali Bayramoglu , published an open letter , inviting Turks to sign an online petition supporting its sentiments .
It reads : " My conscience does not accept the insensitivity showed to and the denial of the Great Catastrophe that the Ottoman Armenians were subjected to in 1915 .
I reject this injustice and for my share , I empathise with the feelings and pain of my Armenian brothers .
I apologise to them . "
But while academics edge towards openness , Robertson says Britain 's official policy has merely been " to evade truthful answers , because the truth would discomfort the Turkish government " .
Billy and Jason ran through the door of the abandoned office , slamming it shut behind them .
Out of breath , they were both silent for a long moment before Jason spoke .
” This shit be fucked up !
There ai n’t no way that this is actually happening … ”
His voice trailed off , unsure of exactly what to say next .
Billy caught his breath and answered , “ I know .
I spent my entire youth watching zombie movies … never in my wildest dreams would I imagine that zombies would become real and take over the world ! ”
“ Well , at least we ’ve done escaped from them , ” Jason said , crouching and peering cautiously out the window .
Suddenly , he stood up , rigid with fear .
“ Or not !
Here they come ! ”
“ Shit ! ” Billy yelled as five of the undead came crashing through the door .
Three of them came shambling towards Billy , arms outstretched , as the other two closed on Jason , who had moved to the far corner of the room and was cowering there in fear .
Not being able to come up with any other coherent thoughts , Billy yelped at his attackers .
“ Please do n’t eat me !
I have a wife and three children ! ! ”
All five of the deceased attackers halted suddenly , stopped in their tracks with their arms in mid-air , as if contemplating some great secret .
Confused but feeling opportunistic , Jason slowly said , ” Ye - yeah , do n’t eat me neither !
I ’ve gots me a grandmother at home that I be taking care of ! ”
The zombies , as if awakening from a dream , roared as they all descended upon Jason and in a flash they dragged him , kicking and screaming , out the door of the office and around the corner , where his screams slowly faded .
Left alone , Billy could do nothing but stand and shake in fear and confusion .
While he was still deciding exactly what to do next , a woman came running through the door .
Billy jumped into action ; unfortunately , that action was slamming himself up against the wall awkwardly while yelling , “ Shit !
Are you a zombie too ? ? ”
The woman stopped in the middle of the room , her hands up in front of her in the classic “ non- threatening ” fashion .
“ No , I ’m a normal person !
My name is Eliza … what ’s yours ? ”
“ Billy … I ’m Billy … ” was all he could muster as a reply .
“ Billy …was that your friend that I just saw being dragged away by zombies ? ”
Billy , feeling slightly dizzied by the day ’s events , replied , “ Yeah , they were just here , but I do n’t know why they took him and not me … ”
He let his voice trail off , not exactly sure what to say next .
The woman took the opportunity to speak , with an air of authority : “ I think I may have the answer to that .
I ’m Professor Eliza Hollingsworth .
I ’m an English teacher at the local college , and our English department faculty was working with the local Army base on a top - secret experiment that was to combine their attempts at ridding the world of counter - terrorism with our attempts of ridding the world of people who ca n’t speak the English language very well .
But , somewhere along the way , our efforts went horribly , horribly awry . ”
Billy opened his mouth to reply , but Eliza , in full - on dramatic monologue mode , carried on with her speech .
“ You see , Billy , the reason the zombies drug your friend away but left you alone is quite simple : he must have used bad grammar in front of them .
That ’s the only time these zombies attack people : because we accidentally unleashed upon the world the sheer horror of …Grammar Zombies ! ! ”
Billy ’s brain , at this point , simply checked out .
Not being able to process such fantastical information , he stood silently , his jaw slacked .
Eliza continued , “ I sense your confusion , and I know this is a lot to take in .
The bottom line , Billy , is that we will be just fine as long as we do n’t make any grammatical errors in front of the zombies .
Whenever they might come back . ”
In a robotic voice , Billy echoed her .
“ Yes …whenever they might come back . ”
Another few seconds of awkward silence passed between the two , and then suddenly the undead came crashing through the other door on the far side of the office !
With a freshly zombified Jason in tow , they lurched towards the two humans , who backed into a corner together as the professor bravely spoke .
“ Fear not , Billy ! ” Eliza exclaimed theatrically .
“ As long as we do n’t make any grammatical errors when we speak , we will be just fine ! ”
“ You ’re right , Professor ! ” Bill said , brazenly .
He was feeding off of her bravado , making him feel more empowered , and more dramatic as a side effect .
“ I realize now , based on what you ’ve told me , that there is nothing to be afraid of ! ”
The zombies stopped suddenly , slowly turning and staring with their undead eyes , fixating on Billy .
Eliza stared a Billy in horror .
“ Billy … did you just … end your sentence … with a preposition ? ”
A variety of emotions passed over Billy ’s face as he slowly realized his mistake .
“ No … I said that I was afraid with … I mean , I … SHIT ! ”
Billy frantically looked for an opportunity to run , but it was far too late .
The group of living dead tore Billy apart limb by limb , eating his insides and splashing Eliza with blood and guts and she stood by , frozen in fright and looking away in horror .
The group , having finished their meal and having no reason to attack Eliza , began to shamble away aimlessly .
Eliza , sobbing , could n’t help but deliver one last dramatic line for her fallen comrade .
“ Oh , Billy !
Hopefully your death will not be in vain ! ”
The undead zombies stopped abruptly in mid-shuffle and turned back to look at Eliza .
She sneered at them .
“ Keep moving , you assholes .
According to the American Writer ’s Association as of 2005 , using ‘ hopefully ’ at the beginning of a sentence is no longer considered a dangling participle . ”
The zombies looked at one another , nodded and grunted begrudgingly , and continue their slow walk out the door of the office , leaving Eliza alone in the suddenly - quiet room .
Taking a moment to compose herself , Eliza wiped the gore off of her face and stood tall .
Speaking to no one in particular , she dramatically stated : “ I see now that it is up to me to save the world .
However , instead of amassing guns and teaching violence , I know now I must amass English textbooks and teach proper grammatical contexts .
We can win this war …with our mouths ! ”
Determined and with purpose , Eliza strode towards the door of the office .
A few feet from the door , she tripped and stumbled over something unseen on the ground .
Her dramatic trance broken , she looked down , exclaiming “ Shit !
Where did that piece of entrails come from ? ”
In the distance , she heard the pack of zombies groan and heard the shuffling of their feet approaching .
Realizing her grammatical mistake made in a moment of panic , she tried to backtrack , stammering : “ I mean , did this piece of entrails from come … where …oh , fuck it ! ”
She ran off to begin the resistance movement , knowing that she was a marked woman in the eyes of …THE GRAMMAR ZOMBIES !

A while ago Tim Bray had a project called the Wide Finder to collect implementations of a log parsing problem in different languages to see which ones made it easy to take advantage of massively - parallel hardware .
The idea is to accept a web server log file and return statistics for which pages have been requested the most .
Yesterday he posted a follow - up in Clojure using refs .
While his version is interesting for someone just getting into the language because it uses refs ( probably the shiniest piece of the language ) , I think a map / reduce approach is a little more idiomatic since it can be done with no explicit state change .
I 'll step through my implementation piece - by - piece .
Note that it is naïve and could be optimized for speed at the expense of straightfowardness , especially with regard to reading from disk ; my intent here is simply to explain the functional approach .
Update : Commenters have posted a version that totally smokes my agent - based implementation in terms of performance and simplicity .
I 'm leaving mine up because I think it 's a fun romp in the land of higher - order functions ; if you think having higher - order functions means " I can pass a block to Array # map in Ruby " then you 're in for a treat .
If you are looking for a hard - core walkthrough of high - performance coding , your best bet is Alex Osborne 's blog post on Wide Finder .
( ns wide .
finder " A basic map / reduce approach to the wide finder using agents .
Optimized for being idiomatic and readable rather than speed . " ( :use [ clojure.java.io :only [ reader ] ] ) )
Every Clojure file opens with a call to the ns macro .
This defines a namespace ( wide .
finder ) and states any dependencies it may have on other namespaces , in this case the reader function from the clojure .
java.io namespace .
Omitting the :only clause would cause it to make all the io vars available in this namespace , but it 's usually better to be explicit about what you need .
We 'll start with the entry point .
The find - widely function below takes a filename and a number of agents to work with .
Agents can be thought of as independent asynchronous workers that share a thread pool and keep a single state value .
They are initialized with the agent function that takes a starting state .
We 'll be using each agent to keep a map of pages to hit counts , so we map this function over a list of n empty maps generated by repeat to get our list of initialized agents .
( defn find - widely [ filename n ] ( let [ agents ( map agent ( repeat n {} ) ) ] ( dorun ( map # ( send % 1 count - line % 2 ) ( cycle agents ) ( line - seq ( reader filename ) ) ) ) ( apply await agents ) ( apply merge - with + ( map deref agents ) ) ) )
Once the agents are initialized , we send them work .
Our line - seq sets up a lazy sequence of lines from the file .
We map over this sequence together with an infinite loop of the agents we construct using cycle .
The map function can loop over multiple sequences in parallel and will stop when the shorter one runs out , so this is just a way of pairing each line in the file with an agent in a round - robin fashion .
( dorun ( map # ( send % 1 count - line % 2 ) ( cycle agents ) ( line - seq ( reader filename ) ) ) )
The code that does the mapping is the anonymous function #( send % 1 count - line % 2 ) , which adds a call to the count - line function to the agent 's internal queue .
This could be written in more traditional lambda form as ( fn [ a line ] ( send a count - line line ) ; the # ( ) form is simply shorthand .
The count - line function will be called with two arguments : the agent 's current value and the next line in the seq .
That function will return a new value for the agent .
( doseq [ a agents ] ( await a ) )
Once all the work has been queued up , it 's necessary to call await on each agent to make sure it has a chance to finish its queue .
If we used map here , it would be a no - op , since map merely creates a lazy sequence ; it does not actually perform the function calls until the value is needed .
Since it 's not in the tail - call position , the value would simply be discarded .
Note that the same problem would occur in the previous call to map , but wrapping it in a dorun call forces the lazy seq to be evaluated .
( apply merge - with + ( map deref agents ) )
Once that 's done we can call deref on each agent to get its value .
But this gives us n maps rather than a list of totals , so we need to merge the values .
merge - with is a special case of reduce that assumes it works on a sequence of maps and merges key collisions using the provided function , in this case + .
This gives us a map of page names to hit counts .
( defn count - line [ counts line ] ( if - let [ [ _ hit ] ( re-find # " GET /( \d+ ) " line ) ] ( update - in counts [ hit ] inc - or - init ) counts ) )
Finally we have the function that actually performs the counting .
As mentioned , it takes an agent 's state ( which is the current map of pages to hits ) and a line from the log file .
If the line matches the regex # " GET /( \d+ ) " , then we return an updated version of the counts map that increments the entry corresponding to the hit .
The other interesting thing here is that if - let uses destructuring : by binding the return value of re-find to a vector form , it splits the value in two .
The first element ( the full matched string ) is bound to the unused _ local , and the second element ( the match group corresponding to the actual page path ) is bound to hit .
( defn inc - or - init [ i ] ( if i ( inc i ) 1 ) )
The only piece left is the tiny inc -or - init function that increments the counter given it but treats nil as zero .
This would be unnecessary if we could construct hash - maps with custom default values , which a perusal of the implementation of PersistentHashMap.
java seems to indicate is supported , though it 's not exposed anywhere through a Clojure function .
This is the piece of the puzzle that I 'm the least happy with , but it may be possible to eliminate it .
In any case , this is a simple example of how to break up a commonplace problem using a classic map / reduce strategy and immutable data structures .
I have no idea how it compares in terms of performance to the other Wide Finder implementations since the logs I have for this site are not exactly the hundred - megabyte blockbuster kind of logs that ongoing enjoys , but the fact that it can be parallelized in twelve lines is a testament to the expressiveness of the language .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
The underground or “ black ” economy is rapidly rising , and the fault is mainly due to government policies .
Here is the evidence .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ( FDIC ) released a report last week concluding that 7.7 percent of U.S. households , containing at least 17 million adults , are unbanked ( i.e. those who do not have bank accounts ) , and an “ estimated 17.9 percent of U.S. households , roughly 21 million , are underbanked ” ( i.e. , those who rely heavily on nonbank institutions , such as check cashing and money transmitting services ) .
As an economy becomes richer and incomes rise , the normal expectation is that the proportion of the unbanked population falls and does not rise as is now happening in the United States .
Tax revenues are falling far more rapidly at the federal , state and local level than would be expected by the small drop in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) and changes in tax law that have occurred since the recession began .
The currency in circulation outside the U.S. Treasury , Federal Reserve banks and the vaults of depository institutions - that is , the currency held by individuals and businesses - has grown by 13.3 percent in the last two years , while real nominal ( not inflation - adjusted ) GDP has not grown at all , and real ( inflation - adjusted ) GDP incomes have fallen by more than 3 percent .
With the growth of electronic means of payment and financial service providers , it would be expected that the currency component of GDP would fall , not rise .
The underground economy refers to both legal activities , such as often found in construction and services industries where taxes are not withheld and paid , and illegal activities , such as drug dealing and prostitution .
Countries such as the United States , Switzerland and Japan historically have had relatively small , nonreporting and / or illegal sectors , a typical estimate being 13 percent of GDP .
Most European countries have had somewhat larger underground sectors ( typically 20 percent or so ) in part because of the desire to escape higher tax rates .
Italy and some of the other Southern European countries are believed to have underground sectors that account for 30 percent or more of all economic activity .
I recall an Italian finance minister telling a few of us at a meeting a couple of decades ago that , for policy purposes , he assumed that “ the economy was 40 percent larger than what was reported . ”
In some developing countries and / or highly corrupt countries , underground or “ off the books ” activities are estimated to be as high as 70 percent of all economic activity .
The FDIC report about the size of the unbanked or underbanked sector in the U.S. should be of concern because those who do not use the banking system often have to pay higher fees to cash checks , pay bills ( e.g. , money orders , etc. ) , or transmit funds .
People who keep their savings in cash at home rather than in banks make themselves easier prey for criminals and are more likely to lose their money to fire , flood , or just neglect .
Not surprisingly , a majority ( 71 percent ) of the unbanked have household incomes of less than $ 30,000 per year .
There are many reasons people do not have bank accounts .
Banks , because of the “ know your customer ” and other anti-money laundering regulations , make it difficult for nonestablished people , such as the young and transient , as well as legal and illegal immigrants , to open bank accounts .
Also , many of these same regulations are responsible for the rise in bank fees , which are a particular burden for low - income people .
You can be sure that every time Congress passes some new law or the IRS implements some new regulation to “ get tax cheats , ” much of the real burden of these compliance costs will fall on those least able to afford it , while those intent on finding their way around it will do so .
People also avoid having bank accounts because they are vulnerable to asset seizure , judgments , levies , etc .
Increasingly , bankers and others who provide financial services are forced by governments to spy and snitch on their own customers , and this is a real turnoff for many people , which causes them to find other ways of maintaining financial privacy .
Many studies have shown that when people believe the taxes they are required to pay are reasonable and the political leaders tend to spend their tax dollars wisely , tax compliance rises , and vice versa .
In the United States , there is increased evidence that many tax dollars are not being spent wisely and are often used to pay off political cronies .
Over the past year in particular , the public has become aware that many in Washington who advocate higher taxes and argue that everyone has a responsibility to pay taxes are themselves not complying with the tax laws and regulations .
When you have a secretary of the Treasury and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee ( the tax writing committee ) accused of cheating on their taxes , it greatly undermines the moral authority of the tax collectors , making the common citizens feel like chumps and , hence , much more willing to try to legally avoid or illegally evade taxes themselves .
The evidence is unambiguous ; governments cannot increase tax compliance and decrease the size of the underground economy by ever increasing and more onerous regulations .
It is no accident that those governments that allow their citizens a high degree of personal and financial liberty , including financial privacy , and spend taxpayer dollars wisely , honestly and competently , have much smaller underground sectors than corrupt and oppressive governments .
Washington , take note .

LOS ANGELES , Calif. , Nov. 20 ( SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE ) — Craig X Rubin faces years in prison and another trial at the taxpayers expense , as cannabis is something most Californians think should be legal .
Recent polls show that 74 percent of residents in California favor taxing and regulating the herb , as opposed to prosecuting offenders .
Most Americans know Craig from his stint on Showtime ’s “ Weeds , ” or one of the many films he ’s been in , from Super High Me to Totally Baked ; but they might soon know him by his prisoner number , as he is facing five years in prison in just a few days .
Rubin is a proponent of pot , having contributed to the final wording of Proposition 215 ; this real life pastor and college teacher is a graduate of UCLA .
He is a full - time pastor at the Family Church in Pasadena and teaches a course to students at the Union Bible College called , The Jewish History of the New Testament , where he emphasizes the fact that the New Testament writers and Jesus himself were all Jewish .
Rubin is more than upset about the arrest , having spent seven days in jail where he dropped 16 pounds , claiming that he did n’t eat for seven days .
Rubin is not claiming he was n’t fed , but saying the food was n’t consumable .
Rubin has a lot of complaints saying , “ This prosecution is completely political retribution because of my outspoken stance in favor of cannabis against city officials who waste taxpayers money . ”
Rubin has named DEA agents by name as being petty thieves when his Temple 420 was raided three years ago and has the video to back up his statements ; he has named the officer who testified against him as a perjurer and again has video evidence ( that was not allowed in court ) ; he is an outspoken critic of LAPD Narcotics Division , who Rubin alleges have stolen millions of dollars from people they arrest , pointing out that drugs are a cash business and the temptation is great .
Recently he and another pastor did an investigation of Building and Safety officers in Los Angeles and uncovered what appeared to be the taking of bribes as well as death threats from city employees writing on public web sites about shooting their city managers and fellow co-workers ; pointing out when this goes down who is going to say , there were red flags .
“ The city does n’t look into any of this stuff , but goes after the person uncovering it , ” claims Rubin .
Rubin claims he was given permission by the probation department and Judge Drew Edwards on May 15 , 2008 , in the court where he was convicted of possessing and selling marijuana , to own and operate a marijuana facility ( club ) .
Trutanich has proposed a law that would affect only Rubin as it is already illegal to own and operate a medical pot club while on probation without judges ’ and probation ’s permission ; but a new proposed ordinance would now make it law .
The only person of the 1,400 clubs in Los Angeles this changes things for is Rubin .
The Pastor was given permission by the probation department and even has an email from Asha Greenberg dated October 21 , 2009 stating , ” We have no intention to prosecute at this point . ”
Rubin says of the prosecution , “ It is unjust , as I would have been closed had it not been for the email from Asha Greenberg the day before saying she was n’t going to prosecute . ”
At court it was testified to that Asha Greenberg , Deputy District Attorney , was the one who initiated the arrest of the pastor less than 24 hours after writing they would n’t prosecute for zoning violations .
The entire investigation is dedicated to the fact that Rubin is unlicensed , when in fact he is licensed , and showed officers that fact on the day of the arrest ; so they changed the charges to alleged child abuse — charges the judge immediately threw out the first day in court saying , “ It is obvious to the court that Rubin went out of his way to protect the young man and make ( sure ) he was never near marijuana . ”
Rubin , on the day of his arrest , his day off , picked up a young man from his church and took him to buy a suit , shoes and a dress shirt .
He then stopped by his wife ’s T - shirt shop ( Tara ’s , at 2366 Robertson Blvd. ) to get the kid a T - shirt .
Rubin owns a medical marijuana club next door to his wife ’s shop .
Two police officers entered the shop and asked if the owner of the medical club was in .
Rubin , having been there for only five minutes , greeted the men , explained how he ran a church - run cannabis dispensary , invited them to his church in Pasadena and offered to answer any of their Bible questions .
After presenting ID showing they were qualified patients to buy medical marijuana , which was verified by Dr. James Eisenberg a licensed Calif .
M.D. , the police then asked to go next door .
Since it was Rubin ’s day off he did not join them , but stayed with the young man from his church .
Within minutes officers entered Rubin ’s wife ’s store without a warrant , claiming because Rubin was there it suddenly gave them the right to search the place .
That would be akin to searching Macy ’s because someone on probation was there .
Officers pointed a loaded weapon at the head of an unarmed 11 - year child who ran from them and then asked the boy to handle strange pit-bulls that he had never met before .
Officers then searched Tara Rubin ’s business without a warrant and arrested the mayoral candidate on charges of alleged “ child abuse . ”
When the preliminary hearing came about , it was obvious the DA could n’t make a case for child abuse and Rubin had all valid permits to be operating his medical marijuana club , which the pastor operates as a church ; but it seems that the Constitution does n’t mean anything these days anyway .
At Rubin ’s last trial the judge ruled Rubin could not even mention the U.S. Constitution for fear it “ might confuse the jury . ”
In the current case the DA is now claiming that Rubin is not a qualified caregiver and therefore should go to jail for years .
Rubin , a Glenn Beck fan , says “ Our Constitution is gone anyway when government agents can get normal law abiding citizens to do acts they are told are legal and then arrest them for it . ”
Rubin had permission from a judge , the probation department , a license from the City of Los Angeles for Selling Medical Marijuana , and he paid his taxes for the medical marijuana he sold on time .
Rubin does n’t understand where the crime is ; but the taxpayers of Calif .
could be paying to lock him away for up to 12 years starting this Monday if Steven Cooley and Carmen Trutanich get their way .
Rubin wo n’t see the last four of his seven children graduate high school .
Cooley recently stated , “ 100 percent of medical marijuana clubs are illegal , ” and has decided to start with the prosecution of the Pastor and his church once again .
Rubin ’s wife and children are currently living in a hotel as the city has once again taken all of the money the family had .
The pastor is sleeping on the floor of his church as he tries to sell the lease and raise money for his family prior to his incarceration .
Says Rubin , “ Personally , I think Cooley and Trutanich should spend a week in County Jail .
They stole the money my wife worked for over the last six months and the funds were in no way commingled with the church ’s money .
These guys are thieves stealing peoples lives savings without a hearing prior to any conviction . ”
The DA ’s office is acting like a criminal organization threatening to jail council woman Jan Perry , going after homeless people , threatening one of the city ’s best corporate contributors ( AEG ) and now trying to lock up a pastor with a licensed church , a specialty permit who is only trying to help sick people .
At what point does America start to look like the Soviet Union ?

We recently reported on FOX's Seth MacFarlane variety show Family Guy Presents : Seth & Alex 's Almost Live Comedy Show - and how it was part of an " ambitious and unique marketing collaboration " with Microsoft to help showcase the best of Windows 7 .
Well now , according to Variety , Microsoft has dropped out of the partnership after their executives were shocked by the Family Guy - style humor they heard at the October 16th taping of the special .
Never+ones+to+offend .
Straight from the " what were they thinking ?
files , it looks as if the execs were not prepared for jokes about the deaf , the Holocaust , incest and feminine hygiene .
In short , it seems like none of them had ever actually watched an episode of Family Guy before .
The special will still air as planned , on November 8th , but with a different , TBD corporate partner .
" We initially chose to participate in the Seth and Alex variety show based on the audience composition and creative humor of ' Family Guy , ' but after reviewing an early version of the variety show it became clear that the content was not a fit with the Windows brand , " said a Microsoft spokesperson .
" We continue to have a good partnership with Fox , Seth MacFarlane and Alex Borstein and are working with them in other areas .
We continue to believe in the value of brand integrations and partnerships between brands , media companies and talent .
" Microsoft might be done with the " Almost Live Comedy Show , " but the rest of the marketing deal , some of which still includes Family Guy , remains in place .
Hong Kong , China ( CNN ) -- New Zealand is preparing for some rare spring visitors .
More than 100 icebergs that were first spotted off the coast of Macquarie Island , an Australian territory around 900 miles south east of Tasmania , are now thought to be only 200 miles away from New Zealand 's south coast .
This is only the second time in 78 years that large Antarctic icebergs have been sighted so far north .
The previous occasion was in late 2006 when icebergs could be seen from the eastern coast of New Zealand 's South Island , even from the hills around Christchurch .
Have your say at COP15 -- Join the CNN / YouTube debate
According to National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research ( NIWA ) , which is tracking the icebergs by satellite , the largest one is thought to be 500 meters wide , 50 meters tall and with a total thickness of 350 meters .
There are an estimated 100 main icebergs heading for New Zealand and possibly hundreds of smaller ones that form around them as they break up .
Only around 10 percent of an iceberg is visible above the water level , making them a hazard to shipping .
In response Maritime New Zealand issued an alert to shipping in the area , which is home to many deep - sea fishing fleets as well as cruise ships and cargo freighters that port in Invercargill on the southern coast of New Zealand .
" While the size of the icebergs has attracted a lot of attention , it is not unusual for icebergs to be found in these waters , " a spokesperson for Maritime New Zealand told CNN , who continued to say that alerts for smaller icebergs are not uncommon .
But a half - kilometer wide iceberg visible from New Zealand 's coast would represent a very rare occurrence .
" An iceberg that size this far north is pretty significant , " Philip Duncan , Head Weather Analyst of the New Zealand - based Weather Watch Center told CNN .
It is thought that the current flotilla of icebergs came off the Ross Ice shelf between 2000 and 2002 , the same period that produced the 2006 icebergs .
The question now is what caused the huge fresh water icebergs to break off from an Antarctic Ice shelf and what has allowed them to travel so far north .
" A lot of people are saying it was due to a very cold snap a few years ago in Antarctica that caused more ice than usual and the outer regions of that ice snap off each summer , " said Duncan .
" It 's too hard to say whether it 's global warming .
We 're really looking at an isolated incident .
These things move very slowly and they take a long time to circle around the Antarctic .
It takes a certain current and wind direction to bring them up to New Zealand .
" It may be we 've just seen a particular weather pattern repeat itself over the past few years , which means we 've seen icebergs [ off the New Zealand coast ] twice , or it may be something bigger .
But I would n't put it down to global warming just yet , " said Duncan .
The currents that have taken the icebergs so far north mean that their now doomed to melt in warmer waters .
NIWA estimate that the bigger icebergs will last between six and eight weeks depending on where they go .
If the 2006 occurrence is any guide the icebergs could provide a mini boom for tourism in southern New Zealand .
Three years ago light aircraft companies provided viewing flights and helicopters businesses landed visitors on some of the larger icebergs .
In a publicity stunt for a New Zealand wool company a prize sheep was shorn on one of the massive floating pieces of ice .
Last week , I found myself at yet another think tank - type meeting about Afghan policy choices .
Toward the end , one of the participants , who had long experience in government , asked a deceptively simple question :
What would happen if we failed ?
First , the question requires a definition of failure .
As I ’ve argued , in my view , a purpose of American policy in Afghanistan ought to be to prevent a second coercive Taliban revolution in that country , not only because it would bring misery to Afghans ( and , not incidentally , Afghan women ) but because it would jeopardize American interests , such as our security against Al Qaeda ’s ambitions and our ( understandable ) desire to see nuclear - armed Pakistan free itself from the threat of revolutionary Islamist insurgents .
So , then , a definition of failure would be a redux of Taliban revolution in Afghanistan — a revolution that took control of traditional Taliban strongholds such as Kandahar and Khost , and that perhaps succeeded in Kabul as well .
Such an outcome is conceivable if the Obama Administration does not discover the will and intelligence to craft a successful political - military strategy to prevent the Afghan Taliban from achieving its announced goals , which essentially involve the restoration of the Afghan state they presided over during the nineteen - nineties , which was formally known as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan .
What would be the consequences of a second Islamic Emirate ?
My scenarios here are intended analytically , as a first - draft straw - man forecast :
The Nineties Afghan Civil War on Steroids : Even if the international community gave up on Afghanistan and withdrew , as it did from Somalia during the early nineties , it is inconceivable that the Taliban could triumph in the country completely and provide a regime ( however perverse ) of stability .
About half of Afghanistan ’s population is Pashtun , from which the Taliban draw their strength .
Much of the country ’s non-Pashtun population ardently opposes the Taliban .
In the humiliating circumstances that would attend American failure , those in the West who now promote “ counterterrorism , ” “ realist , ” and “ cost - effective ” strategies in the region would probably endorse , in effect , a nineties redux — which would amount to a prescription for more Afghan civil war .
A rump “ legitimate ” Afghan government dominated by ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks would find arms and money from India , Iran , and perhaps Russia , Europe and the United States .
This would likely produce a long - running civil war between northern , Tajik - dominated ethnic militias and the Pashtun - dominated Taliban .
Tens of thousands of Afghans would likely perish in this conflict and from the pervasive poverty it would produce ; many more Afghans would return as refugees to Pakistan , contributing to that country ’s instability .
Momentum for a Taliban Revolution in Pakistan :
If the Quetta Shura ( Mullah Omar ’s outfit , the former Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan , now in exile in Pakistan ) regained power in Kandahar or Kabul , it would undoubtedly interpret its triumph as a ticket to further ambition in Pakistan .
Al Qaeda ’s leaders , if they survived American drone attacks , would encourage this narrative and support it as best they could .
The Pakistani Taliban would likely be energized , armed and financed by the Afghan Taliban as they pursued their own revolutionary ambitions in Islamabad .
In response , the international community would undoubtedly fall back in defense of the Pakistani constitutional state , such as it is .
However , the West would find the Pakistan Army and its allies in Riyadh and perhaps even Beijing even more skeptical than they are now about the American - led agenda .
In this scenario , as in the past , Pakistan ’s generals would be tempted to negotiate an accommodation with the Taliban , Afghan and Pakistani alike , to the greatest possible extent , in defiance of Washington ’s preferences .
The net result might well be an increase in Islamist influence over the Pakistani nuclear arsenal , if not an outright loss of control .
Increased Islamist Violence Against India , Increasing the Likelihood of Indo - Pakistani War : The Taliban and Al Qaeda are anti-American , yes .
But they are equally determined to wage war against India ’s secular , Hindu - dominated democracy .
The Pakistani Taliban , whose momentum would be increased by Taliban success in Afghanistan , consist in part of Punjab - based , ardently anti-Indian Islamist groups , such as Lashkar - e - Taiba , which carried out the spectacular raid on Mumbai a year ago .
The probable knock - on effect of a second Taliban revolution Afghanistan would be to increase the likelihood of irregular Islamist attacks from Pakistan against Indian targets — not only the traditional target set in Indian - held Kashmir , but in New Delhi , Mumbai , and other cities , as has occurred periodically during the last decade .
In time , democratic Indian governments would be pressed by their electorates to respond with military force .
This in turn would present , repetitively , the problem of managing the role of nuclear weapons in a prospective fourth Indo - Pakistani war .
Increased Al Qaeda Ambitions Against Britain and the United States : Deliberately , I would list this problem as fourth in severity in my initial straw - man forecast .
Al Qaeda ’s current capability to carry out disruptive attacks on American soil is very low .
Still , it is absurd to think , as some in the Obama Adminsitration apparently have argued , that Al Qaeda would not be strengthened by a Taliban revolution in Afghanistan .
Of course it would .
Whether this strengthening would directly or quickly threaten the security of American civilians is another question .
London might well be more vulnerable than New York during the ensuing five or ten years after an Afghan Taliban revolution .
The Afghan Taliban are essentially inseparable from the Pakistani Taliban .
Because of the size and character of the Pakistani diaspora in Britain , currently , there are about six hundred thousand annual visits by civilians between the two countries , a flow of individuals that is almost impossible to police effectively .
Therefore , as recent terrorist - criminal cases in Britain document , bad guys periodically get through the border .
By comparison , the post - 9/11 American border is much harder for Pakistani - or Afghanistan - originated terrorists to penetrate .
Still , in a civil war - ridden , Taliban - influenced Afghan state Al Qaeda ’s playbook against the United States would expand .
As 9/11 and the current creativity of the regionally focussed Taliban amply demonstrate , their potential should not be complacently underestimated .
If they did get through and score another lucky goal , it is easy to imagine the prospective consequences for American politics and for the constitution .

He might just have to trick Beartato to go on a picnic with him and cut out his heart and bring it back in a little box but then it was actually a pig and Beartato escaped and found a cottage with seven dwarfs and they mine diamonds and he taught them how to love but than Reginald disguised himself as a beggar woman and gave Beartato a poison apple that kind of killed him but the dwarves could n't bear to part with him and buried him in a glass coffin and then a prince comes along and is so struck by his beauty he gives him true loves first kiss which breaks the spell and they ride off into the sunset .

October 22 , 2009 -- Australian Broadcasting Corporation , Queensland --
In September 2008 , the government of Sri Lanka ordered all aid agencies ( including the UN agencies ) to leave the ``northern war zone '' -- inhabited by Tamils -- of Sri Lanka .
Socialist Alliance member Brian Senewiratne explains the history of Sri Lanka and the attacks on the oppressed Tamil people of the north and east .
Following the Sri Lankan government 's war on the Tamil people in 2008 , UN agencies had been delivering food and medical aid to nearly 160,000 internally displaced people ( IDPs ) , i.e. refugees , in the Vanni , the Tamil area just south of the Jaffna Peninsula .
There were 13 aid groups in the region , providing emergency food aid , clean water and sanitation to some 200,000 people living in refugee camps and under trees in this area .
All agencies except ICRC , the Red Cross , left .
A humanitarian crisis is now unfolding .

A couple whose home was placed in foreclosure was charged in California with torturing loan modification agents they believed had swindled them .
Reuters :
As Los Angeles housing advocates launched a campaign warning of mortgage rescue scams , a couple hit by foreclosure are charged with torturing two loan - modification agents they suspected of fraud , authorities said on Monday .
The couple , Daniel Weston and Mary Ann Parmelee , and three other people are accused of luring their two victims to an office where the men were tied up , held for hours and beaten , a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney said .
Police were called after one of the victims managed to escape , said the spokeswoman , Shiara Davila - Morales .
The incident occurred on Wednesday in the town of Glendale , just north of Los Angeles .
Read the whole story here .
The couple believed the victims were doing nothing to help with couple with their loan modification and wanted their money back .
Three other people were also charged for participating in the crime .
This is not the only foreclosure - related violence in the last month .
On September 29 , police in Arizona fatally shot at 64 - year - old man who shot at police and refused to give up his home of nearly 30 years .
Independent warranty provider SquareTrade has released a study of more than 30,000 notebooks tracked through its extended warranty plans — and the results are a little surprising .
Computer makers Asus and Toshiba led the pack in terms of notebook system reliability , with fewer than 10 percent of their systems needing repair after two years , with three - year failure rate projections of about 15.6 and 15.7 percent ( respectively ) .
And who ’s in last place ?
Top computer maker Hewlett - Packard , with more than 15 percent of its systems failing after two years , and a three - year projection forecasting over a quarter of them will fail in three years .
“ While our study found netbook malfunction rates to be trending 20 percent higher than more expensive laptops , the variance between manufacturer is far greater and should be a bigger factor in making a buying decision , ” SquareTrade wrote in its report .
“ Asus and Toshiba laptops failed just over half as frequently as HP , which makes them a solid bet in terms of reliability . ”
Overall , SquareTrade reports that 31 percent of all notebook owners reported a failure to SquareTrade ; about two thirds of those failure were hardware malfunctions , while the remaining third of the failures were reported as accidental damage .
Unsurprisingly , Squaretrade finds inexpensive netbooks have higher failure rates than more mainstream notebook computers — and premium notebook systems have lower failure rates still .
After a year , some 5.8 percent of netbooks had a malfunction , compared to 4.7 percent of mainstream notebooks and 4.2 percent of premium notebooks — that makes the failure rate for netbooks more than 20 percent higher than entry - level mainstream notebooks and 40 percent higher than premium notebooks .
However , SquareTrade does note that netbooks have n’t been on the market very long , so the repair and problem data is still inconclusive .
SquareTrade is in the business of offering independent warranties to consumers .
To produce this data , SquareTrade tracked failure rates for over 30,000 new notebook computers covered by SquareTrade warranty plans .
Although that sample set is self - selecting — there ’s no way of knowing how representative SquareTrade customers are of everyday computer users — the data does suggest significant variations in reliability among computer manufacturers … or significant variations among the way SquareTrade customers select and use different manufacturers ’ products .
And industry darling Apple ?
SquareTrade ranked them number four behind Asus , Toshiba , and Sony , with a two - year failure rate a little over 10 percent and a projected three - year failure rate of 17.4 percent .
Above average … barely .

In one case , British soldiers are accused of piling bodies of Iraqi prisoners on top of each other and subjecting them to electric shocks , an echo of the abuse at the notorious US detention centre at Baghdad 's Abu Ghraib prison .
One claimants says he as raped by two British soldiers , and others say they were stripped naked , abused and photographed .
For the first time , British female soldiers are accused of aiding in the sexual and physical abuse of detainees .

The 33 new cases , which form part of a pre-action protocol letter served on the MoD last week , include allegations of other torture techniques widely employed by the Americans , including mock executions , dog attacks and exposure to pornography .
In one of the most disturbing cases , Nassir Ghulaim , a young Iraqi , says his torture was based on the photographs taken from Abu Ghraib .
He says he was playing football with friends in April 2007 when he was approached by British soldiers in Jeeps .
Their interpreter told two of the Iraqis the soldiers wanted them to go with them to a British base .
When he arrived at the camp his blindfold was removed and he was surrounded by six to eight soldiers , he says .
" The soldiers asked us to pick fights with one another , or fight them .
The soldiers were laughing and taking photos .
The soldiers then made us squeeze together in a pile , while a soldier stood on top of us and shouted and laughed . "
Mr Ghulaim says the soldiers then forced a younger Iraqi male to strip naked and started playing with his penis and taking photographs .
When Mr Ghulaim refused to fight , a soldier kicked him hard on his back and he fell on the floor .
" A soldier started hitting me with a baton on my knees and used an electric baton on various parts of my body , " he adds .
After three days of detention , Mr Ghulaim was freed without charge .
Hussain Hashim Khinyab , 35 , who has three children , was arrested in April 2006 .
He claims that he was badly tortured at the British camp at Shaaibah and later sexually abused by female personnel .
He alleges that when he was moved from solitary confinement to the camp 's detention halls he saw male and female soldiers engaging in sexual intercourse in front of the prisoners .
He says this was done to deliberately humiliate the inmates .
In May 2003 , a 16 - year - old Iraqi was among a group of Iraqis taken to the Shatt - al - Arab British camp to help fill sandbags .
When the Iraqi youth , who wishes to remain anonymous , and his friends had filled the available sandbags , a British soldier indicated that he should enter a room , from where he assumed that he was to retrieve more sand bags , he says .
On entering the room , he claims he saw two British male soldiers engaged in oral sex .
As soon as the two men saw him enter , they started to beat and kick him , he alleges .
When he fell to the floor , one of the men held a blade to his neck while the other soldier stripped him naked .
Although he screamed in protest , the two British soldiers , one after the other , raped him .

In the legal letter to the MoD , Phil Shiner , the lawyer representing all the Iraqis , said : " Due to the wider access of information and disclosure in the US , we do know that sexual humiliation was authorised as an aid to interrogation at the highest levels of the US administration .
Given the history of the UK's involvement in the development of these techniques alongside the US , it is deeply concerning that there appears to be strong similarities between instances of the use of sexual humiliation . "
Mazin Younis , a leading Iraqi human rights activist working in the UK , said a lot of the new cases he had seen included allegations of sexual humiliation techniques which were part of what he said was a wider culture of abuse .
He added : " This is very similar to what was happening at Abu Ghraib and was clearly employed to try to break the will of the detainees .
Hundreds of soldiers must have witnessed this abuse but must either think this was acceptable behaviour or were told by their superiors to turn a blind eye . "
Mr Shiner says that the new cases became known after the British withdrawal from Iraq this year .
He added : " Many of these Iraqis were frightened to come forward and only now have been able to gather the courage to do so .
That is no mean feat given what they have been through . "
An MoD spokesperson said : " Over 120,000 British troops have served in Iraq and the vast majority have conducted themselves to the highest standards of behaviour , displaying integrity and selfless commitment .
There have been instances when individuals have behaved badly but only a tiny number have been shown to have fallen short of our high standards .
" Allegations of this nature are taken very seriously but must not be taken as fact .
Formal investigations must be allowed to take their course without judgements being made prematurely . "
In London , the public inquiry continues to hear more evidence into the death of 26 - year - old hotel receptionist Baha Mousa , who was beaten to death by British soldiers in 2003 .
A post -mortem revealed that he had sustained 93 different injuries .
The testimony : ' They made us pile up like at Abu Ghraib '
Nassir Ghulaim , 24 , a recently married labourer , recalls what happened after his arrest in April 2007 .
" I was playing football with my friends .
We always stood by the main street awaiting someone to pick us up for labour work .
British Jeeps approached us and stopped .
Soldiers got off the Jeeps and headed to us .
They had no interpreter with them .
They pointed to myself and my friend [ Salam ] to accompany them in the Jeep .
They did not force us .
We did not struggle not to go with them as we thought they are picking us for some paid work .
In 2004 they did pick me to do some work in clearing a building .
We were not blindfolded or handcuffed .
After a short drive we were transferred to an APC .
Now they handcuffed us with plasticuffs and blindfolded us .
We had no clue what the reason was for this action .
The APC drove for less than an hour and stopped in a place which we realised later was Camp Akka in Al - Zubayr .
We were taken to a hall where soldiers started stripping us of our clothes .
We were left in just the shorts .
Then we were given some drink which started causing us dizziness and headache .
It may have been a drug of some kind .
They took off our blindfolds and I could see that we were surrounded by seven or eight soldiers .
There were five of us .
They asked us to pick fights with one another , or fight them .
They were laughing at us and taking photos with digital cameras .
They made us squeeze in pile - up , as in Abu Ghraib prison photos , while a soldier stood on top of us and started shouting and laughing .
I felt so humiliated and treated as a toy they messed up with .
They picked further on a younger man who was good - looking .
They made him strip naked and started messing with his penis and taking photos .
On one occasion I refused to pick a fight , then a soldier kicked me hard on my back , which made me fall on the floor .
He started hitting me with a baton on my knees .
Then he used an electric baton on different parts of my body . "
' A soldier exposed herself in front of me '
Hussain Hashim Khinyab , 35 , married with three children , was arrested on April 2006 .
Hussain claims that he was tortured at the British camp at Shaaibah , where he says he was also sexually abused by male and female personnel .
In his statement he recalls : " Soldiers used to play porn movies during evenings and at dawn .
I also noticed that every time I started praying or reading Koran they would play very loud music to distract me and probably other detainees . "
Mr Khinyab , a carpenter , adds : " While squatting in the toilets or in the showers , a female soldier used to expose her breast or parts of her body , or mess with another soldier in a sexual way in front of me .
Another one gestured that she wanted to have sex with me .
I was a practising Muslim and this behaviour was very shameful and humiliating for me .
Also , a soldier in the observation tower used to point the laser spot of his gun at my penis while I was squatting in the toilet . "
He alleges that when he was moved from solitary confinement to the detention halls he saw male and female soldiers engaging in sexual intercourse in front of the prisoners .
He says this was done to deliberately humiliate the inmates .
Later , he claims he was sexually abused by a nurse while he was recovering in hospital .
Hines Ward calls out Ben Roethlisberger for not playing

I just watched Hines Ward on the NBC pregame show and was pretty shocked to hear him discuss the Ben Roethlisberger situation .
Roethlisberger wo n’t play against the Ravens tonight due to a concussion that he suffered last week , leaving the Steelers with third - string quarterback Dennis Dixon , who will make his first NFL start .
Hines was surprisingly candid , as he acknowledged that the Steeler locker room was basically split as to whether Roethlisberger should play .
He never came out and clearly said he supported the decision to have Big Ben sit , and Bob Costas tried his best to get Ward to acknowledge that head injuries like concussions should be treated differently .
In his defense , Ward was trying to explain the mentality of players who want to be on the field if they can walk .
Frankly , it ’s that mentality that necessitates a new policy on concussions , particularly in college and high school where this has become a real problem .
PETAWAWA , Ontario 
As things now stand , when Prince Charles succeeds his mother , Queen Elizabeth II , his many roles will include being the king of Canada .
But as his 11 - day tour of the country with the Duchess of Cornwall , his wife , drew to a sleepy close on Thursday , few Canadians seemed to be looking forward to the day when his face appears on their coins and their laws are proclaimed , as well as their criminals prosecuted , in his name .
The huge crowds that greeted Charles and Princess Diana during the 1980s were absent , frequently replaced by groups , like one at the airport near here , that could be measured by the dozens or , at one stop in Newfoundland , with the fingers of two hands .
When three Canadian government jets carrying the royal party landed outside Petawawa , a town of about 14,600 around 200 miles north of Rochester , N.Y. , no one greeted it other than the staff of the tiny airport .
Charles , wearing a Canadian Army uniform , met informally here with soldiers who had served in Afghanistan , but no spectators stood along the motorcade route .
A gunman opened fire at Fort Hood , killing 13 people and wounding dozens more .

Figure 3 : personal computer
Try to imagine the history of written communications if someone had claimed ownership over the printing press and refused to reveal its secrets in perpetuity .
Obviously we could fall back on quill pens and parchment , but all the benefits of free written expression would be compromised and delayed .
As amazing as it may sound , there are several recent examples of people claiming ownership over basic instruments of intellectual expression .
One of these is the history of Microsoft Corporation , owners of the Windows operating system .
Fortunately for the role of technology in human affairs , Microsoft is about to be superseded by open source programs and operating systems , most notably Linux .
Open Source
Obviously Microsoft has the right to sell its own products , but it does n't have the right to stop competitors from adopting different strategies , or stand in the way of technological evolution .
As it turns out , something called " open source " has overwhelming advantages over the Microsoft corporate plan , to the degree that at the time of writing , we are seeing worldwide adoption of open source programs and methods .
The basis of open source is the idea that computer programs should be readable and modifiable by anyone , sort of like free press rights in which people are at liberty to adopt and modify other people 's ideas ( while granting credit where credit is due ) .
It 's not immediately obvious how businesses can make money with the open source model — indeed we are witnessing a rather painful adjustment to the realities of open source .
But the overall effect of open source has been a shift away from centralized control of technology to a much more open and transparent system in which many more people are allowed to participate and contribute — just as in the history of written communications .
This does n't argue against commercial and profitable activities in computer technology , only that people will make money in a different way .
Future technology companies will accept open source and offer support , training and expertise in new business plans that resemble science more than engineering .
An aside .
Science works only because everything is out in the open , and the benefits of science spring directly from that openness .
This has to do with a kind of efficiency that is unique to science and that depends on openness — bad ideas are quickly exposed , good ones replicated and improved , all due to the public nature of the process .
And very important — secret science is not science at all .
Efforts to practice science behind closed doors tend to produce mediocre results or outright fraud .
Math by Computer
As it turns out , today computer mathematics is in the position of computer software a few years ago , before the advent of open source — a small number of secretive , wealthy vendors of proprietary products , absurdly high prices , many dependent users of these products including scientists and engineers , and a complete absence of openness .
And just as with general computer software , this is all about to change .
I have shown some parallels between computer mathematics and other applications of computer technology , but it 's important to emphasize the differences .
If we study biology using computers , knowing exactly how the computer works is n't very important because the computer can't realistically compromise the outcome .
But if we study mathematics using a computer , it is essential to know exactly how the computer achieves its results .
This springs from a basic difference between mathematics and other sciences — in mathematics we can and should demonstrate the validity of a result by exploring its foundations .
Indeed without this ability mathematics would lose its rigor and standing among intellectual disciplines .
Many mathematicians have argued that computers have no place in mathematics , that they compromise deep understanding of theorems and make mathematicians trust what may be incomprehensibly complex results .
These are real risks , and the remedy is to make the computer 's role in mathematics as transparent as possible .
But computers have already produced many noteworthy results in mathematics , in spite of these cautions .
Two early examples :
Calculus Errors
In the 1960s Melvin Klerer and Fred Grossman began1 a computer project meant to automatically create and test Calculus integrals .
Klerer and Grossman quickly discovered that many existing math textbooks seemed to be riddled with errors .
Naturally enough , at first they assumed that the relatively new computer methods were the source of the errors , but exhaustive testing eventually revealed that the problem actually lay with the textbooks .
In some published tables the error rates exceeded 25 % .
This was a shock for several reasons .
Computers had until then been taken as a lazy person 's substitute for mathematical rigor , and the textbooks being examined were seen as the unimpeachable product of highly regarded professional mathematicians .
Further , engineers responsible for designing bridges and airplanes accepted the tables of equations without question ( on the ground that engineering is n't science , it 's applied science ) .
This and similar results forced a reëvaluation of the role of computers in mathematics .
The Four - Color Map Theorem
The four - color map theorem asserts that a map may be successfully colored by at most four colors ( so that different territories are distinguishable ) , but this idea withstood efforts at proof until 1976 , when Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken proved it using a computer .
This was one of the first computer - assisted formal proofs of a mathematical theorem and it led to much controversy .
The controversy centered around the fact that the proof relied on a computer program that exhaustively tested all 1,936 members of a set of maps meant to represent all maps .
Some argued that this was n't a mathematical proof at all but an exhaustive test of all possibilities — an end run around a mathematician 's presumed responsibility to produce a proof that concisely expresses general principles , and the more concise , the better .
Others argued that only someone with knowledge of computer programming could possibly understand the proof .
Notwithstanding these reasonable objections , projects like the above have had the effect of changing attitudes toward the computer 's place in mathematics , and more recently computers have come to be regarded as a sort of research assistant for pure mathematicians and an essential partner for applied mathematicians .
But over time , the practice of writing small , openly published mathematical programs meant to solve specific problems has been replaced by large , proprietary commercial projects meant to address general problems in an efficient but opaque way .
This is the basis for my comparison with Microsoft — companies like Wolfram Research , publishers of Mathematica , are to mathematics what Microsoft is to computer operating systems .
Figure 4 : Sage graphic output
Figure 5 : Sage graphic output
But the big players in the mathematical software field — Mathematica , Maple and a handful of others — are about to face the same challenge as Microsoft , and for the same reason : the clear advantages of open source .
And in mathematics , the difference between open - source and closed - source is more important , for the reason that any part of a mathematical solution that cannot be fully examined is fatal to the result .
Mathematica
When I first used Mathematica years ago I saw a big improvement in my ability to produce useful mathematics , but I also wanted to use this new tool to improve my understanding of mathematical methods , not just acquire high - level results .
I began to search for a way to make Mathematica show its internal process — for example , to reveal how it transformed a complex equation from one form to another , step by step .
But a thorough search turned up nothing — Mathematica only produced results , with no hint about its methods .
At the time I thought it odd that such a powerful program could accidentally omit something so important .
I eventually realized this design was no accident .
The reason for the omission now seems obvious — Mathematica is only apparently a mathematical assistant .
It 's more accurate to describe it as a costly ( US $ 3,000 in 2009 ) math martinet , a dispenser of results that wo n't brook disagreement or expose its methods .
From a corporate perspective this seems perfectly reasonable , but from a mathematical perspective it is a fatal flaw — no one should expect to use Mathematica 's results as part of a theorem , for the reason that a theorem dependent on Mathematica cannot be broken down to its essentials in the time - honored way .
Sage
As it turns out , there are very promising and active open - source mathematical software projects .
One recent project , the topic of this article , is Sage , a free , open - source project with international contributions and support .
At the time of writing Sage is being actively developed and appears to have acquired a property one might describe as critical momentum — it 's attracting increasing attention and support from many who might instead work on independent projects of lesser scope .
The basic goal of Sage is to provide for mathematics what Linux has provided for operating systems — a medium for free , creative expression , unencumbered by proprietary interests and restrictions .
Not surprisingly , Sage runs most happily on Linux ( but can be made to run on Windows ) .
The entire code base of Sage is open and modifiable in the best tradition of open source , consequently Sage is accessible in ways programs like Mathematica cannot be .
Conclusion
I do n't want to mislead my readers —
Sage is not Mathematica .
There are many things Mathematica can do that Sage cannot ( I provide examples in this article ) .
But a Mathematica license costs about US $ 3,000 ( 2009 ) for unrestricted use , and for perhaps 95 % of mathematical software users that 's an unnecessary expense , or Mathematica 's secrecy may be fatal to the task ( e.g. when publishing both methods and results ) .
I sometimes hear young people say , " How can it have value if it has no price ? "
My reply is that much of reality contradicts this view and many valuable things are free ( like mathematics ) .
Finally , for those who take this position — whatever you do , do n't let your sexual partner hear you saying it .
To put this another way , Mathematica is a black box .
If you only need a result , do n't care how it was obtained and you have US $ 3,000 to spare , maybe Mathematica is the right approach .
But if you cannot afford Mathematica or you need to know how a result was obtained , Sage may be a better choice .
Finally , the existence of programs like Sage puts pressure on companies like Wolfram Research to reduce their prices , to realize there are alternatives and , just as with Microsoft vs. Linux , to rethink how they do business .
None of this is meant to suggest that Microsoft and Wolfram Research do n't have the right to create and sell products to the best of their abilities , and both companies have products with admirable qualities .
But they need to realize there are new players on the field .

It is the first time the sign has been stolen in the camp 's history
The infamous Arbeit Macht Frei sign at the entrance to the Auschwitz Nazi death camp in Poland has been stolen , officials there say .
The sign was taken from above the gate overnight .
Police are looking for the culprits .
It is the first time the sign , made by prisoners , has been stolen since it was erected in the early 1940s .
More than a million people - 90 % of them Jews - were murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz during World War II .
" It 's a terrible thing , " Auschwitz official Pawel Sawicki told the BBC .
" It had to be planned - it 's obvious it was n't someone who just came along to do it , " he said .
The missing sign , which is occasionally removed by officials for conservation work , has been replaced by a replica .
During the Holocaust , hundreds and thousands of prisoners passed under the sign , whose words mean " Work Sets You Free " , but the vast majority were murdered or worked to death .
Recently by Gary North : On Sacrificing for an Idea
I have presented the basics of monetary theory , as developed by Austrian School economists .
A distinct Austrian School theory of money goes back to Ludwig von Mises ’ book , The Theory of Money and Credit ( 1912 ) .
Mises amplified this theory over the years until its culmination in Human Action ( 1949 ) .
His disciple , Murray Rothbard , extended Mises ’ analysis in a series of books , most notably chapter 11 of Man , Economy , and State ( 1962 ) , America ’s Great Depression ( 1963 ) , What Has Government Done to Our Money ? ( 1964 ) , and The Mystery of Banking ( 1983 ) .
What is remarkable about these expositions , especially Rothbard ’s , is how comprehensible they are .
They are not written using technical jargon , algebraic formulas , or complex graphs .
They are presented in a verbal format , argument upon argument , with relevant references to historical examples .
The least accessible of these studies is The Mystery of Banking , in which Rothbard presented the material in a format comparable to other upper - division college textbooks in money and banking .
Compared to the competition , the book is a model of clarity .
Compared to his earlier writings , it is n’t .
This is a testimony to the opaque nature of the standard economics textbooks of the academic world .
The monographs are worse .
The journal articles are worst of all .
I recall the question posed at a Philadelphia Society meeting by George Stigler , in 1974 or 1975 .
“ Why is it that there was not a single article worth reading in any scholarly economic journal last year ? ” Stigler won the Nobel Prize in 1982 .
INCORRECT FIRST PRINCIPLES
I covered five correct premises in Part 1 of this series .
It does not hurt to review them , and then identify their opposites .
1. SOVEREIGNTY .
Sovereignty in the field of economic theory must begin with a theory of property rights .
Mises began here : private property .
All other schools of opinion prefer not to raise the question of sovereignty openly , and especially not early in their expositions .
As the reader learns , they view sovereignty over money as based on the sovereignty of the state .
2. AUTHORITY .
Mises argued that authority over money is derived from the right of individuals to exchange their property .
There is a hierarchy of economic control that is based on individual ownership of the most marketable commodity : money .
Buyers ( sellers of money ) are dominant .
The logic of economics leads to this conclusion .
In contrast , the other schools of economic opinion assume that the state inherently possesses lawful authority over money .
They do not explain why this authority is a conclusion of their economic theory of human action .
They merely assert that politicians or central bankers must retain control over money .
3. LAW .
Mises argued that money evolves within the legal framework of a private property order .
Money evolves out of the right of private exchange and contract .
Pricing is in terms of supply and demand .
The monetary order is the result of human action , but not human design .
In contrast , the other schools of economic opinion see money as evolving within a framework of state control over money .
Supply and demand occur within a legal framework in which the state is allowed to expand the money supply .
They see the monetary order as the product of human action , especially political design .
4. SANCTIONS .
Mises argued that the same sanctions that govern all entrepreneurship should govern the monetary order : profit and loss .
All other schools believe that the national government should license banking and stand ready to protect the banking system from bankruptcy .
This protection rests on the state ’s authority to create money .
5. CONTINUITY .
Mises argued that continuity is preserved through habit , opinion , and the inability of gold miners to mine copious quantities of gold cheaply .
The other schools are all , to one degree or other , hostile to a monetary order based on a metallic standard .
They hold that continuity is best provided by the state .
Mises and the Austrian School economists present their monetary policy in terms of the general laws of the free market .
In contrast their opponents — whose name is legion — argue that monetary policy must be consciously developed and enforced by national governments and government - owned or protected central banks .
This is why non-Austrian theories of money are convoluted .
The theories are in contradiction to the general economic theories offered by the rival schools .
The more convoluted the theory — Keynesian is the example here — the less likely that the public will understand the nature of the shell game going on .
The more these theories are wrapped in the clothing of jargon , equations , and graphs , the less likely that some child will yell from the sidelines : “ The emperor has no clothes ! ”
Why is this the case ?
Because children are not allowed to attend the monetary parade until they have been certified by the state as having completed a state - authorized curriculum .
This curriculum is not grounded in Austrian School economics .
It is grounded in a theory of economic cause and effect that rests on the right of the state to authorize and make mandatory specific curriculum materials .
Over three decades ago , the state superintendent of public instruction of Arizona called his friend and mentor Leonard Read to inform him that he had persuaded the state curriculum committee to mandate a course in free market economics .
Leonard instantly replied , “ I see .
It ’s a compulsory course in freedom . ”
The educational venture was doomed before it got started .
Read knew this instantly .
CONFUSED GRADUATES
The average man in the street has no theory of money , other than this : he wants more of it .
He is easily tempted to make the mistake that all economists other than the Austrians make : a little more money nationally is a good thing .
The man in the street does not need more money .
He needs more of the things money can buy .
This means that he needs greater output .
He says , “ I need more money , ” but he means , “ I need greater output with which to buy scarce consumer goods . ”
The economists say , “ The economy needs more money , ” because they believe that people ’s output can increase only when there is an increase in the money supply .
The state or the state - sanctioned banking system must supply this extra money .
Ask the man in the street if he would be satisfied with the same wage this year if you could show him how to cut his expenses by ( say ) three percent .
If he has any doubts , you could say : “ Remember , you wo n’t get bumped into a higher tax bracket .
You wo n’t pay any income tax on your savings . ”
That would do it .
He would rather have a universal discount coupon than a raise .
Ask a trained economist if he would be satisfied with a flat wage index if you could show him how the country could cut expenses by ( say ) three percent .
He would reject this .
“ Price deflation is bad for the economy . ”
You could add : “ Remember , people wo n’t get bumped into a higher tax bracket . ”
The Keynesian would say , “ That ’s another reason against price deflation . ”
The monetarist would say that price deflation is always bad , so the central bank should increase the money supply by three percent .
“ No , wait , maybe four percent .
Anyway , no more than five percent . ”
The supply - side economist would recommend monetary inflation , and then tell you that price inflation can be offset by cutting top marginal tax rates .
“ Inflate , cut top bracket taxes , and grow . ”
The graduates of our high schools are confused about money .
They are usually humble .
“ It ’s the government ’s responsibility to protect the public . ”
They have never heard of central banking .
College graduates in business or economics are equally confused , and they are equally trusting of government monetary policy .
The Ph.D. in economics trusts the central bank , not the government .
The central bank employs trained scholars like himself .
He prefers to trust them rather than the gold coin standard .
The entire world is confused about ( 1 ) property rights to gold and silver , ( 2 ) the customer ’s authority over money , ( 3 ) supply and demand , ( 4 ) profit and loss , and ( 5 ) the continuity of money ’s value .
It is not surprising that central banks never get shut down or disestablished , not even after they create nightmare hyperinflations .
The victims do not recognize the perpetrator : fractional reserve banking .
The victims of inflation and the boom - bust cycle do not recognize the cause , any more than the victims of the Black Death in 1348 recognized the cause as fleas on black rats , or victims of yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1798 or Memphis in 1878 recognized mosquitos as the killers .
If the physicians did not know , how could the masses have known ?
But economists are not like physicians .
What should we say of economists , who can follow a train of logic ?
Why ca n’t they follow the Austrian School ’s train of logic ?
Because it begins with a supposedly false premise : the principle of the productivity of private property in monetary affairs .
Defenders of central banking reject this principle .
So , they reject Mises ’ Theory of Money and Credit .
Before 1991 brought the collapse of the Soviet Union , defenders of central planning rejected Mises ’ essay , Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth ( 1920 ) .
The basis of the rejection in both cases was the same : their hostility to the principle of the productivity of private property .
The collapse of the Soviet Union brought derisive laughter from academia , worldwide .
The Marxists have never recovered , nor is it likely that they will .
The emperor had no clothes .
No similar derisive laughter has greeted central bankers after their centrally planned disasters have brought economic devastation to tens of millions .
On the contrary , politicians call for more of the same .
The voters are somewhat skeptical , more ready to cry out , “ The emperor has no clothes ! ” Politicians are not .
They know where their bread is buttered , and with what : fiat money for their political action committees .
WHY CONGRESS ABDICATES
The complexity of fractional reserve banking is enormous .
Its processes are deliberately shrouded in mystery .
This is why the Federal Reserve resists an audit by an independent government agency — independent of the FED .
This would be the equivalent of having non-priests enter the holy of holies in ancient Israel .
To reform central banking is to perpetuate it .
To perpetuate it is to accept the fundamental premise of modern economics : money is different .
Money is not governed by the same laws of supply and demand that govern the rest of the economy .
Money requires experts to administer it .
Private contracts are not sufficient .
When we hear that “ monetary policy is too important to be left under the control of Congress , ” why do n’t we hear Congress respond , “ This is a violation of democracy ” ?
Because Congress thinks that monetary policy is too important to be left to citizens who own gold coins .
Congress does not want to have its central bank — funded programs vetoed by gold coin owners who can walk into a bank with digital money and demand payment in gold coins .
Congress tolerates central banking because Congress suspects that citizens would not tolerate Congress if they could veto central bank purchases of government debt .
Members of Congress are confident that they can buy votes by spending newly created money .
They are not confident that this could continue if the public could redeem digital money for gold .
Congress buys votes with fiat money .
It would find it far more expensive to buy votes with gold coins .
What is true of Congress is true of every legislature on earth .
This is why we never see a significant reform of central banking .
Such a reform is not in the self - interest of the elites that have built the modern political order on fiat money .
A JOKE THAT CONVEYS THE TRUTH
Here is an old joke .
A lecturer tells an audience that two things threaten the existence of democracy : widespread public ignorance and widespread apathy .
When his speech ends , one listener turns to the person on his right and asks : “ Do you think he ’s right ? ”
The answer : “ I do n’t know , and I do n’t care . ”
This joke gets to the heart of the matter about as well as anything .
This joke is at the heart of democracy .
Those who benefit directly from government largesse have an incentive to learn how the system works .
They care deeply , so they find out .
In contrast are the masses who will pay just a little per capita for each boondoggle .
They are ignorant of each proposed boondoggle .
They have no cost - effective way to organize against it .
The more anyone knows , the more frustrated he becomes over the ignorance and apathy of the voters .
The cost of organizing masses of voters against a proposed boondoggle is very high .
In contrast , the cost to the special - interest group of paying off Congress through PAC money is low , compared to the potential benefits .
Central banking over the last century has hidden in the shadows of the public ’s perception .
The public knows nothing about how these engines of inflation work .
The voters do not understand what a cartel is .
They do not understand that a central bank is the enforcement agency of a vast cartel of profit - seeking bankers .
The few who took a course in economics were not told by the instructor or the textbook that the economic analysis of cartels applies to every central bank .
This has given modern banking a nearly impervious shield against criticism of the very concept of central banking .
There are critics who oppose this or that central bank policy .
These critics talk to each other , not to the voters .
CONCLUSION
To call for the abolition of central banking in the name of economic theory is to call for the abandonment of economic theory .
It means calling for expensive political mobilization against an unknown institution .
It means imagining that someone will put up the money to change millions of voters ’ minds .
Who will do this ?
Why ?
What results can he legitimately expect ?
A free market built on private property would not allow extensive fractional reserve banking .
It would not allow a central bank .
Bank runs would take their toll .
This is why commercial bankers support central banking .
It is their port in the storm — a storm created by central bank policy .
They think the central bank will protect them from new competition .
It will build a barrier to entry to new banks , the existing bankers believe .
That is exactly what it does .
Then it implements policies that benefit the largest banks .
Such has it been since 1694 .
Such will it be until people voluntarily abandon digital money that is unbacked by precious metals .
The voters do n’t know and do n’t care .
Neither do the depositors .
For as long as the government - funded deposit insurance exists , depositors will not care .
Someday , the system will come unglued , all by itself .
We will then see whether people go to a gold coin standard on their own .
They did not do so after the 1921 — 23 German inflation and the 1933 — 48 price - controlled “ repressed ” inflation .
What will it take ?
I do n’t know .
But I do care .

The 1992 GSE Act was the fuse , and the trillions of dollars in subsequent CRA and GSE affordable - housing loans would fuel the greatest housing bubble our nation has ever seen .
But who lit the fuse ?
Noam Chomsky is the closest thing in the English - speaking world to an intellectual superstar .
A philosopher of language and political campaigner of towering academic reputation , who as good as invented modern linguistics , he is entertained by presidents , addresses the UN general assembly and commands a mass international audience .
When he spoke in London last week , thousands of young people battled for tickets to attend his lectures , followed live on the internet across the globe , as the 80 - year - old American linguist fielded questions from as far away as besieged Gaza .
But the bulk of the mainstream western media does n't seem to have noticed .
His books sell in their hundreds of thousands , he is mobbed by students as a celebrity , but he is rarely reported or interviewed in the US outside radical journals and websites .
The explanation , of course , is n't hard to find .
Chomsky is America 's most prominent critic of the US imperial role in the world , which he has used his erudition and standing to expose and excoriate since Vietnam .
Like the English philosopher Bertrand Russell , who spoke out against western - backed wars until his death at the age of 97 , Chomsky has lent his academic prestige to a relentless campaign against his own country 's barbarities abroad – though in contrast to the aristocratic Russell , Chomsky is the child of working class Jewish refugees from Tsarist pogroms .
Not surprisingly , he has been repaid with either denunciation or , far more typically , silence .
Whereas a much slighter figure such as the Atlanticist French philosopher Bernard Henri-Lévy is lionised at home and abroad , Chomsky and his genuine popularity are ignored .
Indeed , his books have been banned from the US prison library in Guantánamo .
You 'd hardly need a clearer example of his model of how dissenting views are filtered out of the western media , set out in his 1990 's book Manufacturing Consent , than his own case .
But as Chomsky is the first to point out , the marginalisation of opponents of western state policy is as nothing compared to the brutalities suffered by those who challenge states backed by the US and its allies in the Middle East .
We meet in a break between a schedule of lectures and talks that would be punishing for a man half his age .
At the podium , Chomsky 's style is dry and low - key , as he ranges without pausing for breath from one region and historical conflict to another , always buttressed with a barrage of sources and quotations , often from US government archives and leaders themselves .
But in discussion he is warm and engaged , only hampered by slight deafness .
He has only recently started travelling again , he explains , after a three - year hiatus while he was caring for his wife and fellow linguist , Carol , who died from cancer last December .
Despite their privilege , his concentrated exposure to the continuing injustices and exorbitant expense of the US health system has clearly left him angry .
Public emergency rooms are " uncivilised , there is no health care " , he says , and the same kind of corporate interests that drive US foreign policy are also setting the limits of domestic social reform .
All three schemes now being considered for Barack Obama 's health care reform are " to the right of the public , which is two to one in favour of a public option .
But the New York Times says that has no political support , by which they mean from the insurance and pharmaceutical companies . "
Now the American Petroleum Institute is determined to " follow the success of the insurance industry in killing off health reform , " Chomsky says , and do the same to hopes of genuine international action at next month 's Copenhagen climate change summit .
Only the forms of power have changed since the foundation of the republic , he says , when James Madison insisted that the new state should " protect the minority of the opulent against the majority " .
Chomsky supported Obama 's election campaign in swing states , but regards his presidency as representing little more than a " shift back towards the centre " and a striking foreign policy continuity with George Bush 's second administration .
" The first Bush administration was way off the spectrum , America 's prestige sank to a historic low and the people who run the country did n't like that . "
But he is surprised so many people abroad , especially in the third world , are disappointed at how little Obama has changed .
" His campaign rhetoric , hope and change , was entirely vacuous .
There was no principled criticism of the Iraq war : he called it a strategic blunder .
And Condoleezza Rice was black – does that mean she was sympathetic to third world problems ? "
The veteran activist has described the US invasion of Afghanistan as " one of the most immoral acts in modern history " , which united the jihadist movement around al - Qaida , sharply increased the level of terrorism and was " perfectly irrational – unless the security of the population is not the main priority " .
Which , of course , Chomsky believes , it is not .
" States are not moral agents , " he says , and believes that now that Obama is escalating the war , it has become even clearer that the occupation is about the credibility of Nato and US global power .
This is a recurrent theme in Chomsky 's thinking about the American empire .
He argues that since government officials first formulated plans for a " grand area " strategy for US global domination in the early 1940s , successive administrations have been guided by a " godfather principle , straight out of the mafia : that defiance cannot be tolerated .
It 's a major feature of state policy . "
" Successful defiance " has to be punished , even where it damages business interests , as in the economic blockade of Cuba – in case " the contagion spreads " .
The gap between the interests of those who control American foreign policy and the public is also borne out , in Chomsky 's view , by the US 's unwavering support for Israel and " rejectionism " of the two - state solution effectively on offer for 30 years .
That 's not because of the overweening power of the Israel lobby in the US , but because Israel is a strategic and commercial asset which underpins rather than undermines US domination of the Middle East .
" Even in the 1950s , President Eisenhower was concerned about what he called a campaign of hatred of the US in the Arab world , because of the perception on the Arab street that it supported harsh and oppressive regimes to take their oil . "
Half a century later , corporations like Lockheed Martin and Exxon Mobil are doing fine , he says : America 's one - sided role in the Middle East is n't harming their interests , whatever risks it might bring for anyone else .
Chomsky is sometimes criticised on the left for encouraging pessimism or inaction by emphasising the overwhelming weight of US power – or for failing to connect his own activism with labour or social movements on the ground .
He is certainly his own man , holds some idiosyncratic views ( I was startled , for instance , to hear him say that Vietnam was a strategic victory for the US in southeast Asia , despite its humiliating 1975 withdrawal ) and has drawn flak for defending freedom of speech for Holocaust deniers .
He describes himself as an anarchist or libertarian socialist , but often sounds more like a radical liberal – which is perhaps why he enrages more middle - of - the - road American liberals who do n't appreciate their views being taken to the logical conclusion .
But for an octogenarian who has been active on the left since the 1930s , Chomsky sounds strikingly upbeat .
He 's a keen supporter of the wave of progressive change that has swept South America in the past decade ( " one of the liberal criticisms of Bush is that he did n't pay enough attention to Latin America – it was the best thing that ever happened to Latin America " ) .
He also believes there are now constraints on imperial power which did n't exist in the past : " They could n't get away with the kind of chemical warfare and blanket B52 bombing that Kennedy did , " in the 1960s .
He even has some qualified hopes for the internet as a way around the monopoly of the corporate - dominated media .
But what of the charge so often made that he's an " anti-American " figure who can only see the crimes of his own government while ignoring the crimes of others around the world ?
" Anti-Americanism is a pure totalitarian concept , " he retorts .
" The very notion is idiotic .
Of course you do n't deny other crimes , but your primary moral responsibility is for your own actions , which you can do something about .
It 's the same charge which was made in the Bible by King Ahab , the epitome of evil , when he demanded of the prophet Elijah : why are you a hater of Israel ?
He was identifying himself with society and criticism of the state with criticism of society . "
It 's a telling analogy .
Chomsky is a studiedly modest man who would balk at any such comparison .
But in the Biblical tradition of the conflict between prophets and kings , there 's not the slightest doubt which side he represents .
System32 errors are actually pretty serious .
The system 32 folder is big on the running of nearly all your software , so if you have problems with it , there ’s a good chance that very little is working right .
Even worse than that , your Windows program depends on the system 32 folder , so any corrupted files there can cause your whole computer to crash .
I ’m not sure from what you ’re saying what exact system 32 error it is , but that should n’t be an important issue .
It would be if you wanted to spend more time , energy and stress than you really need to .
That is , unless you ’re running a Windows
Me or older , which means it ’s a virus .
Looking for an error in the system 32 files is worse than looking for a needle in a haystack , even if you know what you ’re looking for .
Instead , I suggest you get a registry cleaning program .
My favorite one is here : http://optimize-your-pc.com/regcure/repairing_erro...
It takes all the guesswork out of getting rid of all your system errors .
After you download and install it , it ’s literally just a push of the button to fix everything .
Chances are , it will find problems you did n’t even know you had .
Keep up with it once a month , and you ’ll never see an error message again .
The Neurocritic has compiled a collection of interesting neurological studies where a number of patients seems to have experienced a profound change in their sexual preferences as a result of brain disturbance .
One of the most well - known of these studies is a recent case of a man who was convicted of paedophilia late in life , but was later found to have a brain tumour , and on removal of the tumour his sudden interest in children disappeared .
It reappeared again when the tumour once more began to grow .
The case has raised questions about free will and self - determination in light of the fact that such morally reprehensible acts seemed only to occur when a tumour was affecting brain function .
It ’s importantly to mention that brain damage rarely causes such tragic events , although sexual difficulties , in general , are not uncommon .
Problems can range from difficulties with arousal and enjoyment , to behavioural disturbances and inappropriate behaviour .
In some rare cases , preferences themselves seem to be affected , although it ’s never clear whether it ’s actually that the person has different desires , or whether they always had them but now are , perhaps , less able to stop themselves acting on them .
It ’s easier to think that damage has changed people ’s desires when the behaviour markedly unusual , such as this case of a man who was , to put it bluntly , screwing the coin return tray of a public telephone after brain deterioration .
But one thing we know from the forensic literature and cases of healthy people who accidentally die during sexual practices ( for example , these two ) , is that no matter how strange the attraction seems to you , someone is out there expressing it .
Not all of the cases of changes sexuality after brain damage are where people act outside of the norm , of course .
In one , admittedly , not brilliantly detailed case , an apparently exclusively homosexual man found he developed heterosexual attraction after a stroke .
Sadly , this area is massively under - researched so we really know relatively little about how different aspects of desire , emotional attachment and sexual behaviour are handled by the brain , but these case studies give us a window into the possibilities .

US Defence Secretary Robert Gates wants to improve ' on - off ' ties
China has made dramatic improvements in its military capabilities in space , according to a senior US general .
General Kevin Chilton , commander of US Strategic Command , also said the US would like more information about China 's intentions .
The comments come shortly after China 's air force commander , Xu Qiliang , said military competition in space was a " historical inevitability " .
The two countries have recently been looking to improve military ties .
Speaking to reporters , Gen Chilton said Beijing had made amazing progress in its space programme over recent years .
But he added : " Where they 're heading ... is one of those things that a lot of people would like to understand better . "
Both countries have tried to improve military relations that were recently characterised as " on-again , off - again " by US Defence Secretary Robert Gates .
Last week Gen Chilton hosted a visit to US Strategic Command by Chinese General Xu Caihou , vice - chairman of China 's Central Military Commission , the country 's military decision - making body .
But while the trip was an effort to improve military ties , it is clear the two sides are also expanding their areas of competition into space .
In 2007 China surprised the world by shooting down one of its own defunct weather satellites .
And earlier this week Gen Xu Qiliang said competition in this area would continue .
" Military competition has shifted towards space .
Such a shift is a major trend now , and such expansion is a historical inevitability , " he told state - run media .
" To some extent , if you control space you can also control the land and the sea , and you will be in an advantageous position . "
Politics is full of surprises .
Roberto Micheletti , designated president of Honduras by that country 's parliament , wanted former President Manuel Zelaya to remain in jail in Tegucigalpa while judges and prosecutors formalized the judicial process against him for violation of the Constitution , corruption and misappropriation of public funds .
Curiously , Hugo Chávez , Lula da Silva and Daniel Ortega have made that detention possible .
True , Zelaya is not in a Honduran jail but in the Brazilian Embassy in the capital , but that 's a lot more convenient for the government of Micheletti .
It is unlikely that pro-Zelaya commandos will break into the Brazilian haven to try to rescue him , because he entered it of his own will and , in any case , the responsibility for Zelaya 's physical integrity is now in the hands of Brazil .
The Honduran police need only guard the building 's exterior and control the comings and goings .
At some point , Zelaya will decide to submit to his country 's justice , or maybe he 'll choose to spend a long time under asylum .
Meanwhile , President Micheletti , with remarkable firmness , says that he 's going ahead with the elections planned for Nov. 29 .
Shortly before Zelaya 's return , Panama declared that , if the upcoming Honduran elections are fair and transparent , it will recognize the new government .
That 's the sensible thing to do .
Fortunately , President Ricardo Martinelli is a brave statesman who does n't mind swimming against the current if it is morally justifiable to him .
In addition to being a mechanism for the legitimization of authority , the elections are a ceremony to bury the past and begin a different , more - hopeful stage .
The pluralistic , free consultations in Spain , Portugal and Chile served to put those countries back on track after long dictatorships .
The same happened in Argentina , Uruguay and Brazil .
It would have been madness to deny recognition to the new democratic governments on the grounds that the elections had been conducted by illegitimate and transitory regimes .
The OAS fell into a trap laid by Chávez when it warned that it would not recognize the president elected in Honduras ' next balloting .
Does Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza want to plunge the country into a violent conflict to crown a victor soaked in blood ?
The candidates in those future elections were freely and peacefully elected in open primaries before Zelaya was expelled from power .
They were not imposed by anything or anyone and represent the country 's entire political spectrum .
Now that President Oscar Arias ' healing efforts have failed , what better option than to propitiate an election that can return political normalcy to the nation ?
The State Department has n't acted reasonably , either .
Who in that madhouse decided that it is good strategy to try to discredit a priori the democratic solution for the Honduran crisis ?
How could Zelaya 's return be imposed against the will of the country 's institutions , against the judgment of almost all political parties , the opposition of Christian churches and the rejection of the productive apparatus ?
Is the United States willing to create a sort of protectorate in Honduras and assign 20,000 soldiers to hand the government back to Zelaya against the wish of a majority of Hondurans and the rulings of the Supreme Court but with Chávez 's blessing ?
How can the United States today even consider destabilizing one of the continent 's poorest nations and one of the few societies that genuinely sympathize with its powerful neighbor -- to the point that it sent troops to fight in Iraq -- in a hemisphere that is increasingly dominated by anti-Americanism ?
Following Panama 's announced recognition , probably other countries will do the same .
To their leaders it is evident that what 's best for the Americas is the existence in the continent of stable nations ruled by democratically elected governments that are not under the disastrous influence of Chavism .
That will be the start of a gradual normalization of international relations with Honduras .
In any case , one of the first decisions the new government will have to make is what to do with Zelaya .
Will it grant him amnesty , give him safe conduct or leave him permanently ensconced in the Brazilian Embassy ?
Former Cuban President Manuel Urrutia -- the first chief executive designated by the revolution after the fall of Batista -- spent more than two years secluded in the embassies of Venezuela and Mexico in Havana until Castro granted him safe conduct .
Peruvian President Victor Raúl Haya de la Torre spent five years in the Colombian Embassy in Lima .
It 's a question of firmness .
Do You Dislike Certain Bitter Vegetables ?
Evidence suggests that supertasters are more sensitive to bitter tastes and fattiness in food , and often show lower acceptance of foods that are high in these taste qualities .
Supertasters tend to dislike strong , bitter foods like raw broccoli , grapefruit juice , coffee and dark chocolate .
This may put supertasters at risk for certain cancers that bitter compounds can protect against .
A pilot study on colon cancer conducted at the Wayne State University School of Medicine showed that the number of cancerous polyps a patient had was directly related to tasting ability .

The stumps of 10 rainforest trees , complete with their roots , have been placed around Trafalgar Square to highlight the issue of deforestation .
Laser beams will mark the height the trees would have reached in the wild in comparison to Nelson 's Column .
The legally logged trees will highlight deforestation in countries like their native Ghana which has lost 90 % of its rainforest in the past 50 years .
Ghost Forest , by Oxford artist Angela Palmer , will remain there until Friday .
The installation went up at the central London location in the early hours of Monday morning .
' World 's lungs '
The trees used in Ghost Forest come from the Suhuma forest reserve in western Ghana .
The artist went to a logging camp to locate trees for the exhibit .
Ms Palmer said : " The concept is to present a series of rainforest tree stumps as a ' ghost forest ' - using the negative space created by the missing trunks as a metaphor for climate change , the absence representing the removal of the world 's ' lungs ' through continued deforestation . "
The project has seven indigenous species - Denya , Dahuma , Danta , Hyedua , Mahogany , Wawa and three varieties of Celtis .
The installation , which highlights the threat of deforestation faced by tropical forests , will be shipped to Thorvaldsens Plads in Copenhagen for the start of the UN Climate Change summit in December .

Fossil boffins say that dense triple - canopy rainforests , home among other things to gigantic one - tonne boa constrictors , flourished millions of years ago in temperatures 3 - 5 °C warmer than those seen today - as hot as some of the more dire global - warming projections .
Just like a modern jungle .
Except with bloody enormous snakes .
The new fossil evidence comes from the Cerrejón coal mine in Colombia , previously the location where the remains of the gigantic 40 - foot Titanoboa cerrejonensis were discovered .
The snake 's discoverers attracted flak from global - warming worriers at the time for saying that the cold - blooded creature would only have been able to survive in jungles a good bit hotter than Colombia 's now are .
But now , according to further diggings , there is more evidence to support the idea that a proper rainforest similar to those now seen in the tropics existed at the time of the Titanoboa - despite the much hotter temperatures .
This could be seen as conflicting with the idea that a rise of more than two or three degrees would kill off today 's jungles with devastating consequences for the global ecosystem of which we are all part .
" Rainforests , with their palms and spectacular flowering - plant diversity , seem to have come into existence in the Paleocene epoch , shortly after the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , " says Carlos Jaramillo of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute .
" Forests before the mass extinction were quite different from our fossil rainforest at Cerrejón .
We find new plant families , large , smooth - margined leaves and a three - tiered structure of forest floor , understory shrubs and high canopy . "
Jaramillo and other boffins from the parent Smithsonian Institution in the US probed fossilised leaf remains and identified the plant families Araceae , Arecaceae , Fabaceae , Lauraceae , Malvaceae and Menispermaceae - which are apparently " still among the most common neotropical rainforest families " .
The scientists say that leaf fossil evidence and the very size of the Titanoboa indicate that the jungles of the Paleocene saw temperatures of 30 - 32 °C , as opposed to the 27 °C common in the Colombian rainforest today .
A common goal of global - warming reduction efforts is to limit temperature rises to 2 degrees , though some say this is unachievable and a rise of at least 4 degrees is inevitable .
The well - known Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report of 2007 predicted a rise of 3 degrees by 2100 .
The new research could mean that - assuming the warming arrives on schedule - that the world 's jungles will not turn to desert as is sometimes expected .
Rather , a picture more like that of 65 million years ago might emerge .
" We 're going to have a novel climate where it is very hot and very wet .
How tropical forest species will respond to this novel climate , we do n't know , " senior Smithsonian boffin S Joseph Wright told the IPCC at the time .
Fortunately nobody seems to be suggesting that global warming will see the return of enormous 40 - foot constrictors .
Even the humdrum modern snakes of today 's rainforest occasionally perform gut - busting feats such as scoffing entire jaguars , so Titanoboa would presumably have regarded a human being as merely a light snack .
It 's possible that the lush superwarm jungles of the globally - warmed future might be a bit less diverse than today's , however , as it seems that the old - time ones were .
" We were very surprised by the low plant diversity of this rainforest .
Either we are looking at a new type of plant community that still had n't had time to diversify , or this forest was still recovering from the events that caused the mass extinction 65 million years ago , " says Scott Wing , another Smithsonian scientist involved in the studies .
The scientists say their latest research will be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal shortly . ®

After a state - funded report revealed in August that Texas may have executed an innocent man under the watch of Governor Rick Perry , the Texas Republican currently facing a steep re-election climb was quick to act in his own best interest .
He replaced three members on the key committee charged with investigating the report ’s truth , installing what CNN called a “ political ally ” to head up the Texas Forensic Science Commission .
ADVERTISEMENT
Sunday , the cable news network reported that Perry had moved to replace a fourth member of the commission , reaching the legal limit of how many members he can seat .
The five other members are selected by the attorney general and lieutenant governor .
Perry ’s political ally who now leads the commission was quick to postpone a hearing in which the committee would have heard from the author of the report that suggested Cameron Todd Willingham may have been innocent .
The report from renowned fire expert Craig Beyler , requested by the Texas Forensic Science Commission , also casts doubt on death penalty supporters ’ insistence that there are sufficient safeguards to prevent the innocent from being put to death .
It also raises new calls for the abolition of the death penalty , but has not been released to the public .
Forensic investigations done since Willingham ’s conviction have found no evidence of arson .
Nonetheless , Perry refused to grant Willingham a stay of execution in 2004 , even though credible questions had already been raised about Willingham ’s guilt .
“ Commissioner Alan Levy was replaced by John Bradley , a district attorney who was also named commission chairman .
Aliece Watts was replaced by Norma Farley , chief forensic pathologist for Hidalgo and Cameron counties .
Perry said at the time the replacements were ‘ pretty normal protocol , ' ” CNN reported .
The network added : “ In a statement Thursday , Perry ’s office said he had appointed attorney Lance Evans of Fort Worth to replace former commission chairman Samuel Bassett of Austin , and that Randall Frost of Boerne , chief medical examiner for Bexar County , would replace commissioner Sridhar Natarajan . ”

“ Gov . Perry said that the change was ‘ business as usual , ' ” the ACLU wrote on its blog Friday .
“ Unfortunately , his words ring all too true .
Willingham is not the first likely innocent person executed by the State of Texas .
Others include Carlos De Luna and Ruben Cantu .
But the state has never acknowledged any of these tragic mistakes .
Business as usual , all right . ”
The ACLU statement described the governor ’s timing for the removal of the three commissioners as “ extremely suspicious , to say the least . ”
“ The Houston Chronicle reported Sunday that documents obtained through a public records request indicate Perry ’s office received a fax 88 minutes before Willingham ’s execution detailing an arson expert ’s opinion that evidence used at the man ’s trial was tainted by “ major errors ” and relied on discredited arson examination techniques , ” noted UPI .

The Chronicle attempted to acquire a copy of the report , but the governor ’s office refused to release it .

Canadian brewery Labatt launched a controversial advertising campaign for Labatt ’s Blue de-alcoholized beer , under the slogan “ Leave one out for Santa .
He ’s driving . ” .
It made its debut at 45 Mac ’s stores across the GTA in November and will run until month ’s end .
But some consumers say it sends the wrong message .
“ I do n’t think that ’s quite appropriate , ” said Kathleen Clifford , 65 , who saw the ad at a Mac ’s at Gerrard and Mutual Sts. yesterday .
“ Children see that and they think we ’d better leave beer for Santa instead of cookies and milk . ” she said .
“ I have grandchildren and great - granchildren and I do n’t approve of it .
“ Maybe I ’m an old fuddy - duddy . ”
But Labatt said the message is to remind people not to drink and drive .
“ It ’s reminding people , especially during this holiday season , when people are going out to celebrate , not to drink and drive , ” said Catherine Pringle , corporate affairs manager of Labatt Breweries of Canada .
“ Some of the posters direct people to makingaplan.ca , which is a website to plan ahead and reinforcing people not to drink and drive , ” she said .
Mothers Against Drinking and Driving said it has no problem with it because it ’s alcohol - free beer — even though it actually contains “ 0.5 % or less . ”
Santa may be trading in his plates of cookies and glasses of milk and sucking back cold Labatt ’s Blue this Christmas .

My responses , particularly before my third tour , have always involved leadership , confidence , knowledge of myself and of people in general .
This has n’t changed .
I remain grateful .
Sometimes I feel the pressure of expectation to cast myself as a victim of my experiences , but in truth , I think I ’ve benefited from them .
The Army , and especially the infantry , gives its junior leaders tremendous responsibility .
The rough world of the 82nd Airborne Division was a steep learning curve for me , a freshly minted lieutenant accustomed to the studious habits of Stanford University , of its School of Engineering , no less .
I learned an awful lot and , I think , emerged a better person .
More recently , I ’ve realized some of my beliefs have formed so slowly and subtly that their learning has been entirely unappreciated .
I ’ve learned that no matter what , life goes on — it ’ll do so with or without any one of us — and I ’ve found a measure of respect for selfishness ; for people who look out for themselves and their lives yet to come .
This is surely cynical .
If there ’s redemption in the selfishness , it has to do with loving life , with respecting yourself enough not to end your days prematurely or in futile pursuits .
Yes , I said it .
Somewhere between my second and third tours , I came to believe that our foreign , undeclared wars flouted our Constitution and made us less safe — from terrorism , from debt and from tyranny at home .
Believing this was n’t easy , but I could n’t help it .
Without faith in our military endeavors , my long - held notions about duty , heroism and fighting the good fight did n’t survive long .
If there ’s redemption in selfishness , it has to do with respecting yourself enough not to end your days prematurely or in futile pursuits .
I think you ’re only a hero for as long as your image is useful , as evidenced most dramatically by then - Major George S. Patton ’s cavalry charge against World War I veterans protesting for their pay in 1932 , and General Douglas MacArthur ’s zeal in pursuing them across the Anacostia River even after President Hoover ordered an end to the assault .
If you ’re not troubled by history , you ’re not studying it correctly .
Let ’s choose our role models carefully .
I recognized my ideas about mortality and the false promise of legacy as something learned when I recently described a ceremony at Bagram Air Force Base ( B.A.F. pronounced baff ) to a friend .
I had arrived at B.A.F. en route back to the United States for my mid-tour leave .
Transient housing consisted of a hangar - sized tent absolutely full of bunk beds .
There were clusters of men in Polish uniforms , Egyptian and Jordanian uniforms .
The majority were Americans — Army and Navy .
( I suspect the Air Force found themselves better billeting somewhere else . )
I found a bunk .
One neighbor compulsively called me “ sir ” and told me he returned to B.A.F. to process his U.S. citizenship .
The other never stopped watching movies on his laptop .
In the morning , the P.A. system sounded : “ There will be a fallen comrade ceremony at zero eight five zero .
All available personnel are requested at Disney Drive .
P.T. uniforms and photographs are not authorized . ”
Disney Drive is the two - lane strip of road around which much of B.A.F. seems to sprawl .
It ’s named , like everything else , after a fallen soldier .
The notice sounded several times before I fully woke .
I dressed , dry - shaved and showed up the standard 10 minutes early .
Both sides of Disney Drive were lined by military personnel .
The notice sounded every few minutes .
After 0850 , it changed to “ momentarily . ”
I kept waiting in the line of uniformed strangers .
It was already hot .
I remember when my battalion took our first casualty in Iraq in November 2003 .
At the ceremony , my first sergeant who ’d been wounded on the same mission choked back tears and called roll , repeating our fallen comrade ’s name three time as if his absence was unexpected .
In many ways , it was .
The sharp commands “ Ready .
Aim. Fire . ” broke the silence after the third call of his name , followed by the report of seven rifles .
Then again , “ Ready .
Aim . Fire . ”
Bang !
And again .
Then the lonely , immortal , brassy melody of taps rolled over us from an unseen bugle .
The first sergeant faced about and slowly saluted the empty boots and rifle stuck into the ground by its bayonet .
I felt the enormity of what had happened , and the long shadow of eternity .
I felt the grim dignity of the 82nd Airborne Division , and admiration for what I then recognized as the noble tragedy of the situation .
That was then .
Standing on the side of Disney Drive I felt only hot and tired , and slightly cranky at having shown up early .
What five years earlier had been noble tragedy now appeared to me as wasteful folly .
My sympathies were bitterly reserved for people I knew and people I was forced to know .
I felt an imagined jury pawing at my soul and pleaded with them : Ladies and gentlemen of the court , I answered the call to return to uniform .
Many did not .
I am in Afghanistan ( Again for God ’s sake ! ) and trying to do my job well .
Is n’t that enough ?
Are n’t I entitled to my private feelings ?
Leave my immortal soul out of it !
After a 45 - minute wait , a security vehicle drove by , followed by two Humvees , each bearing a flag - draped coffin , followed by a pickup truck with two cameramen standing in the bed filming .
Everyone saluted as they passed , then went to breakfast , the gym , the bazaar or wherever else .
I mustered only slightly more sympathy for the fallen strangers in those flag - draped coffins than I did for the wounded enemy combatant whose stretcher I helped carry from the helicopter pad to our detention facility in Asadabad .
He wore taped - over goggles ( sandbags have fallen out of fashion since the torture scandals appeared on the radar ) , flex - cuffs on his wrists , and a bandage on his leg which had swollen like a sausage , pulling the skin taught and featureless from thigh to ankle .
I napped after breakfast , lifted weights , ate lunch , took another nap , looked at gem stones in the bazaar , and walked the mile or so to the Internet center , feeling disquiet the whole time .
By chance , an officer from another provincial reconstruction team ( P.R.T. ) found me online .
We were both former infantry officers and good friends .
We ’d been members of a circle of involuntary recalls called “ the captain mafia ” during our pre-deployment training at Fort Bragg .
He told me their P.R.T. lost two guys the day before to an I.E.D. , and apologized for giving me bad news as I left for vacation .
I told him about the ceremony .
I had known the casualties only distantly at Bragg .
We chatted a bit longer and he excused himself for a meeting .
Had I known the coffins carried remote acquaintances from another P.R.T .
I might have seen more of myself in their eternity , but I doubt my reaction would have been much different .
For me , an atheist in church , the ceremony and the sacrifice it represented seemed gratuitous , though from a distance I still recognized it as appropriate ; necessary , too , for the military institution .
I was like the old Italian man in “ Catch - 22 , ” or Hemingway ’s Pablo .
Patriotism gone , I focused on doing what I must to get along , and on not dying .
I told myself there had been and continued to be tragedies and injustices greater than the I.E.D. which killed two distant comrades .
I told myself that everyone in Afghanistan at that point had chosen to be there , including me — we all rolled the same dice .
That was n’t the case in Iraq in 2003 .
I told myself we ’d had a long look at these wars , or at least the opportunity for one and had decided to be here .
I told myself the two dead officers made the choice and other choices too .
I wondered if they made bad ones , which I would n’t make , like neglecting to coordinate with a route clearance package or choosing to go someplace that did n’t need going .
I was very careful in my planning .
Where my sympathy should have been was anger , and a feeling of absolute , positive , beyond a shadow of a doubt certainty that , God help me , I did not want to end up like them .
Legacy be damned .

IT ’S a battle that for a long time looked like being carried alone by the Sunshine Coast .
Capacity , its true meaning and measure , is a concept with which many understandably struggle .
Only 35 years ago , when there was plenty of everything here other than population , opportunity and profit , many were blinkered to the long - term costs of failing to properly plan for growth .
How different and more liveable would the high - density Alexandra Headland strip have been if the council of the day had found the meagre $ 1 million needed in the late 1980s to secure for parkland the mainly vacant land that stretched from Tantula Road down to Alexandra Parade .
How much smarter to have left that coast road as a link to foreshore parks and parking rather than turning it into the drag strip it is today .
And how much wiser would it have been , just less than a decade ago , to purchase vacant riverfront land in Duporth Avenue , Maroochydore , for the cost of the street scaping that was opted for instead ?
By doing so , it would have made sense of the CBD planning conundrum that the council now faces .
Similar opportunities to balance growth with sustenance , of what was once one of the world ’s most diverse ecologies , have been missed or ignored .
The wildflower plains of Kawana Island , which once carried some of the planet ’s oldest living flora , were sacrificed by the state government of the day , which turned Crown land into development leases .
It was a story repeated north of the river as well .
THOSE decisions made by one of our own , then premier Sir Francis Nicklin , could have – except for the will of community warriors , as ex-Maroochy councillor Elaine Green points out in her new book , Green Legends – seen the coastal national parks , which help retain the region ’s character , lost to development .
The first planning scheme for what is now a single region from Noosa to Caloundra is in the making .
Its objectives are to provide a framework for planning that puts the needs of the existing community and the environment on an equal footing with the demands of development .
Maroochy ’s original town planner , Jim Birrell , 82 , wants council to play hardball and make decisions informed by community interest regardless of the cost of potential litigation from developers .
You can say things like that from the sidelines with impunity .
When you are a council under pressure from a state government with a vision for exponential growth , and a prime minister talking up a big Australia of 35 million people within 40 years , things become more difficult .
But while the obstacles remain enormous and many , two reports in the past fortnight have underscored the need for everyone to slow down and more carefully consider consequences of exponential growth .
Last week ’s Healthy Waterways report found the entire south - east Queensland catchment was anything but and in danger of ecological collapse .
Then , this week , a joint federal parliamentary standing committee on the environment and climate change found coastal carrying capacity would be severely mitigated by rising sea levels and weather events .
Climate - change naysayers were dismissive , but that tide is turning .
Any failure to mitigate risk would make the decision - makers responsible and , ultimately , the community liable for future damage to property and loss of life .
The Jennie George committee report recommended that property rights be removed from at - risk land , something the state government ’s own draft coastal management strategy had earlier and specifically ruled out , and signalled a future where it may even be necessary to force people out of their homes .
Prime minister Kevin Rudd quickly followed up , telling business leaders the federal government would be claiming a stake in planning the future of our major cities .
The billions of dollars worth of infrastructure the Commonwealth funds will be dependent on planning that makes cities more climate resilient , more energy and water efficient and which delivers green transport and communication capacity .
Sunshine Coast mayor Bob Abbot was delighted with the George report recommendations for increased coastal vegetation buffers and vegetation corridors for future fauna and flora migration , from a coastline threatened with inundation , and its real focus on keeping future growth out of harm ’s way .
He was not as keen though on Mr Rudd ’s proposal , saying any future urban planning should not be carried out without the Australian Local Government Association at the table .
And he wants any growth focus to consider more than just fixing broken big cities and making them bigger .
Growth , he says , should be pushed away from the low - lying , over - populated coast and back into the country where the bulk of Australia ’s population once lived .
Infrastructure , industry and jobs , coupled with good planning , he said , would be a lure for people who live on the Coast but never go to the beach , to head inland .
The events of the past week have clearly rattled the Urban Development Institute of Australia .
Queensland chief executive officer Bryan Stewart emerged from a board meeting to declare the challenges of climate change as the most complex policy issue facing government .
But he said his members would not tolerate existing development rights being eroded .
“ Government should n’t act precipitously and interfere with property rights ” Mr Stewart said .
“ It ’s too early to do so .
“ There is a need to respect private ownership and existing rights without taking them away arbitrarily .
Our interim view is that we need Commonwealth standards so there is no difference between states .
But having remote Canberra bureaucrats over - ruling local and state levels is not necessary at this stage . ”
Mr Stewart wants more discussion at Council Of Australian Government level to develop a national approach in consultation with the states and local government .
He described the debate over climate - change response as being in its early days .
The problem is that long - term planning decisions being made now impact well into the future , to a time when they may be untenable .
Sunshine Coast Environment Council said this week that the opportunity to factor climate - change risk into the new regional plan was being hampered by state laws that allowed developers compensation in certain circumstances where they lost value on potential development .
SCEC campaigner Annie Nolan said it was outrageous that developers who ignored the science of climate change and pursued development on vulnerable land could be compensated by the local government .
“ Developers should be seeing climate change as a business risk and modifying their practices accordingly , ” she said .
Premier Anna Bligh is dismissive of concerns about the future .
Responding to the committee report and the prime minister ’s call for a national model for the growth of cities , she offered the SEQ Regional Plan and infrastructure plan as an international award - winning model .
Given the state of our waterways and the huge population already at risk of the impacts of climate change and rising sea levels , the Queensland Local Government Association and South East Queensland Council of mayors are understandably less sure .
They have commissioned a detailed report into the region ’s real population carrying capacity , a process LGAQ chief executive Greg Hallam signalled would start in the immediate future .
Population growth is the real elephant in the room .
This week Australian Greens leader Bob Brown called on Mr Rudd to explain the end effect of unlimited growth .
“ Name the final point , ” he asked him in parliament .
“ What is the ultimate carrying capacity of Australia if you say that growth is dependent on population increase ad infinitum ?
The logic of that is that there is no end point , that we not only continue to cram people into this giant country with very limited carrying capacity , but we continue to cram our fellow human beings , all of whom aspire to life and happiness as much as we do , on to a planet which cannot bear it . ”
Outside the senate he said no world leader could ignore the planet ’s population burden .
“ There were three billion people when Kevin Rudd was born , ” Mr Brown said .
“ There are 6.8 billion now .
There will be nine billion by mid-century .
This population boom is not economic wisdom – it is a recipe for planetary exhaustion and great human tragedy .
“ We need the wisdom to have economic growth with a steady - state population at most – this is the new commonsense . ”

What would happen if humans could deliberately create a blackhole ?
Well , for starters we might just unlock the ultimate energy source to create the ultimate spacecraft engine — a potential “ black hole - drive ” — to propel ships to the stars .
It turns out black holes are not black at all ; they give off “ Hawking radiation ” that causes them to lose energy ( and therefore mass ) over time .
For large black holes , the amount of radiation produced is miniscule , but very small black holes rapidly turn their mass into a huge amount of energy .
This fact prompted Lois Crane and Shawn Westmoreland of Kansas State University to calculate what it would take to create a small black hole and harness the energy to propel a starship .
They found that there is a “ sweet spot ” for black holes that are small enough to be artificially created and to produce enormous amounts of energy , but are large enough that they do n’t immediately evaporate in a burst of particles .
Their ideal black hole would have a mass of about a million metric tons and would be about one one - thousandth the size of a proton .
To create such a black hole , Crane and Westmoreland envision a massive spherical gamma-ray laser in space , powered by thousands of square kilometers of solar panels .
After charging for a few years , this laser would release the pent - up energy equivalent to a million metric tons of mass in a converging spherical shell of photons .
As the shell collapses in on itself , the energy becomes so dense that its own gravity focuses it down to a single point and a black hole is born .
The black hole would immediately begin to disgorge all the energy that was compressed to form it .
To harness that energy and propel a starship , the black hole would be placed at the center of a parabolic electron - gas mirror that would reflect all the energy radiated from the black hole out the back of the ship , propelling the ship forward .
Particle beams attached to the ship behind the black hole would be used to simultaneously feed the black hole and propel it along with the ship .
Such a black hole drive could easily accelerate to near the speed of light , opening up the cosmos to human travelers , but that ’s just the beginning .
The micro - black hole could also be used as a power generator capable of transforming any matter directly into energy .
This energy could be used to create new black holes and new power generators .
Obviously , creating and harnessing black holes is not an easy undertaking , but Crane and Westmoreland point out that the black hole drive has a significant advantage over more speculative technologies like warp drives and wormholes : it is physically possible .
And , they believe , worth pursuing “ because it allows a completely different and vastly wider destiny for the human race .
We should not underestimate the ingenuity of the engineers of the future . ”

[ Haskell - cafe ] Re : What is the current state of affairs with supercompilation ?
Hi Eugene , here are some answers : >
I 'm mainly interested in the following : > -
What supercompilers do exist , except for the ones mentioned above ?
We have prototype implementations of supercompilers for both GHC and the Timber compiler , but they are not yet in a suitable form for public inspection .
Neil Mitchell has the source code to Supero available on his homepage [ 1 ] , which I think uses yhc as frontend and ghc as backend .
> -
What academic organizations do research in the area ?
Looking at where the authors of some publications on supercompilation were at the time of the publication gives some hints : - University of York : Neil Mitchell , Colin Runciman - University of Copenhagen : Morten Heine Sørensen , Robert Glück , Jens Peter Secher , Neil Jones - University of Liverpool : Alexei Lisitsa - Russian Academy of Sciences : Sergei Romanenko , Ilya Klyuchnikov - Luleå University of Technology : myself and Johan Nordlander > -
What papers should be read by someone eager to learn about > supercompilation and maybe to make research contributions ?
If you are interested in program optimization , here 's two pointers : - A Positive Supercompiler [ 2 ] - An Algorithm of Generalization in Positive Supercompilation .[ 3 ]
Combine these two and you have a positive supercompiler for a first - order functional language , using the notation that is familiar to the functional programming community .
More recent work on program optimization : - Neil 's thesis [ 4 ] -
There 's a number of tutorials available from the group at University of Copenhagen , all worth a read .
Alexei Lisitsa , Sergei Romanenko , and Ilya Klyuchnikov have used supercompilation to do verification : - Verification as a parameterized testing ( experiments with the SCP4 supercompiler ) . [ 5 ]
- Proving the equivalence of higher - order terms by means of supercompilation . [ 6 ] > -
What are some solved problems and some open problems in > supercompilation ?
The algorithms are quite well - studied with respect to correctness .
There 's less material available on actual implementations , and how to get them to perform well .
I have n't seen anything discussing code explosion and similar practical issues .
I do n't think anyone has mechanically verified the correctness of supercompilation .
This is by no means an exhaustive list of everything , but it 's something to start with .
I hope it helps .

Microsoft started to inform Windows 7
Home users that support for the operating system was about to run out .
From this week on , the notifications will also be shown to users running [… ]
You would n’t immediately suspect that Yelp ’s iPhone app might be a gift bestowed upon us by a benevolent superhero from the future .
Load it up and the program ’s in its Clark Kent garb — a useful - enough guide to local restaurants , bars , and merchants .
advertisement
advertisement
Then you notice a button labeled monocle in the right - hand corner .
Hit it and the screen displays a live feed from the phone ’s camera , showing exactly what ’s in front of you — with one big difference .
Aim the camera at a local storefront and Yelp superimposes a star rating on the image .
Use Monocle in a hot neighborhood , for instance , and point it at every restaurant for a quick appraisal of the best food in the area .
Yelp ’s app is one of the first “ augmented reality , ” or AR , programs to debut on the iPhone , and though it can be handy , it ’s most useful as a sign of what ’s to come .
Throughout the summer , YouTube was the place to see a vision of that future , as programmers from San Francisco to Malmö , Sweden , uploaded demonstration videos depicting such feats as recognizing a face at your high - school reunion while his social - networking pages pop up , or traveling back in time to view the Colosseum as it once existed .
And then there are the really forward - thinking ideas .
Babak Parviz , a bio- nanotechnologist at the University of Washington , has been working on augmented - reality contact lenses that would layer computer graphics on everything around us — in other words , we ’d have Terminator eyes .
“ We have a vast amount of data on the Web , but today we see it on a flat screen , ” says Michael Zöllner , an augmented - reality researcher at Germany ’s Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research .
“ It ’s only a small step to see all of it superimposed on our lives . ”
Much of this sounds like a comic - book version of technology , and indeed , all of this buzz led the research firm Gartner to put AR on its “ hype cycle ” for emerging technologies — well on its way to the “ peak of inflated expectations . ”
Marketers are as much to blame as geeks for the overheated environment .
To date , the most prominent AR practitioners have been ad agencies , and Best Buy , GE , and Procter & Gamble have run campaigns .
Most of them , unsurprisingly , were more gimmicky than useful .
The central questions :
Will people take to this mode of navigating information in the same way they ’ve embraced social networking ?
Or will augmented reality suffer the fate of online virtual worlds such as Second Life , which attracted a torrent of attention but proved too cumbersome ?
Whether augmented reality emerges through this hype cycle depends on both technologists and marketers to peel away the great expectations and find something real .
Augmented reality is n’t new .
The technology has been used for years in military projects as well as public spectacles such as museum exhibits and trade - show booth demos .
The yellow first - down line superimposed on televised football games is an example of augmented reality .
So why all the chatter now ?
“ There have been a couple of game - changing events , ” says Greg Davis , North American general manager of Total Immersion , a decade - old French company that built these first - generation AR installations .
“ Consumers have access to AR on their home PCs , and now on their mobile phones as well . ”
advertisement
At home , consumers can augment reality through a Webcam .
Hold a printed barcodelike “ target ” up to the camera , and the screen , rather than showing the piece of paper , will meld the video input with 3 - D graphics .
Webcams , of course , are tethered to your computer , which is why mobile devices have provoked so much interest in augmented reality .
Modern smartphones can determine their location through GPS and an internal compass , they can download data through mobile broadband connections , and they have powerful graphics - processing capabilities — all the ingredients for rudimentary AR .
In September , Apple updated the iPhone ’s operating system , allowing third - party apps to superimpose graphics on live video .
Although Apple still limits how far developers can go with AR — in particular , the phone ’s programming system prohibits apps from performing sophisticated image analysis on input from the camera — the new OS is expected to usher in a rush of augmented - reality apps .
As a kind of prelude to the wonders that may be available on the iPhone , many AR firms have built versions of their apps for Google ’s Android platform .
Among them is Layar , an Amsterdam - based startup whose Reality Browser aims to become the Netscape of AR — the program that defines for the masses the everyday wonders of augmented reality .
Layar ’s app , which was downloaded more than 50,000 times in its first week in the Android store , uses the Web as its operating metaphor : Load up the browser , and then pick third - party “ layers ” to superimpose on top , the same way you ’d visit a page in Firefox .
Layar has built an open - ended platform that lets developers quickly add content .
There are now dozens of layers , including ones that access Wikipedia , Flickr , and Twitter .
Maarten Lens - FitzGerald , Layar ’s cofounder , is particularly taken with the tourism apps , such as a World War I layer in the north of France that lets people see pictures and info about battlefields as they ’re standing on them .
“ You ’re at an intersection ; hold up your phone and see a picture of that intersection from 100 years ago , ” he says .
“ There ’s a temporal difference between reality and the picture you could n’t see before . ”
“ Augmented reality is going to be huge .
It might even be as big as the Web . ” — Layar cofounder Maarten Lens - FitzGerald Still , today ’s phones are limited in their AR powers .
“ We were trying to superimpose an animated dragon the other day , ” Lens - FitzGerald says , “ and we found you really ca n’t do that . ”
But as the technology improves , AR apps will be able to recognize faces and physical objects and render detailed 3 - D animation sequences .
“ And that ’s when we ’ll see levels of engagement rise , ” Lens - FitzGerald says .
“ People will play AR games .
Instead of seeing the big apartment block in front of you , you ’ll see a castle . ”
advertisement
At the moment , AR ’s commercial potential is not in apps or layers , but in consumer goods and advertising .
Total Immersion has teamed up with Mattel to produce what they call the world ’s first AR toys — action figures based on the forthcoming James Cameron movie , Avatar .
The figures come with an “ i - Tag ” that allows users to see 3 - D versions of their toys playing in their own rooms .
Total Immersion has also produced AR baseball cards for Topps , and its technology can be found in a number of big DVD releases , including Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen .
In each case , marketers know that consumers wo n’t buy the products just for the AR but hope that the gee - whiz appeal influences the buying decision .
The ad industry has adopted augmented reality for the same reason .
Procter & Gamble recently ran AR - powered magazine ads for its Always brand of feminine - hygiene products .
When women interacted with the ad , they saw an animated rabbit jump out of a hat — in theory , bolstering the brand ’s tagline , “ Works like magic . ”
The danger is that the magic will wear off rather quickly .
An AR ad looks pretty cool the first time , but once every brand wants you to hold something up to your Webcam … .
“ It ’s the flavor of the day , ” says Jonathan Sackett , the Martin Agency ’s chief digital officer .
“ I remember when every client had to have a Facebook app , then a viral ad , then it was an iPhone app , and now it ’s augmented reality . ”
The Martin Agency is n’t immune either , but at least its AR campaign for Wal - Mart ’s Your Zone line of furniture for teenagers was useful .
Kids could move around the AR target to simulate a bed , dresser , chair , or other Your Zone item , seeing the piece just as it would look in their room .
“ For us , it was very practical , ” says Sissy Estes , a VP and associate creative director at the agency , “ to show the customer that there are so many different combinations available . ”
Wal - Mart declined to disclose engagement figures on the campaign , and even if it had , usage metrics — how people respond , and whether these systems can keep people entertained or communicate a branding message — are difficult to decipher .
In August , Best Buy included an AR marker in its Sunday newspaper circular that reached 43 million people and only about 6,500 tried it out at BestBuy.com ( the company said it ’s happy with the response ) .
Last summer , a Total Immersion campaign for Transformers 2 got 80,000 visitors to spend an average of three minutes interacting with the AR app .
Are these returns good or bad ?
“ There are n’t any benchmarks , ” admits Total Immersion ’s Davis .
advertisement
The AR industry is wary of converting every imaginable Web thing into an augmented - reality experience .
“ But on the route toward the best AR for all , that ’s part of it , ” Layar ’s Lens - FitzGerald says .
“ We need to run and fall and get up again and get going . ”
In other words , get ready for augmented reality everywhere .
And after that , we ’ll see AR where it makes sense .
JAISALMER :
In the past four years , some 5,000 Hindus may have crossed over from Pakistan , never to return .
It has not been easy abandoning their homes , sometimes even their families , but they say they had no choice : they had to flee the Taliban .
It started as a trickle in 2006 , the year the Thar Express was flagged off .
The weekly train starts from Karachi , enters India at Munabao , a border town in Barmer , and runs up to Jodhpur .
In the first year , 392 Hindus crossed over .
This grew to 880 in 2007 .
The next year , the number was 1,240 , and this year , till August , over 1,000 have crossed over .
They just keep extending their visas and hope to become Indian citizens .
Incidentally , these are official figures .
Sources say there are many more who cross over and melt in the local milieu .
And officials have a soft corner for these people , most of whom have harrowing stories to tell .
Ranaram , who used to live in the Rahimyar district of Pakistan���s Punjab , says he fell prey to the Taliban .
His wife was kidnapped , raped and forcibly converted to Islam .
His two daughters were also forcibly converted .
Ranaram , too , had to accept Islam for fear of his life .
He thought it best to flee with his two daughters ; his wife was untraceable .
Dungaram , another migrant , says atrocities against Hindus in Pakistan have increased in the past two years after the ouster of Musharraf .
" We wo n't get permanent jobs unless we convert to Islam . "
Hindu Singh Sodha , president of Seemant Lok Sangathan , a group working for the refugees in Barmer and Jaisalmer , says there 's unfortunately no proper refugee policy in India even though people from Pakistan reach here in large numbers .
He said in 2004 - 05 , over 135 families were given Indian citizenship but the rest are still living illegally in the country and are often tortured by police because they do n't have proper citizenship certificates .
" In December 2008 , over 200 Hindus were converted to Islam in Mirpur Khas town of Pakistan .
But there are several others who want to stick to their religion but there ���s no safety for them in Pakistan . "
Immigration officer at Munabao railway station , Hetudan Charan , says the arrival of Hindu migrants had suddenly increased as over 15 to 16 families were reaching India every week .
���None of them admit they are to settle here but seeing their baggage , we easily understand , ������ he said .
Ravi Kumar , who was Barmer collector till his transfer two days back , said the government in 2007 had given permanent citizenship to a few Pakistani immigrants .
” The finding was strong evidence to prove the multiregional model , and from this evidence , it was significant to solve the academic dispute between ' the multiregional mode ' and ' out of Africa theory ’ ” .
In the animals there is scarcely a particular chin which can be considered as comparable to that of man : and in those men who , as is often said , seem to have something apish in their countenance , this generally resides in a deeply - retreated chin .

Chinese scientists say that a recently discovered partial jaw from Guangxi challenges the ‘ out of Africa ’ model of modern human origins , while lending support to the multiregional hypothesis .
The 110,000 year - old mandible is described as having a chin that juts “ ever so slightly outward . ”
These scientists assert that the presence of chin shows that there was significant gene flow between populations of modern Homo sapiens and archaic Homo .
Wu Xinzhi of the Chinese Academy of Sciences had the following to say about the find :
It is interesting to note Xinzhi ’s use of the past simple tense to suggest that this is a closed case .
Far from it !
Palaeoanthropological theory has moved on from the multiregional sensu stricto versus ‘ out of Africa ’ sensu stricto dichotomy that predominated the discussion during the latter half of the last century .
Nevertheless , the question of how much gene flow , if any , took place between modern and archaic Homo is still very much a debated issue .
At this stage you may be wondering why there has been such furore over a chinned jaw .
As long ago as 1775 , Johann Friedrich Blumenbach commented on the uniqueness of the modern human chin :
The distinctive modern human chin develops through the combination of bone deposition on the inferior part of the jaw and resorption around the alveolar region .
In other primates the entire jaw undergoes deposition .
The modern human chin is characterised as having a central keel , with hollowed out depressions ( known as mental fossae ) to either side , together with a protruding inferior portion .
This distended mental protuberance and lateral extremities make up the mental trigone , giving the chin the appearance of an inverted T .
It is the combination of all these anatomical features that make up the prototypal modern chin .
However , chins show great variability , with some modern humans not having any .
This variability is also extends to earlier hominins .
The Middle Pleistocene fossils from the Sima de los Huesos have been described as having chins , and even well - developed mental trigones .
Among Pleistocene hominins , Neandertals appear to have the most divergent pattern from the modern configuration , universally lacking the inverted T and mental fossae .
While it has been argued that the Neandertal mandibles from the Croatian site of Vindija show the development of incipient chins , this has not been borne out by later analyses .
Some of the ‘ modern ’ Klasies River Mouth mandibles do not have developed mental trigones , midline keel or a thickening of the inferior margin .
However , the modern designation of this material is controversial with these fossils showing a mosaic of both archaic and modern features .
Similarly , the modern humans from Qafzeh show variable expression of the inverted T and mental fossae , with no indication of these features in the Skhūl specimens .
The 700 - 800,000 year - old Tighenif mandibles show a surprisingly modern configuration complete with central keel , a thickened inferior portion , and the development of a triangular protuberance .
The presence of a chin in these specimens could represent a synapomorphy with modern humans .
Based on the archaeological record , it appears that modern humans left Africa some time around 100,000 years ago .
Among the oldest undisputed modern human remains in China come from Zhoukoudian Cave at around 35,000 years BP .
The possibly earlier fossil from Liujiang is marred with dating problems .
In order for the Chinese scientists ’ assertion to hold , it would require an even earlier exit from Africa or expansive gene flow between modern humans living in Africa and archaic humans in Asia ; claims for which the evidence is currently lacking .
Future analyses of the specimens will determine whether these chins have a truly modern form or whether the pattern is more like the non-homologous protruding inferior jaws seen in other archaic specimens .
Alternatively , if these specimens end up being the result of convergent evolution it would raise questions about the functional significance of a chin .
Finally , if these fossils show a pattern similar to the one seen in the Tighenif fossils it may suggest that they belong to the same clade .

Back in August , we were shocked to learn that Google was working on a new version of its search engine .
The secret project , known officially as Google Caffeine , would n't change the face or design of the Google search engine , but would instead provide an overhaul of the architecture of Google 's web search that would improve its indexing speed , accuracy , and comprehensiveness .
Since the launch of the developer preview however , we have n't heard much about it .
It 's quietly been undergoing testing and tweaking .
That 's all changing though , as now the developer preview of Google Caffeine has been taken down , replaced with an announcement that Google Caffeine will go live in its first datacenter soon .
The new Caffeine splash page says it all .
Here 's the full text :
" Based on the success we 've seen , we believe Caffeine is ready for a larger audience .
Soon we will activate Caffeine more widely , beginning with one data center .
This sandbox is no longer necessary and has been retired , but we appreciate the testing and positive input that webmasters and publishers have given . "
While we admit that there is n't a lot to go off of , we can discern two key takeaways :
- Caffeine testing was successful .
The project is moving forward - Caffeine is going live on Google.com soon , starting with one datacenter
We 're going to dig deeper and see if we can't find out when Caffeine will actually go live .
The new Google search infrastructure is coming though , and as our previous tests have revealed , there should be a lot of subtle but important changes to search results arriving soon .

Facebook and MySpace fixed this quickly after being notified .
As a application developer on Facebook , I usually run into certain walls that limit my application functionality .
But I do n't give up easily , and only recently I found a solution to one of my function limitations .
Surprisingly , when looked into more carefully my solution allowed full access and control to the Facebook user account that accessed my application .
Did I mention this would also be untraceable since exploit actions would happen from the users IP and own domain cookie ?
Lets walk through it along some clarifying images .
Flash applications run on a users ' computer .
A Flash application is able to load data into its environment .
This is done by a request of the application , where the user loads a certain URL .
Luckily - just with browser AJAX requests - a flash application hosted on domain X is unable to open a file on domain Y .
If this would be possible , domain X is able to access content on domain Y , and when the user is logged in on domain Y retrieve and post back any personal data .
In certain cases this could limit a flash application capabilities .
A relevant example : an application wants to display public Facebook user thumbnails .
The application is on domain X , the thumbnails on domain facebook.com .
To resolve such issues , Adobe ( Flash 's developers ) introduced a " crossdomain.xml " file which could allow certain domains accessing another domain , leading to cross domain access by certain or all domains .
While indeed Facebook locked the front door from any non-facebook domain access via Flash , a simple subdomain change allowed any flash application ( domain= " * " ) to access it 's domain data : .
This would n't be a big deal if the subdomain only hosts images , but unfortunately this domain hosts the whole Facebook property , including a facebook user session .
If you have auto - login enabled on facebook , you might recognize your fullname [ update : its a screen cap now ] in the snippet above ( and the keys to do actions from the accounts credentials ) .
A huge problem that leads to full access and control of a user account whom has " auto login " enabled , and who has n't ?
But how does MySpace fit in this story ?
You would be surprised if I found a similar back door on not one , but two of the top 10 websites online , right ?
Well a quick look at the MySpace crossdomain.xml file shows again a locked door , except for one element : the domain farm.sproutbuilder.com was enabled to access myspace.com data .
A look at " sproutbuilder " showed a application builder ( which indeed has a module able to load MySpace data : news updates ) but more disturbing an upload function allows anybody uploading " .swf " files , the file extension of Flash applications .
The location of the uploaded file ?
farm.sproutbuilder.com [ exploit closed ] , exactly the domain that is allowed access to MySpace data .
You do n't need much time to think of all the ways this could be exploited .
All what has to happen is a active session , or a " auto login " - cookie and a URL which hosts a exploiting Flash file .
For example when accessed , a automatic " post update " could be made , that would lure friends of the user to access the exploit URL , and the exploit would spread virally .
An more invasive and hidden exploit could harvest all the users personal photo's , data and messages to a central server without any trace , and there is no reason why this would n't be happening already with both Facebook and MySpace data .
News item featured in various publications :
The fact that CO2 in the atmosphere can cause warming is fairly settled .
The question is , how much ?
Is CO2 the leading driver of warming over the past century , or just an also - ran ?
Increasingly , scientists justify the contention that CO2 was the primary driver of warming since 1950 by saying that they have attempted to model the warming of the last 50 years and they simply cannot explain the warming without CO2 .
This has always struck me as an incredibly lame argument , as it implies that the models are an accurate representation of nature , which they likely are not .
We know that significant natural effects , such as the PDO and AMO are not well modelled or even considered at all in these models .
But for fun , lets attack the problem in a different way .
Below are two global temperature charts .
Both have the same scale , with time on the X - axis and temperature anomaly on the Y .
One is for the period from 1957 - 2008 , what I will call the “ anthropogenic ” period because scientists claim that its slope can only be explained by anthropogenic factors .
The other is from 1895 - 1946 , where CO2 emissions were low and whose behavior must almost certainly be driven by “ nature ” rather than man .
Sure , I am just a crazy denier , but they look really similar to me .
Why is it that one slope is explainable by natural factors but the other is not ?
Especially since the sun in the later period was more active than it was in the earlier “ natural ” period .
So , which is which ?
Note that these two are straight cut and pasts from this graph :
Behind closed doors , the Iranian regime probably cannot conceal its surprise and delight at what it has gotten away with .
For more than 10 years , Tehran has succeeded in deceiving foreign governments , thwarting nuclear inspectors and keeping sanctions weak and feckless .
During that time , Iran has not broken stride in expanding its nuclear program , and it has now announced plans for 10 new enrichment facilities .
Tehran ’s greatest feat has been its success in lulling global leaders -- including many in the U.S. administration and Congress -- into complacency , based on the belief that the threat posed by Iran ’s nuclear weapons program can be negotiated away through engagement and concessions by the West .
This approach also largely ignores the totality of Iran ’s multifaceted threat .
The range and accuracy of Tehran ’s ballistic missiles continue to improve , with U.S. forces and allies in the Middle East and Europe now within striking distance .
Iran is also quickly accumulating an array of advanced conventional weapons in its effort to dominate the Persian Gulf and the world ’s oil supply .
Iran is designated by the U.S. as the leading state sponsor of terrorism , and it is supporting extremist organizations throughout the Middle East and beyond , reaching even into Latin America .
Iran has also assumed a major role in fueling the insurgency in Iraq and is backing Taliban militants in Afghanistan .

Many U.S. officials and congressional leaders seem content to engage in vague and open - ended talks with Iran , acting as though we have a reservoir of time to work with before the Iranian threat reaches critical mass .
Yet , in June , the International Atomic Energy Agency , or IAEA , estimated that Iran had already amassed a stockpile of nearly 1,400 kilograms of enriched uranium , which it could use in a “ dirty bomb ” or pass along to extremist groups or other rogue states .
Just last month , the IAEA made the startling revelation that Iranian scientists may have tested advanced components of nuclear warheads .
Nuclear experts note that such technology , once mastered , would allow for the production of smaller and simpler nuclear bombs , and would make it easier for Iran to put a nuclear warhead on a missile .
This represents a step that few in the West believed possible .
The IAEA also issued a report last month containing urgent new findings .
One was that yet another camouflaged nuclear facility , this time at the recently disclosed Qom site , was at “ an advanced state of construction . ”
With additional installations widely suspected , who knows what will be uncovered next .
The IAEA should immediately cease all technical assistance to Iran and should suspend Iran ’s membership privileges in the organization .
Until such actions are taken , the U.S. should not send one more penny of taxpayer funds to the IAEA that benefit Iran ’s nuclear program .

The regime in Tehran knows only hardball , and nothing less than overwhelming and crippling sanctions could produce a reversal of its threatening programs and policies .
That is why the United States must be prepared to act alone , if necessary , and with every weapon in its political and economic arsenal .
The Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions
Act is one such tool .
This legislation , which I coauthored , has the support of more than 300 members of the House , and it is urgent that this bill reaches the president ’s desk before the end of the year .
It targets one of Iran ’s major weaknesses -- namely , its dependency on foreign gasoline and other refined petroleum products .
By placing financial sanctions on U.S. and foreign companies providing these crucial resources , Iran ’s economic lifeline would be severed and its already weak economy would crumble .
But these sanctions must be coupled with action on all fronts .
The U.S. must also specifically reject Iran ’s claim to an inalienable right to produce nuclear fuel .
We must strengthen existing laws to prevent the transfer of prohibited materials and technology to Iran .
Responsible nations should impose a ban on travel by senior Iranian regime officials and their families to Europe and the U.S.
We should strengthen bilateral and multilateral efforts to shut down accounts of those doing business with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or its affiliated entities ; deny Tehran access to euros and U.S. dollars ; and freeze the assets of those who violate U.N. sanctions on Iran .
Concurrently , we should offer our full support to the Iranian people and increase funding for Iran democracy programs .
The weakness of recent actions has been daunting .
The IAEA mustered only a weak censure of Iran ; the U.N. Security Council has said that it was disappointed ; the White House has maintained its wait - and - see approach ; and the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions
Act continues to languish because many remain true believers in the mirage of engagement .
However , the threat is immediate , and the time to act has arrived .

ABOUT THIS SERIES ABOUT THIS SERIES Congress will soon consider ways to improve the school lunch program .
This is the third part in a series that examines the safety and quality of food that children eat at school .

GOVERNMENT SPENDING ON COMMODITIES GOVERNMENT
SPENDING ON COMMODITIES
In the past three years , the government has provided the nation 's schools with millions of pounds of beef and chicken that would n't meet the quality or safety standards of many fast - food restaurants , from Jack in the Box and other burger places to chicken chains such as KFC , a USA TODAY investigation found .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture says the meat it buys for the National School Lunch Program " meets or exceeds standards in commercial products . "
That is n't always the case .
McDonald's , Burger King and Costco , for instance , are far more rigorous in checking for bacteria and dangerous pathogens .
They test the ground beef they buy five to 10 times more often than the USDA tests beef made for schools during a typical production day .
And the limits Jack in the Box and other big retailers set for certain bacteria in their burgers are up to 10 times more stringent than what the USDA sets for school beef .
For chicken , the USDA has supplied schools with thousands of tons of meat from old birds that might otherwise go to compost or pet food .
Called " spent hens " because they 're past their egg - laying prime , the chickens do n't pass muster with Colonel Sanders — KFC wo n't buy them — and they do n't pass the soup test , either .
The Campbell Soup Company says it stopped using them a decade ago based on " quality considerations . "
TOUGH , STRINGY : Old - hen meat fed to pets and schoolkids TABLE : Fast - food safety rules trump those for school lunches SALMONELLA RECALLS : Call to close meat plant for inspection " We simply are not giving our kids in schools the same level of quality and safety as you get when you go to many fast - food restaurants , " says J. Glenn Morris , professor of medicine and director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute at the University of Florida .
" We are not using those same standards . "
It was n't supposed to be this way .
In 2000 , then - Agriculture secretary Dan Glickman directed the USDA to adopt " the highest standards " for school meat .
He cited concerns that fast - food chains had tougher safety and quality requirements than those set by the USDA for schools , and he vowed that " the disparity would exist no more . "
Today , USDA rules for meat sent to schools remain more stringent than the department 's minimum safety requirements for meat sold at supermarkets .
But those government rules have fallen behind the increasingly tough standards that have evolved among fast - food chains and more selective retailers .
Morris , who used to run the USDA office that investigates food - borne illnesses , says the department 's purchases of meat that does n't satisfy higher - end commercial standards are especially worrisome because the meat goes to schools .
It 's not just that children are more vulnerable to food - borne illnesses because of their fledgling immune systems ; it 's also because there 's less assurance that school cafeteria workers will cook the meat well enough to kill any pathogens that might slip through the USDA 's less stringent safety checks .
USDA - purchased meat is donated to almost every school district in the country and served to 31 million students a day , 62 % of whom qualify for free or reduced - price meals .
President Obama noted earlier this year that , for many children , school lunches are " their most nutritious meal — sometimes their only meal — of the day . "
Next year , Congress will revisit the Child Nutrition Act , which governs the lunch program .
" If there are higher quality and safety standards , the government should set them , " says Rep. George Miller , D - Calif. , chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor .
" Ensuring the safety of food in schools is something we 'll look at closely . "
Officials with the Agricultural Marketing Service ( AMS ) , the USDA agency that buys meat for the school lunch program , insist that schools get top - notch products .
AMS standards for meat sent to schools have been " extremely successful in protecting against food - borne pathogens , " AMS Administrator Rayne Pegg says in a written statement .
She notes that AMS oversight , inspections and tests of that meat exceed those required for meat sold to the general public .
The AMS also has a " zero - tolerance " policy that requires rejection of meat that tests positive for salmonella or E. coli O157 : H7 , pathogens that can cause serious illness or death .
Still , after USA TODAY presented USDA officials with its findings , Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack promised an independent review of testing requirements for ground beef that the AMS sends to schools .
The review , set for next year , is meant " to ensure the food served to our school children is as safe as possible , " Vilsack says in a statement .
Tougher standards for school meat would better protect students , experts say .
Today 's AMS program " is a sort of snapshot of the way things were in ( 2000 ) , whereas the industry has continued to clamp down , " says James Marsden , a Kansas State University professor who advises the meat industry on safety .
" It needs to be modernized . "
The difference USA TODAY examined about 150,000 tests on beef purchased by the AMS for the school lunch program .
The agency buys more than 100 million pounds of beef a year for schools , and the vast majority of it would satisfy the standards of most commercial buyers .
But USA TODAY also found cases in which the agency bought meat that retailers and fast - food chains would have rejected .
Like the AMS , many big commercial buyers reject meat that tests positive for salmonella or E. coli O157:H7 .
But many fast - food chains and premium retailers set tougher limits than the AMS on so - called indicator bacteria .
Although not necessarily dangerous themselves , high levels of the bacteria can suggest an increased likelihood that meat may have pathogens that tests might miss .
From 2005 to this year , the AMS purchased six orders of ground beef that exceeded the limits some commercial buyers set for indicator bacteria .
The meat came from five companies : Beef Packers of Fresno , which filled two of the orders ; Skylark Meats of Omaha ; Duerson Foods of Pleasant Prairie , Wis. ; N'Genuity Enterprises of Scottsdale , Ariz . ; and Palo Duro Meat Processing of Amarillo , Texas .
Palo Duro is the largest provider of ground beef to schools .
Beef Packers is one of the most troubled ; it has been suspended as an AMS supplier three times , and Rep. Rosa DeLauro , D - Conn. , called this week for the plant to be closed temporarily in the wake of two recalls .
From late November 2008 through January this year , the AMS bought nearly 500,000 pounds of ground beef from Beef Packers and Skylark with unusually high levels of an indicator bacteria known as " generic E. coli . "
The organism is considered an indicator of whether potential contaminants from the intestines of cattle have gotten into slaughtered meat — a source of the far more dangerous E. coli O157:H7 .
The indicator bacteria are measured in CFUs , or colony - forming units .
Jack in the Box , which pioneered many of the safety standards now used across the fast - food industry , wo n't accept beef with generic E. coli levels of more than 100 CFUs per gram .
The AMS , on the other hand , will buy beef for the school lunch program with generic E. coli counts of up to 1,000 CFUs per gram — 10 times the Jack in the Box limit .
" That 's a significant difference , " says Marsden , the professor and beef industry adviser .
The shipments of beef that the AMS bought a year ago had generic E. coli levels up to four times higher than what Jack in the Box would accept .
" Most higher - end companies certainly would reject that , " Marsden says .
Those bacteria levels " would be a yellow light ( that ) something 's not right . "
E. coli is n't the only indicator bacteria that the AMS allows at higher levels .
The government also accepts beef with more than double the limit set by many fast - food chains for total coliform , which is used to assess whether a beef producer is minimizing fecal contamination in its meat .
" We look at those ( measures ) to gauge how a supplier is doing , " says David Theno , who developed the safety program at Jack in the Box before retiring last year .
If shipments regularly exceed the company 's limits on indicator bacteria , " we 'd stop doing business with them , " he says .
AMS officials say the differences between the agency 's bacteria limits and those of private industry are inconsequential .
They note that there is n't even a requirement that beef sold in a typical grocery store has to be tested for the organisms .
" We remain confident , based upon past benchmarking activities , that our testing and standards are similar to or exceed those of most major large volume buyers , " AMS chief Pegg says .
Suspect samples
The biggest disparity between the AMS and other big buyers of ground beef may not be in the levels of bacteria they allow but in the effort they make to detect such contamination .
On a given manufacturing day , AMS workers testing ground beef bound for schools sample the meat eight times , regardless of how long the production lines are running .
Those samples are combined into a single composite sample for testing .
Jack in the Box , McDonald 's , Burger King and other more selective buyers sample the ground beef on their production lines every 15 minutes .
Some , such as Jack in the Box , combine those samples to create a composite sample for testing every hour during the production run .
Others , such as McDonald 's and Burger King , combine those samples to create a composite sample for testing every two hours .
That means Jack in the Box would test at least 10 composite samples during a typical 10 - hour production run , which could yield 100,000 pounds or more of ground beef .
The AMS would test just one sample for the entire 100,000 - pound run .
The AMS approach to sampling " is not robust enough to find anything , " says Mansour Samadpour , a Seattle - based food safety consultant and microbiologist .
Fast - food chains are n't the only ones with better sampling .
Other beef buyers , such as Costco and afa Foods , a Pennsylvania firm that supplies beef to restaurants , use similar programs .
AMS officials say the agency accounts for less frequent sampling by being more aggressive in rejecting meat that fails to meet its standards .
When a test shows salmonella , for instance , the AMS rejects all the meat produced by that supplier during that production run — tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds .
But the AMS approach does n't resonate with some scientists .
" AMS is saying once they detect , they take drastic action , " says Ewen Todd , a professor at Michigan State University , " but if they are less likely to detect , the risk is still higher . "
Adds
Theno : " If you do more sampling and you do it on smaller lots , you have a better chance of finding problems . "
Theno helped pioneer the sampling and testing standards now used widely in the fast - food world after he arrived at Jack in the Box in the wake of the industry 's most notorious safety lapse .
In 1993 , an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 at Jack in the Box restaurants left hundreds sick and four children dead .
Victims , most from the West , won more than $ 50 million from the company and its suppliers .
Reverberations from the event rippled across the fast - food industry .
In the aftermath , Theno says , Jack in the Box asked him to build a food safety program that would " set a new ( industry ) standard . "
Today , most fast - food companies and premium grocery chains have safety programs built on the same pillars
Theno set up at Jack in the Box : frequent sampling requirements , tight limits on indicator bacteria , and zero tolerance for dangerous pathogens .
Food safety officials from fast - food chains and other big beef buyers share ideas and information about their programs , says Dane Bernard , vice president for food safety at Keystone Foods , a ground beef supplier to McDonald's .
" Our testing programs are constantly evolving .
We watch the science closely . "
Raising the bar
The AMS could " very easily " raise the standards for federally purchased school lunch meat , says Barry Carpenter , a former AMS official who helped set up the current sampling and testing requirements in 2000 .
" If I was still at AMS , I 'd say , ' Where are we ( with today 's rules ) and where do we need to tighten them ? ' " Carpenter , now head of the National Meat Association , notes that raising AMS standards " would n't cost much , " and it would help combat perceptions that the school lunch program is " a market of last resort " for meat that can't pass muster with commercial buyers .
That perception could be reinforced by the reality of how AMS makes its purchasing decision : Contracts go to the lowest qualified bidders .
Orders are placed on a computer system that can be accessed by all of the agency 's suppliers — those certified as able to meet the special sampling and testing requirements set for school lunch food .
When an order is placed , suppliers enter bids into the system , and the computer automatically awards contracts to low bidders .
Industry experts say tougher standards would not significantly add to the agency 's costs for school meat .
Theno says the safety requirements set by Jack in the Box added less than a penny a pound to its beef costs .
Other big buyers outside the school program say it's a worthwhile investment in safety .
" It 's not about transactional cost ; it 's about value , " says Justin Malvick , a vice president at Keystone , the McDonald 's supplier .
Carpenter says the meat industry that he now represents would have no problem with a decision to modernize — and toughen — AMS standards for school lunch meat .
Most major beef suppliers and processors already have procedures in place to ensure that their products can satisfy the tougher sampling and testing requirements set by many commercial buyers , he adds .
If the AMS followed , he says , " I do n't think the industry would have any hiccup at all . "
Some lawmakers say a change is overdue .
" Why are we even looking at giving ( schools ) … food that would n't be accepted by a restaurant ? , " asks Rep. Carolyn McCarthy , D - N.Y .
" That 's absolutely crazy . "

Former GOP presidential nominee John McCain ( Ariz . ) used Saturday 's floor debate on healthcare to repeat the controversial " death panel " charge for which his running mate , former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , has been heavily criticized .
In a scripted exchange with Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso ( Wyo. ) , McCain assailed a recent recommendation by a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services panel that women receive regular mammograms once they reach 50 years of age , instead of the traditional 40 .
McCain used that to revive a criticism of the Democratic - written healthcare bill that Palin raised over the summer , that advisory boards could create polices that would make them become " death panels . "
" Is n't that the kind of advisory board that this legislation could put into law , that those kinds of mandates could come down which could literally jeopardize the health and lives of Americans ? "
McCain asked Barrasso .
Barrasso's wife is a breast cancer survivor , a fact he referenced .
" This type of legislation would have cost my wife her life , " Barrasso said .
" She is a breast cancer survivor , diagnosed by a routine screening mammogram .
And she was in her 40s when that mammogram was performed ...
It was a screening mammogram that saved her life . "
A grinning McCain then asked , " You would not describe that as a death panel ? "
Barrasso replied , " Some people might . "

Android 2.0 features a lot of new and improved goodies and therefore , the “ settings ” will inherently change .
Want to know exactly what changed ?
No problem , I go through every single setting difference between Android 2.0 running on the Motorola Droid and Android 1.6 running on the T - Mobile G1 , showing them side by side .
I ’m currently trying to find answers on some of this stuff and will keep this post updated as I learn the details :
There are some big additions here that unless you dove into the settings , you might miss .
One of them is the existence of a brand new top level category called “ Privacy ” .
Within Privacy there is an option for “ Backup My Settings ” .
I spoke with someone who has a little more information and they gave me the scoop .
The first time you load the phone you agree to an option that allows Google to back up certain information from your device in the “ Google Cloud ” .
Now suppose you go about using your phone for 1 year and then you drop it in the toilet …
DANG !
Since you opted into Backup My Settings , when you get your new phone and enter your Gmail address , it will restore your settings to how they previously appeared on your phone .
We ’re talking things like Screen Brightness , Media Volume , etc … but I imagine the GOAL is to advance this feature .
Eventually ( and I ’m speculating here ) , it could store your accounts / passwords , application download history , and potentially settings from 3rd party apps as well .
But for now it just backs up mostly everything within your actual “ Settings ” so you do n’t have to start from stage 1 with a new device .
Another brand new item is “ Install From SD Card ” which appears in Location & Security .
No … I ’m sure it does n’t have anything to do with running / loading apps from your SD card as you ’re probably hoping .
The sub - menu explains it as “ Install encrypted certificates from SD Card ” and when selecting it I get the following error : “ No .p12 file found in the SD Card ” – definitely something I ’ll be looking into .
All smartphones have battery life issues to take into consideration and Google has partially addressed this in Android 2.0 with an Application setting called “ Running Services ” .
More apps than you think run persistent services in the background – this allows you to check what apps currently have active processes , how large the app is , how long the process has been running and of course you can kill them if you should so choose .
The bottom of this screen has some numbers that SHOULD be helpful if I knew what they were :
Avail : 90MB+40 MB in 12 – Other : 42 MB in 3
I ’m assuming this has something to do with the amount of ROM / RAM being consumed and available by the device but it would help to know exactly what these are all about .
I ’m working on it .
There are a bunch of other new , improved , moved and altered settings ESPECIALLY in the “ Call Settings ” area .
For example an option called “ Voice Privacy ” with the sub - title “ Enable enhanced privacy mode ” .
You can only turn it on and off with no other options .
I spoke with one Android developer who wondered if it adjusted the earpiece volume depending on the volume of your surroundings – but we have no clue what this option is and we ’re looking into it .
For now I ’ve included a list heirarchy outlining only the changes and I ’ll fill it in with details as I learn more about they mysterious ones :
Wireless Controls :
Airplane mode was at bottom , went to top
Mobile Networks – Cannot select 2G only , Network Operators or Access Point Names
Call Settings :
GSM vs CDMA differences
No “ Use 2G only ” – is Verizon touting their 3G expertise ?
What if we want to save battery ?

This Friday I ’m heading up to rural Massachusetts in hopes of getting born again — again .
Six years ago , in the same locale , I attended my first and only silent meditation retreat .
It was just about the most amazing experience of my life .
Certainly it seemed more dramatic than my very first born - again experience — my response to a southern Baptist altar call as a child , which I wrote about in this space last month .
I came away from that week feeling I had found a new kind of happiness , deeper than the kind I ’d always pursued .
I also came away a better person — just ask my wife .
( And neither of those things lasted — just ask my wife . )
So with the retreat approaching , I should be as eager as a kid on Christmas Eve , right ?
Well , no .
Meditation retreats — at this place , at least — are no picnic .
You do n’t follow your bliss .
You learn not to follow your bliss , to let your bliss follow you .
And you learn this arduously .
If at the end you feel like you ’re leaving Shangri - La , that ’s because the beginning felt like Guantanamo .
We spent 5.5 hours per day in sitting meditation , 5.5 hours per day in walking meditation .
By day three I was feeling achy , far from nirvana and really , really sick of the place .
I was sick of my 5 a.m. “ yogi job ” ( vacuuming ) , I was sick of the bland vegetarian food , and I was n’t especially fond of all those Buddhists with those self - satisfied looks on their faces , walking around serenely like they knew something I did n’t know ( which , it turns out , they did ) .
Yes , the payoff was huge .
But it ’s unlikely to be as big this time around .
It ’s famously hard to replicate the rapture of your first meditation retreat .
Last time , during the first half of the week , my apparently prescient unconscious mind kept filling my head with that old song by Foreigner , “ It feels like the first time , like it never will again . ”
I ’ve never especially liked that song , and during those first few days it joined the list of things I hated .
What I hated above all was that I was n’t succeeding as a meditator .
Now , as the two leaders of this retreat were known to point out , you ’re not supposed to think of “ succeeding ” at meditating .
And you ’re not supposed to blame yourself for failing .
And blah , blah , blah .
Well , they were right : To “ succeed ” I really did have to quit pursuing success , and quit blaming myself for failing .
And some other things had to go right .
And what was “ success ” like ?
Well , to start at the less spiritual , more sensual end :
By the time I left , eating the food I ’d initially disdained ranked up there with above - average sex .
I ’m not exaggerating by much .
When I first got there , I did n’t understand why some people were closing their eyes while eating .
By the end of the retreat , I was closing mine .
The better to focus on the source of my ecstasy .
I was n’t just living in the moment — I was luxuriating in it .
Also , my view of weeds changed .
There ’s a kind of weed that I had spent years killing , sometimes manually , sometimes with chemicals .
On a walk one day I looked down at one of those weeds and it looked as beautiful as any other plant .
Why , I wondered , had I bought into the “ weed ” label ?
Why had I so harshly judged an innocent plant ?
If this sounds crazy to you , you should hear how crazy it sounds to me .
I ’m not the weed - hugging type , I assure you .
And as long as we ’re on the subject of crazy , there was my moment of bonding with a lizard .
I looked at this lizard and watched it react to local stimuli and thought : I ’m in the same boat as that lizard — born without asking to be born , trying to make sense of things , and far from getting the whole picture .
I mean , sure , I know more than the lizard — like the fact that I exist and the fact that I evolved by natural selection .
But my knowledge is , like the lizard ’s , hemmed in by the fact that my brain is a product of evolution , designed to perform mundane tasks , to react to local stimuli , not to understand the true nature of things .
And — here ’s the crazy part — I kind of loved that lizard .
A little bit , for a little while .
Whether I had made major moral progress by learning to empathize with a lizard , let alone a weed , is open to debate .
The more important part of my expanding circle of affinity involved people — specifically , my fellow meditators .
At the beginning of the retreat , looking around the meditation hall , I had sized people up , making lots of little judgments , sometimes negative , on the basis of no good evidence .
( Re : guy wearing Juilliard t- shirt and exhibiting mild symptoms of theatricality : Well , are n’t we special ? )
By the end of the retreat I was less inclined toward judgment , especially the harsh kind .
And days after the retreat , while riding the monorail to the Newark airport I found myself doing something I never do — striking up a conversation with strangers .
Nice strangers !
My various epiphanies may sound trite , like a caricature of pop-Buddhist enlightenment .
And , presented in snapshot form , that ’s what I ’m afraid they ’re destined to sound like .
All I can say is that there is a bigger philosophical picture that these snapshots are part of , and that I had made some progress in apprehending it by the end of the retreat .
The “ apprehension ” is n’t just intellectual .
This retreat was in the Vipassana tradition , which emphasizes gaining insight into the way your mind works .
Vipassana has a reputation for being one of the more intellectual Buddhist traditions , but , even so , part of the idea is to gain that insight in a way that is n’t entirely intellectual .
Or , at least , in a way that is sometimes hard to describe .
On Thursday night , the fifth night of the retreat , about 30 minutes into a meditation session , I had an experience that falls into that category , so I wo n’t try to describe it .
I ’ll just say that it involved seeing the structure of my mind — experiencing the structure of my mind — in a new way , and in a way that had great meaning for me .
And , happily , this experience was accompanied by a stunningly powerful blast of bliss .
All told , I do n’t think I ’ve ever had a more dramatic moment .
This retreat is coming at a good time for me .
In June I published a book that I ’ve been feverishly promoting .
Publishing and promoting a book can bring out the non-Buddhist in a person .
For example , when book reviewers make judgments about your book , you may make judgments about the reviewers — ungenerous judgments , even .
Also , you ’re inclined to pursue the fruits of your activity — like book sales — rather than just experience the activity .
Checking your Amazon ranking every 7 minutes would qualify as what Buddhists call “ attachment . ”
And attachment is bad .
( Oops : I just made a judgment about attachment . )
In fact , in general I ’ve been living like someone who has n’t been meditating with much regularity or dedication , who has strayed from the straight and narrow .
It ’s time to start anew .
At the end of my first retreat , still reeling from that Thursday - night experience , I told one of the meditation teachers about it .
He nodded casually , as if the insight I ’d had was one of the standard stops on the path to enlightenment — but far from the end of the path .
Through truly intensive meditation , he said , the transformation of your view of your mind — and your view of your mind ’s relationship to reality , and your view of reality itself — can go much deeper than I ’d gone .
That would be interesting !
But this week I ’d settle for half as deep .

Alan Maass and Helen Redmond analyze the legislation passed by the House in the name of health care reform in the US magazine Socialist Worker .
THE HOUSE of Representatives narrowly passed health care legislation last weekend that was hailed as “ historic ” and sweeping . ”
It is those things–a historic and sweeping disaster for the hope that a Democratic president and Congress would finally do something to fix the screwed - up health care system that is a source of misery and suffering for so many people .
The House ’s Affordable Health Care for America
Act would force millions of people to buy high - cost , low - coverage insurance policies from private companies .
It would funnel hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars that could be used to do something useful about health care into the pockets of the insurance giants .
It capitulates on even the half - measure of the “ public option ” of a government - run alternative for the uninsured .
It gives up on effective regulation of all but the worst practices of the medical - insurance complex .
It contains an appalling concession to the anti-abortion fanatics that would be the most expansive government restriction yet imposed on women ’s right to choose .
By abandoning any attempt to win real change in the system , and then compromising on already compromised fallback positions , the House Democratic majority has produced health care legislation that will do more harm than good–and that will tarnish the idea of reform in the future .
And this is likely better than what the Senate will come up with as it begins debate on legislation that has even more wrong with it from the point of view of fixing health care .
To top it off , the Senate ’s bill may not even make it to a vote–not , at least , without further surrenders –because of the opposition of Republicans and a few conservative Democrats .
Every Democrat in Washington understands this grim picture , but there was still an unreal air of self - congratulation after the House vote .
President Barack Obama praised lawmakers for “ answering the call of history , ” and the union - backed Health Care for America Now coalition said they cast “ a vote for the American people , for making health care a human right . ”
Rep. Tammy Baldwin , one of the most liberal Democrats in Washington , looked past everything wrong with the House bill and declared : “ I truly believe that we ’ll look back years from now and view the passage of this act to be as significant as the passage of the Social Security Act in 1935 and the Medicare and Medicaid Act in 1965 . ”
“ Significant ” maybe–but not in a good way .
The House vote last weekend deserves to go down in history as a capitulation to the health care robber barons in defiance of overwhelming public support for real reform .
If it does , liberal Democrats like Baldwin–who vowed to fight for strong legislation , and then provided the margin of victory for this outrage –will be remembered as the ones who let it happen .
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
BEFORE THE injury of the final vote on the bill came the insult of an amendment that amounts to one of the most far - reaching anti-abortion measures ever passed in Washington .
In a bid to win support for the full legislation from a handful of conservative Democrats , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decided at the last minute to allow a vote on the Stupak Amendment .
The amendment would bar coverage for abortion services not only from a government - run “ public option ” program , but from any private insurance policy available through the legislation where the government provides any subsidy at all .
The amendment passed with the votes of 64 Democrats and every Republican in the House .
By all accounts , a large majority of people who would purchase health coverage through the so - called “ insurance exchange ” established by the reform legislation would get some kind of subsidy or credit to help with premiums .
Insurance companies that currently provide coverage for abortions would have to drop it if they want to sell their product to the vast majority of customers coming to them through the exchange .
As Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein put it :
[ V] irtually all women with insurance through the exchange who find themselves in the unwanted and unexpected position of needing to terminate a pregnancy will not have coverage for the procedure .
Abortion coverage will not be outlawed in this country .
It will simply be tiered , reserved for those rich enough to afford insurance themselves or lucky enough to receive it from their employers .
If it makes it into the final version of health care legislation , the Stupak Amendment will make it harder than ever to obtain an abortion for millions of women who are currently uninsured and will have to buy–under threat of financial penalty –health insurance through the government ’s exchange .
Even women who currently have employer - based insurance that covers abortion care would feel the effects–many employers are expected to dump coverage for their employees and force them into the exchange , where insurance companies will have an incentive to not cover abortion for any woman .
Rep. Jan Schakowsky was among the many liberals who spoke out against the anti-choice measure .
“ This amendment is a backdoor way of overturning Roe v. Wade ; it is a disservice and an insult to millions of women throughout our country , ” Schakowsky said .
But this was a charade .
Schakowsky knew that once Pelosi allowed a vote on the amendment , it would pass .
If she really wanted to stop it , she and her fellow progressives needed to threaten to vote against the bill itself .
But almost none did .
Rep. Diana DeGette , a leader of the Progressive and Pro-Choice Caucuses in the House , now claims to have 41 representatives signing a letter to Pelosi saying they wo n’t vote for a final bill if the Stupak restrictions remain .
But why did n’t these 41 champions of a woman ’s right to choose fight when they had a chance the first time ?
Once the Senate acts , and leaders of the two Houses of Congress get together in conference committee to come up with a final version , the pressure will be even greater on Democratic liberals to swallow their concerns about any “ flaws . ”
We ca n’t trust them to keep their promise to fight against restrictions on abortion–or any other provisions in this health care non-reform .
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS do admit that the House bill is n’t “ perfect . ”
At least , though , they say , it delivers on long - needed regulations of the insurance industry ’s most notorious practices , and adds substantial funding to the government ’s Medicaid program for the poor .
What ’s stunning , though , is how little there actually is on “ pro ” side of pro-con balance sheet .
The expansion of Medicaid , for example , would be a temporary fix , and unsustainable in the long term .
The costs of expanding the program would fall on state governments , which are experiencing severe budget crises , and already cutting benefits and eligibility .
Insurance companies would be barred from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions , and retroactively discovering reasons to cancel policies after a person gets sick , known as rescission .
But there are a lot of loopholes in the new regulations for insurance company lawyers to try to exploit–and because there are no controls on premiums , companies can respond to any regulation that threatens to impact their profits by simply charging more money .
One provision in the bill caps the amount policyholders will have to pay in out - of - pocket expenses : $ 5,000 for an individual and $ 10,000 for families .
But what working class person or family has thousands of dollars on hand to cover out - of - pocket health care costs ?
These amounts are more than enough to drive people into bankruptcy .
On top of this , points out Dr. Marcia Angell , author of The Truth About the Drug Companies : How They Deceive Us and What to Do About It , there ’s the question of whether any of the regulations will be enforced .
“ [ Q] uite apart from its content , the bill is so complicated and convoluted that it would take a staggering apparatus to administer it and try to enforce its regulations , ” Angell wrote .
The highly touted “ public option ” –a government - run alternative provider of coverage to the uninsured –has been whittled down to almost nothing .
When first proposed , the public option had a potential enrollment of 129 million people .
Now , according to estimates , it would cover between 6 million and 11 million–around 2 percent of the U.S. population at the low end–and the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) estimates that premiums in the public option could cost more than private plans .
A public option this small and expensive wo n’t be the competitive force to “ keep private insurers honest ” that Obama talked about .
On the contrary , it will be more of a convenient dumping ground for insurance companies –covering the sickest people who the private insurers would rather not have as customers anyway .
Meanwhile , at the heart of the House health care reform bill–as with every other proposal under consideration during the Washington debate –is a measure that ordinary people will certainly come to despise if a law is ever passed : Mandates requiring people who do n’t have insurance through an employer and do n’t qualify for a government program like Medicare or Medicaid to purchase a policy through a newly established “ insurance exchange . ”
If this feature of health care non-reform were discussed more often in the mainstream media , there would surely be more outrage against the legislation in Congress .
Basically , the government is planning to force everyone , with some small exceptions , to buy an overpriced , defective product , year after year , or face a stiff financial penalty .
This is why the insurance companies –while also supporting the protests of the Republican right against any reform at all –have been happy to work with the Obama administration to shape health care legislation .
In the House bill , the companies got a fine for anyone who does n’t buy insurance of 2.5 percent of adjusted annual income above the filing threshold or the average premium of a policy available in the insurance exchange .
Karen Ignagni , the insurers ’ top lobbyist , grumbled about the penalties being phased in too slowly and affordability waivers being “ too generous . ”
But this is trivial compared to the windfall profits insurance companies would bank because of a mandate .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich–who voted against the House bill–estimated that at least 21 million people would have to buy private insurance , resulting in “ at least $ 70 billion in new annual revenue [ for the industry ] , much of which is coming from taxpayers .
This inevitably will lead to even more costs , more subsidies , and higher profits for insurance companies–a bailout under a blue cross . ”
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
THAT ISN’T the end of what ’s wrong with the House bill , by any means .
Like the proposal under consideration in the Senate , House Democrats plan to pay for a big chunk of their legislation with hundreds of billions of dollars in “ savings ” from the Medicare program for the elderly .
Supporters of the bill talk about cracking down on fraud and modernizing the system , but Medicare “ savings ” really means Medicare benefit cuts–a further step toward the hollowing out of the popular program .
Big Pharma will get theirs , too .
Under the House bill , manufacturers of biologic drugs–those produced through biological , rather than chemical processes –will get a monopoly period of 12 years , and potentially much longer .
Biologic drugs are some of the most important recent developments in medicine , providing life - saving “ miracle ” treatments for cancer , rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions .
They ’re also extremely expensive , costing tens of thousands of dollars a year .
And they ’ll stay expensive , if Democrats in the House get their way –their health care legislation extends the “ exclusivity ” period when generic versions of biologic drugs are forbidden to 12 years .
“ And , ” wrote Jane Hamsher , founder of the FireDogLake blog , “ because of an ‘ evergreening ’ clause that grants drug companies a continued monopoly if they make slight changes to the drug ( like creating a once - a - day dose where the original product was three times per day ) , they will never become generics . ”
On the other hand , a proposal by Dennis Kucinich that would have protected the right of individual states to create a single - payer health care system–something that would have been mere token support for the distant possibility of a government - run system providing coverage for everyone –was excluded from the bill by the House leadership .
Though the legislation focuses around how the uninsured will be covered , the House bill–and whatever final version emerges after the Senate debate and the reconciliation process –would have a broader effect , and not for the good .
Currently , 60 percent of American workers get their health insurance from private insurers , mostly through employers .
Under the House bill , employers will be given the option of providing coverage for employees or contributing to a fund on their behalf .
If employers offer insurance , they must pay at least 72.5 percent of the premium for workers , and 65 percent for families .
That gives companies who currently pay a higher percentage an incentive to shift costs onto employees until they hit the government - mandated limit .
And because the legislation does nothing to cap what insurance companies can charge for policies , the trend will be for employers to stop providing coverage altogether , and push their employees into the insurance exchange .
Beyond all the details , there ’s something twisted and Orwellian at the core of the House ’s “ landmark ” health care legislation .
The same corporations responsible for a health care crisis that has left 50 million people uninsured and at least 25 million underinsured , that is the leading cause of personal bankruptcy , and that kills 45,000 people every year are being left in charge of the system .
The insurance companies are presented as the only solution to a crisis they caused .
As Kucinich said in a statement about why he voted against the House bill :
We have been led to believe that we must make our health care choices only within the current structure of a predatory , for - profit insurance system which makes money not providing health care .
We cannot fault the insurance companies for being what they are .
But we can fault legislation in which the government incentivizes the perpetuation , indeed the strengthening , of the for - profit health insurance industry , the very source of the problem .
That ’s the reality of health care non-reform , brought to you by a president who promised to bring change to Washington and a party controlling Congress that claims to represent “ the people . ”
As Dr. Marcia Angell concluded :
* Bank regulators say systemic firm list will be public
* Geithner says wo n’t publish list , cites moral hazard
* Geithner concedes market will figure out systemic firms
WASHINGTON , Oct 29 ( Reuters ) - U.S. regulators on Thursday scoffed at the administration ’s plan to not publicly identify financial firms the government considers “ systemic , ” saying such a list cannot remain under wraps for long and federal laws could mandate disclosure .
“ It ’s likely that most , if not all , of the institutions so identified would eventually be known to the public , ” said Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo , to the House Financial Services Committee during a hearing on systemic risk .
“ While there is a reason to try to avoid an increase in moral hazard , we should probably be realistic here about what will and wo n’t be known . ”
The Obama administration , in draft legislation released on Tuesday , proposed that there be no public list , the thinking being that listed firms could be perceived as too big to fail .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner even acknowledged that the public will know who these firms are , but said the government act of publishing such a list could send the wrong message .
“ What you do n’t want to do is , by identifying a list of companies that are going to be held to tougher standards , create an expectation the government will step in and protect them if they screw up , ” he said at the same hearing .
Under the administration ’s proposal , large and complex financial firms would be subjected to higher capital and liquidity standards .
They would also get closer scrutiny from regulators and could be subjected to government - led dismantling that would force losses on shareholders and creditors , if a firm became unstable .
The so - called resolution authority is designed to avoid long - term government bailouts like the ones extended to troubled insurer American International Group AIG.N , or the massive market disruption that followed the failure of investment bank Lehman Brothers last year .
Sheila Bair , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp , said there is little reason to keep a list of systemic firms private .
She said a robust resolution authority would impose the necessary market discipline .
“ At the end of the day I ’m not really sure it ’s realistic to try to keep this confidential , and in the end they may be very well required to disclose this material under the SEC rules , ” Bair said , referring to disclosure requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan also acknowledged , “ I think one way or another , it ’s going to be hard not to disclose , in some way shape or form , who they are . ”
Geithner tangled multiple times with lawmakers on Thursday over whether the list of systemic firms would be kept private or made public .
Republican Representatives Spencer Bachus and Randy Neugebauer repeatedly criticised Geithner , saying they were confused how such a list could be kept hidden from potential investors and creditors .
“ I just want to know , are we going to disclose the companies or not ? ” Neugebauer said .
Geithner conceded that the draft legislation tried to strike a balance between the market ’s right to know the standards to which firms are going to be held , versus the need to not send out the wrong message that these firms would be protected by the government .
“ I am sure for the reasons many of you said , they will be disclosing the regime they ’re operating under to their creditors , their equity holders .
Analysts will know .
And it ’ll be clear how much capital they ’re holding , ” Geithner said .

Energy from the Sahara plants is expected to supply Europe by 2015 A sustainable energy initiative that will start with a huge solar project in the Sahara desert has been announced by a consortium of 12 European businesses .
The Desertec Industrial Initiative aims to supply Europe with 15 % of its energy needs by 2050 .
Companies who signed up to the $ 400 bn ( £ 240 bn ) venture include Deutsche Bank , Siemens and the energy provider E.On .
The consortium , which will be based in Munich , hopes to start supplying Europe with electricity by 2015 .
Desertec Industrial Initiative aims to produce solar - generated electricity with a vast network of power plants and transmission grids across North Africa and the Middle East .
" The time has come to turn this vision into reality , " said the company 's chief executive , Paul van Son .
" That implies intensive co-operation with many parties and cultures , to create a sound basis for feasible investments into renewable energy technologies and interconnected grids . "
The first stage will be to build massive solar energy fields across North Africa 's Sahara desert , utilising concentrated solar power technology ( CPS ) , which uses parabolic mirrors to focus the Sun 's rays on containers of water .
' Pivotal initiative '
The super - heated water will power steam turbines to generate electricity 24 hours a day , 52 weeks of the year .

The electricity will then be transported great distances to Europe , using hi-tech cables that suffer little conductive loss of power .
The move was " pivotal " in the transition of Europe , North Africa and the Middle East to sustainable energy supplies , said Mr Van Son .
Currently there are some small initiatives across Spain and parts of North Africa , but the scale of the Desertec initiative will surpass any other comparable projects .
Strong desire
The initiative has gained the support of the German government of Angela Merkel , who has already expressed a desire to offset a dependence on Russian gas supplies .
A number of North African countries have also expressed a strong desire to join the project , the company says , utilising their main sustainable natural resource - the Sun .
Some of the power generated by the Sahara solar energy fields will also be used by domestic African consumers , Desertec is keen to stress .
North Africa has a small population relative to the size of its desert terrain , it says .
The concept was first announced in 2007 by the Desertec Foundation , with small pilot projects based in North Africa .
Prince Hassan of Jordan has previously been mentioned as a big supporter .
Companies signed up to the consortium include ABB , Abengoa Solar , Cevital , HSH Nordbank , MAN Solar Millennium , Munich Re , M+W Zander , RWE and Schott Solar .

LINCOLN , Neb . 
In an unusual pushback against President Obama ’s expansion of federal financing of human embryonic stem cell research , the University of Nebraska is considering restricting its stem cell experiments to cell lines approved by President George W. Bush .
The university ’s board of regents is scheduled to take up the matter on Friday , and if it approves the restrictions  some opponents of the research say they have the votes , though others remain doubtful  the University of Nebraska will become the first such state institution in the country to impose limits on stem cell research that go beyond what state and federal laws allow , university officials say .
For weeks , the Nebraska board of regents has been the focus of a fierce campaign by opponents of embryonic stem cell research , most recently by a flood of e-mail and telephone calls , a petition drive and radio advertisements .
The effort , which is being met with an equally heated push by supporters , is a new front in the battle over the politically contentious research : it is being fought before a public university ’s governing board , not in a state legislature or in a ballot measure , where opponents have taken their fights before .
“ This could be another possible tool , ” said David Prentice , senior fellow for life sciences at the Family Research Council .
Instead , after production halted for several months , filming restarted with Johnny Depp , Jude Law and Colin Farrell taking turns to complete Ledger 's role .
Thanks to nimble rewriting , the stars ended up playing a character whose appearance changes as he travels between imaginary worlds .
These three marquee names have greatly improved the film 's box office prospects .
And for Gilliam , the out - there director of Brazil , The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and Twelve Monkeys , the arrival of a shape - shifting protagonist offered exciting and innovative possibilities .
In 1999 , the hard - living Reed ( who had worked with Gilliam on Munchausen ) finally dropped dead after a beer , whisky and rum bender .
" I 'd like to think I would be brave enough to drink myself into the grave , " he once said , and so he did , part - way through filming Gladiator .
Director Ridley Scott was unimpressed .
The mega - budget swords - and - sandals epic was to have marked a comeback for Reed but a mega - binge in Malta during a break in filming proved his last .
Computer - generated effects enabled Reed to " appear " in the scenes he had not yet shot , with his face digitally superimposed on to a body double and on to a mannequin .
Even with a reworked script in which his character , gladiator owner - trainer Antonius Proximo , died , however , the effects were laborious and expensive , costing $ US3.2 million for an extra two minutes of screen time .
In 1973 , just days before the release of Enter The Dragon , martial arts dynamo Bruce Lee died after complaining of a headache , aged 32 .
For his next project he had been planning to finish Game of Death , a film displaying his branch of martial artistry , for which he 'd already shot 100 minutes of footage .
This formed the core of 1978 's Game of Death , co-starring Kareem Abdul - Jabbar .
Unfortunately , the fight footage was fleshed out with scenes featuring Lee look - alikes and stunt doubles shot in shadowy half - light .
Hilariously , the 1978 film had a shot of a body double looking into a mirror , an unmistakable cardboard cut - out of Lee 's face glued to its surface .
In 1993 , Bruce Lee 's 28 - year - old son Brandon was starring in The Crow , a gothic drama directed by Australian Alex Proyas , when co-star Michael Massee fired a gun at him .
In a fatal accident , the gun was loaded with a blank , which fired a residual bullet into Lee 's spine .
He died the next day .
With only eight more days of filming required , Lee 's fiancee and mother supported Proyas 's decision to finish .
Proyas hired a friend of Lee's , Chad Stahelski , as a stunt double , superimposing Lee 's face onto his stand - in's .
In death , Brandon Lee became a gothic legend .
Bela Lugosi spent his life as a gothic legend .
B - film director Ed Wood had taken footage of Lugosi in a cape for a planned vampire feature , but could n't raise funding .
When Lugosi died in 1956 , Wood was undeterred .
For his 1959 sci - fi shocker , Plan 9 From Outer Space , Wood interspersed his old footage of Lugosi with new footage of Tom Mason , Wood 's wife 's chiropractor .
Mason half - covered his face with a cape in every scene , but still the similarity was , well , canny .
As Leonard Maltin wrote , " Lugosi died during production , and it shows . "
In 1982 , Vic Morrow and two child co-stars died in a helicopter accident on the set of Twilight Zone : The Movie .
Litigation lasted more than a decade .
Morrow 's key scenes were shot so the film was released , to mixed reviews and minor success .
Film sets can be dangerous .
Stars and stuntmen are regularly injured and occasionally killed .
During the filming of Shirley Barrett 's Love Serenade , stuntman Collin Dragsbaek died after falling from a silo onto a faulty airbag .
Released in 1996 , the drama received a low - key response .
Conjecture continues as to whether or not a stuntman died on the set of 1959's Ben-Hur .
Shot in Rome on the largest film set ever built , it culminated in an epic chariot race , with stand - in dummies depicting men being run over and killed .
But were they dummies ?
" We had a stuntman killed in the third week , and it happened right in front of me , " wrote stuntman Nosher Powell .
" You saw it , too , because the cameras kept turning and it's in the movie . "
However , director William Wyler and second unit director Yakima Canutt say no serious injuries or deaths occurred during filming .
With movies , it can be tough to differentiate reality from myth .
That 's also true for The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus .
Terry Gilliam has said that the last line spoken by Ledger during filming was improvised : " Do n't shoot the messenger . "
On the set several months later , Depp ad - libbed precisely the same line .
" Heath is still out there , " Gilliam said .
" Johnny 's channelling Heath somehow .
I mean , Shirley MacLaine would love all this . "
The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus opens on Thursday .
China , once a proud holder of United States post - World War II debt , is getting scared .
For years the People 's Republic has bought U.S. Treasuries , eventually becoming the largest holder of U.S. debt ( $ 799 BILLION to be exact ! ) .
Those days are long gone , though .
During 2009 , China has n't been buying many Treasuries and has been unloading dollars in a way that makes Geithner shiver at night .
And other big U.S. debt carriers like Japan may follow suit if confidence is lost .
This presentation , courtesy of RBS , takes a deeper look into China 's holdings and associated volumes since 2005 .
Get ready for shock and awe .
HYBRID EQUINES
Equid ( horse , donkey , zebra ) hybrids are well known and some are bred commercially .
The generic term for a zebra hybrid with a horse , pony , donkey or ass is a zebroid .
The generic term for a hybrid of a zebra with any type of donkey or ass is a zebrass .
The usual naming convention for hybrids is a " portmanteau word " comprising first part of male parent 's name + second part of female parent 's name

Zebras that are hand - reared or reared with domestic horses or donkeys can become tame enough to be led , ridden or used as draught animals .
Those raised with horses or donkeys may prefer to mate with horses or donkeys rather than with zebras .
MULES , MOLLIES AND HINNIES
Mules ( donkey stallion / horse mare ) are bred as draught animals .
Mules and hinnies are depicted in Egyptian art circa 1400 BC and were valued as draught animals by the Romans .
Male mules are sterile , but fertile female mules ( mollies ) sometimes occur and can be mated to either a horse or donkey stallion .
In France , the Poitou donkey is used almost exclusively for siring large , strong mules on Poitou horse mares .
Jack donkeys are reportedly often reluctant to mate with horse mares and may have to be trained to do so .
Miniature mules are produced using smaller breeds of donkey and pony .
An article in The New York Times , Thursday Feb 22nd , 1968 entitled " Rare Type Of Mule Kicks Up Heels At Children 's Zoo " detailed the birth of a foal to a Shetland pony fathered by a burro at New York 's Central Park Zoo .
Although sterile , mule stallions are generally castrated to make them tractable .
The hinny ( horse stallion / donkey mare hybrid ) is less common .
The head of a hinny is more horse - like than the head of a mule .
They are harder to produce than mules as stallion / jenny matings are less likely to result in pregnancy .
Hinnies are smaller and finer boned than mules .
This was believed to be due to the donkey mare having a less roomy womb , but the difficulty in impregnation suggests it is largely genetic .
Donkeys have 62 chromosomes while horses have 64 chromosomes ; hybrids are less likely where the male has more chromosomes than the female .
According to the “ Illustrated Natural History ” by the Rev JG Wood ( 1853 , 1874 ) :
The cross - breed between the horse and the ass , which is commonly known by name of the Mule , is a very valuable animal for certain purposes , possessing the strength and power of the horse , with the hardiness and sure foot of the ass .
The largest most useful Mules are those which are produced by a male ass and a mare , the large Spanish Ass being the best for this purpose .
In Spain and in many eastern countries the Mule is an animal of some importance , the parents being selected as carefully as those of the horse itself .
The chief drawback in the rearing of this animal is that it is unproductive , and is incapable of continuing its species , so that there can be no definite breed of Mules , as of horses and asses .
In " The Variation Of Animals And Plants Under Domestication " Darwin wrote : " The ass has a prepotent power over the horse , so that both the mule and the hinny more resemble the ass than the horse ; but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the male - ass than in the female , so that the mule , which is the offspring of the male - ass and mare , is more like an ass , than is the hinny , which is the offspring of the female - ass and stallion . "
In " The Variation Of Animals And Plants Under Domestication " Darwin elaborated : " Colin , who has given in his ' Traite Phys. Comp . ' tome 2 pages 537-539 , [...] is strongly of opinion that the ass preponderates in both crosses , but in an unequal degree .
This is likewise the conclusion of Flourens , and of Bechstein in his ' Naturgeschichte Deutschlands ' b. 1 s. 294 .
The tail of the hinny is much more like that of the horse than is the tail of the mule , and this is generally accounted for by the males of both species transmitting with greater power this part of their structure ; but a compound hybrid which I saw in the Zoological Gardens , from a mare by a hybrid ass - zebra , closely resembled its mother in its tail . "
THE KIANG ( The Field , 29th April 1893 ) Major Hay states that in Tibet the kiang breeds with the horse , and that their produce is highly valued ; and he adds , but not on his own knowledge , that the hybrids are regarded as fertile , which is in the highest degree improbable .
Professor Cossart Ewart crossed kiangs ( a type of wild ass ) to ponies to test the theory that the then newly discovered Przewalski horse was a hybrid rather than a distinct species .
This summary appeared in the Western Times ( among others ) on 30th June , 1903 : THE WILD HORSE .
INTERESTING DISCUSSION OF NEW BREED .
The paper by Professor Ewart on the wild horse laid on the table at the recent meeting the Royal Society Edinburgh has now been printed and circulated .
The writer states that decided to breed a number of kiang - horse hybrids to test the view hold by many zoologists that the horse discovered by the celebrated Russian traveller Przewalsky , said to the true wild horse , was not entitled to rank as distinct species , but was merely a hybrid between the kiang and a Mongolian or other Eastern pony .
With the help of Lord Arthur Cecil he succeeded early in 1902 in securing a male wild Asiatic ass and a couple of Mongolian pony mares - one a yellow dun the other a chesnut .
Jacob , the wild ass , was mated with the dun Mongol mare , with a brownish - yellow Exmoor pony , and with a bay Shetland - Welsh pony .
The chesnut Mongol pony was put to a light grey Connemara stallion .
Of the four mares referred to three had already foaled , viz. , the Exmoor and the two Mongolian ponies .
Comparison showed that the kiang horse hybrid differed from Przewalsky 's horse in having at the most the merest hock callosities , in not neighing like a horse , in having finer limbs and joints and less specialised hoofs , in the form of the head , in the lips muzzle , and ears , in the dorsal band , and in the absence even at birth of any suggestion of shoulder stripes or of bars on the legs .
Professor Cossar Ewart proceeds :
While most the zoologists who hesitated to regard Przewalsky 's horse as representing a distinct and primitive type favoured the view that it was a mule ; some asserted it in no way essentially differed from an ordinary horse .
The colts brought from Central Asia , they said , were the offspring of escaped Mongol ponies .
Others affirmed that they failed to discover any difference between the young wild horses in the London Zoological Gardens and Iceland ponies of a like age .
To test the first of these assertions , I , as already mentioned , mated a chestnut Mongol pony with a young Connemara stallion ; to test the second , I purchased last autumn a recently imported yellow dun Iceland mare in foal to an Iceland stallion .
As I anticipated , the chestnut Mongol mare produced a foal the image of herself .
This foal it is hardly necessary to say , decidedly differs from the Przewaisky colts recently imported from Central Asia by Mr. Hagenbeck , and it decidedly differs from the kiang hybrid .
The Iceland foal , notwithstanding the upright mane and the woolly coat , for a time of a nearly uniform white colour , could never be mistaken for a wild horse , and the older it gets the differences will become accentuated .
Przewalsky 's horse is neither a pony mule nor a feral Mongolian pony , and if , moreover , it is fertile ( and its fertility can hardly be questioned ) , I fail to see how we can escape from the conclusion that it is as deserving as , say , the kiang to be regarded as a distinct species .
FERTILE MULES AND HULES
FERTILITY OF HYBRIDS .
( The Field , 25th September 1897 ) I have noticed some correspondence in your columns concerning the fertility of hybrids and think that the following may be of interest , and at all events it will give an opportunity to some of your readers of thorough investigation .
Some years ago I was driving up from Perarolo to Cortina d'Ampezzo , and noticed several very peculiar looking animals , which to my eye were neither mules nor hinnys .
My driver , a very intelligent man , one of the Apollonio family of Cortina , at once gave me their history , pointing out that this one was by a male mule out of a female hinny , and that one by a male hinny out of a female mule .
He was perfectly familiar with the appearance of each breed , and declared that all these crosses were fertile .
Ile told me what , indeed , I could see for myself , that these crosses , or descendants of crosses , were quite common in that part ; but added that he did not think that they had any good points about them .
As to mules , he disliked them on account of their character , but admired their capacity for work .
If he had to go over the e ground every day , then he would have a mule or mules ; but as they dislike being put out of their groove , and resent it , horses suited him better .
The mule , he said , is sly , and one must be always on one 's guard with him .
- M. D .
[ There can be no doubt that there is some error in the account .
In the Poitou district , where very large numbers of mules are bred annually , a fertile mule is unknown ; and M. Ayrault , in his valuable work , " De l'lndustrie Mulassiere , " gives statements that are quoted in their work on " Horses , Mules , & c. " by Messrs Tegetmeier and Sutherland , showing that the mules there are in the most favourable conditions for breeding , but are never fertile .
The sterility of equine mules is fully discussed in this work .
—ED . ]
Mules are generally sterile , but several female mules have produced offspring when mated to a purebred horse or ass .
This is so rare that the Romans had a saying , " cum mula peperit , " meaning " when a mule foals " - the equivalent of " when hell freezes over . "
When a mule gave birth in Albania in 1994 , it was thought to have unleashed the spawn of the devil on a small village .
When a mule gave birth in 2002 in Morocco five years ago , locals feared it signalled the end of the world .
Donkeys have 62 chromosomes while horses have 64 chromosomes .
As well as different numbers , the chromosomes have different structures .
Mules and hinnies have 63 chromosomes that are a mixture of one from each parent .
The different structure and number usually prevents the chromosomes from pairing up properly and creating successful embryos .
Since 1527 there have been more than 60 foals born to female mules around the world and probably additional unreported ones .
However , mollies have a strong maternal drive and will kidnap foals of horses and donkeys sharing the same paddock .
From The Royal Natural History , edited by Richard Lydekker and published 1894 :
There appear to be no authenticated instances of mules breeding among themselves ; although the female mule will occasionally produce offspring with the male horse or ass .
And it is somewhat remarkable that it does not appear that the hybrids between any other members of the Equine family are mutually fertile .
However , Cornevin and Lesbre stated that in 1873 an Arab mule was fertilized in Africa by a horse stallion , and produced female offspring .
Both parents and the offspring were taken to the Jardin d'Acclimatation in Paris where the mule had a second female colt sired by the same stallion and then two male colts , one sired by an ass and the other by a horse stallion .
The female progeny were fertile , but their offspring were feeble and died at birth .
Cossar Ewart gives an account of a recent Indian case in which a female mule gave birth to a male colt .
The best documented fertile mule mare was " Krause " who had 2 male offspring , both sired by her own sire .
It is now known that in most fertile mule mares , the mare passes on a complete set of her maternal genes ( i.e. from her horse / pony mother ) to the foal rather than a mixture of chromosomes .
A female mule bred to a horse will therefore produce a 100 % horse foal .
In 1898 , an Indian pack - mule produce a pony - like foal .
In the 1920s , a mule mare called " Old Beck " ( Texas A&M ) produced a mule daughter called " Kit " .
When Old Beck was bred to a horse stallion she produced a horse son ( he sired horse foals ) .
When bred to a donkey , she produced mule offspring .
Likewise , a mare mule in Brazil has produced two 100 % horse sons sired by a horse stallion .
There is an unverified case of a mare mule that produced a mule daughter ( this may be another account Old Beck ) .
The daughter was also fertile and produced a horse - like foal with some mule traits ; this was dubbed a " hule " .
There are no reports as to whether the hule was fertile ; it may have been castrated in the same way as a mule stallion .
After " Old Beck 's " case came to light , several others were reported but no definite proof was available concerning most of those .
According to “ AMERICA MAKES SOME NEW ANIMALS ” by Frank Thone ( Miami Daily News Record , 7th March , 1929 ) :-
THE old dictum that hybrids are all sterile and can’t reproduce has , of course , been handled pretty roughly in all these experiments .
In some cases it holds , in others it does n’t .
Anyhow , the doctrine seems to have been established originally by reference to the most familiar of domestic hybrids , the mule .
Mules as a rule do not breed , yet in the recent past two undoubted cases of mule mares giving birth to healthy foals have come to light .
Erasmus Haworth of Lawrence , Kansas , reports the case of a mule mare that produced a foal sired by a jack .
And rare as such cases are , this same mule is now believed to be with foal for a second time .
“ Old Beck " is only an ancient Texas " cotton mule ” mare who has been on this planet long enough to vote , but she has done her bit toward breaking the age - old reproach of sterility leveled at her hybrid race .
For she has not only borne offspring — two lusty colts — but now has a grandchild .
This grandchild is a horse in appearance , although one - quarter mule .
For a mule to have a foal is an almost miraculous rarity , but for one of these to propagate is practically unheard of .
Yet this is the record of “ Old Beck , " as reported by A. H. Groth of Texas A. and M. College .
Her first offspring was a daughter , sired by a jack , and foaled in 1920 .
This feat brought her to the attention of the college authorities , and she was soon given a home on the campus .
Subsequent matings with other jacks failed to produce another colt , but a noted stallion of the college stud sired a foal that has grown up to look quite like a horse — and a fine horse at that .
" Old Beck ’s ” mule daughter has remained without issue , in spite of several attempts to breed her , but the horse - like colt , a stallion , has sired one healthy colt , now over a year old .
A molly gave birth to 2 foals in Nebraska in the mid-1980s .
The event prompted the first genetic testing of a mule 's offspring .
Tests showed no evidence the mother passed along any genetic markers from her donkey father , who was also the father of the foals .
This is called " hemiclonal transmission " .
She passes on only her horse DNA with no shuffling of horse and donkey genetic material .
In April 2007 , a 7 year old black molly , “ Kate ” , owned by ranchers Larry and Laura Amos gave birth at a Grand Mesa ranch near to Colbran .
Kate was one of 10 mules purchased from Pleasant Plains , Arkansas and would already have been pregnant .
Genetic testing at the University of Kentucky and the University of California at Davis confirm that Kate is a mule and that the foal is her offspring .
This rules out stolen foals that were donkeys or mulish - looking horses .
Her son has a donkey - like appearance suggesting the father was a donkey and , because female mules usually only pass on their maternal horse DNA , that he is a mule .
A fertile hinny in China is believed to be a unique case .
Her offspring was sired by a donkey .
Named " Dragon Foal " , one would have expected a donkey foal if the mother had passed on her maternal chromosomes in the same way as a mule .
However , Dragon Foal appears to be a strange donkey with some mule - like features .
Her chromosomes and DNA tests confirm she is a previously undocumented combination .
In Morocco , a mare mule produced a male foal that is 75 % donkey and 25 % horse i.e. she passed on a mixture of genes instead of passing on her maternal chromosomes .
There are no recorded cases of fertile mule stallions .
Asses have 62 chromosomes , horses have 64 so the hybrids have 63 .
When there 's an odd number of chromosomes , meiosis ( cell division to form gametes ( egg or sperm cells ) ) does n't work correctly .
This causes hybrid sterility .
Nature has a way round this called meiotic drive .
Genes from each parent become tightly linked instead of independently assorted .
The genes from one parent - usually the mother - will be over - represented in the gametes produced by the hybrid offspring .
Normally when cells divide to form gametes , a random mix of maternal / paternal alleles ends up in each gamete .
With meiotic drive , there is distinct segregation of maternal and paternal alleles : all the horse genes end up on one side of the cell and all the donkey genes end up on the other .
The cell then splits unevenly .
Only one of those daughter cells will get the necessary machinery for life ( genes from the mother , mitochondria , cytoplasm etc ) while the other cell is discarded along with all the genes from the father !
In fertile mule mares , the mare passes on a complete set of her maternal genes ( i.e. from her horse / pony mother ) to the foal .
A female mule bred to a horse will therefore produce a 100 % horse foal ( which is fertile ) while a female mule bred to an ass will produce another mule .
It seems to be nature 's way of letting a female mate with a related species , but preserving the genes from the female side of the family so the hybrid descendent can produce a purebred offspring .
ZEBRA / DONKEY ( ZEBRA / ASS ) HYBRIDS
Zedonks ( zebronkeys , zonkeys , zebadonks , zebrydes ) are zebra stallion / donkey hybrids .
Zebrets are donkey stallion / zebra mare hybrids and are rare .
Other names have been used : zenkey ( Japan ) and hamzab ( Israel ) .
Generic terms are zebrass , zebra mule and zebra hinny .
Zebrasses resemble donkeys with a striped pattern overlaided on the donkey 's background colour .
Usually there is clear striping on the legs , a dorsal stripe .
There may be facial stripes and indistinct stripes on the body .
According to Dorcas McClintock in " A Natural History Of Zebras , " a hybrid foal from a Somali wild ass bred to a mountain zebra mare had 2 transverse shoulder stripes , leg bands and zebra - like ear stripes .
Piebald zebrasses are produced when a zebra is crossed to a piebald donkey .
Zebra / ass hybrids have been recorded since at least the 1850s .
According to the “ Illustrated Natural History ” by the Rev JG Wood ( 1853 , 1874 ) : Between the zebras and the domestic ass several curious Mules have been produced , and may be seen in the collection of the British Museum .
It is worthy of notice that wherever a cross breed has taken place , the influence of the male parent seems to be permanently impressed on the mother , who in her subsequent offspring imprints upon them some characteristics of the interloper .
In his " The Variation Of Animals And Plants Under Domestication " , Darwin wrote : " I have seen , in the British Museum , a hybrid from the ass and zebra dappled on its hinder quarters . [...]
Many years ago I saw in the Zoological Gardens a curious triple hybrid , from a bay mare , by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra " .
Zebrass males are generally sterile in spite of Darwin 's report of that horse mare x zebrass stallion hybrid ( is it possible the stallion was a quagga rather than a hybrid ? ) .
A zebrass foaled at Schoenbrunn in 1841 .
German zebroid ( 1929 )
Hybrid of Grevy 's Zebra and Somali Ass ( 1929 )
" Ass- zebra " ( " Wonders of Animal Life " edited by J A Hammerton ( 1930 ) ) .
Possibly one of the Sells - Floto Circus Hyneys .
Grevy 's zebra /ass hybrid .
A Grevy ’s zebra stallion was presented to USA by King Menelik of Abyssinia .
President Roosevelt .
It lived at the National Zoo from 1904 to 1919 and was loaned for a while to the US Dept of Agriculture for use in cross - breeding experiments with horses and asses .
At least some of the hybrid offspring went to Sells - Floto circus .
Sells - Floto Circus advertised one of the hybrids as : A New Member Of The Animal Kingdom .
A strange beast came into being a short time ago , and naturally it was the Sells - Floto Circus which seized upon it as thing of interest to the public at large
That beast was the ‘ Hyney , ’ a Government animal , now being exhibited with the Circus to show the wonderful results of the propagation and breeding of entirely different animals .
For the parents of the Hyney were brought from widely separated parts of the earth .
After years of experiments , in which attempts were made to cross the zebra with some other beast that might give it value as a domestic animal , the United States Government , through its division of husbandry and animal industry , decided that the burro was the proper animal .
And so a Grevy Zebra , of the Galla district of Africa , the fiercest and wildest of all types of zebra , was crossed with a Rocky Mountain Burro , known as the slowest and dullest and most sluggard animal of the horse species .
The result was a success .
And thus it is that a new animal enters into being – the Hyney – with a burro for a mother and a zebra for a father .
The combination is perfect .
As fleet , as graceful as a horse , yet the Hyney has all the strength and working power of a mule .
As intelligent as its zebra forebear , still it has the docility of its burro ancestors .
Five of the animals are exhibited both in the menagerie and main performance of the Sells - Floto Circus , where the extent of their intelligence and their value as farm animals is well depicted .

An article from New York Times , June 16th , 1973 , announced the birth of a zebra / donkey hybrid at the Jerusalem Zoo .
They called it a " hamzab " from the Hebrew for donkey - zebra and erroneously claimed it to be the first of its kind born anywhere .
A breeding programme at Colchester Zoo , England in 1975 produced three zedonk hybrids from Arabian Black Ass mares and A Chapman 's Zebra stallions .
In Christmas week of 1975 their third zedonk foal was born .
Previous attempts at crossbreeding zebras with horses and donkeys had failed to produce surviving foals .
The zoo's aim was to produce disease - resistant work - horses for Africa .
Colchester Zoo experts believed their success was due to the use of an Arabian donkey ( a variety not tried before in hybridization experiments ) and had hoped that the hybrids would be viable and fertile .
Their last surviving zedonk , Shadow , died in April 2009 aged 34 .
She shared an enclosure with zebras , but did not socialise with them .
In latter years , the zoo tried to dissociate itself from the hybridisation programme by claiming the zedonks were the result of accidental matings , but contined to claim they 'd bred the first ever zedonks , despite the hybrids being bred over 100 years earlier .
The Chestatee Wildlife Preserve in Georgia , U.S. had its own zonkey on July 21 , 2010 .
A donkey sanctuary in Shropshire has a zorse called Zulu , a zedonk called Zambi , and a zebra hinny called Zee ( the latter results from a donkey stallion and zebra mare ) .
The sanctuary does not condone breeding zebroids , but had rescued the three hybrids which had been bred in the USA where donkey / zebra and horse / zebra crosses are bred on several ranches as exotic riding or driving animals .
Ippo the ' Zonkey ' was born after a zebra stallion climbed out of his enclosure to mate with an endangered donkey at an animal reserve in Florence , Italy .
The sire had been rescued from a failing zoo .
The mother was a Donkey of Amiata , an endangered species , in a neighbouring field .

Usually a zebra stallion is paired with a horse mare or ass mare , but in 2005 , a Burchell 's zebra named Allison produced a zebrass ( a zebret ) called Alex sired by a donkey at Highland plantation in St. Thomas parish , Barbados .
In " Origin of Species " ( 1859 ) Charles Darwin mentioned four coloured drawings of hybrids between the ass and zebra .
In his " The Variation Of Animals And Plants Under Domestication " , he mentions an unusal zebra triple - hybrid : " I have seen , in the British Museum , a hybrid from the ass and zebra dappled on its hinder quarters . [...]
Many years ago I saw in the Zoological Gardens a curious triple hybrid , from a bay mare , by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra . " and " a compound hybrid which I saw in the Zoological Gardens , from a mare by a hybrid ass - zebra , closely resembled its mother in its tail . "
If true , this is the only account of a fertile zebrass stallion .
In " Darwinism An Exposition Of The Theory Of Natural Selection With Some Of Its Applications " ( 1889 ) , Alfred Russel Wallace commented on the production and appearance of hybrids : " Crosses between the two species of zebra , or even between the zebra and the quagga , or the quagga and the ass , might have led to a very different result . "
THE ZEBRULA
Although there is a much more detailed page about this specific hybrid and its uses , here is a summary .
A widely circulated report , published in May 1903 , writes : " That entirely new species of animals may be created is demonstrated by the latest achievements of the world ’s greatest animal hunter , Carl Hagenbeck .
On his animal ranch near Hamburg , Germany , Hagenbeck has for some time past been devoting himself to the creating of new species of animals and birds .
He has obtained new varieties of deer and mules and wonderful crosses between the zebra and the horse . [. . .]
Probably the furthest developed of the new species , of animals he is creating is the cross between the zebra and the horse .
A number of these are at his depot in Hamburg , and it is not an uncommon sight to see him taking a drive behind two of these strange “ horses . ”
The characteristic of these animals is that they possess the zebra ’s body and the horse ’s head , and are as large as mules .
The aim has been to obtain a stronger and better blood than that possessed by the existing equine breeds .
At present Hagenbeck has six zebra-horses broken to harness .
He has found them possessed of greater endurance and strength than horses of their weight , and seemingly possessed of greater intelligence . "
According to the Croydon Chronicle and East Surrey Advertiser , 19th December 1903 ( among many others ) : Scientific Cross - breedings .
Carl Hagenbeck , of Hamburg , the well - known wild animal dealer , [. . .] is trying to introduce the zebrule , or hybrid horse and zebra into the German Army in place of mules .
We know that the zebrules are being tried in the Indian Army .
NEW DRAFT ANIMAL DOOMS ARMY MULE .
CROSS BETWEEN HORSE AND ZEBRA IS SUPERIOR .
DOES NOT CONTRACT DISEASE .
More Lively Than the Animal That Provokes Cussing and Cannot Be Less Intelligent .
( Various , August 1903 )
The days of the mule are numbered .
Within the next few centuries his melodious voice will have been stilled forever .
This is the prophecy of United States Consul General Richard Guenther , at Frankfort , Germany , who sends a report to the state department on the chances of the zebrula , a cross between the horse and zebra , superceding the mule .
He says of the qualifications of the zebrula : “ German papers contend that it has been demonstrated that the mule , the cross between the horse and donkey , is inferior to the cross between horse and zebra .
Formerly the opinion prevailed that the zebra was almost extinct .
The opening up of Africa , particularly the eastern part , reveals these fine animals in large numbers .
Compared with horses and cattle , they possess peculiar advantages , as they are immune against the very dangerous horse disease of Africa , and also against the deadly “ tztze . ”
The question was therefore raised whether the zebra could not take the place of the mule , commonly used in the tropics .
The greatest credit with reference to the solution of this problem is due to Professor Cossar Ewart , who has been trying since 1895 to produce crosses between horses and zebras , with a view to developing an animal superior in every respect to the mule .
Professor Ewart produced crosses from mares of different breeds and zebra stallions of the burchell kind .
The offspring is called zebrula , and on account of its form and general bodily condition , especially the hardness of the hoofs , is specially adapted for all transport work heretofore performed by mules .
The zebrula is much livelier than the mule and at least as intelligent .
The zebra stripes are often well preserved , while the undertone of the skin is generally that of the mother .
A full grown zebrula is fourteen hands high and the girdle circumference about 160 centimeters ( sixty - three inches ) .
The experiments so far have been so successful that it is predicted that the zebrula during the present century will completely supercede the mule . ”
Other newspapers of the time wrote " The days of the mule are numbered , comes the word from Germany , where a new animal , the Zebrula , has been evolved to take the place of the gentle - eyed , melodious - voiced and hard - hoofed little animal .
The new animat1 is the result of a cross between the horse and a zebra .
The nomenclature of horseology would indicate that a better name for the new quadruped would - be the zehorska . "
“ A report from the November 25th , 1904 edition of the Olsburg Gazette mentions the zebrulas at the World ’s Fair : “ The Zebrula .
A new breed of horseflesh has come into public notice , namely , the Zebrula .
Some of these animals are being shown at the World ’s Fair .
They originated in Africa from a cross of the Zebra stallion and the horse mare .
They are said to be highly regarded in South Africa , where they are valuable on account of not being affected by the bite of the tsetse fly , which is sure death to the horse or donkey .
Breeders in South Russia , in England and Germany have taken up the breeding of these animals .
They are said to be hardier than the mule or horse .
The Zebra is known to be a very wild and swift animal and for a long time it was found impossible to make him useful to man on account of his wildness .
The crossing has taken some of the wildness out of his progeny .
The name given to the progeny is Zebrula .
It is likely that we will soon have a good many varieties of the Zebrula , as there are two species of zebras , those inhabiting the mountains and those inhabiting the plains , and the crossing of these in various ways should give a great variety of markings and other conformations . ”
On January 27th , 1905 , The Times Dispatched asked “ Will Zebrulas Come Here ? [ American ] Government May Experiment With New Zebra Horse Cross .
It is understood that the government has under consideration the importance of zebras for the purpose of experimental breeding with the horse .
The Agricultural Department has been asked to take up this work , but as Uncle James Wilson
Is pretty well acquainted with the American mule and his good qualities , it is not sure that he will spend much time or money on the new breed .
The hybrid between the horse and the zebra is a striped animal with great speed and endurance .
Germany has been experimenting with this cross .
for several years and has tested its value in war with results that were very encouraging .
It is said of the zebrula that it is as gentle as a horse , in this respect differing very much from the zebra .
It is stronger than a mule and entirely immune from certain diseases which are pretty certain to attack horses and frequently with fata ) results when imported into certain parts of Africa .
As soon as the German Government were satisfied with the success of this line of crossing , it at once established a breeding station in its African possessions .
At this station much attention in being given to the breeding of zebrulas , and these are now regularly used in handling heavy ordnance , as , for instance , mountain batteries of the colonial service .
They are also being used as mounts for officers and men , and for draught ' purposes in various ways .
Later on , The Cincinnati Enquirer of May 1st , 1905 wrote : “ Three Zebrulas Added To the Curiosities of the Cincinnati Zoological Garden .
Three zebrulas have been received at the zoo from the Hagenbeck Company at Hamburg , Germany .
The animals have been in this country for some time , and were a part of the big collection of wild animals which was exhibited at the St. Louis World ’s Fair by Hagenbeck .
The zebrula is a hybrid animai , which is secured by crossing the zebra with either a donkey or a horse .
One of the zebrulas received here is a cross with a horse , and the other two are crossed with donkeys .
The zebrulas are bred by the German army for experimental purposes for use in Africa .
The zebra has a hide which can resist the insects and flies , and by crossing them with horses the Germans hoped to produce an animal which had the endurance of the horse and those qualities of a zebra which would allow it to be used for domestic purposes in Africa .
The hybrid was called the zebrula as it is purely an artificial animal . "
Ultimately , the zebrula was to become a circus curiosity as this cutting from The Kingsport Times of August 20 , 1925 indicates : " ZEBRAS AND ZEBRULAS DO TRICKS AT WILL OF CHRISTY'S TRAINERS .
For the first time in the history of wild animal training zebras and zebrulas have been taught to perform tricks and obey the will of their trainer .
Some fine specimens of these animals are with Christy Bros , trained wild animal show , which will exhibit in Kingsport on Monday , September 14 .
The striped equine has always been the stumbling block in the paths of educators and trainers of beasts and animals .
Many of them after herculean and patient endeavor have given up in disgust and consigned the convict coated animal to a remote and disagreeable locality , acknowledging that he was beyond all human understanding .
Christy Bros , trainers for many years concurred in this belief , but heroic perseverance was finally and justly rewarded .
These circus kings now have with their great show zebras that give performances which include everything done by the best trick horses .
Interesting in this connection is the appearance and presentation at the same time of several zebrulas , or equine hybrids , the only ones of their kind , produced by scientific crossing of full blooded zebras and Kentucky thoroughbred horses . "
Here we have an account of the hybrid from The Elyria Reporter on August 22nd , 1905 : “ To experiment With Zebrula .
Zebrula , .a newly coined word .
Is applied lo a peculiar appearing animal .
The zebrula is a cross between a full - blooded , vicious zebra and an American horse .
The zebra , as students of natural history are informed , is the hardest of all four - footed , hay - eating animals to handle .
It is more treacherous than either the lion or tiger , and is ten times more lively , when it comes to kicking , than the well - known Missouri mule .
The zebrula does not Inherit these bad qualities from his sire ’s side .
He looks like a zebra about the head and has dull brown stripes that show indistinctly int [ sic ] he still duller brown of the hair , which is very soft and silky .
A full - blood zebra possesses bright , black and white stripes in conformation the zebrula follows the type of the American horse , and from the infusion of the latter ’s blood .
Its temper is normal , as it were , and it displays the many good traits of the horse .
English army officers have become greatly interested in the zebrula and have induced the government to request Mr. Hagenbeck to breed at least a dozen of them and send them to South Africa , for experimental purposes .
The officers believe the zebrula will stand the South African climate better and do considerably more work than either the full - blooded mule or horse .
From
The evening News , September 7th , 1922 : “ Science is just now Interested In hybrids of the zebra stock .
There is a flecky - built faintly - striped zebrula at the Zoo , a cross between a zebra and a Shetland pony .
In Southern Indiana the zebra has been successfully mated with Arabia mares , producing the zebroid , a tough but docile beast of burden .
One advantage expected of this cross
Is the longevity that the sire may be able to confer on his progeny .
In his native Africa he sometimes reaches 75 years , and if his hybrid American offspring can carry their vigor into fifty years , this would be more than double the horse ’s expectancy of life .
“ ( The claim of such longevity in zebras was incorrect ) The Daily Courier of December 7th , 1936 , mentioned the zebrula in brief : “ Mule , Jennet and Zebrula .
Of animals which owe their existence to man the mule and the jennet are the oldest examples , and no one can deny that the mule is a most useful creature Hardy as a donkey , strong as a horse , surefooted and tireless , there is nothing like it for rough country traveling Its success caused the production of the zebrula which is a cross between the horse and zebra .
The zebrula is as strong as a mule , but livelier and even less liable to disease .
ZEBRA / HORSE , ZEBRA / PONY HYBRIDS
Zebras will hybridize in the wild with feral horses in South Africa and with wild asses in northeast Africa .
When I was a child , I had some of Time Life books .
If memory serves , one contained a photo of a mixed herd of zebra , wild horses and zebroids where the aggressive zebra stallions stole the horse mares from the feral herds in parts of South Africa .
The horses arrived in the region with settlers and with the British and German armies .
Some escaped and others were abandoned ( due to the cost of returning them to Europe ) ; being herd animals , they would have been attracted to zebra herds .
Others fell prey to lions as they lacked the zebra ’s camouflage .
The zebroid offspring , although they grew to adulthood and remained with zebra herds , were also vulnerable to predators and , being generally sterile , did not produce offspring of their own .
Zorses or zebrules are zebra stallion / horse hybrids and zonies are zebra stallion / pony hybrids .
Zorses are sometimes called golden zebras due to dark stripes overlaying a chestnut background , though the colour depends on the colour of the horse parent .
The zetland is a one off accidental zebra / Shetland pony hybrid .
Zebroid is a blanket term for zebra / horse hybrids .
Any of the zebra species can be used in breeding zebroids ; the colour depends on the colour of the horse ; usually there is clear striping on the legs , a dorsal stripe , striped face and less distinct stripes on the body ; the somewhat donkey - like attributes of zebras result in a dorsal stripe , upright mane without a forelock and large ears .
Another term for zebra hybrids is zebra mule since zebra stallions ( which are hand - raised or fostered on a horse mare ) are used in preference to zebra mares .
Zebra hinnies are rarely found .
Zebroid and zebrass males are generally sterile .
Although wild animals , zebras which are hand - reared or reared with domestic horses can become tame enough to be led , ridden or used as draught animals .
Piebald zorses are produced when a zebra is crossed to a piebald horse .
Stripes are visible on the colored areas of the coat .
The white patches form a startling contrast with these striped patches .
A hybrid called " Eclyse " was bred in Germany in 2007 from a zebra mare and piebald or skewbald horse stallion ( piebald = black - and - white , skewbald = any - other - colour - and - white e.g. brown / bay / chestnut with white ) .
Pied zorses are not commonly bred .
In " Origin of Species " ( 1859 ) Charles Darwin wrote : " In Lord Moreton 's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga , the hybrid , and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black Arabian sire , were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga ..
In his " The Variation Of Animals And Plants Under Domestication " , Darwin wrote : " I have seen , in the British Museum , a hybrid from the ass and zebra dappled on its hinder quarters . [...]
Many years ago I saw in the Zoological Gardens a curious triple hybrid , from a bay mare , by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra " .
and further described Moreton 's hybrid ;
In the famous hybrid bred by Lord Morton ( ' Philosoph .
Transact . ' 1821 page 20 . ) from a chestnut , nearly purely - bred , Arabian mare , by a male quagga , the stripes were " more strongly defined and darker than those on the legs of " the quagga . "
The mare was subsequently put to a black Arabian horse , and bore two colts , both [...] plainly striped on the legs , and one of them likewise had stripes on the neck and body .
In " Darwinism An Exposition Of The Theory Of Natural Selection With Some Of Its Applications " ( 1889 ) , Alfred Russel Wallace commented : " Crosses between the two species of zebra , or even between the zebra and the quagga , or the quagga and the ass , might have led to a very different result . "
Raymond Hook of Nanyuki , Kenya , is claimed to have bred the first zebroids by crossing a Grevy 's zebra stallion with domestic mares ( date unknown ? ) .
The hybrids had Grevy - like narrow stripes and a tufted tail , but were more horselike in conformation and color .
The strong , sure - footed , docile and mulelike zebroids were used as pack animals by climbers on Mount Kenya 's lower slopes .
Grevy 's zebra has also been crossed with donkey mares .
Carl Hagenbeck produced zebrules ( zebra / pony hybrids ) at his Tierpark in Hamburg .
These had dark bodies and faintly visible stripes .

In " Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine " by George M Gould and Walter L Pyle ( 1896 ) wrote :
The influence of the paternal seed on the physical and mental constitution of the child is well known .
To designate this condition , Telegony is the Word that was coined by Weismann in his " Das Keimplasma , " and he defines it as " Infection of the Germ , " and , at another time , as " Those doubtful instances in which the offspring is said to resemble , not the father , but an early mate of the mother , " - or , in other words , the alleged influence of a previous sire on the progeny produced by a subsequent one from the same mother .
In a systematic discussion of telegony before the Royal Medical Society , Edinburgh , on March 1 , 1895 , Brunton Blaikie , as a means of making the definition of telegony plainer by practical example , prefaced his remarks by citing the classic example which first drew the attention of the modern scientific world to this phenomenon .
The facts of this case were communicated in a letter from the Earl of Morton to the President of the Royal Society in 1821 , and were as follows :
In the year 1815 Lord Morton put a male quagga [ a type of zebra ] to a young chestnut mare of seven eighths Arabian blood , which had never before been bred from .
The result was a female hybrid which resembled both parents .
He now sold the mare to Sir Gore Ousley , who two years after she bore the hybrid put her to a black Arabian horse .
During the two following years she had two foals which Lord Morton thus describes : " They have the character of the Arabian breed as decidedly as can be expected when fifteen sixteenths of the blood are Arabian , and they are fine specimens of the breed ; but both in their color and in the hair of their manes they have a striking resemblance to the quagga .
Their color is bay , marked more or less like the quagga in a darker tint .
Both are distinguished by the dark line along the ridge of the back , the dark stripes across the forehand and the dark bars across the back part of the legs . "
The President of the Royal Society saw the foals and verified Lord Morton 's statement .
Cossar Ewart , Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh ( 1882 - 1927 ) and a keen geneticist , crossed a zebra stallion with pony mares in order to disprove telegony , or paternal impression , a common theory of inheritance at the time .
Cossar Ewart found that zebra -horse hybrids were brown with faint stripes .
When the same mares were subsequently mated with a pony , the resulting foals showed none of the markings or temperamental characteristics of a zebra .
He completely undermined Lord Morton 's case by pointing out that similar bandings occur naturally , without crossing , in certain breeds of horses , notably a Norwegian breed ; and by breeding many zebra hybrids — the progeny of a great variety of virgin horse and pony mares , followed by foals from the same mares by an Arab stallion — not one of which showed any marking or other characteristic which could be traced to the zebra !
Cossar Ewart found that in male zebra-hybrids the sexual cells were immature and the sperm were abnormal , however the ovaries of female zebra-hybrids appeared similar to those of a normal mare or female zebra .
As well as disproving paternal impression , he wanted to produce a more resilient draught animal for South Africa ; one less subject to local diseases and more tractable than a mule .
Gos de Voogt wrote , in “ Our Domestic Animals , their habits , intelligence and usefulness ” ( translated from the French by Katherine P. Wormeley ; edited for America by Charles William Burkett ; Ginn and Co. ; Boston ; 1907 ) : Lately a Scotch naturalist , J. C. Ewarts , who has made himself a name in this domain , mated a zebra stallion , named Matopes , with a mare from one of the Scotch islands .
The product was a foal which received the name of Romulus , the new race being called zebrules , Sir John , a colt , and the fillies Bunda and Black Agnes , which were both sold to Hamburg ; the English government then bought them and sent them to India , where they were trained for service in a mountain battery .
In shape the zebroids are a cross between the horse and the zebra .
Romulus , born in 1896 , derived from his father only very indistinct stripes , while Sir John has them more clearly defined .
These zebroids are strong , manageable , and easy to train both for saddle and harness ; it is hoped that they have inherited the zebra 's immunity from equine diseases .
An experiment that disproved telegony .
Left , a striped zebra - horse hybrid , produced by mating a mare with a zebra stallion .
The same mare was then mated with a horse stallion , and produced the filly shown below , which bears no traces of any effect of the previous sire .
The experiment was carried out by the US Government and reported in " Genetics in Relation to Agriculture " by E B Babcock and RE Clausen .
( " The Science of Life " by H G Wells , J Huxley and GP Wells ( c.1929 ) )
In " The Science of Life " ( c 1929 ) by H G Wells , J Huxley and GP Wells , the authors wrote " To - day it is possible to assert without any question that telegony is a mere fable , which could only have gained ground in the days when men were ignorant of the true mechanism of fertilization and reproduction .
The supposed instances of telegony which are constantly being reported even to - day , invariably .
Perhaps the most famous example is that of Lord Morton 's mare .
The mare , a pure Arabian , was mated with a zebra stallion , and produced a hybrid foal .
On two later occasions , she was bred to a black Arab stallion , and gave birth to two further foals .
These had legs which were striped even more definitely than those of the hybrid foal or the zebra sire himself , and one had some stripes on parts of the neck also .
In addition , they had a stiff mane of very zebra - like appearance .
Darwin himself accepted the evidence as sufficient proof of telegony .
But when definitely planned and long - continued experiments were made , the proof escaped .
Cossar Ewart , for instance , made a number of horse and zebra crosses to test the validity of the belief .
When mares previously bred to zebras were afterwards mated with horse stallions , their colts were often without the least trace of zebra characters .
In other cases , colts with some degree of striping were produced .
But one mare gave birth to a striped colt as a result of her first mating , which was with a horse stallion ; while two later matings with other stallions , made after she had been successfully mated once and three times respectively with a zebra , gave unstriped offspring .
In other cases , when striped colts were born to a mare and stallion after the mare had been previously mated to a zebra , Ewart took other mares , closely related to the first , bred them to the same Arabian stallion without having mated them previously with a zebra - and they , too , produced striped foals .
In short , the production of striping ( and also of erect mane ) in foals is not a very uncommon occurrence in horses ; it may appear whether previous impregnation by a zebra has taken place or not .
The stripes of Lord Morton 's foals were a mere coincidence , well illustrating the danger of drawing conclusions from single and therefore possibly exceptional cases , and the need for systematic and repeated experiments . "
Above : The King 's Hybrid ( 1902 ) .
This is the animal that Hammerton later described in 1930 .
A REMARKABLE ZEBRA HYBRID .
( The Sketch , 30th July 1902 ) The accompanying photograph of a remarkable zebra hybrid which Lord Kitchener brought home for presentation to the King is of peculiar interest .
The animal ( which , properly speaking , should be described as a “ quagga , " being a cross between a zebra and a pony ) was bought as a yearling in South Africa by Captain A. C. Webb , of the Johannesburg Remount Depot , who , after training it to the saddle , sent it home by Lord Kitchener as a present to His Majesty .
The quagga is an inch and a -quarter over thirteen hands the body - colour brown , lightening to bay on the head and legs , with very peculiar striping .
The marks on the body and cheeks are almost vertical , the leg markings horizontal to the hocks , below which the colour is black , while the dorsal stripe tapers to the tail .
The animal is very beautiful and shapely , strongly resembling a well - grown pony , with a quiet , easy temper .
When first brought home by Lord Kitchener , it was quartered in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace , but , as the King has decided that so remarkable a hybrid specimen should find a place in the Zoological Gardens , it was taken to Regent 's Park last week by two of the Royal grooms , who led it quietly through tire busy streets without attracting any attention .
It occupies , for the present , a big loose - box in the Upper Yard in the “ Zoo , " where it has apparently made itself quite at home and comfortable .
From a scientific point of view , the new - comer is said to be one of the most remarkable animals that have come into the possession of the Society for many years .
The photograph was taken at the Remount Depot at Johannesburg .
In " Animal Life and the World of Nature " ( 1902 - 1903 ) , WP Dando ( Fellow of the Zoological Society , London ) writes : Much interest has been aroused at the Zoo by the presentation by His Majesty the King of a hybrid Zebra , a cross - breed between a stallion horse and a Burchell 's zebra mare .
This animal was sent over to England by Lord Kitchener , who discovered it among the remounts placed at his disposal in the Transvaal during the war .
The zebra markings are fairly distinct on all four legs , also slightly across the loins and at the root of the tail , continuing a few inches up the centre of the buttocks .
These markings ( and the tail itself , which it will be noticed is more like a donkey 's than a horse 's ) are the only characteristics of the zebra which are prominent , the animal lacking the erect mane and other distinguishing features .
Since the animal has been in captivity he has become most ferocious and savage - no doubt from the want of proper exercise .
By the courtesy of the Society 's officials I was enabled to get my pictures in the yard adjoining the stables , the animal being securely held ; and I took my position at a respectful distance . "
In " Wonders of Animal Life " ( 1930 ) , J A Hammerton , it noted that crosses were made between Chapman 's zebras and a ponies during the South African War .
In " Wonders of Animal Life " ( 1930 ) edited by J A Hammerton , it notes : During the South African War , an attempt was made by the Boers to evolve a new animal to supplement the supply available for transport work .
A cross was obtained between a Chapman 's zebra and a pony and a specimen was captured by the British and presented to King Edward VII by Lord Kitchener .
The animal was produced chiefly for hauling guns .
It was photographed by W S Berridge .
WP Dando FZS , in the 1902/03 encyclopedia " Animal Life and the World of Nature " described the same hybrid as a cross with a Burchell 's zebra .
McClintock noted that a Chapman 's zebra stallion , kept by Friedrich von Falz - Fein at Askania - Nova in southern Russia actually preferred to mate with domestic mares rather than with a Chapman zebra mare .
Eventually the stallion killed his zebra mate by biting her to death .
In “ Out of Africa ” , the African memoirs of Baroness Karen Blixen ( 1885 - 1962 ) published in 1937 , Blixen writes : ” It is a much debated question whether it is possible to cross domestic animals with the game : many people have tried to create a type of small horse fitted to the country , by breeding from zebra and horses , though I myself have never seen such cross-breeds . ”
Today , zorses and zonies are relatively common .
Zebra hybrids are considered better suited ( through better temperament and more horse - like / donkey - like conformation ) than pure zebras to being ridden or used for draught .
They are resistant to some of the diseases that afflict horses and donkeys , hence they have been used use in Africa for trekking and draught .
In the USA they are bred as riding and show animals , because of their interesting appearance .
in Manila Zoo in 2011 , a domestic stallion that found itself isolated by other horses , made itself part of the zoos zebra herd where it fathered a “ hebra ” .
ZORSE / ZONY COLOURS
Zebras are normally bred to solid colour horses / ponies to produce offspring with striping over the whole body .
The interaction of chestnut and zebra striping gives rise to the alternative name " golden zebra " .
The striping pattern depends on the type of zebra used .
When bred to a piebald ( black - and - white ) horse ( US : piebald pinto ) or to a skewbald ( brown / bay / chestnut - and - white ) horse ( US : skewbald pinto ) or to particoloured USAnian breeds known as " Paint " and " Appaloosa " , the offspring have a mix of striped coloured areas and unstriped white areas .
Grey horses are not used as the offspring will be grey , becoming white with age , albeit having the conformation of a zorse / zony .
DARWIN ON HYBRID EQUIDS In " Origin of Species " ( 1859 ) Charles Darwin mentioned four coloured drawings of hybrids between the ass and zebra .
He noted " In Lord Moreton 's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga , the hybrid , and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black Arabian sire , were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga .
Lastly , and this is another most remarkable case , a hybrid has been figured by Dr. Gray ( and he informs me that he knows of a second case ) from the ass and the hemionus . "
Darwin described the latter hybrid in " The Variation Of Animals And Plants Under Domestication " :
The Equus indicus [ onager ] a hybrid , raised at Knowsley ( ' Gleanings from the Knowsley Menageries ' by Dr. J.E. Gray . ) from a female of this species by a male domestic ass , had all four legs transversely and conspicuously striped , had three short stripes on each shoulder and had even some zebra - like stripes on its face !
Dr. Gray informs me that he has seen a second hybrid of the same parentage , similarly striped .
In his " The Variation Of Animals And Plants Under Domestication " , Darwin wrote : " I have seen , in the British Museum , a hybrid from the ass and zebra dappled on its hinder quarters . [...]
Many years ago I saw in the Zoological Gardens a curious triple hybrid , from a bay mare , by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra .
and further described Moreton 's hybrid ;
In the famous hybrid bred by Lord Morton ( ' Philosoph .
Transact . ' 1821 page 20 . ) from a chestnut , nearly purely - bred , Arabian mare , by a male quagga , the stripes were " more strongly defined and darker than those on the legs of " the quagga . "
The mare was subsequently put to a black Arabian horse , and bore two colts , both [...] plainly striped on the legs , and one of them likewise had stripes on the neck and body .
In that book , Darwin concluded : " The ass has a prepotent power over the horse , so that both the mule and the hinny more resemble the ass than the horse ; but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the male - ass than in the female , so that the mule , which is the offspring of the male - ass and mare , is more like an ass , than is the hinny , which is the offspring of the female - ass and stallion . "
In " The Variation Of Animals And Plants Under Domestication " Darwin elaborated : " Colin , who has given in his ' Traite Phys. Comp . ' tome 2 pages 537-539 , [...] is strongly of opinion that the ass preponderates in both crosses , but in an unequal degree .
This is likewise the conclusion of Flourens , and of Bechstein in his ' Naturgeschichte Deutschlands ' b. 1 s. 294 .
The tail of the hinny is much more like that of the horse than is the tail of the mule , and this is generally accounted for by the males of both species transmitting with greater power this part of their structure ; but a compound hybrid which I saw in the Zoological Gardens , from a mare by a hybrid ass - zebra , closely resembled its mother in its tail . ) "
In " Darwinism An Exposition Of The Theory Of Natural Selection With Some Of Its Applications " ( 1889 ) , Alfred Russel Wallace commented : " Crosses between the two species of zebra , or even between the zebra and the quagga , or the quagga and the ass , might have led to a very different result . "
OTHER EQUID HYBRIDS , ZEBRA X ZEBRA HYBRIDS
All equid species will hybridise to produce viable offspring , though the offspring are generally sterile with only a few exceptions .
Hybrids between Equus africanus ( wild African ass ) x Equus asinus ( domestic donkey ) hybrids are fully fertile ..
Hybrids between the Equus caballus ( domestic horse ) and Equus przewalskii ( Przewalski horse ) , a primitve wild species , are fertile despite their differing chromosome numbers ( 66 for the Przewalski horse , 64 for the domestic horse ) .
The onager ( Equus hermionus ) is an Asiatic ass or hermione .
Ass / onager and horse / onager hybrids appear to have been bred in the ancient civilisations of western Asia , these having a similar role to modern mules .
WILD ASS HYBRIDS .
( The Field , 27th June 1903 ) Equus temoinus , Pallas , is usually known as the kiang .
Blandford terms it the Asiatic wild ass [. . .]
Capt .
Sutherland and myself , says that it , breeds freely with the horse , and that the produce is highly valued .
There can be , in fact , but little doubt that the mule bred by the kiang would be of the highest value . [. . .]
As practical a man as Colonel Kinloch suggested that a cross between the kiang and the horse would prove a most valuable animal , possessing all the good qualities of the ordinary mule , with greater size and strength . [. . .]
There were formerly several examples of the Syrian wild ass ( Equus hemippus , St Hilaire ) in the gardens [ London Zoo ] , and in the catalogue of animals published in 1896 there is a record of a hybrid between this species and the Asiatic ass , which was bred in 1883 .
According to Dorcas McClintock in " A Natural History Of Zebras , " Grevy 's zebra has 46 chromosomes ; plains zebras have 44 and mountain zebras have 32 .
The domestic horse has 64 chromosomes .
Although all 3 zebra species have been crossed with domestic horses , the 2 dissimilar sets of chromosomes inherited by a zebra hybrid cannot mix because of differences in number , size and shape .
As a result , almost all zebra hybrids are sterile .
In captivity , plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras .
The hybrid foals had no dewlap and , except for their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern , they resembled the plains zebra parent .
Attempts to breed a Grevy 's zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in a high rate of abortion .
In the wild , zebra species do n't interbreed even where their ranges overlap or they graze together .
This was was also true when the quagga and Burchell 's race of plains zebra shared the same area .
A hybrid foal from a Somali wild ass bred to a mountain zebra mare had 2 transverse shoulder stripes , leg bands and zebra - like ear stripes .
According to Crandall , some hybrids ( " racial intergrades " ) were foaled by a Hartmann 's mare and sired by a Cape stallion between 1924 and 1931 ; one of these was sent to London Zoological Gardens and figured by Antonius ( 1951:196 ) .
Crandall noted that Gray ( 1954 ) listed many crosses between zebras and both horses and asses , wild and domestic .
In most cases the male hybrids seemed to be sterile , but there was some evidence indicating that females may sometimes be sterile .
Several of these hybrids were figured by Antonius ( 1954 ) .
Additionally , Przewalski's horse interbreeds freely and fertilely with domestic horse and has produced hybrids , probably sterile , with zebras , but did not produce offspring when mated with donkeys ( Gray 1954 ) .
Although Crandall did not state where these Przewalski hybrids were produced , they may have been at Hagenbeck 's Tierpark .
As a result , there may be a very low level of domesticated horse blood in some Przewalski's horses today .
The herd at the National Zoo 's breeding farm at Front Royal , Virginia is known to contain domesticated horse blood .
There are three living species of zebras : the plains zebra Equus quagga , Grevy ’s zebra E. grevyi ( endangered ) and the mountain zebra E. zebra ( endangered ) .
The plains zebra has five extant subspecies : Burchell ’s zebra E. q. burchelli , Grant ’s zebra E. q. boehmi , Selous ’ zebra E. q. borensis , Chapman ’s zebra E. q. chapmani and Crawshay ’s zebra E. q. crawshayi .
The mountain zebra has two subspecies : Cape mountain zebra E. z. zebra and Hartmann ’s mountain zebra E. z. hartmannae .
The plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris , but Grevy ’s zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus .
Plains and mountain zebras live in stable harems consisting of one stallion , several mares , and their offspring ; the harems are expanded by taking mares from the harem they were born into ( this prevents inbreeding ) .
Plains zebra groups gather into large herds which may contain sub - groups , but where the structure is more fluid .
Grevy 's zebra stallions establish large territories and monopolise mares that enter them ; mares with young remain in the sire ’s territory – if they wander into another territory the stallion will kill the foal in order to mate with its mother .
In all species , excess males establish bachelor groups .
Hybridization between Grevy ’s zebra and Grant ’s zebra , a sub-species of plains zebra has been reported in the wild , resulting in fertile F1 individuals .
Hybrids were derived from natural matings between male Grevy ’s zebra and female Grant ’s zebra in Kenya , and the F1 hybrids remained with the Grant ’s zebra group .
[ Cordingley , J. E. et al .
Is the endangered Grevy ’s zebra threatened by hybridization ?
Anim .
Conserv. 12 , 505 –513 , ( 2009 ) ]
Ito et al studied six populations comprised of two pure species ( Grevy ’s zebra and Grant ’s zebra ) and four hybridized populations of Grevy ’s zebra x Grant ’s zebra , including F1 x F1 hybrids ( F2 hybrids ) and F1 backcrossed to one or other parent species .
The backcrossed individuals tended to have ranges overlapping with the backcross parent allowing introgression .
The distribution of Grant ’s zebra and Chapman ’s zebra minimises the opportunities for hybridization in the wild , but they are commonly kept in captivity and are not managed by studbooks , so there is a risk that these sub -species might have hybridized in the past and that some zoo populations are mongrelised .
[ Ito , H. , Langenhorst , T. , Ogden , R. et al .

Sci Rep 5 , 13171 ( 2015 ) . ]
Hybridisation has been recorded between the plains and mountain zebra , though it is possible that these are infertile due to the difference in chromosome numbers between the two species .

HORSES , ASSES , ZEBRAS , MULES AND MULE BREEDING ( 1895 )
By W. B. TEGETMEIER , M.B.O.U. , F.Z.S. , AND C. L. SUTHERLAND , F.Z.S. , CHAPTER X. HYBRID EQUIDAE .
It would appear that all the different species of the genus Equus are capable of breeding together and producing hybrid offspring , some of which are perfectly sterile mules , whilst others are apparently fertile , either with one or other parent species if not inter se .
Some of these hybrids are of great economic value , and it is deeply to be regretted that the opportunities that have presented themselves in our European zoological collections have not been utilised as they might have been , in introducing new species into the service of man , and in producing other useful hybrids beyond the common mule .
In the present chapter I propose to enumerate , as far as practicable , the various equine hybrids that have been produced , and of which any definite account has been published , commencing with those of the horse .
HORSE ( E. CABALLUS ) HYBRIDS .
It appears most probable , though it has not been absolutely proved , that the horse is capable of producing hybrids with every other species of the genus Equus .
The hybrid between the horse and the ass is well known .
When the ass is the male parent it is termed a mule ; on the other hand , if the horse is the sire the produce is termed a hinny , or in some places a jennet .
The consideration of the breeding and practical utilisation of these two hybrids will be fully treated of in the concluding chapters .
The horse has bred repeatedly with both the Mountain and Burchell 's zebra .
In the Jardin d'Acclimatation there is at the present time a hybrid between the horse and the Burchell ’s zebra , of bright bay colour , with black legs and distinct dorsal stripe .
Some years since I described some hybrids between the horse and the female Burchell which were in the park of Sir Henry Meux at Theobalds .
The sire of one was an ordinary park pony , that of the other an American trotting pony .
This latter hybrid was striped on the legs , neck , and haunches .
Both of them , as might be expected , showed much of the equine character and form of the male parent ; and from the relative sexes of the parents they necessarily partook more of the characters of the hinny than of the mule .
Early in this century a pair of hybrids , bred between the horse and BurchelFs zebra , were driven about London in the service of the Zoological Society , but I have not been able to ascertain definitely the relative sex of the two parents , but believe they were hinnys from a zebra mare .
The horse has also bred with the Asiatic ass { E. hemionus ) .
In a private letter Lieutenant J. L. Harrington informs me of a male Hemione breeding with an Indian pony , and producing a hybrid that , with the exception of the tail , which was asinine , looked more like a pony than anything else .
Two hybrids , between a Hemione and a mare , in the Jardin d'Acclimatation , were described by the late Mr. Jenner Weir .
One of these is a very beautiful animal , possessing no shoulder stripes , and with very faint dorsal stripe .
ASS { E. ASINUS ) HYBRIDS .
The hybrids between both sexes of the ass and the horse have been spoken of under the last heading .
The ass also hybridises freely with Burchell ’s zebra ; a hybrid of this is now in the Jardin d^Acclimatation .
It is rather sparely striped , but the three shoulder stripes are well marked .
ASIATIC ASS ( E. HEMIONUS ) HYBRIDS .
The Asiatic Ass hybridises with the horse , as has been already stated .
It has also been mated with Burchell ’s zebra in the Jardin des Plantes , the produce being a faintly striped animal with a broad dorsal stripe , the hind quarters of which are not striped but dappled .
The cross between the Asiatic ass and the mare has been already named .
MOUNTAIN ZEBRA ( E. ZEBRA ) HYBRIDS .
Several of these were apparently recorded in the " Knowsley Menagerie , " but sufficient care was not taken to distinguish between the two species , namely , the Mountain and Burchell ’s zebras .
BURCHELL'S ZEBRA ( E. BURCHELLII ) HYBRIDS .
Burchell ’s zebra breeds most freely with several of the other species of Equus , and there is no doubt whatever that the hybrids of this most horse - like of the asses and zebras now existing would be exceedingly valuable to man if the animals were mated as carefully as is done in breeding heavy draught mules in Poitou , and pack mules for the military service in India .
The Burchell is an animal much better adapted by its structure and form to the use of man than the other wild asses , and were it properly mated and utilised would no doubt produce most valuable hybrid offspring .
The hybrids of the Burchell zebra with the horse have already been mentioned ; it also breeds freely with the common ass .
In the Gardens of the Zoological Society at Melbourne there are some Burchell 's zebras that were bred in Paris , for this most useful animal breeds freely in confinement .
On September 6th , 1892 , an experiment was made by crossing the zebra with a white so - called Siamese ass , which was obviously a variety of the domesticated Equus asinus .
The foal was born on October 25th , 1893 , showing that the period of gestation in Burchell 's zebra resembles that of the ass in being considerably over twelve months .
The young one is described as a strong , vigorous animal , galloping round the enclosure when a day old and evincing considerable speed .
Its colour is somewhat remarkable , not resembling that of its white sire , but being very dark with pronounced shoulder and dorsal stripes , black tips to its ears , and bars on the legs , which are well marked , especially over the joints — the zebra from which it was bred being a true Burchell , not marked on the legs like the variety known as Chapman^ s zebra .
The foal is described as being a compact and well - made little animal , showing splendid bone .
As the progeny of the Burchell zebra are likely to attract much attention , I reproduce the photograph as it was published in the Australasian .
In the Jardin d'Acclimatation there is another hybrid between a Burchell 's zebra and a white Egyptian ass , which shows three distinct shoulder stripes , but otherwise is very faintly marked .
A hybrid between a male Burchell ’s zebra and the common ass was bred by the Earl of Derby and figured in the " Knowsley Menagerie . "
It was utilised by being driven in tandem , and the skin was afterwards deposited in the British Museum .
The Hemione or Asiatic wild ass has also been bred with Burchell ' s zebra .
QUAGGA ( E. QUAGGA ) HYBRIDS .
In Colonel Hamilton Smith 's unpublished volume he gives a portrait , drawn by himself , of a hybrid , the foal of a quagga and a brood mare .
This was faintly striped on the fore - quarters .
In the fine collection of plates known as the “ Knowsley Menagerie ” there are numerous illustrations of the wild Equidae , more especially of the striped species inhabiting Africa , namely , the Equus zebra , E. burchellii , and E. quagga .
All these species interbreed , not only with each other , but with the wild unstriped asses of Asia .
Dr. Gray figured in the “ Knowsley Menagerie ” a mule bred at Knowsley between a male Tibetan wild ass , or kiang , and the female zebra .
In this the legs and neck are banded .
There is also a figure of a mule between a Maltese male ass and zebra , in which the head , neck , and legs are well striped , the body less so , and the hind quarters profusely spotted .
Should any of my readers refer to the plate in the folio they will find that the names of those two have been transposed , as is evident on referring to the text .
There are also figured a mule between Burchell ’s zebra and the common ass ; a second between the ass and the kiang , the titles of which are also transposed on the plate ; finally , we have a mule between the kiang and Burchell 's zebra , and , what is very interesting , a representation of the offspring of a mule , of male ass and zebra parentage , with a bay pony mare .
This strange animal may be described as iron - grey , with a short , narrow dark band on the withers , very faint indications of perpendicular stripes on the sides , distinct dark stripes on the hocks and knees , a horse - like tail , bushy from the base , and a heavy head with a grey hog mane .
This creature , singular from its triple parentage , was eight hands high , and was regularly used in harness .

ONE of the happy trends of 2009 has been that crime is down in major American cities , even the ones that have had a rough year in other respects .
Today the New York Timesreports that New York City is on track to have its smallest number of murders since 1962 :
There were days upon days in New York City when not a single person was murdered in 2009 .
Two such stretches , in February and March , lasted nearly a week each .
The trend can be understood as crime being on a downward trajectory for years , for a variety of reasons — the end of the crack epidemic , better gun control , new policing strategies , and so on — rather than something special about 2009 .
But the concurrence unsettles the widespread and intuitive belief that violent crime will rise during times of economic distress .
Perhaps property crime , theft and the like , has more reason to spike during a downturn ?
Here in Austin , a memorable crime of the year was that someone punched a hole through the wall of a popular Mexican restaurant and stole a bag of meat .
But property crime , according to the FBI 's preliminary statistics , is also in decline .
This is worth keeping in mind as concerns about public safety and police staffing will come up often during next year 's elections .
And there is no reason to feel complacent .
Earlier this year one criminologist fretted to me that although he was n't seeing a direct relationship between crime and the downturn at the moment , he would look for a spike in a few years , from young people who had been derailed from entering the workforce .
The Los Angeles Times , observing a similar downward trend in southern California , suggests that expectations matter :
Southern California 's widespread decline in crime may be due in part to the example set by the LAPD 's long - running success under Beck 's predecessor , Chief William J. Bratton , said George Kelling , a leading criminal justice scholar at Rutgers University .
" Where police chiefs might have been perfectly willing to say , ' It 's the economy or something else and there 's nothing we can do about it , ' their bosses — mayors and city councils — now know they can and should expect reductions in crime , " Kelling said .
" There is now a pressure of , ' If you ca n't get the job done , we 'll find someone who can . ' "

A boat and related equipment are joined together in a welded metal frame .
Everything is painted in a unifying plastic layer to resemble the surface of a model kit .
The real boat is transformed into a model of itself , and its original purpose has given way to something else .
TOYS’R’US was made for the exhibition Besökarna ( the Visitors ) in a new part of Malmö , the Western Harbour , built for the housing fair Bo01 in 2001 .
The area was developed as a demonstration project to provide a model for future cities .
Today , six years later , it still feels like a model .
The artificial atmosphere still awaits to break loose from its surrounding plastic sticks .
In an interview earlier today Mozilla 's CEO John Lily announced that Mozilla would be on the edge of releasing an iPhone app :

SpaceX , one of the most important and renowned private spaceflight companies in the world today , has demonstrated over the years that its engineers have sufficient skill to construct a rocket able to deliver a payload to the low - Earth orbit .
Now , following the successful test launches of its delivery systems , it plans for the future .
Company representatives have recently announced that they are planning to send the first unmanned cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station in 2010 , Space reports .
The first flight is scheduled to take place sometime between May and November 2010 , officials from the Hawthorne , California - based SpaceX have announced .
They reveal that three NASA astronauts have already experienced the first contact with the new spacecraft , at the company 's headquarters .
The operational tests of the Dragon capsule saw the participation of NASA astronauts Tracy Caldwell Dyson , Shannon Walker and Douglas Wheelock , who learned firsthand this October how to interface with the new capsule design , once it was safely docked on the ISS .
“ Three of the participating astronauts will be on board the ISS when Dragon makes its first visit under the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services ( COTS ) program , ” SpaceX officials announce .
A part of the funds required by the new spacecraft came from the American space agency , under the COTS initiative , which the company won fair and square .
The new cargo spacecraft will operate in very much the same way the new Japanese HTV module does – it will fly close to the ISS , and it will then be caught with the robotic arm , and taken to a docking port .
The three astronauts that already had contact with the new craft will be part of Expedition 24 , which will be on the station between May and November 2010 .
SpaceX therefore has a seven - month window to launch Dragon to the ISS .
Speaking about the October tests , the private company 's CEO , Elon Musk , has said recently that , “ This was the first time the NASA astronauts who will interact with Dragon during its early mission were actually inside a Dragon flight vehicle . ”
The cargo vehicle will be delivered to space aboard a Falcon 9 rocket , which is also scheduled to make its debut flight in early 2010 .
NASA signed a $ 1.6 - billion contract with SpaceX , which included the successful completion of three successful flight tests of Falcon 9 delivery systems equipped with Dragon capsules , as well as 12 cargo flights to the station , all stretched between 2010 and 2015 .
During these times , the space agency will be left without any orbital capabilities of its own , as the space shuttles are due to be retired late next year .
Until 2015 / 2106 , when Project Constellation projects will start being completed , there will be no more ISS visits from NASA - built spacecraft .
American astronauts will launch on Russian Soyuz space capsules .
BRUSSELS , Nov 10 ( Reuters Life ! ) -
A five - month brewing window , three years in storage and a sour end product with a farmyard bouquet .
Lambic beer risked dying out a decade ago , but its survival and growth now seem assured despite being among the most awkward beers to make , store and market .
“ Ten years ago I might have said it was set to disappear .
Now there ’s great expansion of traditional brewing and blending , ” said Tim Webb , author of the Good Beer Guide Belgium .
Beer can be divided into three basic forms : bottom - fermented lager and top - fermented ale , both of which have cultivated yeast introduced , and a third form , spontaneous fermentation , using only wild yeasts in the air .
Lambic beer is produced in this third way .
The umbrella group for brewers and blenders Horal says it is the oldest surviving brewed beer in the world .
Jean Van Roy , head of the Cantillon brewery in Brussels , has been glued to the weather forecasts since late October .
Spontaneously fermented lambic beer is not a 365 - day a year product and can only be made when the night temperature drops to around 5 degrees Celsius ( 41 Fahrenheit ) or below .
That is because the boiled wheat and barley juice known as wort must sit overnight in a large copper vessel to cool and absorb airborne yeasts that waft in through vents .
Van Roy ’s brewery , which doubles as a museum welcoming about 30,000 visitors per year , boasts equipment dating back to the 19th century and spiders as natural pesticides .
Most beers are consumed within weeks of production , but gueuze , the most commonly drunk form of lambic beer , sits in barrels for an average of two years and then in a bottle for as much as a year before being sold .
Pure lambic , essentially flat , can be consumed as it is , but is generally drunk as gueuze , a sparkling blend of lambics of different ages that ferment again in the bottle , or as kriek , gueuze with sour cherries .
Other fruit can also be added .
The very dry and sour taste is a shock to anyone used to standard lager or ale .
“ If you approach it as a wine or a traditional cider it ’s easier to appreciate ...
The only reason it ’s not celebrated by people with a taste for excellence is that they have not heard of it , ” said Webb .
CHAMPAGNE OF BEERS ?
European law decrees that the terms lambic , gueuze and kriek can only be used for acid beer made by spontaneous fermentation with specific airborne yeasts .
However , unlike champagne , it need not be made in a specific region -- in lambic ’s case the traditional area is in the Senne valley in and to the southwest of Brussels .
Armand Debelder , a brewer and blender , established an umbrella group , formalised in 2004 , to secure the artisanal industry ’s future .
“ You can brew spontaneously fermented beer all over the world , but lambic only here .
The wild yeasts live in this region , ” he said .
The problem for Lambic brewers is that it is far more expensive to make than average beers and they have struggled to push through price hikes at bars mostly controlled by big breweries .
Unlike Trappist ales , you will struggle to find a gueuze of kriek in a Belgian bar , with the exception of the Belle - Vue and Mort Subite brands of brewing giants Anheuser - Busch InBe and Heineken .
“ With hygiene norms of the 1990s , all the small breweries could have closed , ” said Debelder .
“ People also only had a taste for sweet things . ”
“ Now at least we are respected in the Belgian brewing industry .
Growing interest in slow foods has also helped . ”
Van Roy agreed that the appeal of products such as organic wines and traditional ciders had also extended to lambic beer .
“ The Internet has clearly played a role here .
More and more people also know what is an authentic lambic , ” he said .
The word has indeed spread .
Cantillon exports some 55 percent of its beers .
North American , Scandinavian , Japanese and increasingly Italian drinkers are buying up gueuze .
Bottles on sale for some 5 euros ( $ 7.49 ) in a Belgian brewery could fetch at least $ 50 in a Manhattan bar .
Visiting Carlos Rodriguez , of Ales Agullons near Barcelona , is hoping to adjust Spanish palates with mixes of his own brews and lambic .
Californian speciality brewer Russian River has also turned its hand to spontaneous fermented beer .
“ Twenty five years ago , we had to beat against doors to sell our beer .
Now people beat on our doors to buy , ” said Van Roy .
Beer author Tim Webb believes the lambic brewers and blenders are at a crossroads , facing a decision of whether to survive as folksy craft beer producers or to establish themselves as makers of a growing premium product .
“ You have premium white wines from champagne .
Why ca n’t that happen to gueuze and lambic .
That would justify the money they need to invest , ” he said .
Imagine a world where your snail mail would be converted to digital form before cluttering up your mailbox , allowing you to trash those coupon and credit card offers with a single click while having the important stuff forwarded directly to you .
If you live in Switzerland , this dream is even closer to a reality thanks to a partnership between the Swiss Postal Service and a startup called Earth Class Mail .
First , an explanation of what Earth Class Mail does .
The company allows customers in 170 countries ( including the US ) to sign up for an address where they will have their mail delivered .
When the mail starts coming in , its outer packaging / envelopes are scanned — without being opened — and an image is e-mailed to you .
From there , you can decide to recycle the junk ( according to the New York Times , Earth Class Mail customers recycle 90 percent of their mail ) , have the mail forwarded , or have it opened and the contents scanned .
All the images are encrypted , and you can even request that mail that contains personal information ( such as bills or credit card offers ) be shredded .
This is all done with your authorization — if you 're in the US , you must file a form with the US Postal Service so they know someone 's not just trying to steal your mail — and the company promises the utmost privacy and security with your documents .
Now , the Swiss Postal Service has opened Swiss Post Box , its own branded version of Earth Class Mail .
Not only can Swiss citizens access the service , people can set up addresses in Germany as well , with addresses in Austria , France , and Italy coming in July .
All documents will be scanned in the same facilities where the real Swiss Post handles sensitive banking materials , according to the website , and will make it available to subscribers for 19.90 francs ( or roughly US $ 18.35 ) per month .
We here at Ars think this service is pretty cool for numerous reasons .
Not only can it reduce the amount of physical junk you get every day ( I dunno about you guys , but I get an entire armful of mail every day and maybe one item a week is something real that I want ) , it can also be useful while you 're traveling .
Waiting for certain documents and find out at the last minute you 're going on a week - long business trip ?
No problem .
Have it scanned and e-mailed to you or simply wait until it arrives and have it sent to wherever you are .
There are few differences between Swiss Post Box and a standard Earth Class Mail service except that the former is being used by the Swiss Postal Service itself .
( We 're trying to decide whether it would be better or worse if this was adopted by the US Postal Service and processed in its own facilities . )
If you 're curious to learn more about how this system and the company works , it turns out that the entire first season of the TV show Startup Junkies is about Earth Class Mail , and it's all currently on Hulu .
The unsuspecting governor , smack in the middle of an important press conference , missed being hit by a projectile by mere inches .
The projectile ?
Not a bullet , but an egg .
An outraged citizen calling himself " the Common Guy " ( el tipo común ) interrupted the press conference by screaming in outrage at Puerto Rico 's governor , Luis Fortuño , and throwing a slider that landed on a sign highlighting a new development project the governor was announcing .
As officers locked the man in a bear hug and carted him off , and as the press swarmed this Common Guy , it became clear that his public display of resistance was not only transcendental for its raw expression of pain and anger , but was also symbolic and representative of everyone 's frustration and open outrage at the turn of events on the island .
Puerto Rico is witnessing the kind of social , economic , and political upheaval not seen in decades .
Declaring a fiscal emergency , the pro-statehood Fortuño administration recently passed a Fiscal Emergency Law , which , among other measures , implemented the layoff of over 20,000 government workers — nearly 10 % of the total .
In addition to huge cuts in budgets and services , the layoffs caused immediate shock and outrage due to its massive breadth and potential effects .
Government officials contend that they inherited a bankrupt government from previous administrations along with a huge debt load .
They are scrambling to prevent their credit ratings to be classified in the lowest of categories — the junk rating — and contend that the measures were necessary .
With an unemployment rate of around 16 % , it is obvious that Puerto Rico confronts a serious economic crisis .
According to U.S. Census Bureau 2008 figures , the island 's median household income stands at $ 18,610 ( compared with $ 52,175 in the United States ) and median family income stands at $ 21,639 ( $ 63,211 in the U.S. ) .
Per capita income is $ 10,064 ( $ 27,466 in the U.S. ) , and 41.4 % of families and 45.3 % of individuals fall below the federal poverty level .
In 2007 , over 50 % of families on the island received some form of public assistance .
The figures alone provide a snapshot of the depth of the economic crisis .
Although solutions are not lacking — several leading politicians and economists continue to offer alternative fiscal policies — citizens continue to express concern over their economic situation .
Coupled with a soaring crime rate — more than 750 murders this year alone — alarming suicide rates , increasing acts of domestic violence , and worrisome mental health needs on the island , emotions have reached a boiling point .
Ordinary citizens have begun to express the belief that their government cannot control the social crisis .
Incidents of police abuse , including a recent incident in which university students were indiscriminately attacked with batons and tear gas , are being denounced at an increasing rate across the island .
Squatter communities ( also known as developers of rescued lands ) have recently been targeted as lawbreakers by the conservative administration , and families without clear title to their properties are being forcibly evicted from their homes .
Part of the government 's fiscal emergency response has been an attempt to reverse the gains previously won by collective bargaining agreements , drawing a sharp outcry from the union sector .
Opposition political parties have called for a larger burden to be borne by the rich and by large corporations , only to be rebuked by the administration , which has gone ahead with significant increases in basic services .
The administration , whose governor identifies himself as a U.S. Republican , also censured several books by renowned authors for use in the island 's schools — including Antología personal by José Luís González , El entierro de Cortijo by Edgardo Rodríguez Juliá , and Aura by Carlos Fuentes - a deed met with fierce opposition .
A further alarming development was the governor 's signing of an executive order authorizing the police superintendent to activate the National Guard to quell public disturbances and civil unrest — an act undertaken immediately before the announcement of the layoffs .
Activists from across the political spectrum joined forces to confront the fiscal emergency law and called for a national strike that was held this past October 15 .
The coalition , known as All Puerto Rico For Puerto Rico ( TPRPR ) , is made up of political organizations , student groups , and civic and religious organizations , including churches .
Among its more publicly recognizable activists are priests and labor leaders .
Unions such as the Electrical Workers Union ( UTIER ) and the labor coalition FASYL ( Front for Solidarity and Struggle ) are also heavily involved .
Reverend Juan Vera , of the TPRPR Coalition , is seen by most as one of the main organizers of the coalition .
He declared , during one of the massive demonstrations linked to the national strike , that " the streets will be our battleground .
We declare that there will only be tranquility when our governors respect the will of the people .
Today we begin a new page in the history of Puerto Rico . "
The demonstrations on October 15th , which garnered approximately 200,000 people , were centered in the San Juan area , and focused principally on the largest avenues in the area known as the Ponce de Leon .
Schools in the area were closed , government offices were at a standstill , and public transportation was halted .
Remarkably , the largest shopping mall in the Caribbean , Plaza Las Americas , closed for the day , only the second time in its history , leading some to claim that the national strike had the desired effect of crippling business for the day .
Others hoped publicly that the government would change course once confronted with the growing demands for alternative solutions .
Special police intelligence units were deployed , and Police Superintendent José Figueroa Sancha confirmed that activists were recorded for " intelligence purposes , " drawing an outcry from rights activists .
Figueroa Sancha , previously second - in - command of Puerto Rico's FBI office , has been implicated in the agency 's targeted assassination of revolutionary leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios in 2005 .
Ojeda Rios was the de facto leader of Los Macheteros , an anti-colonial guerrilla force advocating Puerto Rico 's political independence .
He had been wanted by the FBI for 15 years , having gone underground in 1990 after the infamous $ 7 million Wells Fargo heist by his organization in 1983 .
Los Macheteros have re-appeared during the current unrest , issuing a statement on September 23 calling for struggle and for solidarity with the affected working class , warning that the government 's fiscal measures were designed to satisfy the needs of corporations and to further the statehood goals of the governor .
The pro-independence guerrillas called for " firm , effective , and coordinated actions " designed " to evolve into revolutionary action " in order to obtain necessary democratic , labor , and political rights .
Calling for all pro-independence forces to unite , the organization reiterated its position and intent to utilize armed struggle as simply one of the methods of struggle alongside the Puerto Rican working class .
At one point during the October 15 protests in San Juan , several hundred students spontaneously conducted an act of disobedience , stealing the media limelight .
Ordered by the police to disperse , the students suddenly decided to resist the order and promptly sat down in the middle of " Las Americas " Expressway , one of the largest highways in the country .
Blocking traffic for five hours , the students chose to display their militancy and strength by sending a message in action to the current administration .
The students haggled with the authorities for hours , insisting that the police leave the area first , while the police ordered the students ' dispersal as a condition .
The tension was finally broken when nationalist icon Rafael Cancel Miranda arrived to speak with the students , and officers themselves began to disperse .
Cancel Miranda was one of four Puerto Ricans who opened fire in the U.S. Congress in 1954 in a dramatic demand for the island 's independence , serving 25 years in federal prison until President Carter 's clemency in 1979 .
The FUPI ( Pro-Independence University Federation ) released a statement after the demonstrations praising the militancy of the students and the presence of Cancel Miranda .
The statement highlighted the fact that the students present " recognized him and listened to him , because Rafael Cancel Miranda has the moral stature necessary to be heard .
It is indicative of the students ' recognition of our people 's true leaders , who with their lives have demonstrated commitment " and acted honorably .
Days after the National Strike , members of the Hostosian National Independence Movement ( MINH ) surprised the governor as he arrived at a political party meeting in the town of Toa Baja .
Pro-independence activists , labor leaders , and ordinary citizens who had been laid off via the Fiscal Emergency Law all participated in the MINH demonstration .
In the days and weeks following those actions , the governor and his entourage have been met with consistent and repeated demonstrations , protests , and acts of civil disobedience .
These acts are conducted by different organizations , with different interests , and different constituencies , but have all been coordinated by the coalition and brought together by labor leaders .
They all continue to demand the cancellation of the layoffs and of the Fiscal Emergency Law .
Pro-independence student activists have indicated that they will now begin a campaign to demand " more , " an ominous though unclear warning .
In recent days , union leaders have led visits and sit-ins at several offices of elected officials in order to pressure for changes to the Fiscal Emergency Law and continue to confront the governor at every turn .
In the days after the demonstrations , the governor declared that he would not reverse the layoffs and would not repeal any of the provisions of the Fiscal Emergency Law .
In response , student organizations and labor leaders expressed their intention to move forward with a general strike , one that would be held indefinitely , designed to bring the country to a standstill , with the political purpose of forcing the administration to roll back some of the harsher measures contained in the Fiscal Emergency Law .
Meanwhile , Fortuño continues to misstep and provoke the growing activist movement .
During the last days of October , he cancelled the Natural Reserve designation of hundreds of acres of land that were to be protected from contamination and development .
The removal of protection was opposed by environmentalists , who saw it as a capitulation to development interests .
The explosion of unrest on the island will likely deepen as ordinary citizens identify and oppose the privatization efforts of the administration .
The Common Guy and his egg did not constitute the only explosion on the island .
On October 21 , an explosion occurred in the Gulf gasoline refinery owned by Caribbean Petroleum Corporation ( CAPECO ) in the town of Bayamon , drawing a frenzy of media coverage and frantic conjecture by officials in the Fortuño administration about whether it was an act of sabotage .
The fire burned for three days , spewing thick black toxic smoke that , luckily , was mostly blown out to sea by wind gusts .
The explosion was so severe that it marked 2.8 on the Richter scale , blowing out windows in local homes and business , and seriously damaging several homes in the area .
Residents pointed out that at midnight the explosion lit up the sky as if it were noon , and were amazed , frightened , and traumatized by the severity of the blast .
Those who opposed a hated development project in the town of Peñuelas likely feel vindicated .
The " Gasoducto , " recently abandoned , was a development project designed to transport natural gas throughout the southernmost towns of the island , but met with unusually fierce community opposition , most especially in the towns of Ponce and Peñuelas .
Anti-gasoducto arguments were based on the fact that the gas line was to come dangerously close to residential areas , and activists called attention to serious accidental blasts in other countries where gas lines are maintained .
The CAPECO blast was a haunting reminder that overdevelopment coupled with a lack of oversight and regulation is a serious threat to civilian safety in residential areas .
But it gave the administration an opportunity to attempt to link the blast to the growing protest movement .
In spite of having immediate confirmation from CAPECO employees who reported seeing dangerous flammable vapors being emitted from the oil and gasoline transfer stations , and who ran from the site in anticipation of the blast — and luckily were not hurt because they fled in vehicles and not on foot — the administration , along with FBI officials , continued for days to report that they could not rule out " terrorism " and " sabotage " as a possible cause of the blast .
Some saw this as a feeble attempt to weaken the protest movement by attempting to scare more moderate elements of the organizations involved and so prevent further unrest .
Within days , firefighters were able to contain the blaze and extinguish it , and the FBI confirmed no evidence of sabotage was found , instead finding a history of neglect and corruption .
What they cannot contain , however , is the true explosion being witnessed on the island .
The true explosion is not the pyrotechnical type .
It is the explosion of dissent , of organization , and of resistance on the part of hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens who , like the Common Guy , are tired of coming in second place to big business and global capital .
Working class families have been shocked into action by the neoliberal policies of the Fortuño administration , and have taken to public demonstrations and civil disobedience to attempt to roll back some of its more painful policies .
While corporations continue to repatriate billions of dollars to their U.S. offices , and while elected officials continue to pay six figures to consultants and authorize salary increases for themselves , the working class in Puerto Rico has exploded in outrage and action .
While it may not result in immediate fundamental political change , it certainly marks an exciting and historical moment in the history of the United States ' oldest colony .

Electronic
Arts is cutting 200 jobs at developer Pandemic Studios , and will fold the remaining developers into a team to work at the publisher 's Los Angeles studio , EA has confirmed .
The studio's leadership , including Pandemic co-founders Josh Resnick and Andrew Goldman , will also leave the company , says Holly Rockwood , the director of corporate communications for EA .
Pandemic works on titles such as Mercenaries , Star Wars : Battlefront and The Saboteur , which is slated for release on December 8 .
Rockwood says
The Saboteur will arrive as scheduled .
Rockwood also says the core team relocating to Los Angeles will continue work on future Pandemic projects .
" Our intention is to keep the Pandemic brand active in EA LA , " Rockwood says .
The job cuts are part of the publisher 's restructuring plan to cut 1,500 jobs and close several facilities after posting net losses in the second quarter .
" Laying off employees and closing facilities is never pleasant – we have a lot of compassion for those impacted – but these cuts are essential for transforming our company , " said EA CEO John Riccitiello during an earnings call earlier this month following the announcement of the cuts .
Electronic Arts purchased Pandemic in October of 2007 as part of a $ 775 million deal that also included Mass Effect developers BioWare .

Creative Use of Bitwise Operators
While at the Fronteers conference watching Thomas Fuchs go through his slides , a keen member of the audience noticed his use of bitwise negation and asked what it was for .
Understandable , as there is so rarely a time where bitwise operators seem necessary .
It did , however , remind me of a project that I worked on where I ended up using bitwise operators quite heavily in one particular chunk of code .
It 's a solution that I 'm quite particular fond of .
The project was to build a calendar and place events on it .
Nothing ground breaking ; plenty of calendars out there .
I probably could have or should have looked at existing implementations to see how they did it and while I think my approach is cool , it 's quite possible that there 's a better way to solve this problem ( and I 'd love to hear how other people have solved this ) .
The problem with a calendar is that events for a particular week should fit nicely together .
If an event overlaps another event then it should go on a separate line .
At the same time , when an event does n't overlap , it should fit nicely into an open spot in the layout and not on a separate line each time .
In thinking about slots , I started seeing things as switches that needed to be flagged on or off and that 's what had me think of bitwise operators .
I looked at a particular week and envisioned it broken up into horizontal rows of 7 blocks ( one for each day of the week ) and numbered from 0 to 6 .
All of this fit nicely into a byte of information ( not that I really had to worry about that , in this case ) .
First , I needed to know how many slots that an event would use up .
This was the easy part .
Just figure out over how many days the event appeared ( end date minus start date ) .
Then , I converted this into a binary format .
var daysdiff = 4 ; // an event is 4 days long var eventmask = Math.pow ( 2, daysdiff ) -1 ; // 15 or 0001111
This takes the number 2 and puts it to the power of 4 and shifts it down one because we 're working off a zero - based array of bits .
A four day difference is converted to 15 or 0001111 in binary ( see ? four 1s for a four day event ) .
Now I needed to figure out on what day of the week it started .
Then I shift the bits over the same number of day .
( Picture the bits representing the days right to left instead of left to right , with Sunday being the first bit . )
eventmask << = startdate.getDay ( ) ;
The start date is just a JavaScript date object and getDay is the method that returns what day of the week the date falls on as a number between 0 and 6 to represent Sunday through Saturday respectively .
The << performs bitshifting and , combined with the equal sign , the result is assigned to the mask .
If an event started on Monday , the ones would be shifted over 1 day and give us 0011110 .
Now that we know where in the week the event falls , we need to apply this to a mask for the week .
An empty week will have zero slots filled .
var weekmask = 0 ; // 0000000
Next , I needed to apply my event mask to the week mask and see if I got a result .
if ( ( ~ weekmask & eventmask ) == eventmask ) { /* apply mask */ }
The weekmask gets a bitwise NOT ( ~ ) applied to it , which flips each bit .
If it was a 0 , it 's now a 1 and if it was a 1 , it 's now a 0 .
It then gets the eventmask applied to it with a bitwise AND ( & ) .
The AND does a comparison of each bit .
If both are 0s , it 's a 0 .
If one is a 1 and one is a 0 , it becomes a 0 .
If both are 1s , it 's a 1 .
Breaking this down , the weekmask is flipped to 1111111 and then ANDed with the event mask 0011110 , which should leave us with 0011110 .
Is this the same as the original event mask ?
Yes , it is .
So go ahead and apply the event mask to the week mask and move on to the next event .
The event mask is applied with a bitwise OR operation .
It 's like the AND operator but will turn a bit into a 1 if either value has a 1 .
weekmask |= eventmask ;
Let 's look at another example where there 's an existing event already applied to the week mask for Monday .
The week mask would look like 0000010 .
First it 's flipped to 1111101 and then ANDed with the event mask , which creates 0011100 .
This does n't match our original event mask so the event mask then tries to apply itself to the next slot for the week .
( What I have n't mentioned up until now is that the week mask should actually be an array to represent each row of slots that that week contains .
I 'll demonstrate this in the final code example . )
Now we 've seen where an event gets applied on an empty week and where an event gets applied when a slot is already taken .
What about trying to apply an event on a week that already has an event but where they do n't overlap ?
If I 've done a decent job of explaining this , hopefully it 'll already be evident .
If there 's an event that has already been applied to the week mask for Friday and Saturday , we have a week mask of 1100000 .
It 's flipped to 0011111 .
Our event mask of 0011110 is ANDed and gives us 0011110 which does match our original event mask .
That means we can apply the event mask to the week mask with the OR operator and we get 1111110 .
Here 's essentially what the code would look like put together :
// looping through all events to map out for a week var weekmask = [ ] ; for ( var i=0 ; i < events.
length ; i++) { var daysdiff = events [ i] . daysdiff ; // calculated elsewhere var eventmask = Math.pow ( 2, daysdiff ) - 1 ; eventmask << = events[i].startdate.getDay ( ) ; for ( var j=0 ; j < weekmask .
length ; j++ ) { if ( ( ~weekmask[j ] & eventmask ) == eventmask ) break ; // exit loop if found } weekmask [ j ] |= eventmask ; // commit it /* draw event on calendar ... */ }
To describe this code block , we loop through the events and then loop through each set of slots for a particular week .
If the spot is n't found in a particular row then a new row is created and the eventmask is applied to that row .
I sometimes wonder if I created a complicated solution to a simple problem but describing this to people is fun , at the very least .
For Google , traffic pumping was unbearably maddening .
The company decided in August to block Google Voice calls to destinations that had high call volume and a small population .
One of the numbers blocked is for a free conference call service based in Redfield , S.D. Northern Valley Communications , the local phone company that handles that number , is in a legal battle with long - distance carriers that have refused to pay access fees to companies they accuse of traffic pumping .
“ ‘ Traffic pumping ’ is a term fabricated by long - distance carriers who are trying to paint us negatively because we have higher access rates , ” said James Groft , C.E.O. of Northern Valley .
Most rural phone companies are older , “ incumbent ” local carriers and participate in the payments system managed by the National Exchange Carrier System , which prevents abuse , said Joe A. Douglas , its vice president for government relations .
“ Payments are adjusted downward as minutes go up .
Therefore , there ’s no incentive to pump traffic , ” he said .
But a relatively new category of local phone companies , called “ competitive ” local carriers , ” such as Northern Valley , falls outside of NECA ’s purview .
Most Google Voice features handle incoming calls .
The service provides a phone number that connects to voice mail or can forward calls to landlines and cellphones .
It can also record calls , customize greetings for particular callers and transcribe voice mail .
Beginning last week , it could also be an alternative voice - mail destination for a user ’s cellphone voice mail .
Small technology companies are also affected by traffic pumping .
ZipDX , a telephone conferencing service based in Los Gatos , Calif. , charges its customers for its service and must compete against free services in rural areas that are funded by the access fees charged to outside phone companies .
David Frankel , the company ’s founder , said , “ The F.C.C. should say to everyone , ‘ If the only purpose of what you ’re doing is to rake in access charges , it ’s not O.K . ’ ”
A spokesman for the F.C.C. said it had resolved some concerns and “ begun an inquiry into what further steps can be taken to prevent both incumbent and competitive carriers from gaming intercarrier compensation rules . ”
THE F.C.C. has caught one break : it ’s not facing a united front of very large , unhappy complainants .
Instead of extending its hand in solidarity to Google as a fellow victim , AT&T went on the attack .
In a letter to the F.C.C. last month , it contended that Google was blocking calls not only to sex chat lines , but also to others , like an ambulance service and a Benedictine convent .
Google has responded with improvements in its blocking technology .
Instead of blocking by phone number prefix , it blocks only individual numbers , and fewer than 100 nationally are restricted , it reported to the F.C.C. in a filing last week .
It ’s only an improvised solution , however , to the problem of traffic pumping , which the F.C.C. should root out .
In the meantime , calls to Grandma and to the Benedictine convent now go through ; those to highwaymen do not .
Isabel Kershner ’s recent piece in the NYT , " Tough Military Stance Stirs Little Debate in Israel , " reports Israel ’s current war doctrine , whereby " as long as the targets are legitimate ones , the whole point is to try to overwhelm the enemy with maximum force . "
But what about civilian casualties ?
" Israel says that while mistakes were made , it chose its targets on purely military merits and went to extraordinary lengths to warn civilians in Gaza to leave areas under attack . "
In op -eds and in their blogs , the Hasbara troupe dutifully agrees .
If the civilians were warned and did n’t leave , then they ’re responsible for their own deaths .
But the Zionist line was very different a few years ago .
I was reminded of this by a recent review of Yaacov Lozowick ’s Right to Exist , a 2003 book devoted to justify Israel ’s warmongering .
Here ’s an excerpt ( emphasis is always mine throughout the post ) :
The massacres of civilians at Deir Yasin in 1948 , Kibiya in 1953 and Kfar Kassem in 1956 , for instance , really were just that , massacres .
But such events were atypical and were met with horror in the wider community , while great efforts were subsequently made to prevent their recurrence .
Indeed , the IDF has shown a consistent commitment to fight its battles justly , as dramatically demonstrated by Operation Defensive Shield in Jenin in 2002 .
Instead of bombing from the safety of the air , Israel lost 23 soldiers in hand - to - hand combat ‘ so that the Palestinian terrorists would be defeated with as few [ Palestinian civilian ] deaths as possible ’ ( p. 255 ) .
Israel ’s behavior during its assault on Jenin has often been hailed as a model of morality .
Here are other examples :
I am proud that we were there , that we fought , and I also am proud of the morality of the battle .
The camp was not bombed from the air in order to prevent innocent civilian casualties , and artillery was not used even though we knew about specific areas in the [ refugee ] camp where terrorists were holing up .
– Dr. David Zangen , Seven Lies About Jenin , Ma’ariv , 8.11.2002
In Jenin , Israel ’s government decided to pursue a course that placed much greater risks on Israel ’s soldiers but that greatly reduced the dangers to Palestinian civilians .
We announced over loudspeakers our intention to clear out the terrorist infrastructure in the camp and warned everyone to leave .
Then , instead of bombing from the air or using tanks or heavy artillery , our soldiers were sent on a harrowing mis sion .
They painstakingly went from house to house , moving through a hornet ’s nest of booby traps , bombs , and armed terrorists .
After thirteen Israeli soldiers were killed during one mission , we still refused to use our air force or heavy artillery .
– Natan Sharansky , Jenin : Anniversary of a Battle Not only was Jenin not a massacre or an unparalleled catastrophe but it is regarded by many as a model of how to conduct urban warfare against terrorists hiding among civilians .
(…)
Instead of bombing the terrorists ’ camp from the air , as the United States did in Afghanistan and as Russia did in Chechnya , with little risk to their own soldiers but much to civilians , Israeli infantrymen entered the camp , going house to house in search of terrorists and bomb - making equipment , which they found .
Twenty - three Israeli soldiers and fifty - two Palestinians , many of whom were combatants , were killed .
– Alan Dershowitz , The Case for Israel , 2003 , p. 144
In Jenin there was a battle – a battle in which many of our soldiers fell .
The army fought from house to house , not by bombing from the air , in order to prevent , to the extent possible , civilian casualties .
– High Court of Justice of Israel
All of these pieces , as well as the hundreds of similar ones you will find on the Internet , argue that the Jenin operation was particularly moral because Israel did not bomb from the air but did house - to - house searches , thus minimizing civilian casualties .
But in December 2008 - January 2009 , Israel behaved quite differently during operation Cast Lead .
In this war , Israel did n’t risk a single soldier in hand - to - hand combat , but instead bombed all houses where terrorists were holed up , in addition to a large number of buildings that contained none .
Jenin had been called not a massacre because the 500 casualties initially reported were later found to be just 52 ; but in Gaza , 1300 people died , including , by Israel ’s most ardent apologists ’ own estimate , at least 300 civilians .
You would think that would lead Zionists to lament the IDF ’s deteriorated moral standards .
After all , in Jenin they declared that the IDF ’s virtue had been not to bomb from the air , and the Gaza op was completely carried out from the air .
They should have observed that , while the IDF is and will always be the most moral army in the world , unfortunately it ’s not as moral as it used to be .
But somehow they have n’t made that observation .
Considerations about the number of civilian casualties have mysteriously disappeared from their musings , and the wholesale destruction of urban zones has suddenly became acceptable .
The discourse has changed , and now an operation is moral not if the attacking country refrains from leveling buildings with its air force ; it ’s moral if , in addition to the bombs , the warplanes drop leaflets calling on civilians to evacuate the area .

If you ’re looking for work , do n’t look in California .

The world ’s eighth largest economy is still finding its feet after suffering multiple economic shocks , including a housing slump , mortgage crisis and recession .
Employers in California , the most populous U.S. state , are expected to keep cutting staff in 2010 as the wider U.S. jobs market recovers .
As industries in other U.S. states prepare to rehire on signs of recovery , firms in California are still waiting for their economy to rebound .
The state has 12.2 percent unemployment , above the national U.S. level of 9.8 percent , and at odds with California ’s image as an oasis of opportunity in hard times .
California ’s economic engines -- Silicon Valley , Hollywood and gateway ports to Asia -- remain the envy of other U.S. regions but seem incapable of reducing Rust Belt - like unemployment rates .
That is largely because of the Golden State ’s housing and home building crisis .
In the 12 months through August , California ’s construction industry shed 142,000 jobs , or 18.5 percent of its work force , marking the largest decline on a percentage basis over the period of surveyed industry groups .
Those workers are struggling to find new jobs in construction or other trades , according to analysts .
House prices soared higher in California than in most other U.S. states earlier this decade and have crashed harder amid the credit crunch .
Developers are trying to unload unsold new homes and real estate agents are relying on selling foreclosures for a large share of business .
Tight credit and steep job losses have slimmed ranks of prospective home buyers , with many waiting for prices to drop further .
At the same time , a number of other states are beginning to see home prices stabilize .
Tumbling personal , corporate and property tax revenues have put the brakes on government hiring as manufacturers wait for consumer spending to pick up before adding jobs .
“ We ’re calling for a jobless recovery , ” said Jack Kyser , founding economist of the Kyser Center for Economic Research at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp .
SURVIVAL MODE
California is not poised for relief from double - digit unemployment like the broader U.S. jobs market , which is expected to see joblessness peak at 10 percent in early 2010 and ease to 9.5 percent by the end of next year , according to the National Association of Business Economics .
Analysts expect California ’s jobless rate to climb well into next year even as other measures of the state ’s economy regain some of their luster .
Comerica Bank last week reported its California Economic Activity Index extended gains since March by rising to a reading of 101 in August and marking a “ welcoming strengthening ” of the state ’s economy , said Dana Johnson , the bank ’s chief economist .
“ The key missing ingredient to a sustained and healthy rebound continues to be job growth , ” Johnson said .
“ It is the only component of our index that has not contributed positively since it bottomed five months ago . ”
Similarly , California purchasing managers expect manufacturing to grow this quarter -- without new jobs .
Chapman University ’s index tracking their views rose to 54.5 this quarter from 53.8 in the third quarter , a return to late - 2007 levels and the second consecutive quarter of readings above 50 , indicating expansion .
Job seekers , however , wo n’t benefit .
Chapman University ’s index report said output and new orders are projected to increase in the fourth quarter , but employment and inventories of purchased materials are expected to decline at a faster rate compared to the third quarter .
Manufacturers are reluctant to hire without definitive signs the recession is letting up , said Raymond Sfeir of the university ’s Anderson Center for Economic Research .
“ They ’re trying to survive with as few workers as possible , ” Sfeir said .
“ They ’re not going to commit until they ’re more certain . ”
Small - to medium - sized companies need more than economic cues to boost payrolls , Kyser said : “ They ’re having trouble accessing bank lending and are concerned about health - care reform and about environmental regulations out of Sacramento . ”
They ’re also waiting on consumers who have been stashing cash and paying off debt in a hurry instead of fueling job growth at shops , distribution centers , offices and factories .
“ About every two weeks I do a ‘ mall crawl ’ to regional malls to see how many people are there and carrying bags , ” Kyser said .
“ They ’re out strolling around , getting out of the house .
But they ’re not spending . ”
That does n’t bode well for Los Angeles County , California ’s most populous county .
Kyser sees its jobless rate next year averaging 12.8 percent -- or worse .
“ That may be a conservative forecast because it ’s already at 12.3 percent , ” he said .
Speaking of politicians ' books , it looks like we 'll have to wait for next fall to discover what exactly former President George W. Bush meant Thursday when he spoke , seemingly regretfully , about the $ 700 - billion Wall Street bailout decision he made near the end of his term .
He said :
I went against my free - market instincts and approved a temporary government intervention to unfreeze the credit markets so that we could avoid a major global depression .
Bush was speaking in Dallas at the formal unveiling of plans for a $ 300 - million presidential library and think tank at Southern Methodist University , his wife 's alma mater .
Sources said fundraisers have already assembled more than $ 200 million in donations to begin construction next year .
Besides housing his presidential archives and memorabilia such as the bullhorn the 43rd president used atop the World Trade Center rubble after 9/11 , the presidential center will focus , he said , on four policy areas : education , global health , political freedoms and economic growth .
Appearing refreshed and energized before a friendly crowd of about 1,000 , the 63 - year - old said he was retired , not tired .
He covered a broad array of subjects in his remarks .
But Bush kept to his promise from earlier this year not to comment on specific policies or decisions of his successor , something his former vice president , Dick Cheney , has not felt obliged to do .
Oh , and he 's writing a book too .
Who is n't these days ?
In fact , Bush did not mention Barack Obama 's name , nor the Democrat 's policy moves into the banking , financial , automobile , healthcare and insurance industries .
But some might interpret an oblique warning when Bush said :
The role of government is not to create wealth but to create the conditions that allow entrepreneurs and innovators to thrive .
As the world recovers , we will face a temptation to replace the risk - and - reward model of the private sector with the blunt instruments of government spending and control .
History shows that the greater threat to prosperity is not too little government involvement , but too much .
Whomever could he possibly be talking about ?

Chito made friends with the croc after finding him with a gunshot wound on the banks of the Central American state ’s Parismina river 20 years ago .
He had been shot in the left eye by a cattle farmer and was close to death .
But Chito enlisted the help of several pals to load the massive reptile into his boat .
He says : “ When I found Pocho in the river he was dying , so I brought him into my house ” .
“ He was very skinny , weighing only around 150 lb I gave him chicken and fish and medicine for six months to help him recover .
“ I stayed by Pocho ’s side while he was ill , sleeping next to him at night .
I just wanted him to feel that somebody loved him , that not all humans are bad .
It meant a lot of sacrifice .
I had to be there every day .
I love all animals – especially ones that have suffered . ”
It took years before Chito felt that Pocho had bonded with him enough to get closer to the animal .
He says : “ After a decade I started to work with him .
At first it was slow , slow .
I played with him a bit , slowly doing more .
“ Then I found out that when I called his name he would come over to me . ”
At one point during his recovery , Chito left the croc in a lake near his house .
But as he turned to walk away , to his amazement Pocho got out of the water and began to follow him home .
Chito recalls : “ That convinced me the crocodile could be tame . ”
But when he first fearlessly waded into the water with the giant reptile his family was so horrified they could n’t bear to watch .
So instead , he took to splashing around with Pocho when they were asleep .
Four years ago Chito showed some of his tricks to friends , including getting the animal to close his eyes on command , and they convinced him to go public with a show .
Now he swims and plays with Pocho as well as feeding him at the lake near his home in the lowland tropical town of Sarapiqui .
The odd couple have now become a major tourist attraction , with several tour operators , including Crocodile Adventures , taking visitors on touring cruises to see the pair .
On the Crocodile Adventures website it describes the spectacle as : “ One of the most amazing things that no cruise ship passenger will want to miss , the adventure show between the man and the crocodile . ”
Let ’s say you have this idea for a visualization or application , or you ’re just curious about some trend .
But you have a problem .
You ca n’t find the data , and without the data , you ca n’t even start .
This is a guide and a list of sources for where you can find that data you ’re looking for .
There ’s a lot out there .
Universities
Being a graduate student , I always look to the library for books and resources .
Many libraries are amping up their technology and have some expansive data archives .
Many statistics departments also tend to keep a list of data somewhere .
DATA SOURCES :
Data and Story Library –
An online library of datafiles and stories that illustrate the use of basic statistics methods , from Carnegie Mellon
Berkeley Data Lab – Part of the UC Berkeley library system .
Hey , they ’ve even on Twitter .
UCLA Statistics Data Sets – Some of the data that UCLA stat uses in their labs and assignments .
News Sources
I ’m sure you ’ve seen a graphic in the paper or I guess more likely , on a news site , and wondered about another aspect of the data .
Major news organizations always put their sources somewhere on the graphic or are mentioned in the accompanying article .
It ’s usually not a direct link , but a quick online search will get you to the right place .
Sometimes , you ’ll have to email someone to get the same data , but those people are usually happy that you ’re interested in their data or analysis .
DATA SOURCES :
Geographic Data
Got some mapping software , but no geographic data ?
You ’re in luck .
There are plenty of shapefiles , etc. at your disposal .
DATA SOURCES :
TIGER – From the US Census Bureau , detailed data about roads , railroads , rivers , and zipcodes .
Probably the most extensive you ’re going to find .
OpenStreetMap –
One of the best examples of data and community effort .
Geocommons – Both data and a map maker .
Flickr Shapefiles – Boundaries as defined by Flickr users .
Sports
America loves its sports , and thus , has decades of sports data .
You ’ll find it on Sports Illustrated or the sports organizations ’ sites , but you ’ll also find more on sites dedicated to the data .
DATA SOURCES :
World
There are several noteworthy international organizations that keep data about the world , mainly health and development indicators .
It does take some sifting though , because a lot of the data sets are pretty sparse .
It ’s not easy to get standardized data across countries with varied methods .
DATA SOURCES :
Government and Politics
With the new administration , there ’s been a fresh emphasis on data and transparency , so there are lot of government organizations that supply data .
They ’ve been doing this for a while , but with the launch of data.gov , much of the data is finding itself in one place .
There are also plenty of non-governmental sites that aim to make politicians more accountable .
DATA SOURCES :
Census Bureau – Incredibly important data about the country with more effect on your life than you probably know
Data.gov
DataSF – San Francisco recently launched their own data site .
Hopefully , other cities follow suit .
Check out the showcase .
Follow the Money
OpenSecrets – Interesting site MAPlight is powered by data from OpenSecrets .
General Sources
You ’re usually going to find the best data straight from the source , but there are lots of applications and sites that try to make all data easier to find or easier to access .
DATA SOURCES :
Freebase – Free data and a community effort .
For some types , the data are kind of sparse , but it continues to get better .
Numbrary
Many Eyes –
More of a visualization and exploratory site than for data , but they do have a data section .
Infochimps – Did you get your invite ?
Swivel
Amazon Public Data Sets
DBpedia – Allows you to ask sophisticated queries against Wikipedia , and to link other data sets on the Web to Wikipedia data .
Wikipedia – Lots of HTML tables .
Copy and paste in Excel .
Get it From an API
Plenty of sites and applications make their data freely available via APIs .
Twitter has an API ( duh ) .
Google has lots of APIs .
Yahoo does too .
So on and so forth .
Visit Programmable
Web for a detailed catalog of what ’s available .
Scrape the Data
When all else fails , you can always find a site that serves the data through HTML pages , and then scrape the data with Python , javascript , or whatever language you ’re comfortable with .
I use Python with the Beautiful Soup library that makes parsing pretty easy .
For example , I scraped weather data from Weather Underground a while back ( although I do n’t think the script works anymore ) .
I also used it gather television sizes from CNet .
I ’m still figuring out how to scrape AJAX - based sites though .
I ’d be happy to hear any tips from anyone who has experience with that .
Did I miss anything ?
Where do you get your data from ?
On October 6th , I was attending the New York Tech Meetup , and there I learned about the NYC Data Mine repository , which contains " many sets of public data produced by City agencies [...] available in a variety of machine - readable formats " .
I went over the data sets available there and indeed the data sets were big , comprehensive , and ( mostly ) well - structured .
So , I decided to use these data sets for the introductory database assignment for my " Information Technology in Business and Society " class .
It is a core , required class at Stern and the students are mainly non-majors .
Still , I wanted to see what they will do with the data .
So , I created an assignment , asking them to get two or more data sets , import them in a database and run some basic join queries to connect the data sets .
Then , they had to bring the data into Excel and perform some PivotChart - based analysis .
I left the topic intentionally open , just to see what type of questions they will ask .
Here are the results , together with my one - sentence summary of the analysis / results .
Given that this was the first time that I was giving this assignment , and that this was the first time that students were learning about databases , I was pretty happy with the results .
Most of them understood well the datasets and wrote meaningful queries against the data .
However , I would like to encourage the analysis of a more diverse set of data : Students seemed particularly attracted to the graffiti dataset and ( expectedly ) most used the data set with the socio-economic numbers of each borough .
The rather disappointing fact was that many teams took the " easy way out " and joined data based on the borough ( Manhattan , Queens , Brooklyn , Bronx , Staten Island ) , while it would have been much more interesting to see joins based on zip codes , community boards , districts etc .
I guess this becomes a requirement for next year .
Finally , I should encourage people to work with really big datasets ( e.g. , property valuation statistics ) , instead of the relatively small ones .
But perhaps this is something reserved for the data mining class ...

It used to be that every economist worth his salt knew Gresham 's Law ( or , if he was Polish , Copernicus 's Law ) : " bad money drives out good . "
Narrowly understood , this rule says that when the government requires people to accept different forms of money at an exchange rate fixed by law , the form of money that is overvalued ( the " bad money " ) will circulate , while the form of money that is undervalued ( the " good money " ) wo n't .
Now comes a new translation of the plays of Aristophanes by Paul Roche , among them " The Frogs , " which has the oldest known expression of this rule :
You know what I often think :
We treat our best men
The way we treat our mint
The silver and the golden
We were proud to invent
These unalloyed
Genuine coins , no less ,
Ringing true and tested
Both abroad and [ in ]
Greece
And now they 're not employed
As if we were disgusted
And want to use instead
These shoddy coppers minted
Only yesterday
Or the day before
( as if that matters ) .
( Aristophanes : The Complete Plays , trans .
Paul Roche , New American Library , 2005 , p. 573 )
In " The Frogs , " two citizens of Athens descend into Hades for the purpose of resurrecting two well - respected politicians of the past to save the city - state from its current , corrupt rulers .
The current rulers are said to be like the base - metal coins in circulation , while the rulers of the past are like the full - bodied , precious metal coins that formerly circulated .
The full - bodied coins " rang true " ; that is , when flipped onto a solid wooden table , they gave out a distinctive ring .
Think of Edgar Allen Poe 's " The Bells . "
The heft , feel , and tone of the coins were sufficient , for most purposes , to distinguish a counterfeit from the genuine article .
And these coins circulated abroad as well as at home because they had intrinsic value .
In contrast , the debased coins were impossible to distinguish from any counterfeit , since they had no distinctive qualities , and were repugnant to foreigners and anyone else not compelled by law to accept them , just like current politicians .
The passage does n't actually say how the base - metal coins came to replace the full - bodied coins .
Nevertheless , we can infer that the audience knew what had happened , since the play was a comedy , not an economics lecture .
From historical sources , we know that Athens had been involved in a series of wars against Sparta and other Greek city - states , and that it was threatened by Persia .
The continuing expenses of these wars depleted Athens 's treasury .
Even the gold and silver objects at the temple were melted and recast as money .
Then the city resorted to debasement and to legal - tender laws compelling acceptance of the debased coins at the values of precious - metal coins .
Soon , the coins were recast only with base metal .
The story of debased coins and their connection with fiscal imbalance and corruption is perennial .
The prophet Isaiah ( 1:22 ) writes " Your silver has become dross , your wine diluted with water . "
Dross is base metal .
The silver coins that had formerly circulated had come to be replaced by coins of base metal .
The base metals might be polished so as to look like silver , as in the case of many contemporary US coins , but this only hides the corruption that would otherwise be manifest in the coins .
Similarly , the Islamic scholar Ibn Taymiyyah ( who can be viewed as a forerunner of Wahhabism ) wrote , at a time of continuing warfare against Christians to the west and Mongols to the east , " If the ruler cancels the use of a certain coin and mints another kind of money for the people , he will spoil the riches which they possess . "
Like Isaiah and Augustine , Ibn Taymiyyah wrote at a time of decline in his civilization and called for revival and separation from the world .
Speaking of the Mongols , it is to the Emperor Kublai Khan that we owe the invention of paper money .
Marco Polo , who brought the news of this innovation to the Europeans , wrote in his travelogue , " nor does anyone , at the peril of his life , refuse to accept it in payment . "
During the later years of Kublai Khan 's reign , the issues of paper currency became excessive , and an inflationary cycle got underway .
During the reign of his successor , the fourth Mongol emperor , the world 's first " currency reform " was undertaken , with a forced conversion of the old currency for the new at the rate of five to one .
The former prosperity was also replaced by corruption and decline .
Upon the overthrow of the Mongol dynasty in the 13th century , and the ascension of the Ming dynasty in China , history recorded yet another milestone in the evolution of money , the first inscription of a legal - tender law onto paper money : " This paper money shall have currency and be used in all respects as if it were copper money . "
At the beginning of the Ming dynasty , 17 units of paper money were the equivalent of 15 units of copper money .
By the 15th century , 5,000 units of paper money were the equivalent of 15 units of copper money .
Economic conditions deteriorated , and the empire suffered incursions by the Tartars .
Our own country 's experience with legal - tender laws goes back to the colonial days , when the colonies issued paper money then known as " bills of credit . "
The first issue was by the Massachusetts Colony in 1690 , during King William 's War , when the English colonists of Massachusetts thought to outfit an expedition to take Quebec , then a French colony .
The bills were inscribed , " This indented bill of Five Shillings … shall be in value equal to Money . "
Soon after this war came Queen Anne 's War and another issue of bills of credit .
Then came another war whose name escapes me just now , and then yet another .
Each time , more bills of credit .
And , of course , accompanying all these Bills of Credit was inflation .
During mid-century , the English limited the ability of the American colonies to issue bills of credit , and the inflation was ended .
Later in the 18th century , the American colonies chafed under the burden of this British constraint on issuing paper money .
This constraint was among the grievances referred to in the Declaration of Independence .
According to Benjamin Franklin , it was the primary one .
And so they had a revolution .
Freed of the outside constraint on issuing paper money , guess what ?
As is obvious to everyone who does not prostrate himself before the throne of big government , there was inflation .
And to compel acceptance of the paper money , guess what ?
Those not accepting the paper money being issued by each of the self - proclaimed independent states or by their Continental Congress were to be treated as Loyalists and have their property seized .
So , in view of the inflation that burst out during the Revolution and Confederation periods , there was called a convention for the purpose of drawing up a new agreement among the states .
This agreement , among other things , limited the ability of the state governments to issue paper money and did not grant such a power to the federal government .
What is remarkable about the constitution that they drew up is not that it only restrained the issue of paper money for a certain number of years ( until the United States got into the cycle of war , deficit spending , inflation , corruption , and decay ) , but that it restrained the issue of paper money for as long as it did .
So let us , with the same cruel humor , make fun of our condition as Americans the same way Aristophanes did of the condition of Athenians .
Let us send a delegation to Hades to resurrect Ludwig von Mises , Thomas Jefferson , John Locke , and Aristotle to replace the corrupt , debased politicians we now have .
BANGKOK , Thailand –
To hear the Thailand ’s ruling government tell it , Thaksin Shinawatra is the kingdom ’s most meddlesome fugitive .
Since fleeing
Thailand last year , the self - exiled , billionaire ex-premier has zig - zagged the globe while stirring anti-establishment supporters from afar .
He has incessantly needled the ruling party through in - country proxies , sarcastic Tweet messages and Skype video calls , broadcast at political pep rallies that sometimes turn violent .
His sanctuaries have included Hong Kong , London , Liberia and Dubai .
Each new hideout spurs new extradition threats from the government .
But if Thaksin pulls off a recent promise to visit Cambodia — right in Thailand ’s backyard — the government ’s repeated promises to catch him may begin to appear hollow .
Many experts already suspect authorities prefer Thaksin as a fugitive rather than a prisoner .
“ The best way to diminish Thaksin ’s popularity is not to make him a martyr , but rather to allow him to make a fool of himself via Skype as often as he wishes , ” said Federico Ferrara , assistant political science professor at the National University of Singapore .
Imprisoning Thaksin , he said , would be “ highly destabilizing , ” sparking huge rallies and endless requests for release .
Thaksin has repeatedly promised supporters he ’ll someday come home to Thailand .
This week , the Thai government was rankled by his plans to visit the neighborhood .
At an Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit this week , Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen went on the offense for Thaksin and publicly offered to build him a Cambodian home .
Moreover , he pondered hiring him as a political advisor and even compared him to Aung San Suu Kyi , a Nobel Peace Prize winner and political prisoner in Burma .
Thaksin , who was ousted in a 2006 military coup after five years of rule , is also a “ victim ” of politics , Hun Sen said .
These slights were widely interpreted as payback for an ongoing Thai - Cambodia land ownership dispute that has riled fierce nationalism on both sides and occasionally turned bloody .
Bitterness between the countries runs even deeper , dating back to alleged Thai government sympathies to communist Khmer Rogue leaders who led mass killings in Cambodia during the 1980s .
“ I do n’t want ( Hun Sen ) to be a victim or a pawn for somebody that undermines the interests of this country , ” said Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva at a press conference .
“ I ’m sure that when he ’s better informed , he ’ll change his mind . ”
But Thaksin now insists he ’s Cambodia - bound .
He even Tweeted his thanks to Hun Sen , who has assured the ex-premier that Cambodia will disregard extradition requests .
Actually extraditing and jailing Thaksin would surely enrage his supporters , a largely rural , working - class faction known as the “ red shirts . ”
Many of them believe Thaksin was the first Thai politician to challenge old - money elites and fight on their behalf .
The powers behind the coup that toppled Thaksin in 2006 , however , insist he is incorrigibly corrupt .
Last year , courts sentenced him to two years in prison for using political power to secure a Bangkok land deal for his wife .
By keeping Thaksin on the run , he remains a “ fugitive ” that “ helps the government portray the ‘ red shirts ’ as illegitimate by association , ” said political professor Kevin Hewison , director of the Carolina Asia Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
The government appears to crank up its
Thaksin hunt each time his supporters become active , Hewison said .
Imprisoning Thaksin , he said , would just stir even more problems for the government .
“ He 'd likely become an imprisoned symbol for opposition , ” Hewison said .
“ Do they want that ?
No .
He is less of a threat , and a declining star for the red shirt supporters , if he is at a distance . ”
Authorities likely set the stage for Thaksin ’s escape themselves , Ferrara said , by allowing the ex-premier to attend the 2008 Olympic Games opening ceremony in Beijing .
Thaksin was then on trial for fraud and a guilty verdict was widely assumed .
Judges granted him leave , Ferrara said , expecting him to flee .
He has acquired up to six passports – secured from countries including Montenegro and Nicaragua , his political backers said – to traverse the globe and evade capture .
Keeping up the appearance of a vigorous chase has helped the Thai government cement Thaksin ’s “ fugitive ” image , Ferrara said .
“ Thaksin can only be discredited as a ‘ fugitive ’ if someone is actually pursuing him , ” he said .
“ Otherwise he would be merely an ‘ exiled politician , ’ something that has a much more favorable connotation because it hints at the possibility that the government might either not have the goods on Thaksin or the stomach to lock him up . ”
Some of the greatest times I had with my dad were at Shea Stadium , which is where the Jets also played back in the days when Joe Namath was their quarterback .
On a cold , rainy Sunday , like the one forecast for this weekend , we ’d drive out to Queens from New Jersey and shiver and cheer and laugh as Namath lit up the sky with passes that seemed to arc like a rainbow high over the heads of the defenders and then descend into the sure - fire hands of crackerjack receivers like Don Maynard and George Sauer Jr .
The prices were reasonable enough that my dad and I never gave a second thought to the cost .
Even the scalpers ’ tickers were affordable .
The changes over the years were imperceptible enough that no one gave them much notice .
There ’s no way to pinpoint when we became a country that could build the biggest , most garish , most electronically equipped stadiums you could imagine , but almost nothing else .
The auto industry is on its knees and we ’ve got school buildings in sorry shape and we ca n’t even rebuild a public hospital in New Orleans .
But the Dallas Cowboys have a brand new billion - dollar - plus domed stadium that looks like something out of “ Star Wars . ”
They actually sell tours of this stadium , and the ticket prices for the tours are more than families used to pay to go to professional sporting events .
Almost every adult I ’ve ever spoken with who went to a baseball or football game as a child remembers the shock of entering the stadium and then suddenly coming upon the glorious expanse of emerald green grass , sparkling beneath the sun or the brilliant lights at night games .
I remember that those games seemed to go by with the speed of light .
The seventh and eighth innings  or the fourth quarter in football  used to come so fast .
You never wanted it to be over .
Maybe this is not the biggest issue facing the country , but I ca n’t help feeling we ’re making a big mistake pricing these games out of the reach of today ’s boys and girls who are growing up in families of modest means .

Critics accuse President Hamid Karzai of betraying Afghan women
An Afghan bill allowing a husband to starve his wife if she refuses to have sex has been published in the official gazette and become law .
The original bill caused outrage earlier this year , forcing Afghan President Hamid Karzai to withdraw it .
But critics say the amended version of the law remains highly repressive .
They accuse Mr Karzai of selling out Afghan women for the sake of conservative Shia support at next week 's presidential election .
The law governs family life for Afghanistan 's Shia minority .
Sexual demands
The original version obliged Shia women to have sex with their husbands every four days at a minimum , and it effectively condoned rape by removing the need for consent to sex within marriage .
The original bill caused outrage within Afghanistan and around the world Western leaders and Afghan women 's groups were united in condemning an apparent reversal of key freedoms won by women after the fall of the Taliban .
Now an amended version of the same bill has passed quietly into law with the apparent approval of President Karzai .
Just ahead of this Thursday 's Afghan presidential election , human rights groups suggest the timing is no accident .
" There was a review process - Karzai came under huge pressure from all over the world to amend this law , but many of the most oppressive laws remain , " Rachel Reid , the Human Rights Watch representative in Kabul , told the BBC .
" What matters more to Karzai is the support of fundamentalists and hardliners here in Afghanistan whose support he thinks he needs in the elections . "
Women 's groups say its new wording still violates the principle of equality that is enshrined in their constitution .
It allows a man to withhold food from his wife if she refuses his sexual demands ; a woman must get her husband 's permission to work ; and fathers and grandfathers are given exclusive custody of children .

The Wikipedia model - one of open collaboration by the entire world - has been under fire since it was recently revealed that the site would be adding a new layer of editorial oversight for articles about living individuals .
Some even questioned the future of the collaboration model that Wikipedia pioneered .
We were curious as well .
We 've just heard from someone who was able to address those concerns : Jimmy Wales , the co-founder of Wikipedia .
He took the stage today at the Social Ad Summit in New York City to discuss the Wikipedia model and the rules of building community .
Here are some of the highlights of his talk :
Wikipedia is NOT about crowdsourcing : Jimmy compared crowdsouring to tricking people into free labor .
Instead , he compared Wikipedia to bowling .
Yes , bowling .
" It 's about providing a nice bowling alley for people , " he stated as he explained that when people enjoy contributing rather than being tricked in free labor , it 's not crowdsouring .
The world is information dense : Culture has become smarter .
He compared the plots and jokes of I Love Lucy to Seinfeld and just how much more complicated storylines have become .
TV has become a more engaging experience because there are so many more characters and storylines .
He then pointed out Lostpedia , a wiki for the TV show Lost which has over 5,700 articles .
Yes , that 's how complex TV shows have become .
Openness is not the enemy of quality :
He directly addressed the issue of having editors check on edits of articles on living people , saying it is still very much an open system while striving for even greater quality .
He defended Wikipedia 's content , though he admitted that Wikipedia has n't reached the same quality level of the standard encyclopedia ( though Wikipedia kicks their butts in breadth of topics covered ) .
The future of the world is in the non-English world : Wikipedia is in 175 languages ( with over 1000 articles ) and can support up to 200 languages currently .

why ray comfort got the ncse treatment
Religion reporter Dan Gilgoff decided to host a debate between Ray Comfort and a biologist .
Then he tried stacking the deck in Comfort 's favor ...
When last we caught up with Banana Boy and his sidekick , religion reporter Dan Gilgoff was hosting a back and forth between him and Dr. Eugene Scott of the NCSE about the televangelist ’s attempt to slap all sorts of half - baked tripe on Charles Darwin ’s signature work , The Origin of Species .
And now , on top of debating with the mustachioed airhead , the NCSE decided to bring out the big guns and established the Do n’t Diss Darwin Institute website which features detailed , point by point rebuttals of every last inanity parroted by Ray and Kirk Cameron in their “ special introduction ” to the defiled edition .
But is this all really necessary ?
And why would a scientific organization seem to invest so much time and effort into someone who ’s scientific knowledge could easily be bested by your average middle school student who completed at least one decent biology class ?
Now I ’m not saying that Ray is necessarily the dimmest bulb in the box , but compared to him , Bill Dembski ’s long - winded pontifications sound almost scientific .
However , because he invokes the Bible , he gets far too much time , money and media attention .
So when he sent out a press release about his intended mangling of Darwin ’s seminal tome , the aforementioned Dan Gilgoff pretty much ran it as is , throwing in a brief link to the rather obscure idea that The Origin was motivated by Christian abolitionism .
To make sure that Comfort did n’t get off easy , the NCSE ’s communication director , Robert Luhn , contacted Gilgoff and asked that the scientific point of view be given equal time , especially on something as incendiary as Ray ’s stunt .
Gilgoff agreed and to ensure equal time to both science and anti-science .
hosted a debate between a real scientist and a guy who has trouble understanding such things as gravity and genders .
Or as Mr. Luhn generously put it …
We just wanted to make sure that there is n’t just one side of the story out there and people would be armed with the facts .
All we ’re trying to say is that we have a mountain of evidence for evolution .
There are hundreds of peer reviewed papers on the subject being published every year so from where we ’re coming from , the evidence is pretty strong .
Then , just to make sure that when Ray and Kirk start spreading their contaminated edition of The Origin those who get a copy will know why this edition is tainted and how , the NCSE set up the Do n’t Diss Darwin site with a satirical PSA which involves a chef chopping bananas and a point by point refutation of the inanity contained within the introduction .
As I was told , project director Steve Newton spent a fair bit of time going through more than one version of Ray ’s pained attempts at science , history and theology to create the counter - arguments in the fact sheet .
( Rest assured , I ’ll be forwarding my condolences to Mr. Newton very shortly .
Whew , talk about taking one for the team … )
Of course , Comfort ’s ardent fans will think that the NCSE ’s campaign is just a sign of how afraid they are of Banana Boy and how the theory of evolution is crumbling before their eyes , but since the scientific backing for the theory is over half a million peer reviewed investigations strong and the very best creationists can offer is ignorance and slander , they ’ll be very , very wrong about that .
What rattles me most about about this incident though , is not the sheer ignorance and arrogance of a random televangelist hungry for attention .
In fact , that ’s to be expected .
No , what leaves a bad taste in my mouth is the idea of a reporter treating an ignoramus waiving an ancient book as someone suited to debate a scholar who spent many years researching biology .
If you were to read the Egyptian Book of the Dead and try your hand at debating neurologists , you ’d probably be laughed off as a know - nothing .
But substitute the Book of the Dead for a Bible and suddenly , the fact that you have no technical expertise in anything but finding the right quote in what amounts to a collection of ancient religious punditry , does n’t matter .
Suddenly , Bill Dembski can misuse and abuse computer science to prove his nonsensical blathering which gets the same media attention as an actual expert in computers .
And a living , breathing brick wall like Ray , who has the critical thinking skills of your average preschooler , suddenly gets showered in money and attention .
Senator Charles E. Grassley wrote to 10 top medical schools Tuesday to ask what they are doing about professors who put their names on ghostwritten articles in medical journals  and why that practice was any different from plagiarism by students .
Mr. Grassley , of Iowa , the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , sent the letters as part of his continuing investigation of so - called medical ghostwriting .
The term refers to publication of medical journal articles in which an outside writer  sometimes paid by a drug or medical devices company whose product is being studied  has done extensive work on the article without being named on the publication .
Instead , one or more academic researchers may receive author credit .
Mr. Grassley said ghostwriting had hurt patients and raised costs for taxpayers because it used prestigious academic names to promote medical products and treatments that might be expensive or less effective than viable alternatives .
“ Any attempt to manipulate the scientific literature , which can in turn mislead doctors to prescribe treatments that may be ineffective and / or cause harm to their patients , is very troubling , ” the senator wrote .
Could a sex tape have sunk Carrie Prejean ‘s lawsuit against Miss California USA ?
If this report is true , we ’re laughing really hard on the inside right now .
Former Miss California USA
Carrie Prejean infamously launched herself into the national spotlight by declaring marriage should only “ be between a man and a woman ” at the Miss USA 2009 pageant .
The statement caused mass outrage from gay rights activists and garnered heady support from conservative anti-gay marriage advocates .
More controversy stirred when a partially nude modeling photographs of Prejean appeared on a tabloid site .
Prejean later said she “ regretted ” taking the photos and blamed it on being “ naive , and young . ”
Back in June , the Miss California USA dropped Carrie Prejean citing “ continued breach of contract issues ” – claiming she failed to show up for events and speaking at events she was not approved to attend .
Prejean slapped back with a lawsuit alleging they had ditched her over her religious beliefs .
Miss California USA fired back with a lawsuit of their own .
The mutual lawsuits were eventually settled , with Miss USA California agreeing to pay $ 100,000 for Prejean ’s legal fees and allowing her to publish her new book without interference .
But Carrie Prejean herself got not a dime .
Why is that ?
Well , TMZ.com claims they have the answer .
According to the tabloid site , a lawyer for the opposing side allegedly got hold of a sex tape featuring the former pageant winner and told her she ’d better shut up and settle .
Even better , TMZ claims they have actually seen the tape and it does exist .

Swiss officials said Friday that they had sued Google to try to require it to tighten privacy safeguards on its Street View online service .
It is the latest of a series of European objections to the company ’s handling of personal information .
The Swiss data protection authority said it had filed a complaint with the Federal Administrative Court after Google balked at its demand for additional measures to make obscure the images of people who appear in Street View , particularly in areas around hospitals , schools and prisons .
Street View provides ground - level panoramas of streets across the United States , Europe and other regions , searchable via Google ’s mapping service .
Google compiles the scenes with camera - equipped cars .
Google already blurs the faces and license plates that appear in Street View .
Users of the service can also request that certain images , like their homes , be removed or blurred .

I am standing in the shadow of General Motors ‘ $ 1 tree .
It ’s a native guaricica , with pale white bark and a spreading crown that looms about 40 feet above my head .
Hanging from its trunk is a small plaque that identifies it as tree No. 129 .
I ’ve come here , to the verdant chaos of Brazil ’s Atlantic forest , to understand the far - reaching and politically explosive controversies taking shape in diplomatic corridors thousands of miles away over the fate of trees like this one .
No. 129 stands in the heart of the Cachoeira reserve in the state of Paraná — one of the last slivers of a forest that once blanketed much of the country ’s southeastern coast .
Just 7 percent of the Atlantic forest remains , but it is still one of the Earth ’s richest centers of biodiversity , home to a wealth of plants and creatures comparable to the Amazon’s .
On the way here , our group — led by Ricardo Miranda de Britez and his team of forestry experts from the Brazilian conservation group Society for Wildlife Research and Environmental Education ( SPVS ) — walked past clusters of yellow - and - white orchids , stepped over the footprints of an ocelot , kept an eye out for the endangered golden lion tamarin , and were bitten by , it seems , every one of the thousands of species of insects native to the area .
But our journey is not focused on the rare creatures in the forest .
It ’s about the forest itself — the trees that are our partners in respiration , inhaling carbon dioxide , exhaling oxygen , and storing the carbon in their trunks and leaves .
That simple process makes them one of Earth ’s most potent bulwarks against climate change ( a.k.a. a “ carbon sink ” ) ; but when they are cut and burned , all that stored carbon is released into the atmosphere .
Already , some 32 million acres of tropical rainforest are destroyed each year , an amount of land equivalent to the state of Mississippi’s ; deforestation , according to the United Nations , is responsible for roughly one - fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions .
What will it cost to keep those trees standing ?
And who ’s going to pay for it ?
The challenge of assigning precise values to an increasingly rare commodity — wild trees — and indeed the question of whether they are a commodity at all , is one of the most hotly contested in the climate world .
IT WAS AN unusual deal that landed tree No. 129 at the center of the debate .
Between 2000 and 2002 , the US - based Nature Conservancy struck an alliance with three of the planet ’s leading carbon emitters : General Motors , Chevron , and American Electric Power .
Together the corporations gave the environmental group $ 18 million to purchase 50,000 acres of Brazilian Atlantic forest , much of which had been degraded by grazing .
Three reserves were created : Serra do Itaqui , financed with $ 5 million from AEP ; Morro da Mina , paid for with $ 3 million from Chevron ; and Cachoeira , underwritten by $ 10 million from GM .
( GM ’s role in the project survived the company ’s bankruptcy , which means that No. 129 is now partially owned by you and me . )
SVPS was brought in to manage the reserves , which together form one contiguous forest known as the Guaraqueçaba Environmental Protection Area .
You ’ll see Guaraqueçaba promoted on the Nature Conservancy ’s website as an example of corporate partnerships that make “ an invaluable contribution to the preservation of the planet ’s biodiversity . ”
What you wo n’t see is what the companies get out of the deal : the potentially lucrative rights to the carbon sequestered in the trees .
At tree No. 129 , de Britez takes out a tape measure and unspools it around the trunk .
We ’re at one of the 190 carbon dioxide measuring stations — each a group of trees with numbered plaques — scattered around the Guaraqueçaba forest .
Documenting the bulk of the reserve ’s trees is an ongoing enterprise , like tracking tagged whales .
“ We measure the biomass of these trees and their carbon sequestration , ” de Britez says as a ranger picks up the other end of the tape measure and writes down No. 129 ’s stats .
It ’s 3 feet in diameter and about 45 feet tall .
He estimates the carbon it contains at 95 kilograms — just under one - tenth of a ton .
At $ 10 a ton , the upper end of the range at which carbon offsets trade in the US , No. 129 is worth about $ 1 .
Scale up to the two to three tons of carbon per acre that de Britez estimates across the 50,000 - acre reserve , and the potential payoff , in addition to the public relations value , comes into focus .
The trees in the Cachoeira reserve could never offset even a fraction of GM ’s total carbon footprint — a single Hummer H2 ( which the company started producing the same year it signed on to the Guaraqueçaba project ) would require about 50 trees to offset .
But the Nature Conservancy and its partners aimed to use the Brazilian reserves as a test case for preserving forests via corporate carbon credits .
“ The investors wanted to be pioneers in the carbon - sink field , ” de Britez explains .
“ They had in mind to start working on this before other companies . ”
All three companies , as it happens , had aggressively lobbied the Clinton administration against signing the 1997 Kyoto climate accord and stayed mum when President Bush withdrew from it .
But they hedged their bets , figuring that the Brazilian forests could be turned into offsets to sell in places ( like Europe ) where Kyoto ’s emission limits did apply , or could be held in reserve in case the US ever established its own limits .
By the time the companies were ready to begin preparing their credits for sale , however , the UN had refused to allow “ avoided deforestation ” projects — those that buy forestland and then promise not to cut the trees — as an offset for industries seeking to buy their way out of emission limits .
Credits generated from projects like Guaraqueçaba were excluded from the international carbon market launched by Kyoto , a market that now accounts for more than $ 126 billion in offset transactions .
The offsets could be sold , however , in the United States , where the $ 700 million domestic carbon offset market is unregulated ( and where prices are generally half those of Kyoto - regulated offsets ) .
Manyu Chang , a forest scientist who is the coordinator for climate policy for the state of Paraná , explained the problem with avoided - deforestation credits to me at her office in the state capital of Curitiba .
For starters , she said , trees — living beings , after all — are far less predictable than , say , windmills .
They are subject to the vagaries of fires and disease , both of which are increasing due to climate change .
Each species absorbs carbon at different rates depending on factors like the altitude , soil , and weather .
Then there ’s the problem of “ leakage ” — when deforestation simply shifts from protected zones to unprotected ones , creating no overall emissions reduction .
And finally , the UN did not want to open the door to a perverse sort of extortion :
A country could threaten to open its lands to logging unless it was paid to not do so .
More fundamentally , Chang notes , when companies create reserves on already forested lands , their contribution to the fight against climate change is limited : “ Do they get the credit for simply enhancing what was there already ? ” José Miguez , one of Brazil ’s top climate officials , told me that during the Kyoto talks his government opposed using its forests to enable northern industries to pollute more .
“ The forest is there , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t guarantee it will absorb extra carbon .
The General Motors plan gives a false image to the public in the United States .
For us , they are pretending to combat climate change . ”
THERE IS ANOTHER vexing question inherent in preserving forests :
What happens to the people who use the land ?
Efforts to protect biodiversity in the dwindling wildlands of the world have increasingly run into a discomfiting tension between the impulse toward absolute preservation and the needs of people — many of them indigenous — who have lived sustainably in forestlands for decades or centuries .
Such tensions are playing out in the new economics of carbon offsets .
With a preserve designed in large part to safeguard stored carbon , a new set of imperatives comes into play .
Turning trees into carbon credits requires knowing how to extrapolate from carbon measurements , like the ones of tree No. 129 , to determine a forest ’s potential as a carbon sink .
It requires knowing as precisely as possible how many trees there are and of what size — which means minimizing the unpredictable activities of human beings , as small scale as they might be .
For many generations , the Guaraqueçaba forest was home to the Guarani Indians , but their dominion waned as the Brazilian government encouraged subsistence farmers to settle and clear the land .
Today the two populations coexist , living alongside the reserves or in communities nearby and relying on what remains of the forest for everything from food to building materials .
There are more than a dozen villages around the three reserves , linked by dirt roads and river tributaries traveled by canoe .
Most are home to just a few dozen people living in structures of wood and reeds .
Jonas de Souza is a 33 - year - old farmer who grew up a quarter of a mile from the forest that is now part of the GM - funded Cachoeira reserve .
His family grows bananas , cocoa , and coffee on a small plot .
He remembers hunting for small prey — roast paca , a large rodent , is a local delicacy — and collecting seeds and hearts of palm .
But now , signs have gone up at the edge of the forest :
No hunting , fishing , or removal of vegetation .
A state police force , the Força Verde , or Green Police , patrols the three reserves , as well as a larger state - sanctioned preservation area , to enforce the restrictions .
“ Now , ” says de Souza , “ I do n’t have the right to go out and do what I used to do when I was 12 , 14 , 15 years old .
I ’d grab my fishing rod and get a fish to bring to my family or to feed myself .
You do n’t have the right to walk into the forest to go and cut a heart of palm to eat .
I ’ll get arrested and I ’ll be called a thief . ”
De Souza says he ’s found numerous relics of the Guarani— pipes , an axe , pottery , and burial items .
The forest is valuable today , he notes , because his community and those who were here before them have taken good care of it .
“ We have been here , and still the forests have n’t disappeared .
Still the rivers are n’t contaminated .
Still the biodiversity is n’t extinct . ”
One of the goals of the Green Police is to prevent large - scale poaching , particularly of the endangered and highly valuable hearts of palm , as well as exotic primates and birds .
Yet officers cited few arrests of individuals linked to major logging , palmito , or wildlife - smuggling enterprises when I joined them on patrol .
Many of their enforcement efforts have focused on local people cutting a single palm for its succulent heart — or collecting wood to build their homes .
“ They ’re afraid of us , ” said Captain Lestechen , a patrol leader , as a group of young boys sitting on a bench eating a heart of palm quickly scattered at the approach of the Força Verde jeep .
Visiting the villages without the Força in tow , I heard numerous stories of people being harassed , arrested , and shot at while looking for food , wood , or reeds .
Antonio Alves , a 35 - year - old farmer and carpenter — we spoke as he carved a 15 - foot log canoe — said he was arrested this year for chopping down a tree to fix his mother ’s home in Quara Quara .
It ’s a stretch to call Quara Quara a village :
It ’s a cluster of five cabins perched at the end of a small , silted waterway .
The only way in is by canoe .
Three of the homes have been abandoned — the residents left , Alves said , because they could no longer hunt and gather food in the forest .
After his arrest , Alves spent 11 days in jail in Antonina , a one - hour canoe ride away .
The lawyer defending him at trial , pro bono , was the town ’s mayor , Carlos Machado .
Sitting in his expansive office in the town ’s colonial - era city hall , Machado told me that he ’s represented a string of people like Alves , villagers hauled into court on charges of violating the strict prohibitions in the reserves .
“ I know he did n’t go cut that tree down to speculate on the wood , ” Machado said .
“ It ’s one thing , the wood seller who is destroying [ the forest ] — this is very different from a caboclo [ farmer ] who cuts down a tree to build a fence . ”
These distinctions , he said , have been missing from the policies created by the reserves and enforced by the Força Verde ( whose officers have received training from SPVS , the Nature Conservancy ’s Brazilian partner ) .
Machado has noticed a stream of migrants from the backwoods to his town , which is buckling under the strain .
“ Antonina is a small town that has few resources for generating income , few possibilities for people who come from the rural zone without skills and without the defenses to live in the urban environment .
They stay in the outskirts of town , in the mangrove swamps , in irregular , inhospitable situations .
It creates a lot of social problems for us … Through those conservation projects , they created a poverty belt around our town . ”
The migrants also move west to Curitiba , said Machado , where they ’re often steered into prostitution or the drug trade .
By excluding villagers from the forests , says Jutta Kill , a researcher with the Forests and the European Union Resource Network who has spent months interviewing locals about the project , the reserves are pulling out the communities ’ lifeline .
“ In this area , ” she says , “ everyone is cash poor but no one goes hungry .
If you take the forest away , you take away everything .
The preservation projects here are designed to generate offsets for the largest polluters , and they ’re doing it by cutting off people from the land . ”
Few of the people here have motors on their boats , she notes ; even fewer own cars .
People with some of the smallest carbon footprints on Earth are being displaced by companies with some of the biggest .
Back in Curitiba , Chang , the state forestry expert , told me that the conservation groups were trying to create a “ zero disturbance ” environment in their forests .
“ Maybe that ’s a little obsolete , ” she said .
“ Maybe you [ should ] have 90 percent conservation , not 100 percent .
That way you could include the community of people who live there . ”
But that could undermine a system based on assigning a stable , reliable , and tradable value to a living ecosystem .
“ The carbon idea is not really tangible to people in the community , ” Miguel Calmon , the Nature Conservancy ’s director of forests and climate in Latin America , acknowledges .
Calmon says the conservation groups initially sponsored training programs for local community members in alternate sources of income — cultivating honeybees , organic bananas , local crafts — but the money ran out .
Now , he says , the rules are clear : “ You ca n’t go into these private reserves .
That land is not their land anyway .
If you used to go [ into the forest ] from your house across the road , now you can ’t .
That land is already owned . ”
The supply of forests for offsetting pollution in developed countries is , potentially , almost infinite .
There are an estimated 90 billion tons of carbon in Brazil ’s forests alone , and billions of tons more are sequestered in Indonesia , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Malaysia , Papua New Guinea , and other nations with substantial tropical forests , which are considered the most vulnerable to deforestation .
The world has a major stake in keeping all that carbon where it is .
The question now being debated in Washington and Copenhagen is whether the fate of the forests — and their people — will rest on the ability of industries to pay for preserving distant trees rather than reducing emissions closer to home .

Segway Inventor ’s New Device Turns Sewage into Clean Water
The inventor of the Segway has come up with a revolutionary invention that could provide access to clean water for millions of people .
The Segway personal motorized scooter was meant to be a breakthrough transportation device — but these days , it ’s a novelty that ’s probably best known as the ride of choice for Arrested Development ’s wayward magician , GOB .
Though it looks like the Segway wo n’t become the next Schwinn , the device ’s inventor , Dean Kamen , is n’t dwelling on it .
Instead , Kamen is finalizing his next big invention , the Slingshot , which promises to solve one of the world ’s biggest problems : a lack of clean water .
While water is widely available , many water sources are filled with contaminants that cause often - fatal diseases like diarrhea .
More than 1.1 billion people around the globe lack access to clean water sources , and a child dies from a waterborne illness every 15 seconds .
The water crisis is one of the most critical problems of our time .
Kamen is intent on solving it with his invention , which is named for the slingshot that the Biblical hero David used against the giant Goliath .
“ We believe the world needs a slingshot to take care of its Goliath of a problem in water , ” Kamen told CNN .
“ So we decided to build a small machine and give it to the little Davids . ”
The Slingshot is a small , portable electric device that can turn contaminated liquid of any kind — even raw sewage — into clean drinking water .
If it is distributed to communities in developing countries , it can prevent countless people from falling ill because of dirty drinking water , and will give girls the opportunity to attend school , rather than traveling for miles to fetch clean water from faraway wells .
One Slingshot can provide enough clean water for 100 people each day , but the machine is still considered to be too expensive for mass distribution — each one costs about $ 200,000 to create .
But Kamen is dedicated to making his new invention a success , and is working on building corporate partnerships that will hopefully bring down the cost of the device down to $ 2,000 each .
“ It is literally like turning lead into gold , ” said Kamen .
“ But I believe it ’s more important , because you ca n’t drink lead or gold . ”
Pandemic ( H1N1 ) 2009 , Ukraine - update 2
17 November 2009 - Preliminary tests reveal no significant changes in the pandemic ( H1N1 ) 2009 virus based on investigations of samples taken from patients in Ukraine .
Analyses are being performed by two WHO influenza collaborating centres as part of the global influenza surveillance network .
Preliminary genetic sequencing shows that the virus is similar to the virus used for production of the pandemic influenza vaccine , reconfirming the vaccine 's efficacy at this time .
Additional questions about the pandemic virus circulating in Ukraine will be answered as more data is available .
WHO commends the government of Ukraine for its open sharing of samples to inform global monitoring of the virus for signs of change .
A total of 34 samples were analysed independently by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza , Mill Hill in London , UK , and the WHO Collaborating Centre for the Surveillance , Epidemiology and Control of Influenza in Atlanta , Georgia , USA .
THE RELATION OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION
Some fresh observations on an old problem
by RICHARD P. FEYNMAN
" The Relation of Science and Religion " is a transcript of a talk given by Dr. Feynman at the Caltech YMCA Lunch Forum on May 2 , 1956 .
In this age of specialization men who thoroughly know one field are often incompetent to discuss another .
The great problems of the relations between one and another aspect of human activity have for this reason been discussed less and less in public .
When we look at the past great debates on these subjects we feel jealous of those times , for we should have liked the excitement of such argument .
The old problems , such as the relation of science and religion , are still with us , and I believe present as difficult dilemmas as ever , but they are not often publicly discussed because of the limitations of specialization .
But I have been interested in this problem for a long time and would like to discuss it .
In view of my very evident lack of knowledge and understanding of religion ( a lack which will grow more apparent as we proceed ) , I will organize the discussion in this way : I will suppose that not one man but a group of men are discussing the problem , that the group consists of specialists in many fields – the various sciences , the various religions and so on – and that we are going to discuss the problem from various sides , like a panel .
Each is to give his point of view , which may be molded and modified by the later discussion .
Further , I imagine that someone has been chosen by lot to be the first to present his views , and I am he so chosen .
I would start by presenting the panel with a problem :
A young man , brought up in a religious family , studies a science , and as a result he comes to doubt – and perhaps later to disbelieve in – his father 's God .
Now , this is not an isolated example ; it happens time and time again .
Although I have no statistics on this , I believe that many scientists – in fact , I actually believe that more than half of the scientists – really disbelieve in their father 's God ; that is , they do n't believe in a God in a conventional sense .
Now , since the belief in a God is a central feature of religion , this problem that I have selected points up most strongly the problem of the relation of science and religion .
Why does this young man come to disbelieve ?
The first answer we might hear is very simple :
You see , he is taught by scientists , and ( as I have just pointed out ) they are all atheists at heart , so the evil is spread from one to another .
But if you can entertain this view , I think you know less of science than I know of religion .
Another answer may be that a little knowledge is dangerous ; this young man has learned a little bit and thinks he knows it all , but soon he will grow out of this sophomoric sophistication and come to realize that the world is more complicated , and he will begin again to understand that there must be a God .
I do n't think it is necessary that he come out of it .
There are many scientists – men who hope to call themselves mature – who still do n't believe in God .
In fact , as I would like to explain later , the answer is not that the young man thinks he knows it all – it is the exact opposite .
A third answer you might get is that this young man really does n't understand science correctly .
I do not believe that science can disprove the existence of God ; I think that is impossible .
And if it is impossible , is not a belief in science and in a God – an ordinary God of religion — a consistent possibility ?
Yes , it is consistent .
Despite the fact that I said that more than half of the scientists do n't believe in God , many scientists do believe in both science and God , in a perfectly consistent way .
But this consistency , although possible , is not easy to attain , and I would like to try to discuss two things :
Why it is not easy to attain , and whether it is worth attempting to attain it .
When I say " believe in God , " of course , it is always a puzzle – what is God ?
What I mean is the kind of personal God , characteristic of the western religions , to whom you pray and who has something to do with creating the universe and guiding you in morals .
For the student , when he learns about science , there are two sources of difficulty in trying to weld science and religion together .
The first source of difficulty is this – that it is imperative in science to doubt ; it is absolutely necessary , for progress in science , to have uncertainty as a fundamental part of your inner nature .
To make progress in understanding we must remain modest and allow that we do not know .
Nothing is certain or proved beyond all doubt .
You investigate for curiosity , because it is unknown , not because you know the answer .
And as you develop more information in the sciences , it is not that you are finding out the truth , but that you are finding out that this or that is more or less likely .
That is , if we investigate further , we find that the statements of science are not of what is true and what is not true , but statements of what is known to different degrees of certainty : " It is very much more likely that so and so is true than that it is not true ; " or " such and such is almost certain but there is still a little bit of doubt ; " or – at the other extreme – " well , we really do n't know . "
Every one of the concepts of science is on a scale graduated somewhere between , but at neither end of , absolute falsity or absolute truth .
It is necessary , I believe , to accept this idea , not only for science , but also for other things ; it is of great value to acknowledge ignorance .
It is a fact that when we make decisions in our life we do n't necessarily know that we are making them correctly ; we only think that we are doing the best we can – and that is what we should do .
Attitude of uncertainty
I think that when we know that we actually do live in uncertainty , then we ought to admit it ; it is of great value to realize that we do not know the answers to different questions .
This attitude of mind – this attitude of uncertainty – is vital to the scientist , and it is this attitude of mind which the student must first acquire .
It becomes a habit of thought .
Once acquired , one cannot retreat from it any more .
What happens , then , is that the young man begins to doubt everything because he cannot have it as absolute truth .
So the question changes a little bit from " Is there a God ? " to " How sure is it that there is a God ? "
This very subtle change is a great stroke and represents a parting of the ways between science and religion .
I do not believe a real scientist can ever believe in the same way again .
Although there are scientists who believe in God , I do not believe that they think of God in the same way as religious people do .
If they are consistent with their science , I think that they say something like this to themselves : " I am almost certain there is a God .
The doubt is very small . "
That is quite different from saying , " I know that there is a God . "
I do not believe that a scientist can ever obtain that view – that really religious understanding , that real knowledge that there is a God – that absolute certainty which religious people have .
Of course this process of doubt does not always start by attacking the question of the existence of God .
Usually special tenets , such as the question of an after‑life , or details of the religious doctrine , such as details of Christ 's life , come under scrutiny first .
It is more interesting , however , to go right into the central problem in a frank way , and to discuss the more extreme view which doubts the existence of God .
Once the question has been removed from the absolute , and gets to sliding on the scale of uncertainty , it may end up in very different positions .
In many cases it comes out very close to being certain .
But on the other hand , for some , the net result of close scrutiny of the theory his father held of God may be the claim that it is almost certainly wrong .
Belief in God – and the facts of science
That brings us to the second difficulty our student has in trying to weld science and religion :
Why does it often end up that the belief in God – at least , the God of the religious type – is considered to be very unreasonable , very unlikely ?
I think that the answer has to do with the scientific things – the facts or partial facts – that the man learns .
For instance , the size of the universe is very impressive , with us on a tiny particle whirling around the sun , among a hundred thousand million suns in this galaxy , itself among a billion galaxies .
Again , there is the close relation of biological man to the animals , and of one form of life to another .
Man is a latecomer in a vast evolving drama ; can the rest be but a scaffolding for his creation ?
Yet again , there are the atoms of which all appears to be constructed , following immutable laws .
Nothing can escape it ; the stars are made of the same stuff , and the animals are made of the same stuff , but in such complexity as to mysteriously appear alive – like man himself .
It is a great adventure to contemplate the universe beyond man , to think of what it means without man – as it was for the great part of its long history , and as it is in the great majority of places .
When this objective view is finally attained , and the mystery and majesty of matter are appreciated , to then turn the objective eye back on man viewed as matter , to see life as part of the universal mystery of greatest depth , is to sense an experience which is rarely described .
It usually ends in laughter , delight in the futility of trying to understand .
These scientific views end in awe and mystery , lost at the edge in uncertainty , but they appear to be so deep and so impressive that the theory that it is all arranged simply as a stage for God to watch man 's struggle for good and evil seems to be inadequate .
So let us suppose that this is the case of our particular student , and the conviction grows so that he believes that individual prayer , for example , is not heard .
( I am not trying to disprove the reality of God ; I am trying to give you some idea of – some sympathy for – the reasons why many come to think that prayer is meaningless . )
Of course , as a result of this doubt , the pattern of doubting is turned next to ethical problems , because , in the religion which he learned , moral problems were connected with the word of God , and if the God does n't exist , what is his word ?
But rather surprisingly , I think , the moral problems ultimately come out relatively unscathed ; at first perhaps the student may decide that a few little things were wrong , but he often reverses his opinion later , and ends with no fundamentally different moral view .
There seems to be a kind of independence in these ideas .
In the end , it is possible to doubt the divinity of Christ , and yet to believe firmly that it is a good thing to do unto your neighbor as you would have him do unto you .
It is possible to have both these views at the same time ; and I would say that I hope you will find that my atheistic scientific colleagues often carry themselves well in society .
Communism and the scientific viewpoint
I would like to remark , in passing , since the word " atheism " is so closely connected with " communism , " that the communist views are the antithesis of the scientific , in the sense that in communism the answers are given to all the questions – political questions as well as moral ones – without discussion and without doubt .
The scientific viewpoint is the exact opposite of this ; that is , all questions must be doubted and discussed ; we must argue everything out – observe things , check them , and so change them .
The democratic government is much closer to this idea , because there is discussion and a chance of modification .
One does n't launch the ship in a definite direction .
It is true that if you have a tyranny of ideas , so that you know exactly what has to be true , you act very decisively , and it looks good – for a while .
But soon the ship is heading in the wrong direction , and no one can modify the direction any more .
So the uncertainties of life in a democracy are , I think , much more consistent with science .
Although science makes some impact on many religious ideas , it does not affect the moral content .
Religion has many aspects ; it answers all kinds of questions .
First , for example , it answers questions about what things are , where they come from , what man is , what God is – the properties of God , and so on .
Let me call this the metaphysical aspect of religion .
It also tells us another thing – how to behave .
Leave out of this the idea of how to behave in certain ceremonies , and what rites to perform ; I mean it tells us how to behave in life in general , in a moral way .
It gives answers to moral questions ; it gives a moral and ethical code .
Let me call this the ethical aspect of religion .
Now , we know that , even with moral values granted , human beings are very weak ; they must be reminded of the moral values in order that they may be able to follow their consciences .
It is not simply a matter of having a right conscience ; it is also a question of maintaining strength to do what you know is right .
And it is necessary that religion give strength and comfort and the inspiration to follow these moral views .
This is the inspirational aspect of religion .
It gives inspiration not only for moral conduct – it gives inspiration for the arts and for all kinds of great thoughts and actions as well .
Interconnections
These three aspects of religion are interconnected , and it is generally felt , in view of this close integration of ideas , that to attack one feature of the system is to attack the whole structure .
The three aspects are connected more or less as follows :
The moral aspect , the moral code , is the word of God – which involves us in a metaphysical question .
Then the inspiration comes because one is working the will of God ; one is for God ; partly one feels that one is with God .
And this is a great inspiration because it brings one 's actions in contact with the universe at large .
So these three things are very well interconnected .
The difficulty is this : that science occasionally conflicts with the first of the three categories – the metaphysical aspect of religion .
For instance , in the past there was an argument about whether the earth was the center of the universe – whether the earth moved around the sun or stayed still .
The result of all this was a terrible strife and difficulty , but it was finally resolved – with religion retreating in this particular case .
More recently there was a conflict over the question of whether man has animal ancestry .
The result in many of these situations is a retreat of the religious metaphysical view , but nevertheless , there is no collapse of the religion .
And further , there seems to be no appreciable or fundamental change in the moral view .
After all , the earth moves around the sun – is n't it best to turn the other cheek ?
Does it make any difference whether the earth is standing still or moving around the sun ?
We can expect conflict again .
Science is developing and new things will be found out which will he in disagreement with the present ‑day metaphysical theory of certain religions .
In fact , even with all the past retreats of religion , there is still real conflict for particular individuals when they learn about the science and they have heard about the religion .
The thing has not been integrated very well ; there are real conflicts here – and yet morals are not affected .
As a matter of fact , the conflict is doubly difficult in this metaphysical region .
Firstly , the facts may be in conflict , but even if the facts were not in conflict , the attitude is different .
The spirit of uncertainty in science is an attitude toward the metaphysical questions that is quite different from the certainty and faith that is demanded in religion .
There is definitely a conflict , I believe – both in fact and in spirit – over the metaphysical aspects of religion .
In my opinion , it is not possible for religion to find a set of metaphysical ideas which will be guaranteed not to get into conflicts with an ever‑advancing and always ‑changing science which is going into an unknown .
We do n't know how to answer the questions ; it is impossible to find an answer which someday will not be found to be wrong .
The difficulty arises because science and religion are both trying to answer questions in the same realm here .
Science and moral questions
On the other hand , I do n't believe that a real conflict with science will arise in the ethical aspect , because I believe that moral questions are outside of the scientific realm .
Let me give three or four arguments to show why I believe this .
In the first place , there have been conflicts in the past between the scientific and the religious view about the metaphysical aspect and , nevertheless , the older moral views did not collapse , did not change .
Second , there are good men who practice Christian ethics and who do not believe in the divinity of Christ .
They find themselves in no inconsistency here .
Thirdly , although I believe that from time to time scientific evidence is found which may be partially interpreted as giving some evidence of some particular aspect of the life of Christ , for example , or of other religious metaphysical ideas , it seems to me that there is no scientific evidence bearing on the golden rule .
It seems to me that that is somehow different .
Now , let 's see if I can make a little philosophical explanation as to why it is different – how science cannot affect the fundamental basis of morals .
The typical human problem , and one whose answer religion aims to supply , is always of the following form : Should I do this ?
Should we do this ?
Should the government do this ?
To answer this question we can resolve it into two parts : First —
If I do this , what will happen ? – and second – Do I want that to happen ?
What would come of it of value – of good ?
Now a question of the form :
If I do this , what will happen ? is strictly scientific .
As a matter of fact , science can be defined as a method for , and a body of information obtained by , trying to answer only questions which can be put into the form :
If I do this , what will happen ?
The technique of it , fundamentally , is : Try it and see .
Then you put together a large amount of information from such experiences .
All scientists will agree that a question – any question , philosophical or other – which cannot be put into the form that can be tested by experiment ( or , in simple terms , that can not be put into the form :
If I do this , what will happen ? ) is not a scientific question ; it is outside the realm of science .
I claim that whether you want something to happen or not – what value there is in the result , and how you judge the value of the result ( which is the other end of the question : Should I do this ? ) – must lie outside of science because it is not a question that you can answer only by knowing what happens ; you still have to judge what happens – in a moral way .
So , for this theoretical reason I think that there is a complete consistency between the moral view – or the ethical aspect of religion – and scientific information .
Turning to the third aspect of religion – the inspirational aspect – brings me to the central question that I would like to present to this imaginary panel .
The source of inspiration today – for strength and for comfort – in any religion is very closely knit with the metaphysical aspect ; that is , the inspiration comes from working for God , for obeying his will , feeling one with God .
Emotional ties to the moral code – based in this manner – begin to be severely weakened when doubt , even a small amount of doubt , is expressed as to the existence of God ; so when the belief in God becomes uncertain , this particular method of obtaining inspiration fails .
I do n't know the answer to this central problem – the problem of maintaining the real value of religion , as a source of strength and of courage to most men , while , at the same time , not requiring an absolute faith in the metaphysical aspects .
The heritages of Western civilization
Western civilization , it seems to me , stands by two great heritages .
One is the scientific spirit of adventure – the adventure into the unknown , an unknown which must be recognized as being unknown in order to be explored ; the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered ; the attitude that all is uncertain ; to summarize it – the humility of the intellect .
The other great heritage is Christian ethics – the basis of action on love , the brotherhood of all men , the value of the individual – the humility of the spirit .
These two heritages are logically , thoroughly consistent .
But logic is not all ; one needs one 's heart to follow an idea .
If people are going back to religion , what are they going back to ?
Is the modern church a place to give comfort to a man who doubts God‑more , one who disbelieves in God ?
Is the modern church a place to give comfort and encouragement to the value of such doubts ?
So far , have we not drawn strength and comfort to maintain the one or the other of these consistent heritages in a way which attacks the values of the other ?
Is this unavoidable ?
How can we draw inspiration to support these two pillars of western civilization so that they may stand together in full vigor , mutually unafraid ?
Is this not the central problem of our time ?
I put it up to the panel for discussion .

China - Japan scholars ' report likely in January By Cheng Guangjin ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-12-28 08:17
Those who are keen to read the complete results of three years of joint research into the long - disputed issues in the history of China and Japan have to wait for another month , Chinese scholars who joined the research announced over the weekend .
Twenty - six research papers , half composed by Chinese scholars and half by their Japanese counterparts , will be published as early as next month .
The first phase of the joint research concluded on Dec 24 after 10 Chinese and 10 Japanese scholars met for the fourth time in Tokyo .
Five Chinese scholars were present at a press conference held in Beijing on Saturday , headed by Bu Ping , Chinese chief commissioner of the joint research and director of the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ( CASS ) .
The scholars said the two sides postponed the release of details for fear of arousing nationalistic sentiments by simplifying the research conclusions without the full contents , which reflect the complexity of historical disputes in China - Japan relations .
By next month the translation and compiling will be finished , they said .
But they highlighted the statements made by the Japanese scholars in their papers regarding the nature of the Sino - Japanese War of 1931 - 45 , which they admitted to be Japan 's invasion into China , according to Bu .
" They admitted the illegal acts committed by the Japanese army in the war had caused the huge sacrifice of Chinese civilians , which hampered the building of new relationship between the two countries after the war , " Bu said .
Bu said the Japanese scholars also admitted in the papers that " the lawsuits in recent years over germ warfare , chemical weapons left in China , forced labor and violence on women all reflected the deep scar left by the war on the Chinese people . "
However , " China is not seeking revenge but the aim of studying history is eyeing for the future " , stressed Tao Wenzhao , one of the Chinese researchers on the project and a US studies expert at CASS .
" We both want to turn to a new page in our relationship , but the Japanese leaders should keep a consistent stance in respecting the history , " said Tao .
When anti-Japan sentiments inside China reached a climax in 2005 , the Japanese government proposed the joint research project to China and the two governments sponsored 20 scholars to start the project in December 2006 , with a goal to improve bilateral ties , said Bu .
With current Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama 's pro-China policy and the reiterated appeal to create an East Asia Community ( EAC ) , " China and Japan should solve their historical disputes or the EAC would only be a fantasy , " said Bu .
On an earlier occasion , Feng Zhaokui , former deputy head of the institute of Japan Studies at CASS , compared the EAC with the European Union ( EU ) , whose progress has owed much to the solving of historical conflicts between France and Germany left by World War II .
" China and Japan have much to learn from the example set by France and Germany , " Bu agreed .
Whether to admit the Nanking Massacre in Japanese history text books has been a concern to Japan 's right - wing forces , who seek to deny the historical fact and the number of casualties in the massacre , the scholars said .
The Nanking Trial in 1947 confirmed the death toll at over 300,000 and the Tokyo Trial in 1948 set it at over 200,000 , said Bu .
The mainstream Japanese people have already recognized this , the Chinese scholars said .
The scholars said it is a " comfort " that in the past three years the Chinese and Japanese scholars have been able to sit down together and discuss these historical issues calmly and rationally .
But that may be changing .
Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi , the grand sheikh of al - Azhar , a prominent university in Cairo , Egypt , seems recently to have endorsed a more liberal attitude toward apostasy .
According to Tantawi , a Muslim who renounces his faith should be left alone as long as he does not threaten or belittle Islam .
Giving up the faith alone should not trigger actions against an apostate in this view ; only acting as an enemy of Islam should prompt reprisals .

Have I tragically underestimated the ability of foreign cellphone companies to come up with devilishly complex pricing plans and the skill of economists to convert those schemes into pat theories that can be illustrated with neat charts and graphs ?
The many people who have written me over the last two days about my Sunday article on the method behind the madness of cellphone pricing say I have .
The article began quoting Barry Nalebuff , a Yale economist , saying cellphone pricing plans were “ weird . ”
Alex Kaufman , a doctoral candidate in economics at Harvard , wrote to chastise me for my “ characterization of economists as throwing up their hands in confusion over this problem . ”
Indeed , he pointed me to the work of Michael Grubb , now a professor at M.I.T. ’s Sloan School of Business .
I had spoken to Mr. Grubb for the article , in fact , on the recommendation of Mr. Nalebuff .
His research seemed interesting , but a bit too involved to describe in the article , given how many other topics I had to cover .
Mr. Grubb told me that as a grad student he too was perplexed by pricing plans with big bundles of included minutes and high charges for extra minutes , what economists call three - part tariffs .
After investigation , he wrote a paper arguing that phone companies were exploiting overconfidence by consumers about their ability to predict how many minutes they would use .
He summarized this in an e-mail message to me :
Three - part tariffs optimally exploit overconfident consumers because overconfident consumers both underestimate the likelihood of very high usage , and the need to pay high overage charges , and underestimate the likelihood of very low usage , and the likelihood of not getting a refund for included “ free ” minutes .
Consumers certainly do make bad predictions about their own behavior .
Studies show that people buy gym memberships , rather than paying per gym use , because they believe they will work out more than they really do .
And when I wrote about the credit card industry , I saw studies that showed people thought they paid off their bills in full , and thus avoided interest charges , far more often than they actually did .
That ’s not the only factor here , though .
Andrew M. Odlyzko , a mathematics professor at the University of Minnesota , wrote me with a very interesting paper he co-wrote in 1979 which argued that consumers often preferred flat - rate pricing to paying by usage even if it would save money .
It cited data from phone companies that showed half the people who chose local phone plans with unlimited calling would have saved money choosing a pay - per - call plan .
The paper listed three reasons :
( i) Insurance :
It provides protection against sudden large bills .
( What happens if my son comes back from college , and starts talking to his girlfriend around the clock ? )
( ii ) Overestimate of usage : Customers typically overestimate how much they use a service , with the ratio of their estimate to actual usage following a log - normal distribution .
( iii ) Hassle factor :
In a per-use situation , consumers keep worrying whether each call is worth the money it costs , and it has been observed that their usage goes down .
A flat - rate plan allows them not to worry as to whether that call to their in - laws is really worth $ 0.05 per minute .
The second factor there matches up with Mr. Grubb ’s idea that consumers are overconfident of their ability to predict how to save money .
The cellphone executives I spoke to believed that the desire for stable prices , encouraged by their pain - inducing overage charges , was a better explanation for consumer behavior .
On another topic , several readers outside of the United States chastised me for oversimplifying cellphone pricing structures in the rest of the developed world .
( And I did n’t even talk about emerging economies like India , where wireless service is much cheaper , mainly because of lower costs . )
One important difference is that in most other countries , the person who calls a cellphone pays the bill .
Receiving wireless calls is free .
This seems very attractive to consumers , especially when rates are high , and it helped explain the rapid deployment of cellphones in Europe and Asia .
But as it has developed , the caller - pays system has inhibited the use of cellphones .
The rate to call a cellphone in many countries can be quite high and can vary depending on the carrier of the person you are calling ( which you may not know ) .
That means that calling one cellphone from another can lead to nasty charges .
This , some say , explains why people in caller - pays countries talk on cellphones far less than people in the United States .
The article also did n’t make it clear that carriers in many countries offer subsidized handsets for people willing to commit to a service contract .
Indeed , such plans are becoming more common in many countries as people try to afford expensive smartphones .
But it is also true that it is far , far more common in many countries for people to buy phones at retail stores and then to buy prepaid blocks of minutes from carriers as they need them .
Spend a minute looking at the various options available in Britain , and you would n’t say that things are any less complicated there .
Here is the page , from Carphone Warehouse , a large retailer , for the iPhone 3GS and for the BlackBerry Curve 8520 .
One footnote I left out : A few people asked for citations for the effective average price of 5 cents a minute and 1 cent a text message I cited .
The voice statistic came from the CTIA , a wireless industry trade group .
The text figure came from a study of monthly cellphone bills conducted by Nielsen .

ISTANBUL ( Reuters ) - Building atom bombs is stupid .
America must ditch Israel to gain friends in the Middle East .
We need love and spirituality , not failed capitalist consumerism .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad adjusts his earphones as he attends news conference after 25th Meeting of the Standing Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation ( COMCEC ) of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in Istanbul November 9 , 2009 .

The world according to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is not without surprises .
He expounds his views with rhetorical flourishes , jabs at his foes and occasional flashes of humor .
If he lies awake at night fretting about domestic discontent at his disputed re-election in June , international pressure to alter Iran ’s nuclear policy , or even an Israeli military strike , the 53 - year - old leader betrays no such worries in public .
Ahmadinejad , in an open - necked shirt and jacket , pre-empted , parried and sometimes answered questions at a lengthy news conference on Monday night after an Islamic summit in Istanbul .
He opened it with a homily on the evils of poverty due to capitalism and accused the West of using “ so - called democracy , ” liberalism and humanism to mask a drive for world dominance .
Belying his often - demonized image , the Iranian leader evoked universal values , not just Islamic ones , to call for a new world order based on friendship and solidarity , saying : “ Without spirituality , a human being is no different from an animal . ”
Ahmadinejad gave little away under questioning about nuclear policy , reiterating that this was a “ closed file ” -- referring to what Iran says is its right to enrich uranium for civilian use regardless of outside suspicions of its nuclear aims .
Iran plans to install 50,000 centrifuges to enrich uranium at its Natanz site and a recently disclosed facility near Qom , Ahmadinejad said , to be used in as yet unbuilt power plants .
“ Wherever we go beyond our needs , the surplus will be exported , ” the president added , speaking through an interpreter .
He sidestepped queries on whether Iran would accept a U.N. - drafted plan whereby it would ship most of its low - enriched uranium abroad to be processed and returned for use in a medical research reactor -- thus calming international concern and gaining time for negotiations on a long - term solution .
FOLLY OF ATOM BOMBS
Ahmadinejad , whose questioning of the Holocaust and repeated calls for Israel to be wiped out have fueled alarm about Iran ’s nuclear intentions , attacked the folly of building atom bombs .
“ The era of using atom bombs is over , ” he declared .
“ If they could be used , the Zionist regime would be victorious over the people of Gaza and Lebanon .
Has the atom bomb helped the United States in Iraq or Afghanistan ?
Has it made them popular ? ”
Ahmadinejad , son of a blacksmith from the provincial town of Arad , argued that money spent by world powers on nuclear arms would not “ heal wounds , ” build schools or develop economies .
“ They build atom bombs and at the same time they talk of human rights , ” he said .
“ This is something that must change . ”
Asked what U.S. policies must change before Iran took up President Barack Obama ’s offer of dialogue , Ahmadinejad said he had sent his American counterpart a message encouraging him .
“ But I ask you , where are the changes ? ” he queried , saying Obama had not yet kept his promise to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and had not shifted U.S. policies toward Israel and the Palestinians or toward Iraq and Afghanistan .
He acknowledged that abandoning U.S. support for Israel was “ difficult ” for Obama , but added : “ He ca n’t have both friendship with the killer Zionist regime and the countries of the region . ”
Obama himself told Reuters in an interview on Monday that political uncertainty in Iran may be complicating efforts to seal a nuclear fuel deal between Tehran and major world powers .
He said the United States , along with Russia , China , Germany , Britain and France , had made a “ fair ” offer to Iran .
“ Although so far we have not seen the kind of positive response we want from Iran , we are as well positioned as we ’ve ever been to align the international community behind that agenda , ” Obama said .
Ahmadinejad dismissed the past seven years of efforts to restrain Iran ’s nuclear program as sinister and misguided .
“ We have this front against us of some countries who want to control all the world , ” he said .
“ Our nation stood against their activities and gained victory .
Today they cannot do anything . ”
This is part of my Startup Advice series
I often have career discussions with entrepreneurs — both young and more mature — whether they should join company “ X ” or not .
I usually pull the old trick of answering a question with a question .
My reply is usually , “ is it time for you to earn or to learn ? ”
Let ’s face it .
If you ’re thinking about joining as the director of marketing , product management manager , senior architect , international business development lead , etc. at a startup that has already raised $ 5 million the chances of you making your retirement money on that company is EXTREMELY small .
That ’s Ok .
Not every job you have is supposed to be your big break .
It ’s Ok for that to be your job to “ learn . ”
Yet I often hear people asking about these types of opportunities express their questions to me whether I think this company is going to be a big hit .
It ’s clear to me that many people confuse learn with earn .
I will do a simple calculation for them that goes like this .
OK , you would own 0.25 % of the stock .
They raised $ 5 million in their B round .
Let ’s assume that the company raised it at a normal VC valuation , which means it gave up 33 % of the company and thus $ 5 million / 33 % = $ 15 million post - money valuation .
If you never raise another round of venture capital ( a big if ) and if your company is sold for the normal venture exit ( $ 50 million on average for 200 or so annually that get sold ) then what is your stake ?
$ 125,000 .
Yup .
Simple math would have solved that but people rarely do the calculations or think about it .
And let ’s say that it took 4 years to exit — that ’s $ 31,250 / year .
Now … these are stock options and not restricted stock so you ’ll likely be taxed at a short - term capital gains rate ( see comments section for why ) .
In California that averages around 42.5 % so in my state after tax you ’d make an extra $ 18,000 / year and that ’s in a positive scenario !
BTW , this ignores liquidation preferences which actually mean you ’ll earn less .
So let ’s go CRAZY !
You get 1 % , you sell for $ 150 million and it ’s in 3 years ( e.g. you won the lottery ) .
That ’s an after - tax gain of $ 287,500 / year for 2 years .
Not bad .
Doh !
Wait a second .
Stock vests for 4 years .
You did n’t get acceleration on a change of control ?
Sorry bud .
We ’ll have to either cut your earnings in half to $ 143,750 or you ’ll have to complete 2 - years at BigCo that bought you making the money spread out over 4 years so it ’s $ 143,750 / year for 4 years .
Do n’t get me wrong .
This is n’t shabby money .
But given that a home in Palo Alto or Santa Monica will set you back $ 2 million it ’s hardly riding off into the sunset .
I ’m not trying to depress you .
I ’m just trying to be realistic .
If you want to “ Earn ” ( and by earn I mean the chance to buy your house outright or greater ) — you have to start a company or join as a senior executive .
Or you have to hit the lottery and be an early player middle management player at Google , Facebook , MySpace or Twitter .
Let ’s be honest — how many of those are created per year in the entire country ?
1 ? 2 max ?
I spoke with an investor recently who told me that 1,500 deals get funded / year in the US , 80 ( 5.3 % ) eventually sell for $ 50 million and only 8 ( 0.5 % ) eventually sell for $ 150 million or more .
So when the Stanford MBA , the ex senior technology developer or the former Chief Revenue Officer of a company is calling me and asking my advice on their next gig you can see why I start with “ are you ready to earn or to learn ? ”
For most people it ’s learn .
I only emphasize the question before I find it much more helpful to join a company with realistic expectations of what you want to get out of it .
My advice is often , “ make sure that what you get out of working at this company is one or several of the following : a great network of talented excutives and VCs , more responsibility than your last job , specific industry or technical skills that will help you in what you do next , a chance to partner with companies that will increase your industry relationships , etc . ” Learn now to earn later .
When I was CEO of my first company ( where I admittedly F ’d up everything before I figured it all out ) we initially calculated for people how much there options were going to be worth some day .
It was 1999 .
Ventro was trading at $ 8 billion on sub $ 2 million of revenue .
It was easy to do these calcs .
Over time I realized that this created a rotten culture .
Over time I took to telling people the following , “ join BuildOnline because you think you ’ll get great experience .
Join because you like the mission of what we ’re doing .
Join because if you do a good job we ’ll help you punch above your weighclass and work in a more senior role .
And if you ever feel that in the year ahead of you you do n’t think that you ’ll increase the value of your resume and you ’re not having fun then go .
Join because we pay well but not amazing .
Stock options are the icing on the cake .
They ’ll never make you rich .
Do n’t join for the options . ”
Obviously you should only take jobs that you enjoy and that let you be passionate about coming to work every day .
That ’s a given .
Do n’t blindly join a company without knowing why you ’d join or asking the right questions .
So a friend recently called to ask for advice on becoming the CTO of a startup .
He ’d be employee number 3 .
The company was being spun out of a larger company .
I asked him how much of the company would be owned by the parent company and how much would be owned by management .
He had n’t thought to ask .
When we next spoke he had found out that the CEO had about 5 % and there was no management option pool in place .
My advice was … run !
I said , “ all the hard work is ahead .
Why start the game with a company with a structure that ’s likely to fail . ”
Another talented young man I recently met called to talk shop .
He had an offer in NY , an offer with a well known startup in the Bay Area and an offer with a startup in LA .
He also has his own company that he started 6 months ago .
He ’s not even 21 .
He wanted to know what to do .
I told him that he needed to decide whether to learn or to earn .
He ’s young enough to do either but know why you ’re doing it .
I advised against the SF role because it was a bigger company and his role would be pushing paper from one side of his desk to the other .
If you ’re going to learn then at least go work somewhere exciting where you can really do something .
If it works you can stay and grow for the next 5 years .
If it does n’t you ’ll have done 3 startups by 26 .
And you ’ll be ready to earn .
On the other hand , at sub 21 you have the ability to swing for the fences and try and earn if you ’re so inclined and if you think you have the skill sets and the idea .
When you ’re 40 , have 3 kids and a mortgage this is much harder .
Now , for the “ Earn ” part .
Another friend of mine is a very talented executive .
He went to Harvard undergrad , Harvard Business School and has worked at 3 prominent startups and 2 well known big companies .
He ’s worked in the US and internationally .
He ’s in his early 40’s .
Whenever he calls me he must think I ’m a broken record .
I always say , “ Dude ( I live in SoCal now ! ) — it ’s time to EARN .
Stop dicking around with another number 2 job ( he always gets offere the number 2 job ) .
It ’s time for you to be in the driver ’s seat .
Either start a company or go somewhere where they need a CEO . ”
If you really want to earn you need to be in the top 3 – 4 in the company .
Best to be a founder .
Very few people can do this .
It ’s a rare skill .
Be realistic about your skills , background and ideas .
Anyway , I hope this post has n’t been too harsh .
I ’m not all about the money .
I think working in a startup can be an enormously rewarding experience .
I would n’t recommend it any other way .
But you need to match your talents , age , skills , ambition and economic situation with your current reality .
At a minimum be realistic about the outcomes .
And make sure you ask yourself the question , “ am I here to earn or to learn ? ”
A nice online wizarding correspondence school sounds pretty good after 3 or 4 years of nearly dying horribly at the hands of ultimate evil , does n’t it Harry ?
I bet you ’d rather spend your educational hours in your boxers , eating Toasters Strudles in front of a laptop than struggling to survive against insurmountable odds while all of your friends and loved ones are maimed and murdered ( all while still trying to maintain a respectable GPA ) .
Let Neville be the chosen one for a while .
Get yourself a mother effing wizard associates degree !
No employer really checks to see where you went to school anyway .

SPEAKING OF THE EDWARD SHIRT
Team Edward ( James Olmos ) shirts are now linked on Olmos Productions official online STORE .
There will be more cool things to announce on this front soon .
Americans for Prosperity ( AFP ) hosted a speech by Christopher Lord Monckton , a UK climate disruption denier , at Copenhagen yesterday .
According to a report on the event at It’sGettingHotInHere.org , there were only five attendees that were n’t AFP employees – until around 50 US youth climate activists showed up , took over the stage , and proceeded to hold up signs and chant “ Real Americans for Prosperity are Americans for Clean Energy ” from the stage behind Monckton , who continued his speech despite the disruption .
Until he drifted off message and said :
You are listening now to the shouts in the background of the Hitler youth .
The following YouTube video has Monckton saying “ Hitler youth ” twice , but you can skip to the last 20 seconds or so if you are n’t interested in sitting through the entire thing .
As someone who ’s studied the Nazis , I think we can safely add the history of Nazism right under climatology on the list of things Monckton is ignorant of .
However , the more interesting point is that Monckton publicly cracked .
It ’s one thing to say intemperate things about your ideological opponents in private email correspondence that you never intend to make public , but it ’s something else entirely to do the same in a public forum .
Clearly , when being badgered , even a practiced speaker like Monckton can get frustrated and publicly say things that are intemperate at best .
The way I see it , climate disruption deniers have only two courses of action they can take .
Either they can condemn Monckton ’s intemperate public remarks just as they have condemned the private intemperate remarks of climate scientists in the illegally - obtained CRU email archives .
Or they can forgive Monckton his public remarks and similarly forgive the climate scientists their private remarks as well .
Forgiving Monckton but condemning the CRU climatologists would be hypocritical .
Heading Out ( Dave Summers ) and I have been talking about the issues Arthur Berman raises for quite a while now .
Most recently , Dave wrote a post called Shale Gas Estimates Perhaps Optimistic - An Interesting and Worrying Talk at ASPO .
In an act of extraordinary courage , a top Petrohawk executive threatened to cancel his free subscription to World Oil if the magazine continued to publish my column .
Today , John Royall , President and CEO for Gulf Publishing , cancelled my November column .
What Arthur Berman is saying is that natural gas companies that extract shale are mis-estimating how quickly natural gas production will decline in the future -- they are assuming gas production will decline more slowly than evidence indicates it will .
As a result of their optimistic assumptions about decline rates , they are assuming that shale gas can profitably be extracted for as long as 50 years , when Berman believes the average well life is only about 8 years .
Part of the controversy revolves about what price is needed for shale gas to be profitable .
The gas companies are saying that natural gas is already profitable , or near profitable , at today 's low prices .
As Heading
Out notes , Chesapeake testified before congress that the company could operate with a price of $ 4 per thousand cubic feet .
Arthur Berman is saying that prices need to be much higher .
Figure 1
Berman puts the necessary price for operators to earn a reasonable profit at about $ 9 a thousand cubic foot .
One can see from the graph that in the past , prices have rarely hit this level .
If the quality of resources goes down over time , the necessary price could rise from this point .
Based on the analysis of Dave Murphy , we have seen recently that it is difficult for the price of oil to go much over $ 80 without it causing a recession .
Natural gas is a smaller part of the economy , but I suspect it still has issues with too high a price being recessionary .
Figure 2
Historically , natural gas wellhead prices have averaged about 11.4 % of West Texas Intermediate oil prices .
If this ratio holds , one would expect the threshold at which the economy starts reacting negatively to high natural gas prices would be about ( 11.4 % x $ 80 ) = $ 9.12 , which is uncomfortably close to what Arthur Berman says is the necessary price for profitability of shale gas .
Arguably , the average ratio could be distorted by the high ratios during the periods when there were natural gas shortages , but oil prices were quite low ( 2001 , 2003 ) .
But if we choose a lower ratio excluding these points , say 10 % , the threshold for gas comes out to ( 10 % x $ 80 ) = $ 8.00 per 1,000 cubic feet .
Figure 3
Arguably , the maximum price for gas should be about 1/6 of the price for oil , because its energy content is about 1/6 that of a barrel of oil .
But transport and distribution costs for natural gas are higher than for oil , so perhaps the lower empirically derived ratios are reasonable .
( The high residential prices during summer reflect the fact that little gas is sold during the summer , but overhead for the companies selling the gas continues .
Also , many homeowners opt for level billing all year , to smooth out differences in the amount of fuel used in the summer and winter , and this distorts monthly price per BTU indications . )
There is a second problem with natural gas price .
If one ramps up natural gas production , one has to simultaneously ramp up infrastructure for end uses ( for example , natural gas busses and fueling stations ) plus pipelines and storage to enable the new end uses .
If one does n't do this , the extra natural gas has nowhere to go , and prices drop precipitously .
This is what has happened recently .
Adding new infrastructure is slow and expensive , so this may mean that natural gas prices may languish for many years before production and infrastructure finally match ( especially if the country is in a recession , and this holds back demand ) .
At this point , North America really needs to know how much natural gas is producible , and at what price , in order to make good decisions on infrastructure .
It does n't make sense to add a lot of natural gas infrastructure unless enough natural gas will be available , over a long enough period , to make the investment a reasonable one .
If Berman 's calculations are right , not only is quite a high price is needed , but the amount that can be produced is quite a bit lower than other estimates suggest .
One really needs to know the right answer .
Obviously , there are individual company issues as well .
If long term natural gas production from existing and new wells is expected to be very good , the value of a gas company 's land is much higher .
Natural gas companies can borrow more money against the higher value of the land , enabling new investment .
The value of the stock is also likely to be higher .
Fortunately , whether or not Berman is writing about the issue , he has raised enough questions that one might expect auditors to be somewhat diligent about the issue this year end .
What are the some of the arguments against Berman 's approach ?
Berman , in his blog , quotes a rebuttal by Tudor , Pickering and Holt .
This is an excerpts :
Technical credentials .
In any technical discussion , one must establish technical credibility .
The TPH equity research team is staffed with engineers that have worked at Shell , Tenneco , Arco , Exxon Mobil , reservoir consultant Holditch & Associates and reserve auditor Netherland & Sewell .
Dave Pursell has taught petroleum engineering courses at Texas A&M .
Not only do our guys know words like non-linear flow and pseudo - steady - state .. they actually understand what they mean .
We ’ve done decline curve work for 10 - 20 years .
Our A&D team on the ibanking side has another group of engineering talent just like us – and they make technical assessments of reserves for a living .
We know how to do this type of work .
Depth of analysis on this topic .
Within the past six months , we ’ve looked at 32 subsegments of US production , including individual analyses of various historical shale results ( Barnett , Fayetteville , etc ) .
The culmination of the analysis was our US Natural Gas Supply Study .
We ’ve got data coming out of our ears …we have n’t published it all ( and wo n’t ) , but it confirms the technical work being done by literally hundreds of industry folks .
10 Reasons Why Skeptics Are Wrong : 1 . Technical stuff matters –
The skeptics claim Estimated Ultimate Recovery ( EUR ) in shales is much lower than stated by industry , analysts and reserve engineers .
This is because their decline method is technically flawed and is biased to under - estimate recovery .
They suggest that it is appropriate to assume Barnett Shale wells exhibit exponential decline after one year ( and not apparent hyperbolic behavior ) .
Reality – it takes many years for a very tight ( low permeability ) gas reservoirs to exhibit exponential decline behavior .
Thus , hyperbolic decline can and should be used to approximate / extrapolate EUR’s .
Whew – got through that explanation without a mind numbing discourse of transient vs. pseudo - steady - state flow .
2 . Type Curves work – Skeptics further suggest that it is inappropriate to use type curves because it makes the data look smoother than it really is …and suggest that all wells should be analyzed individually .
This is wrong for multiple reasons : ( 1 ) It is accurate / widely accepted to use normalized curves as long as there is a relatively stable well count and vintage / area effects are accounted for .
( 2 ) Projecting individual wells without checking the type curve trends will lead to overly pessimistic projections ( see Reason # 4 ) .
Type curves actually normalize for a negative bias that might be driven by individual well declines .
( 3 ) Reserve auditors project EUR ’s on a by - well base … supplemented with type curves .
Their by - well analysis is consistent with the type curve methods reported by companies .
The answer is generally the same either way if the work is done correctly !
3 . High Terminal Decline Rate is wrong – Skeptics state that terminal declines will be high in shale plays ( > 15 % ) .
Without 10 - 20 years of Barnett history ( the oldest shale play ) , this can not be disproved .
However , there are literally thousands of data points ( actual well production ) that show low terminal decline rates in tight gas reservoirs .
Read the technical papers .
Look at the data .
Enough said .
4 . Reality bites -
We loaded the skeptics Barnett ~ 1bcf EUR type curve ( which are called optimistic ) into our Barnett Shale model .
We applied their type curve to the ~ 3,000 wells drilled in 2008 .
During 2008 , actual Barnett production grew by 1.2bcf.day .
The skeptics “ optimistic ” EUR curve estimated growth of only 0.7bcf.day – which says it underpredicted actual incremental production by 0.5 bcf / day or 70 % .
This is only for one year .
If we went back to 2005 / 2006 and applied the type curve to all Barnett wells drilled , there is NO WAY this low type curve would match actual Barnett production of 5 bcf / d. Scoreboard !
Berman also quoted some comments by Chesapeake Energy :
" We do feel like we have the No. 1 resource base in the nation , ” said Steve Dixon , Chesapeake ’s chief operating officer .
Dixon said Chesapeake ’s shale holdings will continue producing for years to come , despite " misguided ” predictions from an analyst at an industry conference in Denver earlier this week .
" We ’re very confident that these types of rocks will continue to bleed gas for decades and decades , ” he said .
Jeff Fisher , the company ’s senior vice president of production , said the unique size of Chesapeake ’s assets will allow the company to develop new technology to maximize production .
" We ’ve achieved great results to date , and we ’re just getting started , ” Fisher said .
I found an analysis of Berman 's approach by Drilling Info Inc. , Energy Strategy Partners , which seems to be better .
One of their big concerns is that Berman takes results from the earliest period , and projects them forward .
Natural gas companies refine their techniques over time , but this is not really reflected in the analysis .
This post also suggests that the initial wells drilled likely included more marginal producers .
These are less likely to continue :
MARGINAL PRODUCER -
Unlike conventional reservoirs , the economics of shale plays highly favor operators that invest in engineering and ongoing experimentation in optimizing their drilling , completion , and stimulation practices .
The saying “ One Man ’s Gold is another Man ’s Garbage ” is especially true for these plays .
For an equivalent grade of acreage , the best operators statistically produce 40 % or more than the average operator , and up to 4 or 5 times more than an inefficient operator .
Learning curves and operator comparisons are real and quantifiable throughout .
As acreage expires , and the “ land rush ” acreages are released , the optimal operators will successfully step into “ another man ’s garbage ” .
THE VOLUMES OF COMMERCIALLY RECOVERABLE RESERVES ARE GREATLY OVERESTIMATED
-
This is a very definitive statement for which the jury is still out .
Mr. Berman is absolutely correct at current drilling and completion costs combined with $ 2.50 MCFG wellhead price .
However , resource turns into undeveloped reserves fairly quickly as wellhead product price goes up or costs come down .
Reducing the cost of drilling and completing a well by 50 % is the economic equivalent of doubling the lifetime wellhead price .
It helps to think of breakthroughs in reducing drill , complete , and stimulation costs as “ permanent hedges ” .
One cannot address any play on wellhead cost alone .
We know that there is a 80 to 100 x differential in play reserves between static D, C, &S costs and $ 7/ MCFG at the wellhead and $ 2.50 / MCFG at the wellhead .
HYPERBOLIC PREDICTIONS OVERESTIMATE
RESERVES - Mr. Berman is absolutely correct here .
This is also usually the case for conventional reserves .
Hyperbolic predictions typically provide a ceiling estimate .
CONCLUSIONS -
As we discovered when we began analyzing the Barnett , analyzing shale plays is like peeling onions .
Once a layer is exposed , another presents itself .
Many factors need to be normalized to really address the economics and behaviors of these plays in a predictive sense .
Good acreage grade alone is not a recipe for success .
Decent acreage grade needs to be combined with strong , holistic drilling , completion , and stimulation practices that are constantly tested for optimization to create a real repeatable recipe for success and large economic reserve accumulation .
Great operations equate to better recoverable resources / reserves for these plays , not more operators or even more wells .
Raw data combines good operations with bad , early parts of the learning curve results with later , and good acreage with bad .
Making forward - looking predictions of behavior from this soup assumes that every bad habit is propagated forward , and that no operator is better than another .
Expanding that conclusion to other plays based on this assumption misses the big picture .
What the Barnett is capable of producing is different from what it is producing now .
How it can be optimized can only be determined by identifying who is optimizing it and by how much .
Conclusions
To me , the jury is still out on whether Berman 's answer is right .
I think the review pointing out that there are likely gains in efficiency between the earliest wells drilled and later wells drilled likely has a point .
But this may be mostly reflected in the cost per well , which is being reflected in costs that are easily measurable , and not in the long - term decline curve .
It is difficult to know what the impact of large amounts of fracing will be on future production .
The TPH review mentions that long term production of tight gas ( such as what I observed at Wamsutter , Wyoming ) .
But this is not really comparable -- it is a different rock structure , and did not receive anywhere near the level of fracking that shale gas resources have .
Also , as the reviewer from Drilling Info says , the hyperbolic decline estimates provide " ceiling estimates " .
So at least that part of the estimate is likely overstated , no matter how much technology improves .
I think it is likely that Berman is fairly close to right , but it would be good to have confirmation from others looking at the question in different ways .
Hopefully , with greater diligence by auditors , there will be some convergence with company indications in the not too distant future .
Natural gas is one substance where there really does seems to be a lot of resource available , if the price is high enough .
But for the price to be high enough , there needs to be a huge amount of debt based financing available , for all of the players involved : the natural gas companies obtaining the land and doing the drilling ; the companies building pipelines and storage ; and the companies building infrastructure for end use ( adapting busses and cars to natural gas use ; building fueling stations ; installing natural gas home heating where oil was previously used ) .
It may turn out that inability to obtain debt financing will be a big obstacle to development .
Natural gas policy is one where one really would like to have good information on how much resource is available at what price .
One also needs to know what costs would be involved in new infrastructure development , and how many years these need to be amortized over to make the infrastructure worthwhile .
There are other issues too -- what should we really be using this resource for -- chemical uses , fertilizer , commercial vehicle fuel , private passenger auto fuel ?
Or should we be saving it for use for balancing electrical power , when the wind is not blowing .
At this point , I do n't think we really know enough to make good decisions .
If cap and trade legislation is passed , it will encourage use of natural gas over coal for electricity generation .
This is yet another possible use for natural gas .
But the amount of natural gas we have is likely to not go very far , if this is the use chosen for it .
If this use is chosen for natural gas , the amount available for use in other areas ( including long - term wind balancing ) is likely to be greatly reduced .
So this decision needs to be considered with other alternatives , and with total natural gas resource availability .
Food Allergies in Kids
On the Rise Allergies in kids are on the rise , but are kids really becoming more allergic ?
Nov. 16 , 2009  --
The number of kids with reported food allergies has increased dramatically over the past two decades , but are kids really becoming more allergic over time ?
Whether these reports reflect more food allergies in kids or just more reporting of kids ' allergies by parents has been a topic of debate .
Now new research from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics offers compelling evidence that this spike in childhood food allergies is for real .
The study provides some of the " missing pieces " in our information on childhood allergies , says Amy Branum , lead author on the study and health statistician for the National Center for Health Statistics .
" Most of the studies ... up to this point have been in small populations and one demographic ... the fact that we are seeing increases in reported prevalence among children of different race and age groups gives more compelling evidence that these increases may be real , " Branum says .
The study confirmed past findings that the prevalence for childhood allergies has increased at least 18 percent since 1993 , and found that the number of visits to a physician , emergency room , or hospital clinic for food allergy - related care has tripled in that time period .
" [ The ] indication that more children are going to their doctors and emergency rooms for food allergies ... gives further evidence that we may be seeing a real rise in food allergy cases among children in the U.S. , " Branum says .
Though the study cannot rule out increased reporting by parents as a contributing factor in this trend , allergists and pediatricians agree that food allergies in kids have become a growing concern .
Pediatric Food Allergies on the Rise
" These reports are solidifying what many pediatric allergists and pediatricians have been seeing since the later 1990's , " says Dr. Harvey Leo , a pediatric allergist and researcher for University of Michigan 's C.S. Mott Children 's Hospital and School of Public Health .
" Definitely there has been an increase in the number of clinic visits for food allergy in the last 20 years , " says Dr. Wesley Burks , chief of the Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at Duke University Medical Center .
" From my contacts in the American Academy of Allergy , Asthma and Immunology , most every practicing allergist has seen this same increase . "
And it 's not only an increase in the number of kids with a food allergy , Burks says .
" We are also seeing a larger number of children with multiple severe allergies and more allergies to foods that years ago would not be common [ such as ] kiwi , sesame seed , [ or ] mustard . "
Dr. Clifford Bassett , medical director of the Allergy and Asthma Care of New York , says " it 's a mini-epidemic for sure . "
A Squeaky Clean Society Spells Immune System Overdrive
What has brought on this mini-epidemic ?
" That is the question that everyone wants to know the answer [ to ] and so far there is only speculation as to why , " says Burks .
One theory is that certain foods , like nuts , may be introduced too early to children , perhaps as nut oils in creams or lotions used on infants , Bassett says .
" Changes in the environment and food processing " is also " thought to play a part , " Burks says .
The leading theory explaining the effects of these environmental changes is called the hygiene hypothesis .
This theory " contends that immune systems become over - reactive in very clean environments , [ like those ] associated with the medicine and hygiene practices [ used today ] , " says Dr. Bill Parker , assistant professor at Duke University Medical Center , and advocate of the hygiene hypothesis .
In these super - clean environments , he says , " the immune system essentially lacks a normal workload ... however , [ it ] does what it is built to do , and finds something to attack , often directing its attention toward such harmless things as pollen grains ... even healthy food . "
But whether it 's exposure to certain foods too early or exposure to germs too late , once a child has an allergy , " the number one treatment is education [ and ] preventing reactions , " Bassett says .
Treatment for the allergy itself may be possible " in the not too distant future " he notes , but for now , it is crucial for parents and children to ask questions , plan ahead , and be what he calls a " label detective " , making sure that allergens are not hiding out in processed foods .
" Every year there are [ more than a ] hundred deaths attributable to food allergy , and a lot of near deaths , " he says .
" People need to take it seriously . "
[ HOLIDAY SHPPING DEADLINES !!!
I ’ll be announcing these soon , but if you want a book ( especially an Artist Edition ) you should probably ORDER IT like right now ]
This origin story may sound familiar , and it may completely contradict the previous origin story for the Evil Fox Executive but hey , whatevs .
So Fox has decided to shelve Dollhouse for November sweeps , and air it 2 eps at a time when it returns in December .
Sounds like they are blowing through their already canned episodes and fulfilling a contractual obligation with Mutant Enemy at the same time .
A few days ago I would have said , “ Meh , go for it .
The show just is n’t resonating with its intended audience .
The stories range from mildly intriguing to flat out boring ( ie “ Not Without My Baby ” starring Echo Dushku ) . ”
Then ( just like last season with 1.12 ″ Omega ” ) they threw a curve ball and showed what was probably the 3rd best episode of the series so far , 2.4 “ Belonging ” .
I ’ve been saying since the beginning that this show sould be Dollhouse : The Adventures of Victor and Sierra .
Last week ’s ep was irrefutable proof to this point .
Sierra ’s origin story was fucking intense .
Just brutal .
There was character development , depth , drama and suspense coming out the yang .
And she and Victor have such fantastic chemistry even in their blank doll states .
I wonder how much of this improvement had to do with Jonathan “ Space Beard ” Frakes being in the director ’s chair ?
Maybe this season can end with Echo being brutally murdered by Alpha then Victor and Sierra can take over for the fictional 3rd season that will only air in my fevered dreams .

Jamait - e - Ulema
Hind or the JEU on Tuesday issued a fatwa against singing national song ' Vande Mataram '. ( Watch Video )
According to a resolution , Muslims should not sing ' Vande Mataram ' as its reciting is against the Islam .
The resolution , which was passed at the Deoband national convention meet , says that Muslims should not sing ' Vande Mataram ' as some verses of the patriotic song are against the tenets of Islam .
The JEU leader said that the some of the line in the song is against Islam .
Meanwhile , home minister P Chidambaram addressed a Jamait - e - Ulema Hind conference in Deoband today .
Meanwhile , the Muslim Law Board justified the decision saying that ( Muslims ) can���t offer prayers to anyone but Allah .
Kamal Farooqui , a prominent leader of the Board said , " We love the nation but can't worship it . "
QnA : Which part of the song offended the Jamait - e - Ulema Hind and what is un-Islamic about it ?
You know what you 'll be doing in 2011 ?
Everything that you 've ever wanted , that 's what , ' cause the world as we know will unquestionably end in 2012 .
Amazingly enough , one of those bucket list items that you 'll be able to achieve is to change the channel on your tele without ever slipping a battery into your remote .
A prototype clicker was recently shown over in Japan utilizing technologies from NEC and Soundpower ; essentially , the remote turns the small vibrations from button presses into power , which it then uses to beam out signals to the nearby set .
If all goes well , the two hope to have battery - less remotes shipping with televisions in just two years -- a proposition that surely exasperate the likes of Duracell and Energizer ( and enraptures us to no end ) .
CPU CRUNCH SHOOTOUT :
iMac Core i7 versus other Macs
Posted Monday , November 16th , 2009 , by rob-ART morgan , mad scientist
Updated , November 19th , 2009 with iMac Core i5 results
We , like many of you , are excited about the new quad - core iMacs .
We ordered the " Core i7 " model and decided to compare it not only to the fastest dual core iMac but also to the quad - core and octo-core ' early 2009 ' Mac Pro ( Nehalem ) .
GRAPH LEGEND
MP 8 core = 8 - core ' early 2009 ' Mac Pro 2.93GHz with 12G of RAM and Radeon HD 4870
MP 4 core = 4 - core ' earl 2009 ' Mac Pro 2.93GHz with 12G of RAM and Radeon HD 4870
i7 iMac = 4 - core ' late 2009 ' iMac 2.8GHz
Core i7 with 8G of RAM and Radeon HD 4850
i5 iMac = 4 - core ' late 2009 ' iMac 2.66
Ghz Core i5 with 8GB of RAM and Radeon HD 4850
c2c iMac = 2 - core ' early 2009 ' iMac 3.06GHz
Core 2 Duo with 8G of RAM and Radeon HD 4850
TEST APPS : Cinebench 10 , Geekbench 2.1.4 , Compressor 3.0.5 , After Effects CS4 .
RED BAR means FASTEST
" Gap Spanner "
The iMac Core i7 ( quad - core ) finally gives us an " all in one " Mac that can " run with the big dogs . "
It is just a few steps behind the 2.93GHz quad - core Mac Pro and significantly faster than the fastest dual - core iMacs -- at least when running " MP aware " software .
With memory expansion up to 16GB , drive options up to 2TB , Radeon HD 4850 graphics , and a 27 " LED display , there is very little else you would want if you are a fan of " all in one . "
Considering the fact that a four - core Mac Pro 2.93GHz with 8GB of RAM , 1TB HDD , Radeon HD 4870 , and 24 " LED Cinema display lists at $ 4448 while the iMac Core i7 2.8GHz with 8GB of RAM , 1TB HDD , Radeon HD 4850 , and 27 " LED display lists at $ 2399 , the four - core iMac is a huge bargain .
What about the Core i5 iMac ?
Based on the four CPU intensive apps featured in the graphs , we believe it 's well worth paying 10 % more for the Core i7 iMac to get 13 % to 30 % more CPU crunching power .
The only " missing piece " in the lastest model of iMac is an external eSATA port .
That would enable owners to take advantage of the speed offered by HDD enclosures with 7K SATA drives capable of 138MB /s and / or Port - Multiplier multi-bay SATA enclosures capable of 230 + MB /s .
I 'm sorry but FireWire 800 at a maximum of 80 MB / s seems lame nowadays .
The Core i7 ( and i5 ) have " Turbo Boost " which increases the core clock speed when only one or two cores are active .
We may have observed that phenom when we ran the single CPU test in Cinebench .
In that scenario , the 2.8GHz Core i7 was 21 % faster than the 3.06GHz Core 2 Duo .
We also are just getting started with testing the Core i5 and i7 iMac , so stay tuned for more fascinating results .
I missed Omar Barghouti ’s debate with George Fletcher at Columbia Thursday night but Roane Carey of the Nation set it up to have coffee with him at a cafe downtown on Friday afternoon and he asked me along .
They were sitting at a back table , and a half dozen others were crammed in to listen to Barghouti , who wore a red jersey and sat with his back to the wall .
I recognized him at once as an international activist in a classic mold .
He wore glasses and his posture was very erect , he might have been running a marathon .
His hair was cut short on his large head .
He is in his mid-40s but seems younger .
He has a slightly beaklike nose and spoke in forceful long - considered paragraphs that he had surely said before .
Around us was the glittering hubbub of downtown New York , attractive young people slouching onto couches or playing idly with their computers , but Barghouti was focused on one thing , the international campaign of boycott , divestment and sanctions .
When I was at J Street the week before I saw a number of people who had demurred at the prospect of debating Barghouti , and now I understood why .
What kind of argument can you make against such a calm and forceful intellectual / activist , who knows the issue backwards and forwards , and is himself a second - class citizen ?
I had heard that he had polished off Fletcher the night before without much argument .
Barghouti said that the debate was a farce .
" I might have been talking to myself . "
An earlier debate had gone the same way .
The hardcore Zionists are not coming forward .
The mood in the U.S. has changed .
The main question from the audience was not whether to boycott Israel , it how to do so .
" The Zionist lobby " is showing signs of weakness .
“ I ’m very optimistic .
On this tour , for the first time I did not meet any — how should I put it diplomatically — I did not meet any reasonable Zionist position . ”
No the Zionists were hunkered down , talking among themselves .
Barghouti told stories meant to inspire .
He said that Naomi Klein after touring the West Bank had been so devastated that she needed to delay her Ramallah speech , she needed to sit quietly for a half hour to deal with what she had seen .
And that was before she went to Gaza .
Later Klein spoke in Haifa , in a Palestinian space , and even Israeli Jews were cheering her .
In the middle of the speech Ilan Pappe texted Barghouti , " you would not believe what is happening here . "
Some of these Jews want to save Israel .
Many American
Jews feel the same way .
Israel is on a " fascist " path , Barghouti says , and BDS is all that will steer her back .
I believe that some Jews at J Street secretly share some of this understanding , and in addition to their being intimidated , that may be why Barghouti did n’t get a debating partner from their ranks .
Many J Street Jews secretly would support a targeted boycott against products of the West Bank .
Barghouti says that is a compromise of traditional boycott principle ( you do n’t just boycott what China produces in Tibet , you go after China for occupying Tibet ) , but he does n’t care about allies ’ motivations or their half - measures .
" You can just boycott Israeli eggs and we ’re happy . "
In Stockholm when the city railroad contract was up with Veolia , which had contracted to build the West Bank colonists ’ railway , thousands of Swedes wore BDS buttons and the Church of Sweden supported an end to Veolia in Stockholm , and the government in signing another company said it was about price but it was n’t , Barghouti said , they did n’t want the headache of a company complicit in the occupation .
Gaza has accelerated the BDS campaign , but the urgency of the campaign is also growing .
" The cancer rate in Gaza is skyrocketing . "
What a coup it was to get Jane Fonda and Danny Glover ’s signature on the Toronto Declaration that used the word " apartheid . "
Yes there has been terrible pressure on Fonda from funders of her own nonprofit in Atlanta , but she did not remove her name .
Barghouti could not stay long .
He had another appointment .
His colleague Riham Barghouti kept telephoning ahead to say they would be an extra ten minutes .
The impression I carried away was a simple one .
You do n’t often meet such committed and articulate people .
Barghouti personifies the idea that Ali Abunimah and Nadia Hijab have both expressed : BDS is essential because it is the most powerful weapon Palestinians have in seeking to fashion their destiny .
I ’m stunned , too , by the fact that Barghouti has gotten so little media coverage here .
As another friend told me , Barghouti is the future .
He is intelligent , empowered and non-violent .
He is completely impressive .
It would help Americans to see such a picture of Palestinian political engagement , when they have such a distorted image of who Palestinians are .
Some day they will know him .

Nokia definitely has the most interesting concept phones .
Nokia 888 Communicator is a striking futuristic concept phone .
The phone , which uses liquid batteries , speech recognition , flexible touchscreen and touch - sensitive body cover , is designed by Tamer Nakisci and won the Nokia Design Award .
Plenty of people have switched from their home phones to cell phones , as they are the new revolution and most evolving technology .
Mobile applications can help mobilize and increase productivity for your business or organization .
Nokia Aeon
Nokia Aeon was presented by Nokia on their website in the Research & Development section .
What is so great about this phone is that it looks like it will actually go into production next February .
Of course , its just a rumor , but still , makes us hope to actually see it someday in the GSM shop .
All we know about it for now is that its a touchscreen phone and it looks fantastic .
Benq - Siemes “ Snaked ”
Benq designers thought of women too and presented Snaked .
This is a “ reptile ” looking phone , creepy somehow , but still is very cool .
The Snaked is a fashion phone for sport loving women , because it also has body monitoring sensors to help the ladies keep those fine shapes .
What You See is What You Get Concept
One thing is for sure about this concept phone , they could ’ve named it shorter .
Designed by Pei-Hua Hang , the phone ’s name comes from the fact that this concept no longer uses an LCD as viewfinder for the digital camera , instead it uses a transparent frame .
And of course , interaction is made through a touchscreen .
Retroxis By Dark Label
If most phones presented here will never be sold in store for sure , the Retroxis concept phone from Dark Label looks kinda human , and makes us hope we ’ll be able to get one of these one day .
Designed by Lim Sze
Tat the phone is encased in high polished polycarbonate renowned for its lightweight and toughness and has an invisible OLED display that silently hides away when inactive .
Benq - Siemens “ The Blackbox ”
Black Box designed by Benq - Siemens uses a touch screen as its keypad and , depending on the functions you are using , the touch screen changes the control layout immediately .
NEC Tag
Somehow similar to the Snaked concept , the NEC Tag is a flexible phone concept that can be , for example , hung from a belt or wrapped around the user ’s arm .
Interesting is that the phone has shape - memorizing material and sensors that allows the phone to change its shape according to the mode .
TripleWatch
Though the idea of a cellphone watch is not so new , the TripleWatch designed by Manon Maneenawa has an interesting triple flip technique that allows the user to transform the watch into a normal cellphone .
When used as a wrist watch , the phone has a speaker button that allows the user to answer the phone and hang up while driving .

What would Frank Costanza say if he saw us now ?
What would he say about Festivus poles , wines , and cards ?
What would he say about concert promoters using the name to sell tickets ?
What would he say about Festivus soft - news stories which have become a December staple for editors desperate to move their product off of newsstands ?
( Adhering to its “ if we have n’t written about it in 10 months it counts as ‘ news ' ” principle , the Washington Post composed Festivus stories in 2006 ( two of them ) , 2007 , 2008 , and 2009 . )
On that fateful day Frank Costanza ’s blows rained down on his fellow toy store patron this is not the “ better way ” he had in mind .
If we stay on our current path Ryan Seacrest will soon be hosting a two hour “ Fox Festivus Extravaganza ” featuring performances by the cast of Glee , Nickleback , and the runner up of So You Think You Can Dance .
It ’s time to stop the commercialization of Festivus .
November 9 , 2009 --
Of the many characteristic traits a drug can have , one of the most desirable is the ability for a drug to be swallowed and absorbed into the bloodstream through the gut .
Some drugs , like over - the - counter aspirin , lend themselves to this mode of delivery and are trivial to take .
They can be pressed into a pill and swallowed .
Other drugs cannot be swallowed and must be administered instead through more complicated routes .
Insulin , for instance , must be injected .
The reason why insulin and many other drugs cannot be swallowed is that they cannot survive the trip through the digestive tract -- wherein they are first plunged into the acid bath of the stomach and then passed into the intestines , which are filled with enzymes designed to break down molecules like insulin .
Aspirin does fine in the gut because its active ingredient is a small chemical that does n't get broken down .
But insulin is quickly degraded .
Tejal A. Desai ( University of California , San Francisco ) is looking at ways to enhance the " oral availability " of drugs by designing new delivery devices that will help their absorption in the gut , which she will present on November 12 at a meeting of the scientific society AVS in San Jose .
Working with a Bay - area biotechnology company , she is making devices that are sort of like spiny beads filled with drugs .
The spines on these beads are silicon nanowires designed to form an adhesive interface with the tiny , hair - like cilia that cover the cells lining the gut .
They are designed to stick like burrs to the cells lining the gut and slowly release their drugs there .
Localized in one spot , the drugs have a better chance of diffusing into the bloodstream .
Desai is currently fine - tuning the geometry of the nanowires in order to optimize their adhesion .
Her laboratory has done a number of toxicity studies with the beads , and their plan next is to look at how effectively they can deliver proteins , peptides , and other macromolecules that are not usually taken orally .
One of the advantages of this approach , Desai says , is that it may be applicable for delivering drugs to other part of the body as well , such as mucosal tissues like the insides of the nose , lungs , or vagina , where the surface cells are also coated with such cilia .

The home secretary says Prof Nutt was wrong on cannabis dangers
The Home Secretary has agreed a number of concessions to his drugs advisers after several walked out .
Alan Johnson has now pledged to write to members of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to explain any decisions that go against their advice .
He also said he would not pre-judge decisions on drug classification ahead of the committee issuing advice .
Five advisers have now resigned over Prof David Nutt 's dismissal for " crossing a line " into politics .
The concessions were agreed between the Home Office and the Advisory Council ( ACMD ) on Tuesday , but announced on Wednesday .
Following the meeting three more council members announced their resignations .
One of the advisers - Dr Simon Campbell - said he had stepped down because decisions on drugs were being made on political rather than scientific grounds .
The new protocol , thrashed out at talks between the Home Office and ACMD also included an agreement by Mr Johnson to give " careful consideration " to all future advisory council reports .
' Careful consideration '
From now on , advice will be made public at the same time as the Home Office receives it .
It is hoped this will avoid quick - fire , pre-prepared government statements being released .
Mr Johnson has also agreed to meet with the ACMD chairman before making a final decision if he thinks in advance he reject the council 's advice .
Earlier , Dr Campbell told the BBC home secretaries would listen to scientific advice - but had usually already made their decisions .
He said : " When we made our recommendation on cannabis we saw no reason to change the classification and yet the government has already decided to move from Class C to Class B . "
" That can only be because the government saw it as a vote - catching exercise . "
The Home Office has confirmed the ACMD , which is down to 25 members , must have at least 20 members to function , and that six key positions must be filled for the advisory group to function .
Prof Nutt was sacked last month after calling cannabis less harmful than alcohol and nicotine , and saying it had been upgraded to Class B for political reasons .

“ The same idea , if it ’s born in Silicon Valley it goes the distance , ” said Nadathur S. Raghavan , a investor in start - ups and a founder of Infosys , one of India ’s most successful technology companies .
“ If it ’s born in India it does not go the distance . ”
Mr. Raghavan and others say India is held back by a financial system that is reluctant to invest in unproven ideas , an education system that emphasizes rote learning over problem solving , and a culture that looks down on failure and unconventional career choices .
Sujai Karampuri is an Indian entrepreneur who has struggled against many of these constraints .
His Bangalore - based company , Sloka Telecom , has developed award - winning radio systems that are more flexible , smaller and less expensive than equipment used by phone companies today .
Mobile phone companies and larger telecommunications equipment suppliers are buying and testing his products , but he has not been able to interest Indian venture capitalists .
For the last five years he has run his firm on $ 1 million he raised from acquaintances .
“ I can only afford to trial with one customer at a time and that takes three months to materialize , ” said Mr. Karampuri , who has considered moving the company to the United States to be closer to venture capitalists who specialize in telecommunications .
“ You are always worried about paying next month ’s salary to people .
Should you keep the money for this trial or next month ’s salary ? ”

Companies like Sloka Telecom are important , analysts say , because they are more likely to create the next wave of jobs than large , established Indian technology companies , many of which are experiencing slower growth .
These companies could also help offset some of the outsourcing jobs the country will likely lose because of greater automation and competition from countries where costs are even lower .
After Joe released memprof a few days ago , I started thinking about ways to add more functionality .
The initial Memprof release only offered a simple stats api , inspired by the one in bleak_house :
require ' memprof ' Memprof.start o = Object.new Memprof.stats
1 test.rb:3: Object
With the help of lloyd ‘s excellent yajl json library , I ’ve slowly been building a full - featured heap dumper : Memprof.dump .
require ' memprof ' Memprof.start [ ]
Memprof.dump
[ { " address " : " 0xea52f0 " , " source " : " test.rb:3 " , " type " : " array " , " length " : 0 } ]
Where can I find it ?
This new heap dumper will be in the next release of Memprof .
If you want to play with it , checkout the heap_dump branch on github .
What else is planned ?
Over the next few days , I ’m going to add a Memprof. dump_all method to dump out the entire ruby heap .
This full dump will contain complete knowledge of the ruby object graph ( what objects point to other objects ) , and its json format will allow for easy analysis .
I ’m envisioning a set of post - processing tools that can find leaks , calculate object memory usage , and generate various visualizations of memory consumption and object hierarchies .
Why should I care ?
In building and testing Memprof.dump , I ’ve learned a lot about different types of ruby objects .
The rest of this post covers interesting details about common ruby objects , with examples of how they ’re created and what they look like inside the MRI VM .
Objects and Floats
o = Object.new o.instance_variable_set(:@pi , 3+0.14159 )
{ " address " : " 0x1823dd8 " , " source " : " test.rb:3 " , " type " : " object " , " class " : " 0x1854b38 " , " class_name " : " Object " , " ivars " : { " @pi " : " 0x1823da0 " } }
This ruby object points to its class ( Object 0x1854b38 ) and has some instance variables - here , there ’s only one variable named @pi that points to another object at 0x1823da0 .
The address 0x1823da0 belongs to a float object - this float was created on the heap when MRI executed the code 3 + 0.14159 .
{ " address " : " 0x1823da0 " , " source " : " test.rb : 4 " , " type " : " float " , " data " : 3.14159 }
The float 0.14159 used in the addition also lives on the heap , but it is created upfront once when the ruby source is parsed .
Strings
Unlike floats , new string objects are created every time ruby encounters a string in its execution path .
1.times {" abc "}
{ " type " : " string " , " shared " : " 0x15136a0 " , " flags " : [ " elts_shared " ] }
This newly created string object has no character data associated with it ; instead , it is marked elts_shared and points to 0x15136a0 .
In this case , 0x15136a0 is another string object - one that holds the actual data “ abc ” and was created earlier when the ruby source was parsed .
Arrays and Fixnums
[ 1,2,3 , " hello " ]
{ " type " : " array " , " length " : 4 , " data " : [ 1 , 2 , 3 , " 0x12aa0c0 " ] }
The fixnums 1 , 2 and 3 in the array are immediates , so they live in the array itself and do not occupy slots on the ruby heap .
The fourth member is the string object “ hello ” that lives at 0x12aa0c0 .
Hashes and Symbols
{:a= > 1 , " b " =>:c}
{ " type " : " hash " , " length " : 2 , " default " : null , " data " : { " 0xd13378 " : " : c " , " : a " : 1 } }
The symbols :a and :c are also immediates , so they live directly inside the hash ’s data table .
The key for “ b ” is a pointer to that string object at 0xd13378 .
Blocks and Data
Hashes can also be created with a default block .
Hash.new{|h , k| h[k ] = k ; h }
{ " type " : " hash " , " length " : 0 , " default " : " 0xcca208 " } , { " address " : " 0xcca208 " , " type " : " data " , " class " : " 0xcced80 " , " class_name " : " Proc " }
In this case , the block is converted to a new Proc data object that holds a reference to an internal struct BLOCK .
The new hash ’s default field points to the address of the Proc .
Data objects are commonly created by C extensions to point to external memory that needs to be marked and freed using ruby ’s garbage collector .
Classes
A simple class definition creates many objects on the heap .
class MyClass ; end
First is the class itself , along with the class ’s string representation ( pointed to by an internal ivar __classpath__ ) .
Notice the class object holds a reference to its superclass .
{ " address " : " 0x29f3228 " , " type " : " class " , " name " : " MyClass " , " super " : " 0x2a23b28 " , " super_name " : " Object " , " ivars " : { " __classpath__ " : " 0x29f31b8 " } } , { " address " : " 0x29f31b8 " , " type " : " string " , " length " : 7 , " data " : " MyClass " , }
The class definition also creates two more objects - an internal CREF node , and another singleton class with no name that is __attached__ to MyClass .
{ " type " : " node " , " node_type " : " CREF " , } , { " type " : " class " , " name " : null , " super " : " 0x2a23a80 " , " super_name " : null , " singleton " : true , " ivars " : { " __attached__ " : " 0x29f3228 " } }
This singleton is MyClass ‘s metaclass , where singleton methods and instance variables are added .
MyClass.instance_variable_set(:@a , 123 )
{ " type " : " class " , " name " : null , " singleton " : true , " ivars " : { " __attached__ " : " 0x29f3228 " , " @a " : 123 } }
Constants , Class and Instance Variables
Classes store both constants and class variables along with the instance variables .
class MyClass A=1 @@b=2 @c=3 end
{ " type " : " class " , " name " : " MyClass " , " ivars " : { " @@b " : 2 , " A " : 1 , " @c " : 3 } }
Methods
Methods are stored in a separate method table and represented by METHOD node objects which hold the method body .
class MyClass def d( ) end end
{ " type " : " class " , " name " : " MyClass " , " methods " : { " d " : " 0xb7ec30 " } } , { " address " : " 0xb7ec30 " , " type " : " node " , " node_type " : " METHOD " , }
Method Invocation
def test ( ) a=1 b= :b c='c' Memprof.dump end test ( )
{ " type " : " scope " , " node " : " 0xa9bdd0 " , " variables " : { " _ " : null , " ~ " : null , " a " : 1 , " b " : " : b " , " c " : " 0xb60 ce8 " } }
During method invocation , a new scope object is created on the heap .
This scope points to the node object representing the method body , and has a list of all local variables .
The local variables include the perl - style ruby magic variables $ _ and $ ~ .
Modules and IClasses
Modules in ruby are similar to classes and have the same associated strings and CREF nodes created with them .
module MyModule ; end
{ " address " : " 0xe82248 " , " type " : " module " , " name " : " MyModule " , " super " : false , " ivars " : { " __classpath__ " : " 0x208eda8 " , " __classid__ " : " : MyModule " } }
When a module is included into a class , an extra iclass object is created :
class MyClass include MyModule end
{ " address " : " 0x208ecc8 " , " source " : " - e:1 " , " type " : " iclass " , " super " : " 0x20 bfb40 " , " super_name " : " Object " , " ivars " : { " __classpath__ " : " 0x208eda8 " , " __classid__ " : " : MyModule " } }
This new iclass points to MyClass ‘s old superclass , and shares its instance variable and method tables with MyModule .
Once created , this iclass becomes MyClass ‘s new superclass .
{ " type " : " class " , " name " : " MyClass " , " super " : " 0x208ecc8 " , " super_name " : " MyModule " , }
and more ..
Ruby has various other internal object types , including Regexps , Matches , Bignums , Structs , Files , Varmaps , and almost 130 different types of Nodes .
Memprof will eventually be able to dump out all these objects in individual detail .
Is being a Jew a matter of bloodline or religious practice ?
The UK's new Supreme Court is debating the subject this week , in a case that could have a wider impact on faith schools , says Tim Whewell .
In a draughty school hall in Liverpool , they 're holding an " admissions evening " .
Parents listen anxiously as the headteacher explains what " evidence " they 'll require to ensure that their son or daughter can apply for a place .
Is Jewishness about nature or nurture ?
The scene at King David primary is repeated up and down the country , particularly at this time of year as the deadline for applications approaches .
And for those trying to get into a faith school like King David , there 's a particular headache : do parents have to " prove " an adequate level of religious observance ?
This week that question will be debated by some of The UK 's top legal brains at the highest court in the land , the new UK Supreme Court .
The outcome will directly affect only Jewish schools such as King David .
But the government is warning that it may have " wide ramifications " for other faith schools too .
And at the heart of the case is the simple question : how do you define faith ?
Is religion a matter of who you are ?
What you believe ?
Or what you do ?
The King David primary and secondary schools , both highly successful and oversubscribed , are the pride of Liverpool 's diminishing but vibrant Jewish community .
FIND OUT MORE ... Being Jewish : Blood or Belief ? is on Radio 4 on Monday 26 October at 2000 GMT and Tim Whewell 's film will be on Newsnight on Monday at 2230 GMT on BBC Two Or listen again via the BBC iPlayer
In the religious studies class this month , children were making models - some thatched with sweets - of the flimsy huts that Jews traditionally build as part of the festival of Sukkot .
It commemorates the years the Children of Israel spent wandering in the desert , without permanent homes , after the Exodus from Egypt .
Some of the children come from observant homes , but some do not .
Until now , that did n't matter because , in common with other schools under the religious authority of the Chief Rabbi , they 've taken Jewish children as defined by Orthodox Jewish law - the children of Jewish mothers .
No test of observance or belief was set .
" Judaism differs fundamentally from all other faiths , " says Yitzchak Schochet , rabbi of an Orthodox congregration in London .
" Regardless of one 's observance level , if one is born a Jew it does n't matter if they keep absolutely nothing .
How dare they question our beliefs and our Jewishness ?
David Lightman
" Having a ham sandwich on the afternoon of Yom Kippur , the fast day , does n't de facto make you non-Jewish .
The Jewish definition is that as far as God is concerned , when you are born of a Jewish mother then you contain a unique Jewish soul , which de facto makes you a Jew .
And the only other way of embracing the Jewish faith is by way of conversion . "
But that definition can't now be used to gain a place at a Jewish school .
The Court of Appeal ruled in July that because Jews are also defined as an ethnic group under the Race Relations Act , denying a child admission solely on the basis that their mother is n't Jewish would count as unlawful racial discrimination .
It was a victory for the parents who brought the case , whose child was originally denied admission to a Jewish comprehensive in London , the JFS or Jewish free school , because the Chief Rabbi 's office questioned his mother 's Jewish status .
' God is not racist '
And another parent in a similar position , David Lightman , also feels vindicated .
He says : " My wife keeps a kosher Jewish home , we go to synagogue as a family , my daughter teaches in the Hebrew classes .
How dare they question our beliefs and our Jewishness ? "
But now JFS is appealing to the Supreme Court to have that judgment overturned .
Rabbi Schochet says : " The law is essentially suggesting from a Jewish perspective that God is a racist , and that does n't wash . "
Some Catholic schools insist on baptism
Some would dispute whether the ruling really libels God .
And even within the Jewish community , there are those who say religion can't just be a matter of parentage .
At the liberal synagogue in Elstree , north London , Rabbi Pete Tobias says : " I would say the idea that it 's God that decrees the status of a child simply on the basis of a child 's mother is somehow missing the point of what religion is supposed to be about .
To me Judaism is a faith , a series of ideas , a philosophy that is absorbed culturally and educationally . "
But Jews are n't the only faith group in Britain who can be difficult to define legally .
And that 's why the government says in its submissions to the Supreme Court that the current ruling , if upheld " potentially affects a significant number of schools " .
" At least in certain areas , " it says , " it is likely that membership of other religions is ' closely related ' to particular ethnic origins . "
' A better Catholic '
Then there 's the question of what constitutes " membership " of a religion .
For Catholics , for example , baptism is usually the mark of membership and in some Catholic dioceses baptism , regardless of observance , is the main criterion for admission to Catholic schools .
Some Jews say their religion is not simply about parentage John Waszek , headmaster of St Edward 's College , a leading Catholic state secondary in Liverpool , says : " For some parents involvement in church is difficult - a single mum will find it harder to be involved in their church rather than a two parent family with two jobs .
" Someone who runs a football club - taking those children off the streets - who 's to say they are not being a better Catholic that someone who goes to church every day of the week ? "
But some lawyers say baptism , usually performed when a child is just a few weeks old , is n't proof of the parents ' current faith and therefore may be too broad a definition to be legal as a schools admissions criterion .
For now , Catholic leaders reject that possibility .
The government , after all , says that it's for the faith provider - in this case the Church - to decide the religious rules for admission to its own schools , even if they 're state - funded .
But the Court of Appeal has now shown that faith providers can only act within certain limits , and it's possible that if the Supreme Court upholds the ruling , other challenges to admissions criteria could follow .
Faiths are free to define themselves .
They 're not free to decide who gets into schools .
Below is a selection of your comments .
In the Bible it says repeatedly that regularly going to church is an important part of being a Christian .
There are exceptions both ways though - you can be a Christian , but living in an area where meeting together in a large group could bring persecution , and going to church does n't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car .
Your faith is something determined between yourself and God , but going to Church is an important demonstration of faith
Nathan Harper , Portsmouth , UK I 'm always confused by how any child can be a member of a religion .
Their parents having them dunked in some water when they were a few weeks old , or their mother being allegedly descended from some guy thousands of years ago seem strange criteria for anyone to use .
Surely no child can be a member of a religion , in the same way as they can't join a political party or have a credit card , until they 're old enough to be able to assess all the options and make a decision for themselves ?
James Rigby , Wickford , Essex Under British law Jews and Sikhs are considered a race and are covered by racial discrimination law , unlike Christians , Muslims etc .
As far as the Law Lords are concerned being Jewish is a matter of birth not faith .
Its worth highlighting that Hitler considered Jews a race too and even if your family had n't been near a synagogue in generations you would still be exterminated .
Peter , Notts
God most certainly is not a racist .
God does not discriminate for against any particular group of people .
To claim that one race or another are God 's chosen people is intellectually , spiritually morally bankrupt .
David Preston , Bournemouth
Is n't it about time we had a serious look at ' faith schools ' and their place in our society ?
The separation of children based on what their parents believe leads to nothing but ignorant , segregated kids harbouring their differences rather than celebrating their similarities .
Should n't children be free to grow up and make their own mind up about issues to do with faith ?
Lucy Clark , Glasgow Some of us ( me included ) would say that a child has no religion .
There is no such thing as a Christian or Jewish or Muslim child , only a child of Christian or Jewish or Muslim parents .
Where would this leave faith schools ?
Nowhere , I 'd be happy to see them all turned over to state control and absorbed into the rest of the school structure tomorrow , their doors open to all children no matter what faith their parents were .
Ponder , London Employers are quite rightly not able to discriminate on the basis of religious belief .
Why should a school be able to do so : especially one that takes state funding ?
Rhodri Richards , London , UK
The fact that faith - based schools ( especially Church of England schools ) are oversubscribed is itself interesting : even non-practising parents see benefit in a faith - based organisation .
Why ?
Because a basis of faith - whatever faith - entails a value set , a discipline and a high standard that is otherwise lacking in our society .
And there is always the hope that a child attending such a school might make up his or her own mind to become a practising member of that faith - and that would make the world a better place .

Myth No. 2 : It is a weak state that is the problem .
A central tenet in the current debate is that centralism is good and fragmentation is bad .
The entire focus has been on presidential politics and on how to create a strong central state .
Our study shows , however , that in Afghanistan , with its rugged terrain , strong tribal affinities and extreme poverty , it is localism that will defeat poverty and corruption and knit a nation together .
More than 19 million people have participated in a community planning and budgeting process to decide how to best use government grants of around $ 30,000 per village .
In a community in Kabul Province that was layered with 12,000 land mines , without a single standing building in 2002 , the men decided to invest funds in reviving irrigation canals , and the women in electricity generators .
Men in the village told us that animosities between the Tajiks and the Pashtuns had eroded as a result of the collective budgeting negotiations .
No central agency in Kabul can ever know the priority needs of people in every Afghan village .
Unity can not be delivered from the top .
But when local leaders , engaged in the nitty - gritty of local policymaking , practice fairness and inclusion , the people follow .
A weak state can not be made strong overnight .
But it can set up the systems that catalyze strong local communities .
Myth No. 3 : The Taliban is thriving because of its religious appeal .
How can the West and President Hamid Karzai compete with God ?
The reality is that most Afghans have the same concerns as people everywhere :
They just want to get on with their lives .
The appeal of the Taliban is less other - worldly and more propelled by practical motivations .
When our research teams visited poppy - growing communities near Jalalabad , nobody expressed love for the Taliban and no one mentioned God .
Rather , local farmers , their lands devastated and their options few , developed a silent partnership with the Taliban to grow poppy .
The Taliban provided protection and the connection to the drug dealers who came to the farmers , paid cash and provided credit — that silver bullet of life in the developing world .
The only other job that paid as much was joining the Taliban .
The Taliban succeed by offering what the state should provide , but does n’t .
There is hope in Afghanistan .
The strength of a weak state lies in its communities .
This strength needs to be the cornerstone of a strategy for peace — helping Afghanis take the lead in building accountability and legitimacy from the bottom up , even as corruption and chaos prevail at the top , for a while .

Soc Electron localization functions show the increasing probability of finding bonding electron pairs between metals and CN– ligands ; Cu(CN ) 2 – is mostly ionic , whereas Au( CN ) 2 – is mostly covalent .
Text Size A A
Experimental evidence has confirmed earlier computational studies showing that the Au–C bonds in Au( CN ) 2 – have significant covalent character , in contrast to the ionic behavior of gold 's lighter homologs copper and silver .
The research , led by Lai -Sheng Wang of Brown University in collaboration with Jun Li of China 's Tsinghua University , provides new insight into bonding interactions involving heavier metals and could lead to a better understanding of the recently discovered catalytic properties of gold ( J. Am. Chem . Soc. 2009 , 131 , 16368 ) .
The chemists used gas - phase photoelectron spectroscopy along with theoretical calculations to probe the electronic structure and determine the electron density in M ( CN ) 2 – for M = Cu , Ag , or Au .
They found that the molecular orbitals of the complexes are similar but that the electronic structures are strikingly different , ranging from copper with mostly ionic character to gold with multiple - bond covalent character .
The results indicate that hybridization of s and d orbitals and an increase in electron affinity drive gold to form covalent bonds .
Those properties lead to the high stability of Au( CN ) 2 – , which has been used since ancient times to extract and process gold .
" Most of the world 's gold production and electrolytic gilding is done using gold cyanide , " says computational chemist Pekka Pyykö of the University of Helsinki , who has studied multiple - bond character in Au–C bonds .
" But it is only now that we have the first thorough study of the complex in the pure gaseous state .
It ’s a nice piece of work . "

UPPSALA , Sweden ( Reuters ) - Sweden ’s Lutheran church decided on Thursday to conduct gay weddings in the Nordic country from next month .
“ We are the first major church to do this , ” said Kristina Grenholm , the church ’s director of theology .
The decision came after the Swedish parliament earlier this year passed legislation allowing homosexuals to legally marry , changing a previous law permitting legal unions but not formal marriage .
“ For my part , the right decision was taken , but I can empathise with the many who believe this has gone too fast , ” Archbishop of Sweden Anders Wejryd told a news conference .
The church said in a statement it would begin wedding same - sex couples on Nov. 1 .
Sweden ’s Lutheran church , which split from the state in 2000 but remains the country ’s largest religious community , had previously said it was open to registering same - sex unions but wanted to reserve the term matrimony for heterosexual marriages .
The new legislation , which came into force on May 1 , eliminated legal distinctions between heterosexual and homosexual spouses , but does not force dissenting clergy to wed gay couples .
A church official said individual priests would still not be required to perform gay marriages .
However , local churches would have to ensure that they could wed same - sex couples , if necessary bringing in an outside priest to perform the ceremony .
Some within the church have opposed introducing gay marriage , saying it contravenes scripture .
Half of Swedish couples get married in church , though regular church attendance is very low .
It 's hard to think of a single good reason for Palm to implement iTunes syncing in webOS by spoofing the iPod , and then to play this cat - and - mouse game of hacks and workarounds with Apple .
Palm 's actions makes it seem like there are no other ways for a device to interact with iTunes , and the company 's outraged response to Apple blocking the Pre make it seem like Apple is wrong for forbidding non-iPod devices from masquerading as iPods .
But that 's simply not reality , and it's not fair to Palm 's customers to have to sit through a proxy war with devices that may or may not work tomorrow because Palm refuses to do what so many other companies have managed to do and simply integrate with iTunes properly .
That 's right -- integrate with iTunes .
Although conventional wisdom would have you believe that Apple 's hell - bent on forcing the iTunes - iPod - iPhone ecosystem down your throat , it 's really quite easy to use all kinds of other software and hardware with iTunes .
Seriously .
For example , I use a piece of software called Connect360 almost daily , which instantly makes all my iTunes playlists and media available to my Xbox 360 over the local network .
Funny how Apple has n't blocked that in the three years it 's been out .
I also routinely use Serato Scratch Live , which allows me to DJ directly from my iTunes library and playlists within its interface without having to do anything except check a box -- Traktor Pro does the same thing .
As for devices , Salling Media Sync and BlackBerry Media Sync both sync music from iTunes to my array of portables without any fuss -- or endless petty bickering with Apple .
Sure , there are some interesting antitrust questions that arise anytime any single company dominates a market as thoroughly as Apple dominates digital music , but the primary consideration is whether or not two products are wrongfully tied together , and it's hard to make that case for iTunes -- for the most part the music is DRM - free and the library is straight folders and XML files , so there 's nothing keeping anyone out or forcing you to use an iPod .
I 'm not saying we should n't scrutinize Apple 's actions closely --
Steve and the gang certainly manage to do a lot of things seriously wrong -- but when it comes to syncing devices and software with iTunes there 's almost nothing to even consider , since it 's so easy .
Apple 's sure as hell competing with Palm , and engineering a crucial feature to be wholly reliant on Cupertino 's goodwill when vastly better options exist simply does n't make sense .
appears
But that 's not how Palm sees it , for some reason , and the more I think about it the more it seems like it 's purely a publicity stunt .
Why else would Palm use its limited resources to fight this battle and deliver an inconsistent experience for its customers when it could just code a proper sync client for the Pre instead ?
Why not license excellent software like The Missing Sync or DoubleTwist instead of paying lawyers and PR people to wring their hands on Twitter and in legal documents ?
It 's totally mysterious .
Roger McNamee might swear up and down that Palm 's not competing with Apple , but Apple 's sure as hell competing with Palm , and engineering a crucial feature to be wholly reliant on Cupertino 's goodwill when vastly better options exist simply does n't make sense .
Yes , it would be nice if Apple made it even easier for third - party devices to sync with iTunes -- it does n't make me totally comfortable that the world 's largest music retailer has created a system thatto be completely closed to the average consumer , even if it 's not .
Before the iPod existed iTunes actually directly supported a small list of third - party players , and while no one expects Apple to expend resources on supporting non-iPod devices , I 'd love to see the company acknowledge the wide variety of devices that can sync with iTunes using additional software -- " You can use your BlackBerry or Pre with iTunes , but the best experience is on an iPhone " is a pretty reasonable message to send , and it would go a long way towards softening the proprietary image that persists even though the store is now DRM - free .
I 'm not holding my breath , though -- and considering the amount of ex-Apple talent at Palm that 's more than capable of building a top - notch iTunes sync client , I do n't think Palm 's customers should be forced to wait either .
Warning !
Professor Bowles ’s lecture was rich in economic jargon , and I ’m not an economist .
And it had an unusally high idea density .
It ’s quite possible that I missed large swaths of what he was saying and misinterpreted what he did say .
If something here seems obviously wrong , please use the comments section to gently correct me .
Yochai Benkler introduces Samuel Bowles of the Santa Fe Institute as his “ intellectual hero ” referencing his ability to apply a completely different set of intellectual tools to problems , switching tactics each decade .
The target of Professor Bowles ’s thought is “ the weightless economy ” , and his talk is titled , “ Kudunomics – Property rights for the information - based economy ” .
The big idea behind Bowles ’s recent research is that some of the fundamental laws of economics – notably Adam Smith ’s invisible hand , may not work in the “ weightless economy – the economy that ca n’t be weighed , fenced , or conveniently contracted for . ”
Rather than being based on material wealth , knowledge - based economies are based on embodied and relational wealth .
In these economies , individual - posession based property rights are difficult to enforce , and socially harmful to enforce .
Bowles suggests that we may gain some insight about the evolution of institutions under these conditions by studying the reverse transition : by studying the transition from the late Plioscene forager economy , where weath was difficult to own , to agrarian and industrial economies , based on ownership .
We can study this by “ running history backwards ” with an agent - based model of the weightless economy .
We understand the forager economy fairly well due to ethnographic research , and we might gain insights about the governance of this emergent weightless economy from studying governance dynamics in forager economies .
Bowles offers a model of wealth where the wealth of a person is the sum of network wealth , embodied wealth and material wealth .
He puts exponential weights on these types of wealth in a Cobb - Douglas production function .
He plots different types of economies in a triangular graph , showing their wealth in terms of these three different dynamics – material , network and embodied wealth .
Recent economies based on the domestication of plants and animals concentrate in the material corner , while older economies cluster around the network wealth – embodied wealth axis .
Network wealth is the contribution made by your social connections to your well - being .
This could be measured by your number of connections , or by your centrality in different networks .
A simple way to think about this is the number of people who will share food with you .
Embodied wealth is a combination of what you know and how strong you are .
It measures factors like hunting prowess and grip strength .
Bowles asserts that we ’re moving from a history where network and embodied wealth mattered more that material wealth – we briefly ( for about eight thousand years ) moved into a world of embodied wealth , and now we ’re moving back .
Smith ’s invisible hand theorem suggests that “ good fences make good neighbors ” .
Smith ’s complete markets have certain characteristics :
– The effects of the actions of economic actors take the form of contractual exchanges .
– The cost of contract enforcement is low and handled by a third party .
– Increasing returns to scale are absent and small .
This is important because it maintains competition .
Under these assumptions , goods will be priced at their marginal cost , which will equal their true scarcity .
Price moves towards marginal cost , which also equals social marginal cost .
This is n’t just false in a weighless economy , Bowles tells us – it ’s proveably false .
In economies of grain and steel , you could weigh , fence and contract .
To find examples of these classic Adam Smith markets , you actually need to go to the developing world and look at grain markets , in which homogenous goods are traded in competition by using simple forms of measurability , weighing grains out in tin cans .
These markets are n’t a good analogy for contemporary economies .
Instead , we ’re more likely to see economies where first copy costs are extremely high and marginal costs are low .
The first copy of Windows 97 cost $ 50 million .
The second copy cost $ 3 … and it can be copied for even less .
Generic drugs sell for about half the price of brand name drugs .
For some drugs , the ratio is closer to 10 to 1 .
When copying costs are low , enforcement of property rights is difficult … and ultimately irrational .
Intellectual property rights are a way of forcing a violation of the invisible hand theorem .
You allow someone to charge $ 20 for a CD whose marginal cost is $ 0.85 .
The market structure of the economy of grain and steel exhibited a mixture of competition – approximating Smith ’s ideal – and stable oligopoly : the emergence of a small set of succesful , competing firms .
Network externalities – the economies of scale on the side of demand – tend to lead towards a winner take all dynamic .
Take the decisions inherent in deciding to speak a second language – if lots of other people learn how to speak Chinese , there ’s a strong incentive for you to learn Chinese .
In the weighless economy , positive feedbacks and winner - take - all dynamics are very important .
Those who get ahead will tend to stay ahead .
They do n’t need to be the best , just first and good enough .
This dynamic tends to generate significant inequality – whether we ’re considering pop stars or dentists .
Private firms can’t confirm to the price equals marginal cost theory – marginal costs are much less than average costs because of the increased first copy costs .
And property rights become both ambiguous and difficult to enforce .
In other words , the invisible hand is n’t working in a weightless economy .
It might be time to look back to the Pleistocene .
Bowles has hunted with the Hadza people in Tanzania – he reassures us that he did n’t actually kill anything .
Actually , that ’s pretty common .
The Hadza hunt kudu , an animal which contains about 160,000 calories .
These people have no refrigeration , so it ’s hard to eat your kudu over a month .
And even very good hunters are lucky to kill a kudu once a month – there ’s about a 3 % success rate for a hunt .
So when you get a kudzu , it needs to be widely shared .
Something like 2/3rd of the calories are shared outside the nuclear family – Bowles watched roughly 60 people join a small set of hunters for a feast on the kudu they harvested .
The culture of the foraging band emphasizes generosity and modesty .
There are norms of sharing .
You depricate what you catch , describing it as “ not as big as a mouse ” , or “ not even worth cooking ” , even when you ’ve killed a large animal .
In the Ache people of Eastern Paraguay , hunters are prohibited from eating their own catch .
There ’s complex sanctioning of individually assertive behavior , particularly those that disturb or disrupt cooperation and group stability .
This makes sense – if hunters can’t expect that they ’ll be fed by other hunters – particularly by a hunter who suddenly develops a taste for eating his own catch – the society collapses rapidly .
Mobile foraging bands and accompanying collectivist and egalitarian norms were displaced by a society based around property rights , made possible through the domestication of crops and livestock .
Initially , this domestication probably reduced individual human productivity … but it increased land productivity .
This led to an idea that you should define a set of resource as yours and invest in those resources .
This idea preceded states – they were enforced by interpersonal conflict , not by third parties – but the system became more efficient in a system with strong state actors .
As Smith speculated in “ The Wealth of Nations ” , the property rights revolution contributed to the wealth of states .
It emphasized unambiguous ownership of land and resources .
But now the most important resources – information and ideas – are difficult to own , risky to pursue , and wasteful if not shared .
Strong property rights might not be the best strategy for allocating resources in this environment .
Bowles references Jared Diamond ’s “ Guns , Germs and Steel ” , where Diamond explores the challenges of domesticating individual plant and animal species .
“ Is a song or an application more like a cow or like a kudzu – something that will simply cause trouble if you try to tie it up near your house ? ”
This question leads to the phrase “ kudunomics ” , which has a nice resonance with “ kudonomics ” , reflecting the fact that the economies of hunter - gatherer societies were reputation economies .
Information , suggests Kenneth Arrow , is a fugitive resource .
There are contradictions between private property and information acquisition and retention .
In this sense , Arrow is replicating Marx , and his recognition that “ information was what allowed us to appropriate nature . ”
Studying changes in institutions is hard .
In history , we rarely encounter changes as large as the French revolution or the end of Chinese foot binding .
Instead , we ’d do better to build agent - based simulations .
Bowles and his group at Santa
Fe are building Markov process models to try to understand the dynamics of this hunter / gatherer - pastoralist transition .
It ’s a hard problem to solve as a system of equations .
There are events outside the model , and a complex interaction of group and individual selection processes .
The feedback of a society on individual decisions is non-lineral .
Because we can’t easily solve the equations , we build models and watch them instead .
Watching these models , we discover that they ’ve got multiple equilibria .
In economic terms , what ’s goint on is an equilibrium selection process , watching societies transition between multiple equilibria in a system .
Bowles ’s model ( which you can download and run on a Window machine ) looks at three different strategies for coping in an economy :
– Bourgeois – if you ’re in posession of an item , defend it
– Share – Share and do n’t punish those who do n’t share
– Civic – share and jointly punish those who do n’t share
The civic strategy succeeds if there are lots of civic members in a group .
If there are very few , they tend to fail .
This is one of the dynamics which leads to multiple equilibria in a system .
The bourgeois strategy is stable ( an asymptotically stable symmetric Nash equilibrium ) if property rights are well defined .
But if property rights are ill - defined , the bourgeois stragegy is no longer evolutionarily stable .
The simulation introduces costs for conflicts between “ firms ” , groups of individuals which share a strategy .
Because there ’s a cost to conflict , firms that resolve conflicts without much expenditure of energy are going to outlast those that spend resources on conflict .
Individuals within these firms are paired with cultural models drawn from a group of possibilities , conveye by “ conformist transmission ” .
Individuals might simply draw from neighbors , or might compare how others are doing and change strategy .
Losing groups are not eliminated – instead , they lose resources and tend to adopt the cultural model of the winning group .
Individuals who are in losing firms will have a strong tendency to adopt the strategy of winning firms .
In these simulations , some fraction of the time , a bourgeois player will challenge someone over a resource he does n’t own – i.e. , he ’ll attempt to steal it .
Because of this , if there are very few bourgeois , civics will do well , and vice versa .
It turns out that simulations where all actors are bourgeois are stable .
The two strategies where sharing is involved are equivalent if there are no bourgeois actors .
A smiluation might drift between sharing and civic strategies without outside influences .
As a result , All C ( civic ) is not a stable equilibrium – it ’s subject to drift .
And all B ( bourgeois ) is not stable if property rights are not well defined .
With Jung - Kyoo Choi , Bowles built models with 25 firms of 20 individuals .
They were randomly seeded with S , B , C actors and run with different levels of property rights .
The property rights are varied by changing how often bourgeois actors challenge ownership incorrectly – to simulate high ambiguity in property rights , bourgeois actors challenge property rights incorrectly quite often .
Actors in the simulation go through a cultural learning process – someone in a minority could choose a model in the majority .
If you run the simulation with no ambiguity in property rights , there is rapid consolidation around B as a strategy .
We watch a live simulation , and Bowles points out that “ the ‘ equilibrium ’ is actually pretty volatile – we watch societies cluster around b- heavy strategies .
As ambiguity increases , we see an emergence of strategies that orbit between the civic and shared poles – societies appear to go through rapid revolutions , shifting from one set of societal rules to another .
An all - shared equilibrium is more efficient because there ’s no cost for enforcement , but it ’s not a stable state , as previously discussed .
Bowles points out that the evolutionary success of the bourgeois equilibrium depends on property rights being unambiguous – he shows a curve of experimental data where stability tracks ambiguity in a cubic relationship .
As we consider evolution of institutions in the weightless economy , we know of at least three forms of economic governance : communities , states and markets .
Markets allocate resources well in conditions where the individual hand applies .
States have superior powers of enforcement , which allow for powerful civic strategies .
And as Elinor Ostrom has pointed out , communities can handle ambiguity of property rights , but tend to fail where inequalities between members are large .
Hayek ’s work questioned the efficiency of central planning versus that of the market .
At the center of that question is information – in societies where information is easily available , central planning might be very efficient .
If it ’s harder to acquire information , markets can act to aggregate that information .
To govern in these systems , you can either adjust prices to get an equilibrium or collect sufficient information to engage in efficient central planning .
Ostrom suggests that we need different mechanisms to govern by communities .
Bowles closes by reminding us that societies need to support high levels of information creation .
We need incentives to provide these resources in the first place .
But there ’s a paradox :
Why do hunters hunt if they have to give it away ?
In the Ache society , hunters are n’t allowed any of what they catch – they could spend their hunting time harvesting fruit and tubers .
Why do n’t they ?
This question has important implications for the creation of information resources in a weightless economy .
David Weinberger has a good accounting of the questions and answers that followed Professor Bowles ’s talk – I largely missed the Q&A , desperately trying to catch up with the substance of the talk !

• China plans to slow emissions growth by up to 45 % • PM Wen Jiabao to attend Copenhagen climate talks
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The Chinese prime minister , Wen Jiabao , will attend the Copenhagen climate talks next month , the government said today , as it unveiled firm targets for curbing the world 's biggest carbon footprint for the first time .
A day after the US president , Barack Obama , confirmed he would attend the early stages of the conference , the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman , Qin Gang , said Wen would join the gathering , which aims to set a global strategy for reducing emissions .
China announced that it would cut emissions of carbon relative to economic growth by 40 % to 45 % by 2020 compared with 2005 levels .
" This is a voluntary action taken by the Chinese government based on its own national conditions and is a major contribution to the global effort in tackling climate change , " the state council was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency .
Because of its high economic growth rate , China 's emissions will continue to rise rapidly for at least a decade .
But this target commits China to slowing the speed of emissions growth through the adoption of renewable energy , replacing old power stations with more efficient plants , and possibly capturing and storing more carbon .
It is also likely to galvanise moves to introduce a carbon trading scheme and a carbon tax .
Kim Carstensen , leader of WWF International 's global climate initiative , told Reuters : " It is extremely welcome news that China is now putting specific figures on its reductions of carbon intensity towards 2020 . "
John Hay , spokesman for the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat called news of Obama 's visit and China 's announcement of firm targets as " a huge morale booster " .
By setting its first carbon target , China moves its policies more closely into line with international efforts to reduce greenhouse gases .
But the figure is unlikely to be high enough to satisfy European and US negotiators , who have indicated that anything below 50 % would represent a less ambitious target than its current efforts to improve energy efficiency .
The UK government said China 's first ever carbon target was an " important opening contribution " , but it reminded Beijing that it , and other major developing nations , had made a commitment to make a meaningful deviation from business as usual in order to hold back warming .
" It is essential that for the right ambitious deal to be made in Copenhagen , China and other nations will need to take action consistent with this 2 degree objective , " the UK government said in a statement .
China 's negotiators counter that it is doing far more than wealthy nations at a similar stage of development , particularly given the greater historical and per capita responsibility of the US and Europe .
But Xie Zhenhua , the country 's most senior climate negotiator , hinted at the possibility of faster steps if the developed nations provided more assistance .
" It will be difficult because it is already tough for us to achieve our target , " he said .
" If we receive technical and financial support , we might be able to reach our target at an earlier date . "
European diplomats expressed disappointment that China would not be represented in Copenhagen by President Hu Jintao , which may weaken the negotiating team 's ability to set an emissions reduction strategy .
Wen ranks considerably lower than Hu in the Communist party hierarchy .
However , Qin said : " Wen Jiabao 's attendance at the meeting shows the importance that the Chinese government places on this issue , and shows that the Chinese government is willing to co-operate with the international community . "
Other observers said Wen was the best choice because he headed the climate leading group in the state council , China 's cabinet , and may be better versed on the issues than the president .
" Wen is the one really driving the action , " said Wu Changhua , China director for the Climate Group .
" There is not a major difference in terms of decision - making at Copenhagen .
They all speak with one voice . "
Other environmental groups said China 's representation may have been partly determined by the US announcement that Obama would attend only the first part of the meeting .
" We would have liked Hu Jintao to go because he has more power and is in a better position to make decisions in the final stages of the meeting , " said Yang Ailun of Greenpeace .
" But if Obama is not going to be there at the end , then China may have decided that the prime minister should go instead . "
The announcement comes ahead of two hastily scheduled press conferences by senior officials in the national development and reform commission , which heads China 's climate policies .
Brazil , Indonesia and South Korea have recently released their carbon goals .
The US has said it will bring a numerical commitment to the negotiating table .
Among the nearly 200 zombie movies I have seen , there have been some truly atrocious films .
Not just bad mind you — in a genre so filled with amateurish , low - and - no - budget entries , bad is commonplace .
No , we are talking about the truly , spectacularly terrible — movies that are difficult , painful or even brain damaging to sit through .
Which I have done , because when it comes to zombies , I watch them all from the opening credits to the end credits , no matter how much it hurts .
And some of these hurt bad .
So to save you the trouble — or to provide the masochists with fodder for their self - abuse — I present these , the ten worst zombie movies I have had the misfortune to sit through .
I do n’t necessarily claim these are the worst of all time , just the worst I have seen .
God forbid that there are actually worse , but in all honesty , there probably are .
And I ’ll get around to watching those eventually , too …
All of these except number 10 have full reviews elsewhere on the site , just click the “ Full review here ” link at the end of each entry if you need more detial .
And a final note regarding ranking – do n’t get too hung up on it .
At this level of awfulness , these are all pretty much the worse movie you have ever seen .
10 ) Automaton Transfusion – I will never understand how anyone actually liked this movie .
Apparently someone over at Bloody Disgusting liked it enough to call it one of the best zombie movies in years , if the blurb on the case is to be believed .
That person should be fired and everything they have ever written destroyed , because this movie sucks .
Apart from one minorly amusing , over - the - top gag involving a pregnant woman having her fetus ripped out by a zombie , there is nothing to like here .
Fast zombies , plot and dialog that seem to be made up as they went along and lots of nonsensical running around killing zombies .
It ’s like some people decided to film their hyperactive nephews playing make - believe zombie apocalypse in the back yard .
And if I did n’t hate it already by the time it ended , the ending made me want to put my head through the screen .
The story simply stops , the words “ To Be Continued ” flash on screen , and it ’s over .
Um , Automaton Transfusion ?
Go fuck yourself .
You will not be continued .
9 ) City of Rott – Horrible , cheap , stupid and slow , this one - man animated feature runs a mere 78 minutes but manages to feel like it lasts as least 178 minutes .
There really needs to be a good , animated zombie apocalypse tale .
This is most assuredly not it .

8 ) Dead Moon Rising – Here ’s a hint to the filmmakers .
You do not tell your story exclusively through the use of asides directed at the camera / audience .
And you most especially do not use a talentless , uncharismatic ass clown as your lead / narrator if you do .
And you do n’t make a major subplot involving him pissing himself and hating guns because of said pissing incident .
And also … well , just do n’t ever make another movie , okay ?
That ’s probably simpler .
( Full review here )
7 ) Deadlands : The Rising – I think someday that Gary Ugarek , the director / writer / producer / star of this turkey , will make a decent movie .
This is his first effort , and it is not a decent movie .
No one in it can act .
The makeup and effects are nearly nonexistent .
There is nothing to like about it .
It is a confusing , talky , meandering , pointless , ill - conceived mess .
His sequel , Deadlands 2 : Trapped ( that one is reviewed here ) , is several orders of magnitude better — enough to pull it out of the bottom ten , anyway — and it ’s still kind of a mess .

6 ) Death Valley : The Revenge of Bloody Bill –
It ’s just your average cowboy zombie - ghost meets debating team held hostage by drug dealer story , so what ’s not to like ?
Besides everything , I mean .
Some of the worst cinematography , lighting , acting , writing , directing and effects ever .
There was one girl who was kind of cute , though .

5 ) Violent Shit 3 : Infantry of Doom – Just thinking about this makes me want to scream , then go take a long , hot shower in ammonia .
Blech .
Horrible , horrible German horribleness from Andreaas Schnaas .
It was just one long orgy of rape , mutilation and mind - meltingly bad dubbing .
I think there was a story of sorts , but it not only made no sense , it actively sought out and destroyed sense , so I ca n’t be sure .
Fuck you Schnaas .

4 ) Everything Bruno Mattei ever directed – I ’ve only seen three of Mattei ’s films ( there are at least two more that look to have zombies , god forbid… ) , but sweet brain pudding , they are fucking atrocious .
And they kept getting worse as he made more !
Hell of the Living Dead ( aka Virus , aka Night of the Zombies , et al — read my reaction piece here ) is almost not - bad enough to escape this list ( it would probably sit around eleven , though ) but Zombie 3 ( credited to Lucio Fulci but widely known to have been directed by Mattei — read my reaction piece here ) and Zombies the Beginning ( review here ) are seriously dangerous .
I am pretty sure they both made me stupider and less attractive .
They may have caused some sterility as well .
Avoid anything and everything with his name on it , and thank god he ca n’t make any more films ( he ’s dead , see ) .
3 ) Dead and Deader – This one deserves a special slot in hell , because it takes a recognizable cast , some decent production values ( and thus probably a decent budget ) and a midget and manages to make a shit sandwich out of it .
This is one of the few movies that left me genuinely angry .
Seriously , if I met the director , I might still be tempted to punch the guy .
It also made me hate Dean Cain even more , but that was its only good point .

2 ) Zombie Lake –
It could n’t be a bottom ten list without at least one Nazi zombie movie , could it ?
The zombies in this just had green paint smeared on their faces .
There ’s a subplot about a daughter whose father is one of the zombies that makes no sense , but does provide some touching zombie / daughter moments .
It ’s slow , painful to watch and utterly sleazy .
Okay , that last point is actually a compliment — this movie is chock full of hot French nude girl , which was probably a reason to watch it before the advent of Internet porn .
Now it only dulls the pain enough to stop you from scratching your eyes out of your head .

1 ) Zombie Night – Oh , how I hate thee , Zombie Night .
You no -budget , shot - on - video , Canadian piece of shit .
It ’s a complete rip off of Night of the Living Dead , but that ’s actually its best feature .
It was completely impossible to get any gauge of the timescale of the film — does it take place over a couple of nights , or over a couple of months ?
People came and went seemingly at random , despite it apparently being the end of the world .
Technically deficient , narratively challenged and wholly unlikable , it felt endless — seriously , somewhere in my mind , I feel like I am still watching Zombie Night , and in that place I am screaming and screaming and praying for the sweet release of death .

Gathering positive experience
Last Monday , the new CERN Machine Advisory Committee ( CMAC ) met for the first time , and we had good news to tell its members .
Over the weekend , injection tests for both LHC beams were successfully carried out .
In other words , we ’ve had beam in the LHC for the first time since September 2008 .
That ’s a good feeling , but it ’s no reason for complacency .
There ’s still a long way to go before first physics at the new energy frontier .
As the Bulletin has reported over recent weeks , we ’re gathering a lot of positive experience with the new quench detection and protection system ( QPS ) , which is already allowing us to monitor the LHC far better than we were able to in the past .
So far , the QPS for three of the LHC ’s eight sectors has been put through its paces , and we ’ve also power tested those sectors to 2000 amperes , the equivalent of around 1.2 TeV per beam .
The next step is to slowly increase the current to 4000 amperes , and then on to 6000 amperes , the current needed for 3.5 TeV running .
This will take a few weeks .
The road from here should take us to the first circulating beams of 2009 by the second half of November , with collisions at injection energy following soon after .
If things go well , we may have the first high - energy collisions before the end - of - year break , which would be the best Christmas present I could wish for .
Starting up a new accelerator is a complex process , however , and we ’re modifying the LHC schedule on a weekly basis in the light of progress .
Just last week , we detected a helium leak that diverted attention from other things .
Thankfully that turned out to be manageable , and did not slow us down .
Commissioning the LHC for 3.5 TeV is the top priority now , and will take several weeks .
The CMAC gave a strong vote of confidence to our prudent , step by step , approach to getting the LHC running again .
At the end of the meeting I had a word with Thomas Roser , Chairman of the CMAC and Associate Chairman for Accelerators at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the USA .
" It ’s good to see things going so smoothly at this stage in the project , " he told me .
And he should know , having lived through the start - up of another groundbreaking superconducting particle accelerator , Brookhaven ’s RHIC , ten years ago .

Under federal law , people who pose a heightened risk of violence cannot buy or own firearms , including convicted felons , domestic abusers , the seriously mentally ill and several other categories .
Suspected terrorist is not one them .
Individuals on the government ’s terrorist watch list can be barred from boarding airplanes , but not from purchasing high - powered guns or explosives .
Bipartisan legislation in both houses of Congress would end this ridiculous loophole , commonly known as the “ terror gap . ”
Introduced in the Senate by Frank Lautenberg , a New Jersey Democrat , and in the House by Representative Peter King , a Republican of Long Island , this reform was first offered in 2007 with support from the Bush administration , a rare departure from the gun lobby ’s party line .
The Obama administration has endorsed the bill .
This is no small problem .
An audit by the Government Accountability Office released last June found that since 2004 , people on the terrorism watch list succeeded in purchasing firearms 865 times in 963 attempts .
The relatively few denials owed to another factor like a felony conviction .
A 2005 G.A.O. review found people on the watch list were able to buy weapons in 35 of 44 attempts between February 2004 and June 2004 .
The Book of Exodus in the King James translation of the Bible describes a pharaoh who “ hardened his heart ” against the exodus of the Jews from ancient Egypt .
But if a research letter published last week in The Journal of the American Medical Association is correct , the pharaoh may have been suffering from hardened arteries .
The new report recounts how a team of cardiologists used CT scanning on mummies in the Egyptian National Museum of Antiquities in Cairo to identify atherosclerosis  a buildup of cholesterol , inflammation and scar tissue in the walls of the arteries , a problem that can lead to heart attack and stroke .
The cardiologists were able to identify the disease in some mummies because atherosclerotic tissue often develops calcification , which is visible as bright spots on a CT image .
The finding that some mummies had hardened arteries raises questions about the common wisdom that factors in modern life , including stress , high - fat diets , smoking and sedentary routines , play an essential role in the development of cardiovascular disease , the researchers said .
“ It tells us that we have to look beyond lifestyles and diet for the cause and progression of this disease , ” said Dr. Randall C. Thompson , a cardiologist at St. Luke ’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City , Mo. , and part of the team of cardiovascular imaging specialists who traveled to Cairo last year .
“ To a certain extent , getting the disease is part of the human condition . ”

A few Macros for Designing by Contract in Objective - C
What 's that ?
Design by contract is a software methodology invented and pushed by Bertrand Meyer .
Basically , the idea is that for each Object in your program , you want to have a " contract " , that explicitely states what the Object expects ( input / output ranges , etc. ) .
In fact , it 's the old idea of assertions -- but Bertrand Meyer refined it to a great degree in his OO language Eiffel .
Each method of the Object could then have for example Prerequisites and Postrequisites -- the former states what the method expects in parameters / object state before running , the later states what must be the result of the method .
Additionally , there is the possibility to have invariants , that is , assertions that must be true during the whole life of the Object .
The concept of Design by contract is more advanced than just " assertions " , in that it 's a way of explicitely have a contract between the Object and its user .
It 's quite helpful to find bugs , and it's a really useful tool in OOP when you want to reuse objects .
A famous example is the Ariane 5 crash : an Ariane 4 software component was reused and caused the crash .
But more specifically , if the component crashed , that was n't exactly because of a bug , but because the component expected a value range less important ( which was ok with Ariane 4 , no more with Ariane 5 ) ... and that was stated in the documentation !
Yet nobody spotted it .
Using the Design by Contract methodology in that case would have immediately raised the difference between the module 's expectations and the reality .
It costed half a million dollars ;-)
The macros
The macros available on this page implements the pre- and post - assertions as well as invariants .
Eiffel is way more refined , but I think the macros in their current state are useable .
Yet , I 'm not an expert in Design by Contract nor in Eiffel , and theses macros are quite young .
So , obviously , if you have ideas / critics / comments , feel free to send me a mail :-)
Download
Download a tgz here .
The macros should work on GNUstep ( Linux / * nix / Windows / OSX ) and OSX .
Example
Say you have an Account object , modeling a bank account .
You want to keep trace of all the deposits on this account , and have the balance .
Your object could be something like that :
#import < Foundation / Foundation.h > @interface Account : NSObject { NSMutableArray * AllDeposits ; int balance ; // current balance } - ( int ) depositCount ; // number of deposits made since opening - ( void ) deposit : ( int ) sum ; // add sum to the - ( int ) balance ; @end
The implementation will then be :
#import " Account.h " @implementation Account - ( id ) init { self = [ super init ] ; AllDeposits = [ NSMutableArray new ] ; return self ; } - ( void ) dealloc { [ AllDeposits release ] ; } - ( int ) depositCount { return [ AllDeposits count ] ; } - ( void ) deposit : ( int ) sum { [ AllDeposits addObject : [ NSNumber numberWithInt : sum ] ] ; balance = balance + sum ; } - ( int ) balance { return balance ; } @end
The Contract
Here is the contract for this object :
#import " Contracts.h " #import " Account. h " BEGIN_CONTRACT ( Account ) INVARIANTS ( FACT ( AllDeposits != nil ) ; FACT ( balance >= 0 ) ; ) - ( int ) depositCount VERIFY ( int Result = [ super depositCount ] ; // call the method ) - ( void ) deposit : ( int ) sum VERIFY_PROC ( REQUIRE ( FACT ( sum >= 0 ) ; ) MODIFY ( AllDeposits ) ; MODIFY ( balance ) ; [ super deposit : sum ] ; // call the method ENSURE ( FACT ( [ AllDeposits count ] == [ OLD ( AllDeposits ) count ] + 1 ) ; FACT ( balance == [ OLD ( balance ) intValue ] + sum ) ; ) ) END_CONTRACT
Explanation
The basic idea for implementing contracts in Objective - C for a class A is to create a subclass B of the class A .
Then , you subclass all the methods of A in B , following the model :
// in A - ( void ) method { // do something } // in B - ( void ) method { // Verify the invariants // Verify the preconditions [ super method ] ; // call the A's method // Verify the postconditions // Verify the invariants }
The trick is then to replace A by B using poseAsClass : , so all the normal calls to A will be treated in B first , thanks to the ObjC runtime :-)
The pre- and post - conditions are just normal assertions ; the invariants are assertions stored in the method - ( void ) invariants -- so if you have already a method named like that , you need to change that in Contracts . h
Problems and limitations
Ideally , what we'd like is the automatic wrapping of the method -- at least for checking invariants ; for methods that want pre- or post - conditions , the programmer should anyway declare them .
The problem here is the runtime ; although I was able to hack a bit the GNU runtime to replace the normal method 's addresses by mines , and effectively have them called , I still have some problems with the returning parameters .
Thus in the actual version of the macros , I do n't do anything with the runtime and you MUST reimplement in B all the methods that you want to be checked :-/
Detailed explanation
BEGIN_CONTRACT and END_CONTRACT
Each contract should be enclosed in BEGIN_CONTRACT / END_CONTRACT -- theses macros actually create a subclass of the class given in parameters
#import " Contracts .h " //
You want to import all theses nice macros :-) #import " YourObject. h " //
Import the header of the object you 're writing the contract BEGIN_CONTRACT ( YourObject ) //
Here use the macros ... END_CONTRACT
INVARIANTS
To define the invariants , you use the macro INVARIANTS -- you just put assertions in it .
assertions : FACT and FACT_MSG
Theses assertions takes an expression as a parameter that is tested .
If the test is false , then some NSLog are issued explaing the problem and the program quit via exit ( - 2 ) ; .
If you prefer to have the assertions raise exceptions , just modify theses macros .
FACT_MSG takes another parameter , a message that is printed if the assertion fails .
Assertations could be wrapped in REQUIRE (...) and ENSURE (... ) macros .
Theses macros just set a variable used in the error reporting ( CONTRACTS_CURRENT_STATE ) .
REQUIRE represents the preconditions of a method , ENSURE represents the postconditions .
Methods
You declare the methods like you do normally , but you use the macros VERIFY (... ) or VERIFY_PROC (...) instead of { and } :
- ( int ) method VERIFY ( int Result = [ super method ] ; // call the method in A ) - ( void ) method VERIFY_PROC ( [ super method ] ; // call the method in A )
What theses two macros do is to wrap the code between two calls of the invariants ' method , plus set some variables used for the error display in the assertions ( CONTRACTS_CURRENT_METHOD ... ) .
They also create a dictionary ( __OLD_DATA_VALUES__ ) for possibly keeping trace of the original state of values .
For signaling that you want to keep trace of a value , just use the MODIFY ( ... ) macro -- that will copy the value in the dictionary .
You could then refers to theses values using the OLD ( ... ) macro , as seen in the first example .
As the values are stored as objects , int and float are stored as NSNumber , hence the call to intValue in the example .
The difference between VERIFY and VERIFY_PROC is that VERIFY expects you to have a local variable Result that will be returned .
VERIFY_PROC is thus mandatory for use with " procedures " ( void returning methods ) .
Use of the contract
In your main procedure , before using your objects , you should call the APPLY_CONTRACT ( ... ) macro .
You must import the Contracts.h file and the file where your contract is defined .
Notes
The following global variables are used :
CONTRACTS_CURRENT_METHOD
CONTRACTS_CURRENT_STATE

Gordon Brown will intervene in the critical issue of immigration , using a major speech tomorrow to promise that migrant workers will only be used to fill jobs temporarily in parts of the economy where there are labour shortages .
He will make it a requirement that government - sanctioned training schemes are created to ensure that unskilled British workers can ultimately take on the jobs in sectors where there are genuine skills shortages , such as catering , supply teaching or some skilled medical and engineering jobs .
The speech will be seen as an effort to give meaning to his promise of " British jobs for British workers " .
His intervention follows private polling conducted during the summer by the Unite trade union showing that immigration is the single biggest issue leading natural Labour voters to defect either to the more extreme parties , such as the British National party , or into refusing to vote at all .
Ministers have acknowledged that they have ceded ground to the BNP either by not talking about immigration or by not confronting the BNP 's true politics .
The issue is likely to become more potent as unemployment increases and the Conservatives claim the number of migrants in the UK is the result of a deliberate government strategy to create a multicultural Britain .
Brown has not made a significant speech on immigration since he became prime minister and tomorrow 's speech is seen by some ministers close to the issue as belated , if welcome .
In an interview in tomorrow 's Daily Mail , he insisted that immigration had always been a source of " economic , social and cultural strength to Britain " , but added : " I understand people 's concerns when they hear suggestions that levels of immigration are going to rise .
Especially in difficult economic circumstances , people have concerns …
They want to be assured that the system is tough and fair .
They want to be assured that newcomers to the country will accept their responsibilities … obey all the laws , speaking English is important , making a contribution . "
In his speech tomorrow , the prime minister will again reject Tory proposals for an annual cap on immigrants , arguing that the policy is unworkable and cannot be implemented due to the free movement of workers inside the EU .
Ministers also claim the flexibility inherent in the government 's points system introduced in 2008 allows the government to raise or lower the bar on who can be allowed into the UK , in effect having the same impact as an annual quota .
Brown will also propose a tightening of the " labour market test " that allows employers to recruit migrants from outside the settled workforce for a skilled job only if they can show no suitably qualified settled worker can fill the job .
Under the test , a job vacancy must also be advertised for two weeks before a migrant can be recruited .
The prime minister will say that in future the job will have to be advertised for a month .
Brown will also highlight the government 's decision to require employers to set up accredited skills training schemes in any areas of the economy where there is a shortage of skills requiring employers to recruit from abroad .
In an effort to take the heat out of the argument , he will say there has been a 44 % fall in net immigration over the last year , and as a result of the points system the number of people who can enter Britain for work without skills has been reduced .
He added in the Daily Mail interview : " There is a new determination to train people in the skills that we need .
We want to ensure … that we do n't have to bring to the country people with skills when we can develop those skills quickly . "
The Migration Advisory Committee , a government advisory body , said in a report last week that the number of people in the government 's skills shortage list had fallen in a year from 700,000 to 500,000 .
That represented less than 2 % of all employees .
It also found that net immigration for work - related reasons has fallen throughout 2008 .
Running a freemium web app ?
Here 's a big reason we 're growing .
Before Scout , my experience developing software was primarily consulting .
Success was measured by delivering software on time and on budget .
With Scout , a subscription - based service , my focus is n’t on scheduling .
We are self - funded and we did n’t have the luxury of a venture - backed startup .
We ’re focused on figuring out which pieces of development work can increase revenue the most .
What follows is how we ’re approaching it .
The 1 % paid conversion rule
If there ’s a golden rule of a subscription - type service like Scout , it ’s this : 1 % of visitors will signup for a paying subscription .
This 1 % rule exposes itself across industries , price point , and size .
The 1 % rule is the Pi of freemium web apps .
It ’s very easy to think you can improve this because 1 % is such a small number , but your business is the rare exception if your paid conversion rate dramatically exceeds 1 % .
If your paid conversion rate is around 1 % , you need to dig somewhere else for treasure .
As our signup rate is around 1 % , what have we focused on ?
Retention & Lifetime Value
Increasing the rate that customers renew their subscriptions ( retention rate ) can have a dramatic impact on revenue .
For example , increasing retention by 1/2 results in the following revenue per / month :
If you sum the periods , you ’ll see that revenue actually doubles with a 50 % increase in the retention rate :
To determine the revenue , I ’m using an equation for Lifetime Value , which is the revenue expected from a customer over their lifetime .
Every period ( in our case , 1 month ) , decreases the chances that they ’ll renew .
R represents the retention rate and rev is the revenue per / period in the equation below :
LTV = rev + rev*R + rev*R^2 + rev*R3 + â€¦
This can be simplified to :
LTV = 1/( 1 - R ) * rev
The retention rate can be calculated using the equation below :
R = 1 -( # of canceled accounts in a given period / # of accounts in a given period )
So , is it as difficult to increase retention as it is increase the signup rate ?
Good news – there is no rule for retention rate
While there is a rule for paid signup conversions , you wo n’t find one for retention rate .
Retention rates vary widely and are a great target for increasing revenue .
Focusing on churn also makes sense in another way : increasing retention by 50 % is the same as doubling your signup rate .
If your paid conversion rate is already around 1 % and you think you can double it , you might be a bit crazy .
I ’ve had good success increasing retention by :
Closely monitoring application performance .
As you ’d expect , we use Scout for this .
Getting feedback from users when they cancel .
Asking users for feedback after they ’ve setup their account .
Aggregating and prioritizing user feedback .
We use UserVoice .
Tracking user behavior .
We use Google Analytics .
Focusing on retention rate is n’t glamourous work , but for many subscription - based web apps , it may hold the most untapped potential to increase revenue .
A higher retention rate can have a dramatic impact on signups too
You can double your revenue if you decrease your churn by half .
That is a substantial number – it means you could also charge customers the same amount , but double your spending on acquiring customers and have the same income .
Increasing your retention rate gives you room to breath .

Enlarge By Charles Dharapak , AP Vice President Biden answers a question while speaking about the economy and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on Thursday at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Trumpeting economic progress to a skeptical nation , Vice President Biden says the massive government program intended to stimulate and reshape the economy is reaching and exceeding goals .
Nearly 200 days into the effort , Biden says it is more effective " than we had hoped . "
Biden 's upbeat report card , to be delivered Thursday in a speech at the Brookings Institution , comes as economists say the country is slowly breaking free of the most crippling recession in decades .
Yet public angst is also deepening about the cost of government intervention , and millions of people remain out of work .
At the heart of President Obama 's agenda for an economic turnaround is the $ 787 billion package he signed into law on Feb. 17 .
The effectiveness of the two - year program is a matter of sharp political debate ; Biden , the administration 's point man on the issue , is aiming to show a restless public that results are tangible .
" Recovery act dollars are going farther and working harder than we anticipated , " Biden said in excerpts released in advance by his office .
With Obama on vacation at the Camp David presidential retreat , the White House hopes Biden 's message will get through on perhaps a quieter news day .
Biden is up against a wary audience when he says " the recovery act is doing more , faster , more efficiently and more effectively than we had hoped . "
A Gallup Poll last month found 51 % of Americans wished the government would have spent less to stimulate the economy .
The same poll found 41 % thought the stimulus package was helping the economy in the short term ; 33 % saw no effect , and 24 said it was making the economy worse .
Citing a scorecard , Biden says that over the past 100 days , using stimulus money , the administration has met its goals of paying for 135,000 education jobs and hiring or keeping 5,000 police .
Other goals have been exceeded , he said , from the number of highway projects to new water systems to health centers .
The stimulus package is a mix of tax cuts , increased spending on Medicaid and huge investments in infrastructure , education , energy projects and more .
" One of the criticisms of the recovery act is that it is simply a grab bag of different programs , " Biden said .
" But the fact that the recovery act is multifaceted does n't reflect a lack of design .
It is the design .
Our economy is so complex and so wounded that reinvigorating one segment alone — or using one tool alone — would never do all that needs to be done . "
The vice president 's appearance is part of a concerted White House push in advance of the 200th day of the stimulus act on Saturday .
Five top administration officials plan to speak about the law 's benefits on Thursday in appearances in Arkansas , Virginia , Illinois , California and Minnesota .
Public approval of Obama 's performance and of his handling of the economy have slipped .
Polls now put both figures slightly above 50 % .
The White House wants people to take a longer view .
A string of indicators show the economy is recovering , but many people are hurting financially .
" Our goal is not just to emerge from the recession .
We will , " Biden said .
" That 's not enough .
We must emerge stronger than we were before we entered it . "

Mr. Reid ’s version of the bill would also let states opt out of the program .
“ We have compromised four times on the public option , ” Mr. Brown had said .
“ There is no more movement on the public option . ”
“ Many people wanted to do Medicare for all , but that was never in the cards here , ” he added .
“ We have moved three or four or five times on this , and those days are over . ”
In the end , the liberals had no choice , and they moved again .
But not without winning concessions in return , including an expansion of the ultimate public plan , Medicare .
The agreement announced by Mr. Reid calls for allowing people from age 55 to 64 to buy coverage through Medicare beginning in 2011 .
While it is not Medicare for all , it is Medicare for more than under current law , and the liberals view it as a major improvement for people nearing retirement , who face some of the biggest obstacles to obtaining insurance and pay some of the highest prices if they get coverage .
At first , those who want to buy in to Medicare coverage will have to pay full cost .
But once provisions of the bill take effect that will provide subsidies to moderate - income Americans , those subsidies could be used to buy either private insurance or coverage through Medicare .
That liberal senators in the negotiations were bargaining from a position of strength was largely due to the strategic efforts of Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York , who ranks third in the Democratic leadership , and who pressed Mr. Reid to include a public option in the bill .
Mr. Reid , Mr. Schumer and many others realized that further negotiation on a public option was inevitable if they were to have any hope of enacting the health care bill as a whole .
The question that arose , as Mr. Reid combined rival versions of the legislation that were developed by two Senate committees , was whether a public option would be in or out of the bill at the start .
Get the code here : Recorded in 1976 , it ’s an Easter egg at ‘ Gene ’s Journal ’
We ’ve all heard of trying to find Easter eggs on DVDs .
But how about Web sites ?
Gene ’s Journal , the popular online comic created by Trevor Roth and drawn by David Reddick , features a young Gene Roddenberry and the tales of his adolescence that would later lead to him creating “ Star Trek ” — in a fictional way of course .
Commissioned and approved by the Roddenberry family , other characters include Agent 4 and Agent 6 , two aliens who are visiting Earth during Roddenberry ’s childhood for the purpose of studying human beings .
The hidden interview was one Gene Roddenberry did in July 1976 with William Shatner called “ Inside Star Trek ” that was recorded at United Western Studios in Los Angeles .
It was part of a series of interviews , rarely heard , that included DeForest Kelley ( Dr. Leonard McCoy ) and Mark Lenard ( Sarek ) .
The interviewers were meant as a look at the development of “ Star Trek ” as well as the story of Gene Roddenberry , his dreams and his difficulties .
Because “ spoken word ” albums such as this were typically unpopular in music stores , “ Inside Star Trek ” sold poorly and was not released again in the LP format .
However , in 1999 , Columbia re-released “ Inside Star Trek ” as part of the two - CD “ Star Trek : The Motion Picture 20th Anniversary Collector ’s Edition . ”
In order to access the interview , visitors to the Gene ’s Journal site need to have a special Konami Code .
It will play on both PCs and Macs ( but not Linux ) , and once the code is entered , the screen goes dark , a retro radio appears , and Eugene Roddenberry Jr. , the son of the late “ Star Trek ” creator and his wife Majel Barrett Roddenberry , delivers a special introductory message .

Gene ’s Journal is one of two comic properties produced by Roddenberry Productions and Reddick , the other being the popular “ Rod & Barry . ”

Yesterday morning , I woke up feeling like someone punched me in the nose .
As I was sober the night before , I am 100 % sure this is not what actually happened .
Understandably , this worried me .
So I did what every uninsured American probably does when they feel unwell : checked WebMD 's symptom checker .
Everything from leukemia to staph to sinus infections came up .
I decided to chug some echinacea tea and sleep it off , hoping I 'd be better the next day .
The next day , my entire face was swollen and painful , and I was blowing my nose every 30 seconds .
Shit .
After another web search found someone suggesting whatever I had could spread to the brain if unchecked , I resigned myself to getting checked out .
I still had my rent money ( around 600 in USD ) for the month in my wallet , and my landlady is nice enough that I could probably get an extension , I thought .
If it was just sniffles I 'd have stayed home , but my face already did n't even LOOK like me .
I have to work on live TV next week , and it's not an all - caucasian remake of Rudolph , so I bit the bullet .
I found a hospital nearby that was still open in the evening ( many places here , after mid-afternoon , you 're screwed ) and said I needed to be checked out , but I did not have insurance .
The receptionist seemed a little concerned , but checked with other staff and then told me that if I paid in full , and brought photo ID with my name and address included , I could see the doctor .
I asked if I needed an appointment .
" No , not at all , " the receptionist said .
" We 're open until 7 pm , just come in at any time .
We 'll be waiting for you . "
On a Friday night , in the middle of the 2nd biggest city in Japan , in the midst of a swine flu epidemic that is just now starting to calm down .
I came in , explained that I was the foreigner on the phone earlier , and they gave me a sheet to fill in , standard medical background stuff and a place to write down what was wrong that caused you to seek treatment .
I filled it in , and after a bit of waiting was brought in to see the doctor , apparently the main guy since his last name is the one on the sign .
We talked a bit about my symptoms , when they started .
He checked my throat and nose , asked about my mucus consistency , then showed me on a computer screen display of the throat / sinuses where and what was inflamed , and diagnosed it as an acute sinus infection that apparently is going around quite a bit right now .
He promptly wrote me a prescription for 3 days worth of pills and told me to come back if there was no improvement .
I thanked him and left .
I went back to the reception area , they gave me a card for the hospital , and 2 papers : 1 was the prescription sheet , one was my bill .
Keep in mind this is the full price , as I am not insured ( a Japanese under the national insurance would pay 1/3 of this ) .
3,900 yen .
As of writing this , that 's about $ 43 .
I paid them , said thank you , and left .
The pharmacy was directly next door ( for prescriptions in Japan , you either get them inside the hospital , or usually a place very close to it .
OTC drugs are sold at regular drug stores ) .
I headed in , gave them the paper , and they handed me another form to fill in .
One of the staff very kindly walked me through it to make sure I understood everything .
Incidentally , one of the questions was " do you have an interest in generic drugs ? "
I checked the " hell yes " box .
Almost the moment I handed back the form , the other pharmacist came out and apologized for making me wait .
She brought out 3 different drugs ( anti-biotic , an expectorant , and something for stomach problems ) - each 3 days ' worth .
She explained when to take them and their use , then stuck them in envelopes in a plastic bag , along with a free handwarmer and a printout with pictures , descriptions , and use instructions of each medication .
Then , she handed me the bill , apologizing for it being so expensive because I was uninsured .
3,100 yen .
Or if you prefer , 34 dollars .
In all , this trip to the doctor cost me less than $ 80 and took less than an hour ( I arrived at the clinic at 6:15 , I left the pharmacist drugs in hand at 7:05 ) .
This is not a perfect country by any means .
There are many things that I feel we do better in America .
I have heard of ( and seen ) some terrible medical facilities here .
But when I get 3 prescriptions filled in 5 minutes and they are SORRY they have to charge me a whopping 30 bucks for it , and I see people back home paying many times that , I have to wonder how we 're managing to do things just this wrong .
You are in an intimate relationship , and you 'd just as soon remain that way .
The problem is , s/he is religious while you have come to doubt your faith .
After some deep reflection , you have come to the conclusion that you just do n't believe all this god stuff anymore .
But you are worried that telling your partner about this may irreparably damage your relationship .
What do you do ?
If you keep your thoughts to yourself , will that make you feel like you are living a lie or that your partner might love who they think you are rather than who you are ?
What would it be like to stay in a relationship where you can't be yourself ?
I can't decide what is right for you in such a case , but I will offer some thoughts on the matter for you to consider .
I 'll start by saying that I think the situation I have described , difficult as it is , tends to be easier than a similar scenario involving one 's family .
After all , most people will have more intimate partners during the course of their lives than they will have families .
I realize this is not a pleasant notion because you 'd prefer to maintain this relationship .
I think that the main question I would want to ask myself in such a predicament would be as follows :
How important is it that my partner loves me for being me rather than for being something he or she wants me to be that I am not ?
If I do not believe in gods , I would not want to pretend that I did .
I would have a hard time remaining in a relationship with someone if I did not feel like I could be myself around them .
I would want to give my partner an opportunity to know the real me .
This might include my thoughts on the subject of gods and the manner in which belief in them affects the culture in which I reside .
It is fairly common for people in a relationship to be as attracted to the potential of someone rather than to the actual person .
And yet , it has been my experience that such relationships are often doomed if they do not progress beyond this point .
If I am in love with what I want someone to be rather than what they really are , I 'm resigning myself to being perpetually disappointed and unhappy .
One could reasonably argue that this would n't be a relationship at all but merely a form of narcissism .
In any case , it is difficult to imagine such a relationship being satisfying in the long run .
Of course , one might decide that maintaining such a relationship is worthwhile even if it means concealing one 's true thoughts about religion .
This would n't be my choice , but it is not my place to fault you if it is yours .
I have little difficulty understanding why some would make such a choice .
Being an atheist can be a lonely experience , and I would not fault anyone for not wanting to go down that path if they could avoid it .

The current health care debate is becoming so loud and polarizing that we are in danger of missing the very real needs of people seeking health care in the United States today .
As a practitioner working for Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio , I work with patients seeking affordable , quality health care , and I strongly believe that we cannot let women , or men , become worse off in the future than we are today .
Nationally , more than six out of 10 patients who receive service at a health center like Planned Parenthood consider it their primary source of care .
Many clients will tell you that their local health care center is the most affordable .
There has been an increase in visits to these health centers brought about by the economic downturn we are all experiencing .
Many visits are for contraception as most today cannot afford a pregnancy .
I cannot tell you the number of times that a woman coming in for a " simple " annual wellness exam has presented with a serious problem .
Our health centers have discovered breast cancer , diabetes , high blood pressure , heart disease , anorexia , thyroid problems and more .
Women with abnormal pap smears are followed up with affordable colposcopies , biopsies and treatment , thus preventing cervical cancer .
As a caring and compassionate society , we must commit to keeping women and community health providers as an important part of this discussion on health care .
We really can not do less .
One hopes that , whatever the result of the current debate , a woman 's access to affordable health and reproductive care remain a priority .
Community providers can help solve access to care issues .
Women cannot be fooled : Health care that does not include reproductive care is not real health care reform .
You will probably never need to know about the Olson database , also known as the Zoneinfo or tz database .
And were it not for my elmcity project I never would have looked into it .
I knew roughly that this bedrock database is a compendium of definitions of the world ’s timezones , plus rules for daylight savings transitions ( DST ) , used by many operating systems and programming languages .
I presumed that it was written Unix - style , in some kind of plain - text format , and that ’s true .
Here , for example , are top - level DST rules for the United States since 1918 :
# Rule NAME FROM TO IN ON AT SAVE LETTER / S Rule US 1918 1919 Mar lastSun 2:00 1:00 D Rule US 1918 1919 Oct lastSun 2:00 0 S Rule US 1942 only Feb 9 2:00 1:00 W # War Rule US 1945 only Aug 14 23:00 u 1:00 P # Peace Rule US 1945 only Sep 30 2:00 0 S Rule US 1967 2006 Oct lastSun 2:00 0 S Rule US 1967 1973 Apr lastSun 2:00 1:00 D Rule US 1974 only Jan 6 2:00 1:00 D Rule US 1975 only Feb 23 2:00 1:00 D Rule US 1976 1986 Apr lastSun 2:00 1:00 D Rule US 1987 2006 Apr Sun>=1 2:00 1:00 D Rule US 2007 max Mar Sun >=8 2:00 1:00 D Rule US 2007 max Nov Sun>=1 2:00 0 S
What I did n’t appreciate , until I finally unzipped and untarred a copy of ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata2009o.tar.gz , is the historical scholarship scribbled in the margins of this remarkable database , or document , or hybrid of the two .
You can see a glimpse of that scholarship in the above example .
The most recent two rules define the latest ( 2007 ) change to US daylight savings .
The spring forward rule says : “ On the second Sunday in March , at 2 AM , save one hour , and use D to change EST to EDT . ”
Likewise , on the fast - approaching first Sunday in November , spend one hour and go back to EST .
But look at the rules for Feb 9 1942 and Aug 14 1945 .
The letters are W and P instead of D and S .
And the comments tell us that during that period there were timezones like Eastern War Time ( EWT ) and Eastern Peace Time ( EPT ) .
Arthur David Olson elaborates :
Most of this Talmudic scholarship comes from founding contributor Arthur David Olson and editor Paul Eggert , both of whose Wikipedia pages , although referenced from the Zoneinfo page , strangely do not exist .
But the Olson / Eggert commentary is also interspersed with many contributions , like this one about the Mount Washington Observatory .
From Dave Cantor ( 2004 -11-02 )
Early this summer I had the occasion to visit the Mount Washington Observatory weather station atop ( of course ! ) Mount Washington [ , NH ] ….
One of the staff members said that the station was on Eastern Standard Time and did n’t change their clocks for Daylight Saving … so that their reports will always have times which are 5 hours behind UTC .
Since Mount Washington has a climate all its own , I guess it makes sense for it to have its own time as well .
Here ’s a glimpse of Alaska ’s timezone history :
From Paul Eggert ( 2001-05-30 ) : Howse writes that Alaska switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar , and from east - of - GMT to west - of - GMT days , when the US bought it from Russia .
This was on 1867 - 10 - 18 , a Friday ; the previous day was 1867 - 10 - 06 Julian , also a Friday .
Include only the time zone part of this transition , ignoring the switch from Julian to Gregorian , since we ca n’t represent the Julian calendar .
As far as we know , none of the exact locations mentioned below were permanently inhabited in 1867 by anyone using either calendar .
( Yakutat was colonized by the Russians in 1799 , but the settlement was destroyed in 1805 by a Yakutat - kon war party . )
However , there were nearby inhabitants in some cases and for our purposes perhaps it ’s best to simply use the official transition .
You have to have a sense of humor about this stuff , and Paul Eggert does :
From Paul Eggert ( 1999-03-31 ) : Shanks writes that Michigan started using standard time on 1885 - 09 - 18 , but Howse writes ( pp 124-125 , referring to Popular Astronomy , 1901 - 01 ) that Detroit kept local time until 1900 when the City Council decreed that clocks should be put back twenty - eight minutes to Central Standard Time .
Half the city obeyed , half refused .
After considerable debate , the decision was rescinded and the city reverted to Sun time .
A derisive offer to erect a sundial in front of the city hall was referred to the Committee on Sewers .
Then , in 1905 , Central time was adopted by city vote .
This story is too entertaining to be false , so go with Howse over Shanks .
The document is chock full of these sorts of you - can ’t - make - this - stuff - up tales :
From Paul Eggert ( 2001-03-06 ) , following a tip by Markus Kuhn : Pam Belluck reported in the New York Times ( 2001 -01 - 31 ) that the Indiana Legislature is considering a bill to adopt DST statewide .
Her article mentioned Vevay , whose post office observes a different
time zone from Danner ’s Hardware across the street .
I love this one about the cranky Portuguese prime minister :
Martin Bruckmann ( 1996-02 - 29 ) reports via Peter Ilieve that Portugal is reverting to 0:00 by not moving its clocks this spring .
The new Prime Minister was fed up with getting up in the dark in the winter .
Of course Gaza could hardly fail to exhibit weirdness :
From Ephraim Silverberg ( 1997-03-04 , 1998-03-16 , 1998-12-28 , 2000-01 -17 and 2000-07-25 ) : According to the Office of the Secretary General of the Ministry of Interior , there is NO set rule for Daylight - Savings / Standard time changes .
One thing is entrenched in law , however : that there must be at least 150 days of daylight savings time annually .
The rule names for this zone are poignant too :
# Zone NAME GMTOFF RULES FORMAT [ UNTIL ] Zone Asia / Gaza 2:17:52 - LMT 1900 Oct 2:00 Zion EET 1948 May 15 2:00 EgyptAsia EE%sT 1967 Jun 5 2:00 Zion I%sT 1996 2:00 Jordan EE%sT 1999 2:00 Palestine EE%sT
There ’s also some wonderful commentary in the various software libraries that embody the Olson database .
Here ’s Stuart Bishop on why pytz , the Python implementation , supports almost all of the Olson timezones :
As Saudi Arabia gave up trying to cope with their timezone definition , I see no reason to complicate my code further to cope with them .
( I understand the intention was to set sunset to 0:00 local time , the start of the Islamic day .
In the best case caused the DST offset to change daily and worst case caused the DST offset to change each instant depending on how you interpreted the ruling . )
It ’s all deliciously absurd .
And according to Paul Eggert , Ben Franklin is having the last laugh :
From Paul Eggert ( 2001-03-06 ) : Daylight Saving
Time was first suggested as a joke by Benjamin Franklin in his whimsical essay “ An Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost of Light ” published in the Journal de Paris ( 1784-04 - 26 ) .
Not everyone is happy with the results .
So is Olson / Zoneinfo / tz a database or a document ?
Clearly both .
And its synthesis of the two modes is , I would argue , a nice example of literate programming .
In a bizarre case involving teen YouTube sensation Justin Bieber and a riotous crowd of his fans , a record exec from Island Def Jam Records was arrested Friday for , among other things , failing to Tweet when told to by authorities .
When the Beiber event at Roosevelt Field mall became unruly ( video below ) , police appealed to the artist 's label to send a Tweet telling the crowd to leave .
When that allegedly did n't happen , police arrested James Roppo , a senior vice president of Island Def Jam Records , for " endangering the welfare of a minor and obstructing government administration " .
An Associated Press feed reads :
Police arrested a vice president from Bieber 's record label , Island Def Jam Records , saying he was n't cooperating with attempts to disperse the crowd .
James Roppo , 44 , of Hoboken , N.J. , was charged with a series of misdemeanours , including endangering the welfare of children and obstructing governmental administration .
" We asked for his help in getting the crowd to go away by sending out a Twitter message , " said Nassau County Police Det. Lt. Kevin Smith .
" By not cooperating with us , we feel he put lives in danger and the public at risk . "
The report does n't put the police in a good light , especially considering that Bieber 's feed does contain Tweets asking the crowd to leave .
But all may not be as it seems : contrary to the AP reports , the NY Daily News implies that the arrest was for sending out updates that Bieber was signing autographs even after the crowd had dispersed .
Roppo is pleading not guilty to the charges .

RAICHUR : You ca n’t google in Google .
For , Google , a tiny village about 510 km north - east of Bangalore , does n’t have internet connectivity .
This village on the banks of the Krishna river in Raichur district , with just about 1,000 residents , is far removed from the search engine company based in Mountain View , California .
And how you spell the name in English is left to you as all signboards here , including those of government offices , are in Kannada .
When the government tried to put up English boards , activists stopped them .
‘‘ We asked officials if anyone from Cambridge University would come here to read these boards , ’’ laughs Kannada activist K P Yallayyanayaka .
No wonder then that only a few villagers have heard of their famous namesake in cyberspace .
‘‘ My grand - daughter told me that two boys have named a website after our village .
I feel happy and proud , ’’ says landlord Basavarajappa Gouda Police Patil .
‘‘ Who ’ll not be happy to know the name of our village is so popular in the cyber world ?
But this is just a pleasant coincidence .
Americans will have totally different reasons for naming their company Google , ’’ reasons native Sharana Gouda , an agricutural scientist who works in Bellary .
The story goes that 12th century saint poet Allama Prabhu stopped by in the village while travelling from Basava Kalyan to Shreeshailam in Andhra Pradesh .
The cave he stayed in has been described as ‘ Gavi Gallu ’ ( cave of stone ) , say villagers .
‘‘ Our village was hence called Gavi Gallu .
Over the years , it became Googallu and now it ’s Google , ’’ says Gouda .
As proof , residents point to the temple atop the underground cave now .
Devotees crawl through a hole in the ground to enter the cave , which has an idol of Allama Prabhu and a small well .
Experts , however , point to a piece of history that they say is closer to the truth .
‘‘ The Helavas , who went around telling people about their ancestral history , say the village was named after rocks that seemed to sing , ’’ says writer Chidananda Sali .
The name comes from ‘ Kooguva Kallu ’ ( stones that make a pleasant sound when river water strikes them ) , he says .
‘‘ The sound was n’t produced by river water but by people who wanted to communicate with villagers in far - off places , ’’ explains S K Aruni , assistant director of Indian Council of Historical Research .
‘‘ In ancient times , people would send signals to far - off villages by hitting rocks with small sonorous stones .
This produced cup - like marks in the rocks .
Prehistoric rocks with such cup marks are found in several places in the Krishna river basin , such as Watkal , Hunasagi , Hebbal Burj and other villages in Gulbarga and Raichur districts .
So , it ’s possible that a village with such rocks was called Kooguva Kallu , ’’ he adds .

The chairman of the Iraq Inquiry has insisted Tony Blair will give evidence in public , while rejecting claims the panel is being too secretive .
Sir John Chilcot said his team had not been " trying to ambush witnesses or score points " , but denied they had not been tough enough on witnesses so far .
Mr Blair is due to appear before the inquiry in the New Year .
In his statement , Sir John also said hearings would not take place during next year 's general election campaign .
" We are determined to remain firmly outside party politics , " he said .
" We have informed members of Parliament that we are ready to meet them if they want an explanation of our working methods , but the inquiry should not be used as a platform for political advantage . "
' Absolutely clear ' Sir John made his remarks before suspending public hearings of the inquiry for Christmas .
Earlier this week , the live video feed of a witness 's testimony was halted for just over a minute for reasons of national security , prompting some accusations of secrecy .
But Sir John said there was " an exceptional level of openness " , which had led to a huge amount of " valuable and illuminating evidence " being gleaned already .
AT THE INQUIRY BBC World Affairs correspondent Peter Biles
Over the past four weeks , there have been some suggestions that the mood inside the inquiry room is too cosy .
The Liberal Democrats have likened it to " a gentlemen 's club " .
But in his statement today , Sir John sought to justify the committee 's methodical approach , insisting : " We are not here to provide public sport or entertainment . "
So a picture of what happened in Iraq between 2001 and 2009 is slowly being built up , piece by piece .
We now know that the inquiry has not yet asked the government to declassify documents to allow them to be published .
This will be done as ministers and other senior figures are called to give evidence in the new year .
When the public hearings resume in January , all eyes will be on Tony Blair and his justification for taking Britain to war .
UN Iraq blast ' hindered UK work ' " My colleagues and I remain committed to hearing as much of the evidence in public as possible , " he continued .
" Evidence will only be heard in private in the narrow circumstances we have set out in the protocols on our website .
" But I would like to be absolutely clear about this - evidence sessions with key decision - makers , including the former prime minister , will be in public .
" They will be openly questioned about the big issues that they were involved in . "
The probe has heard from 38 witnesses to date , including civil servants and senior military figures involved in the run-up to and aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
Sir John said : " This is a serious inquiry and we are not here to provide public sport or entertainment .
" We 've been asking fair questions , and been expecting and getting full and truthful answers .
" That is the essence of a formal public inquiry and witnesses have responded to this approach by being commendably open and candid . "
He added that he expected to begin seeking the declassification of relevant documents concerning the war early in the new year .

The Harris County District Attorney 's office has asked criminal Court - at - Law Judge Reagan
Helm to remove himself from two family violence cases because of “ deep - seated bias and prejudice . ”
In motions filed Thursday , prosecutors said Helm has a history of making inappropriate comments to assistant district attorneys , victims and defendants .
“ These comments also signal to the victims and the community that Judge Helm believes that family violence cases are simply escalated domestic disputes , ‘ stupidly ' initiated and wasting his time , ” according to the motions .
Prosecutors cited five specific cases and what they called a general pattern of admonishing men accused of family violence that the women who are accusing them have them “ by the balls . ”
Helm called the allegations “ ridiculous ” and said he would not recuse himself .
“ If I ever say something like that , it 's hyperbole .
It 's something that does n't mean anything , ” Helm said .
“ I handle my court the same way everyone else handles their court . ”
In one case , according to Thursday 's motions , Helm phoned a woman who wanted an emergency protective order .
Sitting at the bench , Helm asked how she would pay for groceries and take care of her children without her husband .
“ He looks like a real killer to me .
You 're telling me you are afraid of him ? ”
Helm is alleged to have said .
The case was dismissed after the wife refused to participate in the prosecution .
Three of the cases cited were dismissed after accusers recanted or refused to cooperate .
Two are pending .
In another , Helm allegedly told a defendant accused of threatening his wife , “ It 's a disaster .
You married a disaster . ”
In two other cases , prosecutors said , Helm expressed his irritation at ordering motions for emergency protective orders then removing them when victims recant .
Prosecutors also said Helm refused to sign off on a 2008 plea deal after a man pleaded guilty to assaulting his girlfriend .
The man 's attorney disputed the allegation Thursday , saying Helm did not act inappropriately .
If Helm refuses to recuse himself , prosecutors could ask for a hearing from an administrative judge to rule on the request .
Typically a tool of the defense , prosecutors rarely request recusals .
Prosecutors were tight - lipped Thursday about why they chose to file the motions now .
Donna Hawkins , assistant district attorney and office spokeswoman , would only say that prosecutors anticipate presenting evidence in support of the motion during a formal proceeding .
A 68 - year - old Republican , Helm has presided over Harris County Criminal Court at Law No. 1 since 2002 .
There are 15 Harris County criminal court - at - law judges , who are elected to four - year terms .
They preside over misdemeanor criminal cases and appeals of misdemeanor cases from municipal and justice of the peace courts .

Frugality sites are full of advice for cutting your expenses right away .
Everybody 's got a list of unnecessary expenses , an exhortation not to buy stuff you do n't need , and some ideas for how you can get the things you do need more cheaply .
Living cheaply for the long term is different .
Call it " strategic frugality . "
Most people do n't really have a goal to live cheaply .
Rather , within the constraints of their income and their important long - term goals ( like college for the kids and retirement ) , they want to live as well as they can .
The problem is , boosting your living standard at each opportunity makes it impossible to take the strategic actions that let you live better for less .
( And once you 've got that down , funding your long - term goals gets a lot easier . )
Many of these strategies cost money , which means that they 're not an option for someone who's in the midst of a financial emergency like a loss of income or a major unexpected expense .
For that , see my emergency belt - tightening post with a bunch of ideas on how you can cut your expenses right now .
Living cheaply on a non-emergency basis is different .
Living cheaply for the long term sometimes involves spending more money now with an eye toward long - term savings .
Many of the basic ideas are pretty obvious , but it 's worth putting them all together and looking at the pattern they form .
Strategies
Buy stuff that lasts .
This saves money , because you do n't need to replace the item as often .
It also raises your standard of living , because stuff that lasts is often higher quality .
Buy stuff that reduces future expenses .
Things like weatherstripping , insulation , energy - star appliances , a fuel - efficient car , a small motorcycle , or a bicycle can all save on future fuel costs .
Doing proper maintenance can save on future repair costs , and proper preventative care can save on future health costs .
Tools , books , and classes that enable you to make ( or repair ) your own stuff can save on future expenses .
Stock up when things are cheap .
This saves money , because you 're getting the stuff at a better price .
It also raises your standard of living , because you do n't have to rush off to the store to get something ( or else decide to make do without it ) .
As a bonus , it produces huge tax - free investment returns .
Buy things that earn money .
That is , invest in things like bonds and dividend - paying stocks .
If you can handle the extra work of being a landlord , you can also invest in rental property .
Take care of your stuff .
This goes along with buying things that last , but it 's a concept that is n't well supported by society these days .
It 's tough to get things that are made to last — most things are made to break .
Still , despite planned obsolescence , most things will last longer with gentle use and many things can be repaired ( or kept in service , at least temporarily , despite not working as well as they did when new ) .
Best practices
When you want something , it 's easy to fool yourself into imagining that whatever it is will somehow save money in the long run .
( Such as thinking that a home theater will pay for itself in fewer movie tickets or that a fitness center membership will pay for itself in fewer heart bypass operations . )
Avoiding that pitfall simply requires being honest with yourself .
To that end , here are a few best practices .
Evaluate your budget against your needs .
Even among people who have a budget , most simply assume that last year 's spending is the benchmark against which they need to compare .
Instead , start each budget category at zero .
Then , evaluate what you actually need and investigate the cheapest way to fill that need .
Analyze fixed costs .
The average household has a bunch of costs that are fixed for the medium term — a lease that runs for a year , a cell - phone contract that runs for two , a car loan that runs for several years , a mortgage that runs for a decade or three .
You can often get a better deal if you commit to an expense for a longer term , and a collection of such deals is what adds up to living cheaply .
Still , always think twice before buying things that come with monthly fees or that need to be insured , fed , or maintained ( unless you can maintain them yourself ) .
The more fixed costs you have , the less flexible your household cost structure becomes — and an inflexible cost structure makes it tough to handle a financial emergency .
Learn how to do things yourself .
If your goal is the highest possible standard of living , you probably come out ahead by putting all your time into whatever is your main way to earn money .
In the time it would take to change your oil you can earn more than enough to pay someone to change it for you .
In the time it would take just to plant a garden you can earn enough to buy a whole summer 's worth of vegetables .
But if your goal is to live cheaply for the long term , learning how to do things yourself adds a whole category of cost saving options , while at the same time recovering some of the flexibility you 'd otherwise lose to fixed costs .
Having said all that , a lot of keeping costs down is just spending less .
If you do n't do that , none of this other stuff is going to add up to much .
Still , there are certain opportunities where spending a little more up - front , or committing to spending for a little longer , can save money .
The key to living cheaply for the long term is cranking the numbers to figure out which option is cheapest — and then , of course , taking action in accordance with what you figure out .
Trying to decide if your next sewing project will need a twin or full - sized sheet ?
Here ’s how to convert standard sheet sizes into yardage .
I thrift a lot , and I sew a lot .
When I sew , I try to use primarily thrifted or recycled or otherwise unwanted materials , and when I thrift , a large part of what I ’m searching for is material to sew with–T - shirts , button - down shirts , pants , sweaters , pillowcases , curtains , sheets , etc .
If I find any of these items in good shape and at a good price , and if they sport an especially appealing pattern or image , then I add them to my fabric stash for later crafting .
One of the trickier components of sewing using these thrifted items , however , is knowing how much fabric there actually is there , and therefore what you can sew with it .
I know from experience that I can sew one skirt and and one pair of matching leggings for my three - year - old from one adult - sized stretchy cotton or acrylic sweater , but is the queen - sized sheet that I picked up at a yard sale last summer enough to make matching pajama pants for me , my husband , and both our girls ?
How do standard sheet sizes translate when you ’re looking at a sewing pattern ?
Questions like that are much easier to answer when you know the standard yardages for standard sheet sizes .
Here are the standard sheet sizes for flat sheets ( easier to work with and always less worn than the fitted sheet ) and their translations into yardages :
Crib Flat Sheet : 42″ 72 ″ .
This equals two yards of 42 ″ - wide fabric .
42″72 ″ .
This equals two yards of 42 ″ - wide fabric .
Twin Flat Sheet : 66″x96 ″ .
This equals a smidge over two and two - third yards of 66 ″ - wide fabric .
66″x96 ″ .
This equals a smidge over two and two - third yards of 66 ″ - wide fabric .
Twin Extra Long Flat Sheet : 66″x102 ″ .
This equals a little over two and three - quarter yards of 66 ″ - wide fabric .
66″x102 ″ .
This equals a little over two and three - quarter yards of 66 ″ - wide fabric .
Full or Double Flat Sheet : 81″x96 ″ .
This equals , lengthwise , a smidge over two and two - third yards of 81 ″ fabric .
The fabric is wide enough , however , that you can turn it the other way if the print works sideways .
Widthwise , the fabric equals 2.25 yards of 96 ″ - wide fabric .
81″x96 ″ .
This equals , lengthwise , a smidge over two and two - third yards of 81 ″ fabric .
The fabric is wide enough , however , that you can turn it the other way if the print works sideways .
Widthwise , the fabric equals 2.25 yards of 96 ″ - wide fabric .
Queen Flat Sheet : 90″x102 ″ .
This equals a little over two and three - quarter yards of 90 ″ - wide fabric .
Used sideways , widthwise , the fabric equals 2.5 yards of 102 ″ - wide fabric .
90″ x102 ″ .
This equals a little over two and three - quarter yards of 90 ″ - wide fabric .
Used sideways , widthwise , the fabric equals 2.5 yards of 102 ″ - wide fabric .
King Flat Sheet : 108″ x102 ″ .
This fabric is longest when turned sideways .
Widthwise , the fabric equals three yards of 102 ″ - wide fabric .
Used lengthwise , the fabric equals a little over two and three - quarter yards of 108 ″ - wide fabric .
108″ x102 ″ .
This fabric is longest when turned sideways .
Widthwise , the fabric equals three yards of 102 ″ - wide fabric .
Used lengthwise , the fabric equals a little over two and three - quarter yards of 108 ″ - wide fabric .
California King Flat Sheet : 102″ x110 ″ .
This equals a smidge over three yards of 102 ″ - wide fabric .
Widthwise , the fabric equals a little over two and three - quarter yards of 110 ″ - wide fabric .
Whew !
Now you can invent your own projects using sheets , or apply this yardage to an existing pattern to see if your sheet will work .
P.S. A queen - sized flat sheet turned out to be enough to make one adult and two children ’s pairs of pajama pants , although one child ’s pants had to have the pattern turned sideways on one side to fit .
I made the children ’s pants very roomy , however –with a better - fitting pattern , I might be able to squeeze in all three pants going the right way .
The scientists at the University of East Anglia 's Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) and the people who funded them did not know how utterly useless the CRU is .
All the research done at the CRU made no difference whatsoever to the " science " of global warming .
Just ask other scientists and global warming alarmists .
Heck , ask CRU .
You think CRU was the only source of raw thermometer data going back 150 years ?
Nope , there are two others .
So who cares if CRU " lost " theirs ?
You think CRU did science that showed warming trends ?
So what ?
Their conclusions were the same as everyone else 's .
Phil Jones , head of CRU , said that .
Our global temperature series tallies with those of other , completely independent , groups of scientists working for Nasa and the National Climate Data Centre in the United States , among others .
Even if you were to ignore our findings , theirs show the same results .
In fact , all that nonsense about thermometers , stations , adjustments , tree rings , ice cores , etc. -- all totally useless .
Just look at the polar ice caps : one of them is shrinking .
Eugene Robinson , Megan McArdle , and Katie Couric said that .
In fact , we do n't need any data whatsoever .
If there is even the slightest chance that the world might end if the alarmists are right , then the correct policy is to spend humongous gobs of money from now on .
Thomas Friedman said that .
According to Mr. Friedman , it does n't matter at all if the science is " unequivocal " ; we need be only 1 % sure .
Skeptics , your weapons are useless .
The climate alarmists always have something else that trumps whatever evidence you have against their alarmism .
They do n't even need evidence at all -- just an asserted probability as low as 1 % that the world will end if they are right .
( It 's Pascal 's wager for the new age . )
Below is a very brief summary of the conclusions from the climate scientists themselves -- those who believe in man-caused , catastrophic global warming .
The globe warmed about 0.6 o and the oceans rose about six inches in the last hundred years , according to the U.N. IPCC .
( I use Celsius throughout unless otherwise noted . )
We are now in what is called an interglacial period , or the time between ice ages .
Previous interglacial peaks were three degrees warmer than now .
In Antarctica , these previous peaks were actually six degrees warmer .
Since the last ice age , the oceans rose about four hundred feet .
Most of that occurred before the pyramids were built ( and well before modern use of fossil fuels ) , but the trend for hundreds of years up to the present has been rising sea levels .
The sea ice of the south polar ice cap has grown in the last thirty years .
Climate scientists have fairly recently recognized a climate cycle they now call the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation .
" The cause of the oscillation is not well understood , but the cycle appears to come round about every 60 to 70 years . "
They think this is why temperatures over the last eight years or so do not show the continued warming their models predicted .
This and other cycles ( Pacific Decadal Oscillation , El Niño , La Niña ) are not included in the IPCC climate models .
The sun does appear to account for " at least 10 to 30 percent of global warming measured during the past two decades , " according to two Duke University physicists .
While they were quick to remind us " that their findings do not argue against the basic theory that significant global warming is occurring because of carbon dioxide and other ' greenhouse ' gases , " they note that IPCC - type climate models do not include any solar influences .
The " ice caps " on Mars shrank over all three years of initial observation by NASA 's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions , 2005 - 2007 .
Glaciers in the northern hemisphere generally have been shrinking for about seven hundred years , while those in the southern hemisphere have been shrinking for the last sixty - five hundred years .
( You might notice that those times precede the modern use of fossil fuels . )
Himalayan glaciers , 230 of the largest mid-latitude glaciers in the world , have been growing since at least 1980 .
One could go on .
Remember , these are the things that climate alarmists generally concede .
So far , I see only slight warming and sea - level rise , nothing that looks unprecedented for an interglacial period , and nothing that looks unnatural .
Everything is totally consistent with a planet that is near an interglacial peak and following cycles of various periods ( from one year to 40,000 years ) that are " not well understood . "
What the alarmists do not mention is that their entire CO2 - as - culprit story depends on the concept of " positive feedback . "
Richard Lindzen , professor of climatology at MIT , explained it .
It is generally accepted that a doubling of CO2 will only produce a change of about two degrees Fahrenheit if all else is held constant .
This is unlikely to be much to worry about .
Yet current climate models predict much higher sensitivities .
They do so because in these models , the main greenhouse substances ( water vapor and clouds ) act to amplify anything that CO2 does .
This is referred to as positive feedback .
But as the IPCC notes , clouds continue to be a source of major uncertainty in current models ...
At this point , few scientists would argue that the science is settled .
In particular , the question remains as to whether water vapor and clouds have positive or negative feedbacks .
William Happer , Cyrus Fogg Bracket Professor of Physics at Princeton University , went further .
With each passing year , experimental observations further undermine the claim of a large positive feedback from water .
In fact , observations suggest that the feedback is close to zero and may even be negative .
That is , water vapor and clouds may actually diminish the already small global warming expected from CO2 , not amplify it .
In short , if the " positive feedback " hypothesis is false , and " experimental observations " so far say it is , then the case for global warming alarmism completely falls apart .
Do these professors at MIT and Princeton sound like cranks to you ?
Senator Inhofe ( R - OK ) found over 650 such " cranks . "
By the way , these people have " Ph.D. " after their names .
But let 's get back to Thomas Friedman 's formulation -- the formulation in which physical observations become moot .
Upon entering Friedman 's world , we talk only of costs and probabilities .
Not just possibilities , but probabilities .
Otherwise , we could invoke the possibility of the planet - eating Flying Spaghetti Monster of atheist fame and justify spending every cent we have to combat it .
( Actually , Friedman 's calculus is not far from that . )
( Freidman is not the only one to propose his argument .
It is used throughout the blogosphere by those who think they can avoid all hard thinking and all hard data with some magical , logical QED that trumps everything . )
The cost of fighting global warming has recently been estimated .
As reported in The Washington Post ,
With enough technological advances , the world could get to a dramatically lower level of greenhouse gas emissions at a cost of between one and three percent of global GDP per year , according to a report issued Tuesday by a group of economists .
That price tag is in line with previous economic estimates aimed at meeting more modest climate goals .
The world 's GDP in 2008 was about $ 70 trillion .
So 1 % to 3 % of that is $ 700 billion to $ 2.1 trillion .
Per year .
Let 's call it two trillion every year from here out .
To justify an expense of $ 2 trillion per year to avoid catastrophe , the " expected cost " of catastrophe must be at least $ 2 trillion per year .
The expected cost is the product of the probability of catastrophe and the cost of catastrophe .
That is
( Probability of catastrophe ) X ( Cost of catastrophe ) > $ 2 trillion
If we think the probability of catastrophic warming is just 1 % , then we would have to assume that the cost of such catastrophic warming would be $ 200 trillion per year to make our abatement cost worthwhile .
That is almost triple the entire world 's GDP !
How can the cost be more than everything we have or could ever hope to have ?
Recall that this probability must include the combined probability that ( 1 ) the globe is getting warmer , ( 2 ) it is due to man 's use of fossil fuels , ( 3 ) the warming is catastrophically bad , ( 4 ) the only remedy is drastic curtailment of fossil fuel use by man , and ( 5 ) all the governments of the world will actually implement such a policy .
On top of that , we must include the probability that the remedy must be implemented immediately to be effective .
Waiting even another decade or two for more evidence would be too late .
Larrey Anderson put this combined probability at 2.8 % using generous assumptions .
That 's not too far from Friedman 's claim of " a lot higher than 1 percent . "
If we bump up the probability to a generous 3 % , the cost of catastrophe would have to be almost $ 67 trillion to justify the $ 2 trillion cost of abatement .
That is almost the entire world 's GDP .
Every year .
How many of you think the cost of catastrophic global warming is wiping out mankind or sending him back to " cannibalism , " as Ted Turner claimed ?
Even if we give the climate alarmists the benefit of the doubt and call the probability of catastrophe even , or 50 - 50 , then the cost of catastrophic global warming would have to exceed $ 4 trillion per year , or about 6 % of global GDP .
Every year .
That is the combined GDP of approximately 145 of the 227 countries in the CIA World Factbook .
Do we really think the costs of catastrophic warming are that high -- the equivalent of completely wiping out two - thirds of the planet , or even the entire planet ?
You can formulate the problem as Friedman does .
But to get the answer he gets requires extreme assumptions ... extreme in the probability of catastrophe and extreme in the cost of catastrophe .
The IPCC 's worst - case scenario over the next hundred years is a temperature rise of 4o ( 7.2o F ) and a sea - level rise of 26 to 59 centimeters ( 10 to 23 inches ) .
Why would that wipe us out ?
The average annual temperature in Memphis , Tennessee is 62.3o F .
The temperature of Lexington , Kentucky is 54.9o F .
That is a bigger difference than the IPCC 's worst - case scenario .
Could mankind handle that kind of adaptation -- moving from Memphis to Lexington in the next hundred years ?
Thomas Friedman thinks it 's worth $ 2 trillion a year to avoid even the slightest probability of that .
I do agree with the climate alarmists on something : CRU 's findings and CRU 's e-mails did not affect science .
In its day , Paul Thomas Anderson 's oil - drilling epic had to take a back seat to the Coen Brother 's nihilist No Country For Old Men .
But a few years later , this Blood will not be washed out .
The web has come alive with Best Film of the Decade lists .
Unlike Best of the Year lists , where the same dozen or so films appear again and again , Best of the Decades are where a list - making critic can really take wings and fly , revealing their inner soul through their choices .
Are you a Lost in Translation type or a Memento - ite ?
The choice says everything , and nothing , about the list makers .
So what we 've done is added up all the Best lists we could find online — from the New Yorker to spitefulcritic.com ; anywhere where people had made a list .
We gave each film a point for every inclusion on every top ten list .
Some lists made it a bit difficult , doing say an unordered top 15's , but we 've included as much as we can to try and get an accurate count .
Also in the case of multi- film series , such as Lord of the Rings or the Bourne films , some critics placed the entire series on the list , some cast their votes for the individual films .
And when the votes were all in , by a nose , There Will Be Blood stood alone at the top of the decade , its straw in the whole damn cinema 's milkshake .
Some other interesting findings :
Really this has to be considered a huge moral victory for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .
Barely noticed by Oscar , relatively little discussed so many years later , the Gondry / Charlie Kaufman film came just one vote away from taking the entire decade .
When one looks at how spread out the voting is , one can't help but see how few consensus masterpieces there were in this decade .
A mere 11 films get more than 5 votes .
Perhaps the most discussed filmmaker of the decade , Michael Moore , barely registers , getting just two votes for Farenheit 9/11 and one for Bowling for Columbine .
Many of the decades other high profile auteurs also barely crack the list : No Wes Anderson and Quentin Tarantino gets higher than the four vote level .
Judd Apatow and Alexander Payne fail to rise above three votes .
Clint Eastwood and David Cronenberg above two .
Steven Speilberg bizarrely scores a high ranking in the voting only because of Catch Me If You Can , which inexplicably received six votes for a highly forgettable film .
Other than that , no Speilberg film received more than a single vote .
The highest grossing series of the decade , the Harry Potter films , gets body - slammed by the listmakers with just one vote .
If the Pixar movies had been one series , it would have won the decade .
Easily .
Foreign films predictably are largely ignored by the listmakers .
Brazil 's City of God is the highest ranking with six votes .
This was a rough decade for comedy , with very few films seemingly entering the canon .
The highest ranking and thereby best comedies of the decade are 40 Year Old Virgin and Anchorman , each of which scored three votes .
Overall certainly no one could say that masterpieces were pouring out of every crevice during the zeroes .
But looking at the list overall , one can feel mildly content that there were in fact a pretty large number of pretty decent films over the last ten years .
We can close the door on a decade of tumult saying in the cinema front at least , if not in the peace and economic stability front , the 00's can go home feeling content about a job well done .

Chris Floyd Published : 12 November 2009 Hits : 14616
The New York Times is shocked -- shocked ! -- to find personal enrichment of American elites at the heart of the rape and gutting of Iraq .
Who could possibly have ever foreseen such a scenario as the Times revealed on Thursday , describing how " influential American adviser " Peter Galbraith helped " ram through " highly controversial provisions in the constitution that the occupying force and its collaborators imposed – provisions that could put more than $ 100 million in Galbraith 's pocket .
Of course , Galbraith 's war - profiteering machinations are hardly unique ; the roll call of " advisers " and officials and other insiders feasting on Iraqi corpseflesh is longer than the Mississippi , and considerably more muddy .
Just this week , the Financial Times noted that another gaggle of occupation geese , " including Zalmay Khalilzad , former US ambassador to Baghdad , and Jay Garner , " the first appointed satrap of the conquered land , are now cashing in on their blood - soaked connections in Iraq .
Given the fact of the rampant corruption among the murder - mongering elite , one might darkly suspect that this sudden spotlight on Galbraith could be related to the embarrassment he recently caused to the Obama administration , which ordered the UN to fire him from his special envoy post after he insisted on a full investigation of the massive fraud in the Afghan elections .
( Although one can't but wonder now if Galbraith took this principled stand only after failing to cut some juicy sweetheart deal with Hamid Karzai . )
However , although the Afghan imbroglio might have played some part in the prominence accorded the revelations by the Times ( A call from Rahm to the editorial offices , perhaps : " Galbraith 's fair game now ; let him have it " ) , the story itself was initially unearthed by journalists in Norway , investigating Galbraith 's ties to the Norwegian oil giant , DNO .
And what a sordid little saga it is .
As the Times notes :
Galbraith , an influential former American ambassador , is a powerful voice on Iraq who helped shape the views of policy makers like Joseph R. Biden Jr. and John Kerry .
In the summer of 2005 , he was also an adviser to the Kurdish regional government as Iraq wrote its Constitution — tough and sensitive talks not least because of issues like how Iraq would divide its vast oil wealth .
Now Mr. Galbraith , 58 , son of the renowned economist John Kenneth Galbraith , stands to earn perhaps a hundred million or more dollars as a result of his closeness to the Kurds , his relations with a Norwegian oil company and constitutional provisions he helped the Kurds extract .
In the constitutional negotiations , he helped the Kurds ram through provisions that gave their region — rather than the central Baghdad government — sole authority over many of their internal affairs , including clauses that he maintains will give the Kurds virtually complete control over all new oil finds on their territory ....
[ The investigations ] reveal in considerable detail that he received rights to an enormous stake in at least one of Kurdistan ’s oil fields in the spring of 2004 .
As it turns out , Mr. Galbraith received the rights after he helped negotiate a potentially lucrative contract that allowed the Norwegian oil company DNO to drill for oil in the promising Dohuk region of Kurdistan , the interviews and documents show ...
When drillers struck oil in a rich new field called Tawke in December 2005 , no one but a handful of government and business officials and members of Mr. Galbraith ’s inner circle knew that the constitutional provisions he had pushed through only months earlier could enrich him so handsomely .
As the scope of Mr. Galbraith ’s financial interests in Kurdistan become clear , they have the potential to inflame some of Iraqis ’ deepest fears , including conspiracy theories that the true reason for the American invasion of their country was to take its oil .
It may not help that outside Kurdistan , Mr. Galbraith ’s influential view that Iraq should be broken up along ethnic lines is considered offensive to many Iraqis ’ nationalism .
Oh , our good Gray Lady !
She just can't help herself , can she ?
Even as the Times publishes an actually excellent story outlining vile corruption in high places , it is still fretfully anxious to assure its readers that America 's intentions are always pure , always good , despite any " mistakes " or the inevitable " bad apples . "
Hence the reference to Iraqi " conspiracy theories " that the American invasion was about taking their oil .
Poor little primitives .
Of course it was n't just about taking their oil .
As the Times ' own Thomas Friedman tells us ( via Arthur Silber ) , it was also about America 's need " to hit someone in the Arab - Muslim world " to assert its dominance .
It was also about " the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf [ which ] transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein , " as the elitist faction PNAC told us back in September 2000 ( along with their open yearning for a " new Pearl Harbor " to " catalyze " the American people into support the militarist agenda ) .
It was also about the hundreds of billions of dollars in government pork and outright graft that the invasion and occupation have provided to a select and powerful few .
It was about our elites ' profound psychological and sexual anxieties that evidently cannot be quelled without resort to violence , destruction , repression and mass death inflicted on innocent people .
No , the American invasion of Iraq was about a lot of other things besides " taking their oil . "
But by God , taking their oil was sure enough a great big part of it .
The recent Jay Garner story has that black gold at its corroded heart as well , as the FT reports :
Mr Garner , the de-facto US governor of Iraq after the war , sat on the board of Vast Exploration when it bought 37 per cent of a Kurdistan oil block two years ago and remains an adviser to the Canadian company .
“ Jay is very well known in Kurdistan and Iraq and it was useful to the company , ” said a spokesman for Vast .
This kind of war profiteering goes back to the very beginnings of the illegal war of aggression -- and it goes up to the very top .
For example , here 's a piece I wrote way back in December 2003 , about the Bush family 's direct involvement in blood money .
In detailing the cornucopia of dodgy , dirty dealing that is Neil Bush , I noted this :
Now comes the sweetest deal of all – enriched by the blood sugar seeping out from the bodies of American soldiers and Iraqi civilians .
Yes , Neil has dipped his silver spoon into the reconstruction gravy being ladled out by his brother George , the White House warlord .
Neil is now being paid a fat annual fee to " help companies secure contracts in Iraq , " the Financial Times reports .
Bush is co-chairman of a pork funnel called Crest Investment Corporation .
His partner , Jamal Daniel , is wired into the chief private conduit of war profits , New Bridge Strategies , a lobbying firm packed with Bush family retainers , many of whom left government service this spring to leap into the Iraq money pit .
And what does Neil do to earn his crust of bloodsoaked bread ?
He told the divorce court that he " answers the phone when Jamal Daniel calls to ask for advice . "
And what does Jamal Daniel get out of this unusual arrangement ?
Why , he gets to say , " I was just talking to my partner , the president 's brother " when he 's negotiating with Bush administration officials to win " reconstruction " contracts for his clients .
As long as Brother George keeps tossing cannon fodder into the Iraqi cauldron , Brother Neil will keep padding his fat Bush wallet .
The idea behind the $ 787 billion stimulus bill is that government can create jobs by spending money .
For now , let 's ignore fact , history , and economic theory and assume that government spending can actually create jobs .
In that case , we should expect the government to invest relatively more money in the states that have the highest unemployment rates and less money in the states with lower unemployment rates .
So let 's check the data .
Using numbers from President Obama 's website Recovery.gov and the Bureau of Labor Statistics , this chart plots the amount of stimulus funds spent per person in each state and the corresponding unemployment rate in that state .
The solid blue line shows what the allocation of funds should look like if the administration was allocating relatively more money to the states with higher unemployment rates .
Yet , with a few exceptions , the data show that this is not the case .
Many higher - unemployment states are getting far fewer stimulus dollars than lower - unemployment states .
Take Michigan , for instance .
Michigan 's 15.2 percent unemployment rate is the highest in the country .
So far , it has received $ 403 per person in stimulus funds .
That 's above the average stimulus per person across all states ( $ 326 ) .
However , it 's lower than the $ 409 per person that the state of Vermont , a state with relatively low unemployment ( 6.8 percent ) , has received so far .
Michigan 's per-person take is also much lower than the $ 707 per person the District of Columbia received .
D.C.'s unemployment rate is 9.9 percent .
Now look at the state with the lowest unemployment rate in the country : North Dakota .
It 's getting $ 253 per person with a 4.3 percent unemployment rate .
Many other states are receiving roughly the same amount of stimulus funds per person despite much higher rates of unemployment .
Which suggests that stimulus funds are being allocated without thought to the level of unemployment within states .
If government spending could in fact create jobs , then the problem of unemployment could be mitigated by distributing funds to states based on their relative unemployment levels .
But that 's not being done at all .
Instead , funds are being distributed randomly , as quickly as possible , among the states .
That in turn suggests something else :
Even the federal government does n't believe the myth that government spending can actually create jobs .

IS THE ZHU ZHU PET THE MOST DANGEROUS TOY EVER CREATED BY SATAN AND HIS ARMY OF RED - HOOFED DEMONS IN HELL ?
As always , Satan 's shopping list of Christmas gifts are guaranteed to make any Christian parent call their state Senator after slapping their rebellious child across the face for ruining Christmas !
We 'd like to prevent that from happening .
At least the slapping part .
The following Christmas toys are banned from purchase .
Be warned :
If one of these items is found in your home or on your person , then you 'll have to find yourself another place to worship , for you are no longer welcome at this Godly church .
6. Zhu Zhu Pet Hamsters :
Recent Fox
News stories inform us that the noses of these demonic rodents are covered with chemicals that will kill your child and send them straight to Hell .
Please make sure you child is saved and will go to Heaven before they are killed by this dangerous Christmas toy .
These soft wiggling , sniffing creatures with moist , lubricated snouts ( covered with chemicals to kill children ) appear innocent enough , but their alluring squeaks are what REALLY have informed Christian parents worried .
When our Deacons spent a leisurely afternoon playing with them and watching them walk through hoses , their muffled squeaks were heard squawking out lewd remarks !
" Come hither and sniff my nose , precious child ! "
To think that little children across America will be sitting in their bedrooms alone , playing and listening to these hairy little rodents should make your skin crawl !
If you are thinking about purchasing one , there is a way you can rip open a Zhu Zhu 's neck through its lubricated chemical snout after covering it in Crisco Oil™ .
This will remove the hamster 's obstructive vocal cord and make it pliable for burning on an altar of the Lord .
If you are inviting a Zhu Zhu Pet into your home this Christmas , save yourself some pain and make sure it can't talk and it has a snipped snout !
2. Toy Story 3 Talking Buddies :
Our Christian mole in Hollywood informs us that Buzz Lightyear and Woody will be planning a gay toy marriage in their next film .
As part of Hollywood 's marketing campaign , and in a liberal effort to desensitize children to the homosexual agenda , Disney is releasing the " Talking Buddy " set this Christmas .
" Let 's take this friendship to another level , " says Woody ( that name is already enough to make a Christian parent flinch ) .
Even more disturbing is that each character comes with a removable shirt .
Do you want to see your conservative child playing with topless toys under the Christmas Tree ?
Look to landoverebaptist.org for updates as we petition Congress to put an R rating on Toy Story 3 before it is released next year .*
3. Scientific Explorer 's Mind Blowing
Science Kit :
When will scientists learn that a Holy Bible and a box of chicken bones provides children with more knowledge and fun than any silly science kit they can ever come up with ?
This so - called , " kit , " will have your child performing dangerous experiments that will make them question the existence of our omniscient God .
The Mind Blowing Science Kit , at least does what it says it does - it blows a child 's mind wide open !
An open mind is the Devil 's Playground - susceptible to demonic spirits !
Atheist liberals sell these kits to promote " rational thought . "
Well , as any True Christian™ will tell you , there is NOTHING rational about Evolution and science .
Children who are exposed to this kit will one day die and go to Hell , where they will have all the time in the world to use " rational thought " to figure out why they are being burned alive in a lake of fire while being sodomized by demons for all eternity !
4. Radio Flyer Little Red Roadster :
The beloved , innocent toy of our Christian youth has been retrofitted and redesigned by sodomites to resemble a drooping , semi-aroused red penis !
Is there no shame left in this world ?
How a Godly little red wagon turned into a symbol for Gay rights , and passes unnoticed to even the most conservative family is beyond the Christian imagination !
Who wants to see their Baptist child giggling in glee as they ride a mockery of Americana down a public sidewalk in open support of the Homosexual Agenda ?
While conservatives sleep and do nothing , gays are actively taking over everything we hold dear !
And that includes the Radio Flyer Association™ !
So , even if you want to purchase an old - fashioned flyer that does n't look like an engorged penis , your money will most certainly go to helping place homosexual teachers in your local elementary school !
5. Barack Obama : Son of Promise ,
Child of Hope Book :
We 're all for Black people feeling better about themselves , and what better way to raise a colored child to grow up to be a waiter who does n't spit in your food , or a sanitation worker who does n't spill your garbage on the curb .
This book could have accomplished that , but since it was written by an angry , liberal racist , it is " Pro Obama . "
Which means that any child who reads it will grow up to become a person who spits on American values and spills the hard earned cash of decent , God-fearing Americans onto the gravel and dirt driveways of the lazy and incompetent !
It has NO place in a Christian home !
1. Little Dora ( All Dora Products Banned Until Further Notice ! ) :
The Little Dora character was cooked up a few years ago by liberals as a tool " to force conservative children into questioning their racial identity and Christian heritage . "
This year , Dora looks more " Oriental . "
A modification obviously made so that children who play with her , will be more accepting of President Obama 's loose policies toward Japan and China .
Children who are exposed to Little Dora , will grow up to be the next generation of liberal adults who embrace a world currency and help destroy America by toppling the United States ' status as the world 's most powerful nation .
If you love your child , and you love America , please keep them away from Little Dora and any of her related products , including the Fisher Price Dora Kitchen set ( an underhanded attempt to target the conservative female child demographic ) .
7. Jump Start the Gay Lifestyle Trampoline for Boys :
When homosexuals were asked to share their earliest memory about choosing to be gay , 87 % of them started their story by saying , " Well , my earliest memory was playing on a trampoline as a young boy . "
And as such , we acknowledge that the use of a trampoline by a male child , is one of the leading causes of homosexuality !
And now gay toy designers openly attack conservative Christians by not only creating a triangular trampoline ( designed to mock the Holy Trinity ) but to add insult to injury , they paint it in the colors of a rainbow !
A sacred symbol the Homosexuals stole from God , who gave it to Noah as a promise
He would forever stop killing people ( except for Asians ) by drowning !
This toy has NO place in a Christian home !
Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have developed a theoretical model that informs the understanding of evolution and determines how quickly an organism will evolve using a catalogue of " evolutionary speed limits . "
The model provides quantitative predictions for the speed of evolution on various " fitness landscapes , " the dynamic and varied conditions under which bacteria , viruses and even humans adapt .
A major conclusion of the work is that for some organisms , possibly including humans , continued evolution will not translate into ever - increasing fitness .
Moreover , a population may accrue mutations at a constant rate -- a pattern long considered the hallmark of " neutral " or non-Darwinian evolution -- even when the mutations experience Darwinian selection .
While much is known about the qualitative aspects of evolutionary theory -- that organisms mutate and these mutations are selected by the environment and are gradually absorbed by the entire population , very little is known about how , or how quickly , this is accomplished .
Information on evolution between consecutive generations is hard to come by , and the lack of understanding has real - world implications .
Public - health officials would have an easier time preparing targeted vaccinations , or combating drug resistance , if they understood the evolutionary speed limits on viruses and bacteria such as influenza and M. tuberculosis .
Penn researchers presented a theory of how the fitness of a population will increase over time , for a total of 14 types of underlying landscapes or " speed limits " that describe the consequences of available genetic mutations .
These categories determine the speed and pattern of evolution , predicting how a population 's overall fitness , and the number of accumulated beneficial mutations , are expected to increase over time .
Researchers compared the theory to the data from a two - decades study of E. coli to investigate how the bacterium evolves .
Organisms of that simplicity and size reproduce more rapidly than larger species , providing 40,000 generations of data to study .
" We asked , quantitatively , how a population 's fitness will increase over time as beneficial mutations accrue , " said Joshua B. Plotkin , principal investigator and an assistant professor in the Department of Biology in Penn 's School of Arts and Sciences .
His research focuses on evolution at the molecular scale .

" This was an attempt to provide a theoretical framework for studying rates of molecular evolution , " said first - author Sergey Kryazhimskiy , also of the Department of Biology .
" We applied this theory to infer the underlying fitness landscape of bacteria , using data from a long - term bacterial experiment . " .
In some theoretically conceivable landscapes , fitness levels are expected to increase exponentially forever because of an inexhaustible supply of beneficial mutations .
But in more realistic landscapes the rate of adaptive substitutions ( mutations that improve an organism 's fitness ) eventually lose steam , resulting in sub - linear fitness growth .
In some of these landscapes , the fitness eventually levels out and the organism ceases to adapt , even though mutations may continue to accrue .
E. coli , for example , has been observed to increase its rate of cellular division by roughly 40 percent during the course of 40,000 generations .
Initially , the bacterial fitness increased rapidly , but eventually the fitness leveled out .
These data have allowed the research team to infer that early mutations , while conferring large beneficial effects , also diminish the beneficial effects of subsequent mutations .
According to the study , a population 's fitness and substitution trajectories -- t he mutations acquired to achieve higher fitness -- depend not on the full distribution of fitness effects of available mutations but rather on the expected fixation probability and the expected fitness increment of mutations .
This mathematical observation greatly simplifies the possible trajectories of evolution into 14 distinct categories .
Researchers demonstrated that linear substitution trajectories that signify a constant rate of accruing mutations , long considered the hallmark of neutral evolution , can arise even when mutations are strongly beneficial .
The results provide a basis for understanding the dynamics of adaptation and for inferring properties of an organism 's fitness landscape from long - term experimental data .
Applying these methods to data from bacterial experiments allowed the researchers to characterize the evolutionary relationships among beneficial mutations in the E. coli genome .
The study , appearing in the current issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , was performed by Plotkin and Kryazhimskiy along with Gašper Tkacik of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Penn .
The study was funded by the Burroughs Wellcome Fund , the David and Lucille Packard Foundation , the James S. McDonnell Foundation , the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation , a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency grant and the National Science Foundation .
Nikita Filatov : “ I might stay in KHL for one more year ” ( Photo © khl.ru )
Nikita Filatov , who was loaned to CSKA Moscow by the Columbus Blue Jackets , keeps on doing great in the KHL .
He played 4 games so far and amassed 8 points , scoring 4 goals and giving 4 assists .
Filatov also managed to set a new KHL record , scoring 3 game - winning goals in 3 matches in a row .
RussianHockeyFans.com offers you a translation of his interview published by Sovetskiy Sport , which he gave after yesterday ’s game against Spartak .
– One can see that now you are playing as if you had wings on your back .
Is it because you do n’t have to focus so much on defence in CSKA as you had to in Columbus ?
– Yes , it is .
But I would n’t say that I spend all my time in the offensive zone , I do n’t forget about the defence too .
The defence was the only thing I had been thinking about in the NHL for 1.5 years …
–
But nevertheless you intend to return to the NHL next year .
What can CSKA do to make you stay ?
– The one thing I ’m not thinking about right now is where I will spend next year .
But I would n’t exclude the possibility of staying in CSKA .
A few days before Filatov wrote in his conference on allhockey .ru , answering if there was a chance of him staying in Russia after this season :
Let me quote from a speech that Lawrence Summers , then deputy Treasury secretary ( and now the Obama administration ’s top economist ) , gave in 1999 .
“ If you ask why the American financial system succeeds , ” he said , “ at least my reading of the history would be that there is no innovation more important than that of generally accepted accounting principles : it means that every investor gets to see information presented on a comparable basis ; that there is discipline on company managements in the way they report and monitor their activities . ”
And he went on to declare that there is “ an ongoing process that really is what makes our capital market work and work as stably as it does . ”
So here ’s what Mr. Summers  and , to be fair , just about everyone in a policy - making position at the time  believed in 1999 : America has honest corporate accounting ; this lets investors make good decisions , and also forces management to behave responsibly ; and the result is a stable , well - functioning financial system .
What percentage of all this turned out to be true ?
Zero .
What was truly impressive about the decade past , however , was our unwillingness , as a nation , to learn from our mistakes .
Even as the dot - com bubble deflated , credulous bankers and investors began inflating a new bubble in housing .
Even after famous , admired companies like Enron and WorldCom were revealed to have been Potemkin corporations with facades built out of creative accounting , analysts and investors believed banks ’ claims about their own financial strength and bought into the hype about investments they did n’t understand .
Even after triggering a global economic collapse , and having to be rescued at taxpayers ’ expense , bankers wasted no time going right back to the culture of giant bonuses and excessive leverage .
Then there are the politicians .
Even now , it ’s hard to get Democrats , President Obama included , to deliver a full - throated critique of the practices that got us into the mess we ’re in .
And as for the Republicans : now that their policies of tax cuts and deregulation have led us into an economic quagmire , their prescription for recovery is  tax cuts and deregulation .
So let ’s bid a not at all fond farewell to the Big Zero  the decade in which we achieved nothing and learned nothing .
Will the next decade be better ?
Stay tuned .
Oh , and happy New Year .
Nikita Filatov : I took the right decision ( Photo © Richard Wolowicz / Getty Images )
“ Yeah , he ’s simply great ” – exclaimed CSKA ’s goalie Konstantin Barulin looking at how many journalists were trying to get an interview with the day ’s star Nikita Filatov .
His return was a very good thing for CSKA and after the match he talked with allhockey .ru correspondent Olesya Usova .
Are you happy about your return and about today ?
Yes , of course I am happy .
The first thing I am happy for is my team ’s victory .
And three points on your first match …
Yeah , I picked up three .
But I never get to a match planning how many points collect , if score or not …
The first thing is that my team wins .
Especially now that CSKA had a long losing streak it ’s a good thing that we interrupted it .
We played an excellent game and I think that we deserved to win .
You got the player of the game honors .
Are you happy to be named the best ?
Of course , it ’s always pleasant .
I scored and successfully played my first game – I ’m very happy .
Was it important for you to play well your debut match ?
I did n’t even thought about that .
It ’s a game .
Now it ’s finished and I ’m ready to get the next one .
I set to any game equally .
Describe your first goal .
[ CSKA ’s forward Dmitry ] Monya gave me an excellent pass .
I got it , worked the puck .
No one checked me and thus I shot .
Good that it hit the net .
What did help your team to beat Traktor ?
First of all our playing like a team .
Everyone wanted to win , there was a big drive .
We did feel the match .
Even on the bench we were supporting each other for the whole match .
We worked to win the match .
Traktor is a very aggressive and tough team .
That and the fact that they scored first complicated things for us .
I liked Traktor and it was truly a not easy game for us .
How did you like playing with your new partners , Albert Leschev and Dmitry Monya ?
Super .
It was simply a pleasure to play with him .
Albert Leschev is twice as old as me and I remember that when I was a child I used to go seeing him playing .
He ’s a master , playing with him is easy and pleasant .
I trained with him for half a hour yesterday and now we played a good match .
The guy does know hockey .
Which feelings you had today , wearing CSKA jersey and getting to the game with it ?
I had unique feelings .
I spent my life when I was 6 to 17 here and I have n’t changed my mother club .
This is my second house , thirteen years of my life have been dedicated to CSKA .
This is something special and I felt extraordinary feelings playing with CSKA .
Did you want to return in Russia only playing for CSKA ?
Yes .
I did n’t even think about moving to another team .
This was for me the best option .
First , it ’s Moscow , it ’s my home town , and secondly it ’s CSKA , my mother club and I knew it would have been easy to get into the team .
I was sure to be successful since the start and that my team mates would help me in that .
How did your team mates receive you ?
All was great .
I knew already many guys for some years , and I also trained with the second team this summer .
All this helped me , I knew the guys , talked with them .
And it was simply great how they received me .
You ’re back to the KHL .
Which changes you noticed since you first left overseas ?
I ’ve already noticed many changes .
For example this brand new arena in Chelyabinsk , with a super ice and full tribunes .
I am impressed .
Playing like that is more pleasant and more interesting .
I saw changes and it ’s great , although it ’s hard for me to judge as I played in the RSL of old only five matches .
But during this time I watched matches and I can say that the level has became a lot higher .
And there are also better import players .
So you do n’t regret your return to Russia ?
I ’ve never thought about regrets .
I was sure that all would be good .
I took the right decision .
Any regrets for your play in Columbus ?
I did n’t even think about it .
I will follow the guys and their matches .
There is a good team there too .
I had no such intentions as to prove something to them .
Not now and never before …
How can you judge the part of the season you spent there ?
I never thought about any individual aim .
The match is played , I already forgot it , now I think about the next one .
But I want to win all the matches !
United States
Treasury prices rose , as did the dollar , as investors fled equities for the safety of government - backed debt .
The 10 - year Treasury note rose 18 /32 , to 101 14/32 , and the yield fell to 3.21 percent , from 3.27 percent late Wednesday .

Charles Crowell / Bloomberg News
Markets in Asia were sharply lower on Friday , with the Hang Seng in Hong Kong falling 4.8 percent .
European exchanges finished slightly higher .
Some analysts said Friday that the declines were overdone , exaggerated by light trading over a holiday .
A truer picture of the markets may not come until next week , analysts said , as buyers return and as more details of the Dubai crisis , and the exposure of banks , emerge .
“ Dubai is really a symptom , a legacy , from the previous boom , rather than symptomatic of a start of a whole new set of issues that are going to create a systemic crisis in emerging markets , ” Kevin Grice , senior international economist at Capital Economics in London , said .
“ Markets assume the worst - case scenario . ”
Investors on Friday tried to assess just how much damage Dubai ’s debt struggle would wreak on the global economy , and a question was how much exposure banks might have .
Emerging markets have often seemed more vulnerable because their financial markets are not as deep and sophisticated as those in the West .
While that notion was proved wrong during the financial crisis , investors are still skittish about the developing world ’s ability to handle a crisis .
They need look no further than Bangkok , where a seemingly contained financial panic spiraled into a regional crisis more than a decade ago .
There is a fear that Dubai ’s problems could rattle emerging market banks and financial institutions that have lent the emirate money .
The use of computer modelling and the simulation of business processes as a means of coming up with improvements in the way that things are done within an organisation
At the heart of operations research ( OR ) is the use of computer modelling and the simulation of business processes as a means of coming up with improvements in the way that things are done within an organisation .
The tasks that OR examines are complex and involve many variables .
They include things like designing an optimal telecommunications network in a situation where future demand is uncertain , or automating a paper - based bank clearing system .
According to the Operational Research Society :
Operational Research ( OR ) , also known as Operations Research or Management Science ( OR / MS ) , looks at an organisation 's operations and uses mathematical or computer models , or other analytical approaches , to find better ways of doing them .
The term “ operational research ” is generally used in the UK ; the United States favours “ operations research ” or “ management science ” .
Information technology is central to the skill of an operational researcher .
But OR also draws on mathematics , engineering , physics and economics .
The heyday of OR was the 1950s and 1960s when , as Russell Ackoff , an OR academic , once put it , “ use of quantitative methods became an ‘ idea in good currency ' ” .
By the 1990s , though , Ackoff found that OR had been pushed into “ the bowels of the organisation not the head .
When it could no longer be pushed down , it was pushed out ” .
This , he believed , was because OR had been “ equated by managers to mathematical masturbation and to the absence of any substantive knowledge or understanding of organisations , institutions or their management ” .
Ackoff also claimed that there was a more fundamental flaw to OR .
It is , he said , designed to “ prepare perfectly for an imperfectly predicted future ” , and it “ helps us little and may harm us much ” .
Igor Ansoff , author of the classic “ Corporate Strategy ” , was heavily influenced by the time he spent working on sophisticated operational research for the Rand Foundation in the early 1950s .
Among other things , he analysed the extent of the exposure of NATO air forces to enemy attack .
OR was given a big boost by the second world war when researchers applied the principles of physics and engineering to military operations .
After the war , military personnel took these practices with them to civvy street , and to the companies that they then went to work for .
OR was often the entry point for engineers , like Ansoff , to come into general management .
Many management gurus , including Frederick Taylor , W. Edwards Deming ( the founder of the quality movement ) , Henry Mintzberg and Bruce Henderson ( the man behind the experience curve ) , were trained first as engineers .

A legislative aide changes signs at left , as Senate Budget Committee Chairman Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) at podium , speaks at a news conference announcing a proposed bi-partisan task force to solve the country 's fiscal problems .
Dems to lift debt ceiling by $ 1.8T
In a bold but risky year - end strategy , Democrats are preparing to raise the federal debt ceiling by as much as $ 1.8 trillion before New Year ’s rather than have to face the issue again prior to the 2010 elections .
“ We ’ve incurred this debt .
We have to pay our bills , ” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told POLITICO Wednesday .
And the Maryland Democrat confirmed that the anticipated increase could be as high as $ 1.8 trillion — nearly twice what had been assumed in last spring ’s budget resolution for the 2010 fiscal year .

The leadership is betting that it ’s better for the party to take its lumps now rather than risk further votes over the coming year .
But the enormity of the number could create its own dynamic , much as another debt ceiling fight in 1985 gave rise to the Gramm - Rudman deficit reduction act mandating across - the - board spending cuts nearly 25 years ago .
Already in the Senate , there is growing pressure in both parties for the creation of a novel bipartisan task force empowered to force expedited votes in the next Congress on deficit reduction steps now shunned by lawmakers .
As introduced Wednesday , the legislation sets no specific targets for deficit reduction , but its 18 - member task force — 16 of whom would come from Congress — is promised immense leverage to force change if they can first come together behind a plan .
“ This is a defining moment , ” said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) , one of the lead sponsors , and New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg , the panel ’s ranking Republican , is already maneuvering to try to add the legislation as an amendment to any bill tapped to carry the debt increase .
As explained by Hoyer and other Democrats , that will almost certainly be a pending $ 636.4 billion Pentagon appropriations bill that includes $ 128.3 in contingency funds for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The House leadership has held back the bill for weeks , saving it for this moment , but now appropriations clerks have been instructed to have a final package ready to go by Monday .
Leadership staff stressed that nothing was yet final in what has become a year - end negotiation between top Democrats in the House and Senate .
But the Senate appears to have been the first to put the $ 1.8 trillion number on the table .
And Hoyer ’s comments are the clearest yet on the scale of the increase and the expectation that it will be part of a larger year - end legislative train pulled along by the must - pass military bill .
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Obey , who is pursuing job - related measures he would also like to add , insisted that the debt issue is a “ leadership call ” alone .
But the Wisconsin Democrat showed no sign of opposition to the strategy outlined by Hoyer .
“ It is December .
We do n’t really have a choice , ” Obey told POLITICO .
“ The bill ’s already been run up ; the credit card has already been used .
When you get the bill in the mail you need to pay it . ”
Though Treasury can buy itself time by moving assets around , it is already coming close to the current debt ceiling of $ 12.1 trillion .
Last spring , the Democratic - backed budget proposed to raise this to about $ 13 trillion , but given the current pace of borrowing , no one now expects that will be sufficient to get through 2010 .
In fact , fiscal year 2009 ended Sept. 30 with a $ 1.4 trillion deficit , which demanded higher - than - expected Treasury borrowing .
Most of that was due to the downturn in the economy and spending commitments in place before Barack Obama took office .
And as much as Republicans point to the president ’s economic recovery bill last February as the culprit , only a small share of that $ 787 billion package was spent by Sept. 30 .
The picture in 2010 is different .
The administration is predicting the stimulus will hit its stride with much more spending .
And there will be a steady escalation of outlays driven by back - to - back increases in 2009 and 2010 appropriations for domestic agencies .
The White House has vowed to be more deficit conscious in its forthcoming 2011 budget due out in February .
But the House could vote as early as Thursday on a $ 446.8 billion year - end package covering more than a dozen Cabinet departments and agencies and representing a healthy 9 percent to 10 percent increase over current spending for the same accounts .
For example , transportation and housing resources would grow by 12 percent , including $ 2.5 billion for high - speed - rail investments on top of the $ 8 billion already added by the White House to the giant stimulus bill in February .
A $ 163.5 budget for the Departments of Labor , Health and Human Services , and Education would add an additional $ 8.6 billion to annual spending , and Veterans Health Administration spending would grow to $ 45.1 billion , a $ 4.1 billion increase .
Enlarge By CJ Gunther for USA TODAY Cycle of addiction : Steve Ballou loads his bike atop his car at his home in Sherborn , Mass .
Ballou had resumed smoking after a smoke - free decade when he enrolled in a trial for a nicotine vaccine .
He says cigarettes no longer taste good .
QUIT SMOKING QUIT SMOKING
Pregnancy can motivate smokers to kick habit
It takes a village to quit -- or realization you could buy a new car instead Approach it like training for marathon On the Web : American Cancer Society guide | SmokeFree.gov | BecomeAnEx.org HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER Steve Ballou , an ex-smoker for more than a decade , started slipping back into his old ways with cigars .
He'd have one when he was out with the guys , then when he was driving home from work , then one after dinner .
This went on for several years , but he thought of himself as a cigar aficionado , not a relapsed smoker , since cigarettes were never on the menu .
Until he vacationed in the City of Lights .
Ballou will forever associate Paris ' nickname with the act of lighting a cigarette .
Over lunch one day , he realized he 'd forgotten to buy a cigar to savor after the meal .
So he bummed a cigarette from his wife , an occasional smoker .
" I smoked half her pack that afternoon , and from that point on , I was a smoker , " says Ballou , 54 , a Sherborn , Mass . , resident who works in financial services .
He had a smoker 's typical love / hate relationship with cigarettes .
" I really did want to quit , but I was a nicotine addict .
I needed something to help me get over this . "
That something was a nicotine vaccine .
DEVELOPERS : Vaccine firms will collaborate SMOKING BANS : Analyses show they reduce heart attack rates Researchers are investigating whether the same approach used to prevent infectious diseases could treat addictions to such drugs as nicotine and cocaine .
None is yet on the market , but in late September , the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) released a $ 10 million stimulus grant to Nabi Pharmaceuticals to help pay for the first Phase III trial – a large study designed to confirm effectiveness and monitor side effects – of a smoking - cessation vaccine .
Company spokesman Greg Fries says Nabi , based in Rockville , Md. , expects to begin enrolling patients in the NicVax study by year 's end .
In early October in the Archives of General Psychiatry , scientists reported the results of a cocaine vaccine study , the first successful placebo - controlled trial of a vaccine against an illicit drug of abuse .
At a news conference , NIDA director Nora Volkow , whose institute funded the study , called the findings " transformative . "
Wary of cocaine vaccine Kim Janda , who has been studying vaccines to treat addiction since the late 1980s , predicts one against nicotine will hit the market within two years .
" I think you can make antibodies to any drug of abuse , " adds Janda , a chemistry professor at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , Calif .
But , says Thomas Kosten , leader of the recently published Archives study , no company is interested in developing a cocaine vaccine because of liability concerns and the assumption it would n't be nearly as profitable as a nicotine vaccine .
Nicotine and cocaine molecules are so tiny that they easily pass from the bloodstream into the brain , where they produce feelings of pleasure or euphoria .
This is where the vaccines come in .
Like those against infectious diseases , the nicotine and cocaine vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies .
These antibodies bind with the molecules , and the combo is far too large to pass through the blood / brain barrier .
Quitters must commit Ballou joined the phase II NicVax trial at Boston 's Massachusetts General Hospital after seeing an ad seeking volunteers .
He was to receive one shot a month for five months and was asked to try to quit smoking after the second shot .
As in most clinical trials , Ballou was not told whether he was getting the real thing or a placebo .
But , he says , after the first shot , " I knew instantly that I was not getting the placebo .
I was overjoyed . "
How could he tell ?
After that first shot , cigarettes no longer tasted good .
Instead of pleasure , smoking gave him a headache and burned his throat .
Between the first two shots , " I found myself smoking less and less . "
He last smoked three years ago .
" I can honestly tell you the vaccine was truly the thing that gave me that extra push I needed to get over the top . "
Half the volunteers in that study achieved satisfactory levels of nicotine antibodies , Nabi says .
A second study added a sixth shot and raised that proportion to 80 % .
The company says it 's optimistic nicotine antibodies will persist long enough to prevent a relapse , which happens within a year of quitting in most cases .
Getting ex-smokers through six smoke - free months would greatly reduce their relapse risk , says psychologist Douglas Jorenby of the University of Wisconsin 's Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention in Madison , which is testing NicVax .
Addiction vaccines are an aid , not a cure , Janda says , and the need for multiple shots might dissuade the less - committed .
" Too many doses are required , " he says .
" Most people who read about it think it 's like a polio vaccine .
They think it 's a one - shot deal and you 're covered for life . "
The cocaine vaccine study also used five shots .
Virtually everyone got all five , but only 38 % reached antibody levels thought to be high enough to block cocaine 's euphoric effects .
" It 's not ready for prime time yet , " Kosten says .
Urine tests showed some tried to override the vaccine by using more cocaine , he says .
That points out a risk in giving a nicotine vaccine to teens , who could try to defeat it by smoking 10 cigarettes at once , Kosten says .
They might get some of nicotine 's effect , but they 'd also be getting 10 times the carcinogens found in one cigarette .
Still , Janda says , addiction vaccines hold great potential : " You 're not treating a drug problem with another drug .
It 's much more palatable to take advantage of our immune system , the best foot soldiers around . "

Who Killed Copenhagen ?
An FP Whodunnit .
Barack Obama
Who ?
President of the United States
The crime : Obama came into office promising sweeping change and pledging to make the United States a global climate leader .
But last weekend , at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Singapore , world leaders dashed global hopes that a fully binding international legal agreement on climate change would happen next month .
The new goal of the upcoming U.N. climate treaty at Copenhagen , they announced , would be to reach a “ political ” consensus about possible next steps .
And they punted on the most difficult questions — of national targets for greenhouse gas cuts , and who will pay for them — into the future .
Obama ’s role in delivering the bad news was a sad spectacle , but not really a surprise .
It marked the culmination of a year in which climate has all but slipped off the president ’s agenda .
While a host of European leaders , from Gordon Brown to Angela Merkel , have publicly stated their intention to attend Copenhagen and committed to carbon reductions , Obama has stonewalled .
Earlier this year the president traveled to the Danish capital to lobby ( unsuccessfully ) for Chicago ’s Olympic bid .
But he has n’t committed to heading across the pond to lobby for the planet ’s future .
Obama said he would only go to Copenhagen if his appearance would seal the deal — the deal he just helped scuttle ( an unhappy self - fulfilling prophecy ) .
Plus , Obama ’s ambivalence has deflected pressure from two other big emitters : China and India .

Wen Jiabao
Who ?
Premier of People ’s Republic of China
The crime :
Wen commands more international affection than most Chinese politicians .
But as chair of China ’s national climate committee , Uncle Wen let the world down .
It ’s true that China has come further on climate issues in recent years than most observers expected .
Before 2007 , climate change was largely off the public radar in China , with Chinese journalists and experts wary of making public statements before the parameters of the official position were known .
In the intervening years , the world ’s top carbon emitter has stepped up its research on the impacts of climate change and made real strides on energy efficiency and renewable energy .
But , all the while , China has clung stridently to the principle of “ common but differentiated responsibilities , ” wherein the developing countries that have contributed the most cumulative carbon to the atmosphere ought to shoulder the majority of the practical and financial burden for reducing emissions .
Whether or not the there is logic to this argument , the way China has presented it has surely not signaled that it is open and willing to negotiate .
( “ Developed countries must lead the way with transforming their unsustainable production and lifestyle , ” China ’s top economic minister recently said . )
Such finger - pointing at the West has only fueled suspicion of China on Capitol Hill , giving U.S. cap - and - trade skeptics another reason for inaction .

Harry Reid
Who ?
Democrat of Nevada and Senate majority leader
The crime :
He ’s made a lot of promises — but not kept them .
In January , Reid pledged that the U.S. Senate would pass climate - change legislation before the summit in Copenhagen .
Last month , with still no bill in sight , a reporter asked if a bill would even reach the Senate floor , let alone pass , before the summit began .
Reid responded with a less - than - inspiring but still affirmative , “ Yup . ” But as of today , it has n’t happened .
The Senate cap - and - trade bill — a version of which the House , headed by Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi , passed in June — languishes in the committee - approval stage .
There is no possibility of a vote until next year .
The Senate has run out of time , and it has hamstrung the efforts of the rest of the world .
Indeed , as Reid knew , action in Congress was a prerequisite to progress in Copenhagen .
Last spring , Obama indicated that he would not agree to internationally binding carbon - reduction targets unless the U.S. Congress had already passed its cap - and - trade bill .
The United States needed to make sure its international agreements comported with domestic law , he said — and therefore it needed to have its domestic law set first .
Reid ’s foot - dragging ensured that did not happen , causing Obama to punt on Copenhagen and the global agreement to evaporate .
Granted , Reid says he needed the legislative time to eke out a massive overhaul of the U.S. health - care system ( a Senate vote is expected on that bill next month ) .
But Pelosi managed to do her part — and had Reid fast - tracked or rushed a vote , the world would n’t be waiting .
If any single body bears blame for Copenhagen ’s faltering , it is the Senate — and if any single person is responsible for the Senate , it is Harry Reid .

Jairam Ramesh
Who ?
India ’s minister of state for environment and forests
The crime : Two years ago , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a U.N. research organization , issued a report on climate change .
It concluded that the Himalayan glaciers in India were among the fastest - receding on Earth and that they might disappear by 2035 .
India has long resisted international efforts to rein in its emissions , but this month , India ’s environment minister released a classic piece of oppo research , arguing that climate change is not responsible for glacier melting and implying that political concerns underpinned the IPCC report .
“ This comes from Western scientists , ” Jairam said , apparently ignorant that the report ’s primary author is Indian .
“ It is high time India makes an investment in understanding what is happening in the Himalayan ecosystem , ” he added .
This sort of diversionist finger - pointing exemplifies Ramesh ’s beliefs about global warming .
He agrees that climate change exists .
He contends that “ no country in the world ” is as vulnerable to its effects as India , with its long floodable coastline and monsoon - dependent crops .
But he has refused to have India agree to binding international targets , arguing that developed economies should do more instead — butting heads with dignitaries such as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and with Copenhagen negotiators along the way .

Tom Donohue
Who ?
President and chief executive officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
The crime :
If Copenhagen were a person and FP were prosecuting for its death , we ’d charge most of the offenders on our list with manslaughter .
But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ’s Tom Donohue could stand for murder charges .
His organization actually set out to kill a deal .
Climate legislation has stalled in the U.S. Congress , crippling the chances of any international agreement , in no small part because of the redoubled efforts of American industry and business lobbyists .
According to an analysis by the Center for Investigative Journalism in Washington , “ More than 1,150 companies and advocacy groups had hired an estimated 2,810 lobbyists on climate change ” — five for each member of Congress .
The chamber has been front and center in efforts to convince legislators to just say no to cap - and - trade legislation , arguing that measures enacted now to save the planet would n’t be worth the upfront cost to the U.S. economy .
The chamber , for instance , has been one of the backers of a fake grassroots group called “ Energy Citizens , ” which , according to its press release , held rallies to “ to aim a loud message at those states ’ U.S. senators to avoid the mistakes embodied in the House climate bill . ”
The question , really , is just who Donahue is speaking for today ?
With concern about climate on the rise in the U.S. , marquis companies like Apple and Levi Strauss & Co. have quit the chamber to protest its obstructionist stance .

A note to this edition :
We published The Treasures of Simple Living in 1987 , and have left it here much as it first appeared .
Radical Simplicity and the Fourth Step updates that story , but more importantly , tries to describe and distill how living in the forest changed the way we saw the world we had grown up in , and convinced us a better way of living was possible .

Introduction
Our future was set out for us : full - time jobs , mortgage payments for the next 20 years , and retirement at 65 .
Our children would go to school and we would see them as much as our busy schedules allowed .
But such a future held no attraction for us .
So we packed up , left it all behind and drove into the unknown .
Our journey took us beyond the electric lines , telephone , paved roads and television .
We built our own house , grew salads year - round in a solar greenhouse , and taught our children at home , all in the midst of a forest where the nearest neighbors are wild animals , and the snow gets four feet deep .
The inconveniences were soon forgotten in the joys of living under our own roof , watching our children blossom , and discovering abilities we never knew we had .
The simplicity took away economic pressures and gave us time to search for lifes deeper meanings .
PART I explains why we left the city , how we solved the problem of earning a living and what we went through once we bought a piece of land in the middle of a forest .
PART II tells about the treasures we found in our simple life , and why our experiment paid us back a thousand - fold .
PART III describes common obstacles to creating a new lifestyle closer to nature , and some important skills that helped us along the way .

Farmers have been able to buy subsidised seeds and fertiliser Malawi is one of the poorest and most densely populated countries in the world .
Four years ago almost half its population depended on food aid from abroad for survival .
But this year , Malawi has managed to feed itself and even export some maize to hard - pressed neighbours .
This remarkable turnaround has been called the " Malawi Miracle " .
At its heart is a programme which provides heavily subsidised seeds and fertiliser for poor farmers .
Emma
Aron grows maize on two acres of land near the village of Lundu .
Her one crop has to feed a family of four for the whole year .
In Malawi the winter months are known as the " lean times " because many families have run out of food and the new crop is not yet ready for harvesting .
The problem with using too much artificial fertiliser is that its costly and it gradually makes the soil less productive in the long run
Edson Musapole of Action Aid Ms Aron remembers the suffering of four years ago .
" It was so difficult for me to see my children going hungry , " she says .
" It was not easy for the children to attend school because they had no food . "
For Ms Aron , the subsidised seeds and fertiliser have meant more to eat for her family .
And Adiel Banda , president of the Farmers Union of Malawi , says the programme has made him proud of his country .
" There has been a progressive improvement in food sufficiency , " he adds .
Soil degradation ?
But the programme has its problems .
It is very expensive for a government which gets one third of its revenues from foreign aid .
Emma
Aron says her children have had to go hungry in years gone by And its cost depends on the price of fertiliser , which can fluctuate alarmingly .
Britain is Malawi's biggest aid donor , through its Department for International Development ( DFID ) .
DFID 's team in Malawi is led by Gwen Hines .
She believes that the fertiliser programme has significantly reduced hunger in Malawi , although under - nourishment in young children remains all too common .
Ms Hines is now exploring whether using futures market contracts to buy fertiliser would remove some of the financial uncertainties around the programme .
There is also some concern in Malawi that increasing the use of factory - made fertiliser will lead to a long - term degradation of the soil on which the country depends .
The charity Action Aid is helping to fund a programme to teach better techniques for making compost to rural women .
The idea is to help strengthen the soil , although compost is not seen as a complete alternative to fertiliser on the tiny scraps of land on which Malawian farmers depend .
" The problem with using too much artificial fertiliser is that it 's costly and it gradually makes the soil less productive in the long run , " says Edson Musapole , of Action Aid .
Global challenge Malawi currently has a population of 13 million .
That is expected to treble to around 40 million in the next 30 years .
So will the country be able to feed so many people ?
Mr Musapole argues that with the right policies it will .
Malawi has avoided droughts in recent years , unlike some neighbours Even after recent improvements , agricultural productivity remains very low by international standards and can be raised much further .
It will be a huge challenge .
Government ministers and heads of state from around the world have gathered in Rome this week to hammer out policies on what they call " food insecurity " - that means the billion people in the world who are either hungry or at risk of being hungry in the near future .
Much of the attention at the meeting will focus on the need for developing countries to come up with their own solutions for feeding themselves , rather than being handed a plan by donors .
Malawi provides an example of a " country - based solution " which has succeeded so far .
It is worth pointing out that the south - eastern African nation has been fortunate enough to avoid the droughts that have afflicted some other African countries in recent years .
But the world will need a lot of successful initiatives if - as expected - global population rises to 9 billion by 2050 .

A few months ago , I was coming out of the lavatory at Maison Bertaud , a fusty old patisserie in Soho , when I saw the familiar full - moon face of Simon Callow – actor , playwright , director , indeed all round homme de théâtre – eclipsing the window .
For a moment I experienced the giddy thrill of fandom , and had to restrain myself from striding across the room and pumping him by his hand while exclaiming , " You 're Simon Callow , are n't you ? "
I had to restrain myself not only because I dissent from the assumption that notoriety is a licence - to - accost , but also because this rhetorical question would then have mutated into the no doubt unwelcome encomium , " I just love your talking book of The Twits " .
Who knows , perhaps Callow would be completely relaxed about my regarding his reading of Roald Dahl 's children 's story as his chef - d'oeuvre , but somehow I doubt it .
After all , not long after this near encounter I saw him effortlessly upstage Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart , playing Pozzo to their distinctly sweet - cured Estragon and Vladimir in a grown - up production of Waiting for Godot .
But while Callow 's Pozzo may have been magnificent , no recollection of it will ever fill my heart with joy the way his fabulously orotund declamation of the opening lines of The Twits does .
It helps that it 's such a very good entrée : " What a lot of hairy - faced men there are about nowadays .
When a man grows hair all over his face it is impossible to tell what he really looks like .
Perhaps that 's why he does it .
He 'd rather you did n't know . "
To my mind Dahl 's flatly authoritative statements have a universal sweep and psychological penetration to rival the first line of Tolstoy 's Anna Karenina , with the added bonus of actually being true ; I mean , there are undoubtedly many happy families that are altogether unalike , while – speaking with all the authority of the recently barbellate – I can assure you that when a man grows hair on his face , he definitely has something to hide .
The Twits is my favourite Dahl book – although I 'm not sure that I can entirely divorce my enthusiasm for it from Callow 's performance .
The celebrated midden of Mr Twit 's beard , his insertion of his glass eye into Mrs Twit 's beer , her substitution of worms for his spaghetti – not forgetting the dreaded shrinks ; indeed , all of the creepy mind games the ghastly duo engage in strikes me as a more veridical portrait of a marriage than anything ever staged by Strindberg .
That the whole tale of spousal , child and animal abuse should be punctuated by lines that skilfully and inexorably tighten the dramatic noose is testimony to Dahl 's genius as a fashioner of narrative , when the aside comes : " We ca n't go on for ever watching these two disgusting people doing disgusting things to each other . "
The only possible reply is : " Yes , we can – please , more ! "
Certainly the appetite for Dahl 's children 's books seems undiminished in the 19 years since his death .
They sell in huge quantities , and the linkage of the sprightly texts to Quentin Blake 's spikily effective illustrations is as secure in the popular consciousness as any horse and carriage – or Dumbledore and Harry for that matter .
Not that everyone exactly likes Blake 's line ; it 's more that his shtick – an early form of the now commonplace " adult child " style – is a good enough visual simulacrum of Dahl 's imaginary world .
As in Blake 's drawings , there are big white spaces in Dahl - world where any realistic detailing might well be shaded in by a lesser writer ; and again , in common with Blake 's vision , Dahl - world is at once lurid and curiously ill - defined .
The passions are strong and clear – fear , hatred , avarice , love , greed ( especially for sugar ) – but they are played out against a backdrop that is only wonkily apprehended .
Dahl mimicked to perfection a believable child 's - eye view , that , looking up from below , sees the adult realm as foreshortened , and adult foibles as grossly elongated .
I say this with confidence , but I 'm not the ideal critic of Dahl 's children 's writing , for the simple reason that I was never exposed to it during childhood .
In theory , I could 've read – or been read – James and the Giant Peach ( 1961 ) , Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ( 1964 ) and The Magic Finger ( 1966 ) , but by the time Dahl published Fantastic Mr Fox ( 1970 ) I was out of the zone .
Children 's literature is in this respect rather like pop music – until it reaches classic status it has a rigid generational stratigraphy .
No , the Dahl of my childhood was the grown - up author of Kiss Kiss ( 1960 ) , Switch Bitch ( 1974 ) and Tales of the Unexpected ( 1979 ) .
This last short story collection gave its name to a long - running television series ( nine seasons in all , between 1979 and 1988 ) that initially dramatised Dahl 's tales but latterly used his basic format to generate and adapt many more , something in the manner of the 1950s Twilight Zone .
Indeed , the lounge - lizard signature tune of the show , and its title sequence of silhouetted naked Princess
Di mop-crops cavorting in front of a roulette wheel is synonymous in my memory with a louche demimonde , at once attractive and repulsive .
In my teens , I thought Dahl 's short stories pretty cool : they were lucidly macabre , full of cod-scientific details , often world - wearily sexy , and invariably ended with an unforeseen twist , thrust like a stiletto through the reader 's psychic armature .
That being said , when I began thinking about this piece and tried to recall some of the stories , I drew almost a complete blank , apart from one about a middle - aged woman whose ex-husband convinces her that her smoking and drinking have rendered her frigid , and so drives her to suicide .
This turned out to be " The Last Act " from Switch Bitch , and when I reread it I found a rich seam of misogyny and sadism .
In " Royal Jelly " ( in which an obsessive apiarist cures his own infertility with royal jelly then feeds it to his languishing baby daughter ) I discovered a mordant authorial delight in not so much subverting as completely inverting the unconditional love of good parenting .
True , when I started scanning the Dahl collections I was able to marry tale to twist , but mostly it was the twists alone that had stayed with me : the murdering wife feeding the weapon – a frozen leg of lamb – to her policeman husband 's colleagues in " Lambs to the Slaughter " was far more memorable than the mise en scène , let alone Dahl 's prose , which was never much more than workmanlike .
I was once with Martin Amis when he was asked if he'd ever consider writing a children 's book .
He thought for a few moments before drawling : " I might . . . if I had brain damage . "
I do n't take that view – for me a great children 's book transcends the age group of its intended readership as completely as a great science fiction or detective novel transcends its genre .
And it takes a fully engaged writer to write one ; after all , Lewis Carroll may have been a repressed paedophile , but he certainly was n't cognitively impaired .
With Dahl there does seem a case for suggesting that it was the beneficial loss of at least some of his faculties that transformed him from a so - so writer for adults into a masterful one for children .
I 'm not too interested in raking over the Dahl biography in search of a psychoanalytic perspective on his work – plenty of others have been there before , and the writer seems to have been as mercurial , if not Manichean , a figure as we would expect .
By some accounts he was a deeply altruistic man , responsible – among other things – for designing a valve to release the pressure on the skulls of hydrocephalic children when his son , Theo , was afflicted with the condition after a car accident .
According to others he was a fulminating misanthrope , whose late excursion into political comment earned him the reputation of an antisemite ( unjustified in my view ) .
Was he the caring husband , who took over the rehabilitation of his wife ( the actress Patricia Neal ) after she suffered a series of cerebral aneurysms – or the callous adulterer who had an affair with one of her close friends , Felicity Crosland , before leaving Neal to marry her ?
Then there 's the vexed question of what sort of parent Dahl had been himself ; with AS Byatt 's A Children 's Book shortlisted for this year 's Man Booker prize , the richly ironic cloth of the dysfunctional families of the great purveyors of children 's literature has been spread before us : a counterpane world of suicides , mental breakdowns and addictions .
As for Dahl , was he the delightfully playful , loving and inventive paterfamilias that some of his five children have recalled – or the crushingly dominating patriarch , subject to terrifying rages that looms in others ' accounts ?
Standing 6ft 6ins , was Dahl not so much a BFG as a Big Angry Giant ?
Nor am I keen on probing further back , to the miserable boarding school boy 's separation from his doting mother , or the early death of his father .
Dahl may have got some of the furniture for his children 's stories from testing Cadbury 's products at school , his hated masters and the folk tales of his Norwegian grandmother – but if a children 's writer does n't gather material from his own childhood , where else is there ?
I 'm more interested in Dahl 's children 's fiction as a perfectly achieved analogue of his distinctive worldview , with those elements that are wholly unsuitable for children obliterated – as if by some insult to the brain – yet their ghosts informing what remains .
Dahl had a good war : an RAF fighter pilot , he achieved record numbers of " kills " , and his early short stories traded on his wartime experiences .
And yet can there ever really be such a thing as " a good war " ?
Even from the air the obliteration of human life is a vile business , while especially from up above , the pretensions of human morality are miniaturised .
In Dahl - world , political institutions are shoved well to the background , while the notion of an orderly society is never seriously entertained : at best we have a little community anti-authoritarianism , as in Danny , the Champion of the World .
Take Dahl 's most famous work , Charlie and the Chocolate Factory : its boy protagonist 's family is immiserated , his carers are incapable of looking even after themselves – so salvation comes through luck , and the arbitrary beneficence of a deranged feudal - capitalist with a happily mancipated workforce .
Of course , the spur that initially drives Charlie on is a lust for sweet things that , were it transferred to an adult plane , could only result in a work entitled something like " Charlie and the Huge Seraglio full of Compliant Nymphomaniacs " .
The NAACP slated the black pygmy Oompa - Loompas in the original text – and so Dahl changed them to a fictional light - skinned subspecies – but he could n't get rid of the brown sugar .
My equation of sweets with sex is not facetious ; in Dahl - world , oral gratification is pretty much the only thing that matters .
The misogyny that haunts Dahl 's adult writing is also short - circuited in his sexless children 's fiction , for here his heroes and heroines can be either orphans ( James of giant - peach lusting , for instance ) , or else , as in The Magic Finger , an unnamed , and thus family - free , eight - year - old girl .
The eponymous heroine of Matilda has parents who are neglectful to the point of being abusive .
Sophie in The BFG is extracted from her natal home in order to experience good and bad surrogacy – from giants ( ie Dahlesquely huge men ) .
The infanticidal witches of The Witches stand proxy for all mothers – who kill that which they claim to love ; true , the boy 's Norwegian grandmother is a good enough parent , but then she 's safely de-sexed by age and illness .
Only Danny , the Champion of the World presents an idealised parent – and that , also , has to be a man .
Danny is the most naturalistic of the Dahl children 's books , and its evocation of rural English life in the 1950s gives us more substantial clues to its author 's political perspective than any of the other , more cartoonish works .
True , there are the satirical personifications of consumerism ( Veruca Salt ) and mass media ( Mike Teavee ) in Charlie , while even in a squib such as The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me we get little vignettes of a ruptured organic society – but it 's only in Danny that the whole Red Tory cloth of his convictions is unfurled .
With its portrayal of happy poaching folk , existing in impoverished but mutually supporting symbiosis with a rough - shooting aristocracy , Dahl registers his wholesale revulsion from the modern world .
That Danny 's father , William , is a pretty much perfect single parent , raising a boy to be self - sufficient as well as loving , is as much a function of the support network that surrounds their Romany caravan – the doctor , the policeman et al – as his own particular qualities .
In Danny there 's no such thing as family – only a small and male society .
Reading Danny one thinks of the milieu of the Men of the Trees , and other proto - fascist eco-movements of the British interwar period .
Danny is also noteworthy for another of those strange ambivalences that permeate Dahl 's work : while The Magic Finger is an out - and - out assault on blood sports , this book seems to embrace the killing of game , so long as it's perpetrated in a sustainable fashion .
I said I would n't wax Freudian in my view of Dahl , but I can't help myself : I think it safe to see blood sports in his children 's books as a synecdoche for all human violence .
Dahl seems to suggest that there are good ways of killing things – the just war , the poached pheasant – and emphatically bad ways : the holocaust of pheasants that the grotesquely plutocratic brewer , Mr Hazell , is intent on unleashing .
This brings us fairly logically to Fantastic Mr Fox , the latest film adaptation of Dahl .
It 's a distinguished addition to a filmic canon that includes superb versions of The Witches and Matilda – although there are also notable clunkers such as Danny , the Champion of the World with an effete Jeremy Irons as the ideal parent .
Filmed using stop- motion techniques , Fantastic Mr Fox looks beautiful : a vivid appliqué of pose - able figures threaded into sets that any kidult would love to play with .
It 's a relief to experience a children 's film that has a genuine quiddity after all that remorselessly perfect computer - generated imagery .
As for the players , I wonder whether George Clooney ( Mr Fox ) and Meryl Streep ( Mrs Fox ) have ever generated more sexual chemistry than they do with these husky , sassy voiceovers .
I took my eight - year - old to the screening .
He 's the youngest of our cubs , and the last one available with whom to burrow about in Dahl - world .
His remark on the adaptation was telling : " I like it when they do the whole story properly , but then they put in anything else they feel like . "
Luckily , the " anything else they feel like " is in this case cleverly scripted by Noah Baumbach ( of The Squid and the Whale ) and director Wes Anderson .
I had no problem with all the animal characters being snappy late 1950s American types , not unlike the advertising men and their wives in Mad Men ; nor did I mind the introduction of a yoga - practising , karate - kicking fox nephew , with whom Fox Jr has a troubled rivalry .
Nor , indeed , did I suspect any sinister subversion of the special relationship in Anderson choosing a fine trio of British character actors for the loathsome farmers , Boggis , Bunce and Bean ( the last giving Michael Gambon an opportunity to smoke heavily on screen , albeit in puppet form ) .
After all , while it's a great bedtime book , Fantastic Mr Fox would be slim pickings for a feature had a flickknife - toting rat ( voiced by Willem Dafoe ) not been interpolated .
All that 's fine , and it's refreshing also that Anderson does n't play up the convenient truth of environmental damage by humans , but rather subverts it by making this the cause – as it indeed is – of an advantageous vulpine incursion into the built environment .
However , the recasting of the Foxes ' marriage as one of near - equality , with Fox himself not so much a wild animal as a grandiose chicken - snatching addict , and Mrs Fox scratching against her own co-dependency , was certainly not true to the spirit of the book .
For Dahl , Mr Fox was the fantastic one – he did n't need any lousy vixen to show him the way to dig .
I can't claim to have read every Dahl children 's book , but those I have read , I 've read aloud .
It might be an idea for all literary critics to read the books they analyse aloud – it certainly helps to fix them in the mind , while providing a readymade seminar with your audience .
The Dahl books I have n't got on with – Esio Trot and The Minpins spring to mind – were ones my kids did n't like either .
The reason I never finished The BFG was that I kept falling asleep while reading it ; the eponymous hero of the book is meant to give children dreams – or nightmares – but to me he simply gifted oblivion .
But if my view seems to be of a jaundiced introjection of adult attitudes into children 's entertainment , please do n't imagine for a second that I find this remotely objectionable .
I do n't adore Dahl 's children 's fiction in spite of its submerged misogyny , lust , revanchism and wilful neglect of identity politics – I love it precisely because of these attributes .
Dahl understood intuitively the truth best exemplified by a famous scene in The Simpsons , when Bart overhears Marge saying to Homer " Kids can be so cruel " and , taking it as an injunction , cries out : " We can ?
Thanks Mom ! "
There then comes the sound of his rapid footsteps along the hall , followed by Lisa 's pained cry : " Owwww !
Bart , cut it out ! "
Dahl 's books resound down through the generations with the demented call " We can ! " and its pained response " Owwww ! "
And long may they do so .

For most the past 12 months , Paul Volcker was sitting on the policy sidelines .
He had impressive sounding job titles – member of President Obama ’s Transition Economic Advisory Board immediately after last November ’s election , and quickly named to head the new Economic Recovery Board .
But the Recovery Board , and Volcker himself , have seldom met with the President .
Economic and financial sector policy , by all accounts , has been made largely by Tim Geithner at Treasury and Larry Summers at the White House , with help from Peter Orszag at the Office of Management and Budget , and Christina Romer at the Council of Economic Advisers .
With characteristic wry humor , Volcker denied in late October that he had lost clout within the administration : “ I did not have influence to start with . ”
But that same front page interview in the New York Times contained a well placed shock to then prevailing policy consensus .
Volcker , legendary former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board with much more experience of Wall Street than any current policymaker , was blunt :
We need to break up our biggest banks and return to the basic split of activities that existed under the Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 – a highly regulated ( and somewhat boring ) set of banks to run the payments system , and a completely separate set of financial entities to help firms raise capital ( and to trade securities ) .
This proposal is not just at odds with the regulatory reform legislation then ( and now ) working its way through Congress ; Volcker is basically saying that what the administration has proposed and what Congress looks likely to enact in early 2010 is essentially — bunk .
Speaking to a group of senior finance executives , as reported in the Wall Street Journal on Monday , Volcker made his point even more forcefully .
There is no benefit to running our financial system in its current fashion , with high risks ( for society ) and high returns ( for top bankers ) .
Most of financial innovation , in his view , is not just worthless to society – it is downright dangerous to our broader economic health .
Volcker only makes substantive public statements when he feels important issues are at stake .
He also knows exactly how to influence policy – he has not been welcomed in the front door ( controlled by the people who have daily meetings with the President ) , so he ’s going round the back , aiming at shifting mainstream views about what are “ safe ” banks .
Many smart technocrats listen carefully to what he has to say .
This strategy is partly about timing – and in this regard Volcker has chosen his moment well .
The economy is starting to recover , but this process is clearly going to take a while and unemployment will stay high for the foreseeable future .
At the same time , our biggest banks are making good money – mostly from trading , not much from lending to small business – and they are lining up to pay very big bonuses .
Not only is this contrast – high unemployment vs. bankers ’ bonuses – annoying and unfair , it is also not good economics .
Bankers are , in effect , being rewarded for taking the risks that created the global crisis and led to massive job losses .
And they are being implicitly encouraged to do the same thing again .
The case for keeping big banks in their current configuration is completely lame .
Even if we are lucky enough to avoid another major any time soon , the fiscal costs are enormous and coming right at you ( and your taxes ) .
Now that Paul Volcker has picked up his hammer , he will not lightly set it aside .
He knows how to sway the policy community and he knows how to escalate when they do n’t pay attention .
Expect him to pound away until he prevails .

Reported Ukraine Cases Top One Million - 174 Fatalities
Recombinomics Commentary 18:41
November 9 , 2009
1,031,597 Influenza / ARI
52,742 Hospitalized
174 Dead
The latest update for Ukraine includes more than 1 million reported cases ( see map ) .
The fatalities have jumped from 155 to 174 and almost 53 K have been hospitalized .
The biggest jump in fatalities was in Lviv , where reported deaths rose from 63 to 74 .
However , the largest jump in cases was in Kiev , raising concerns that the infections were spreading east .
The increase in cases and deaths continue to support a genetic change in the H1N1 virus .
However , there have been no updates on samples which were sent to London over a week ago .
The sequence silence continues to increase concerns that the large number of cases and deaths in Ukraine is linked to changes , which may involve the receptor binding domain in general and position 225 in particular .
Jose Manuel Barroso , right , said he was encouraged by the talks President Barack Obama has said it is " imperative " the US and EU redouble efforts to achieve success at next month 's climate summit in Copenhagen .
Speaking after talks in Washington with EU officials , he said they agreed they should create a framework for progress .
The Copenhagen talks are aimed at negotiating a follow - on agreement to the Kyoto Protocol .
Meanwhile , former US Vice President Al Gore says he believes President Obama will attend the talks in Copenhagen .
He said the president would want to emphasise his administration 's commitment to safeguarding the environment .
But Mr Obama 's allies in Congress are struggling to push through legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , and it is unlikely that any bill will be passed before the December talks .
' Potential disaster '
Mr Obama said climate change had been discussed " extensively " with EU leaders on Tuesday .
" All of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the Copenhagen meetings to ensure that we create a framework for progress in dealing with what is a potential ecologic disaster , " he said .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the talks with Mr Obama had made him more confident about progress .
Campaigners say the world 's poorest are most at risk from climate change " With the strong leadership of the United States we can indeed make an agreement , " he said .
The Kyoto Protocol required 37 industrial nations to cut carbon emissions by an average 5 % from 1990 levels by 2012 , when it expires .
However , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon has said world leaders are unlikely to agree on a comprehensive treaty in Copenhagen .
He said it was more likely there would only be agreement on principles .
UN officials have also recently declared there is no chance of agreeing all elements of a new legally - binding UN treaty before the end of the year .
But Mr Gore , a leading environmental campaigner , said it would n't be a disaster if the conference produced only a framework agreement , and not a binding deal .

I ’ve felt a bit quaint the last couple of days , toting a pen , a notepad and my old journalism notions around here at the Googleplex .
I ’d once thought that a journalist ’s ( and journalism ’s ) work ended when a story cleared the copy desk .
But a two - day blizzard of power - point presentations in the heart of the Silicon Valley pounded home a notion that the media and their foot soldiers need to do much , much more to thrive in the midst of an information revolution .
We ’re talking about media letting the audience increasingly into the middle of the conversation .
We ’re talking about shifting from producing single articles to curating “ topic pages ” from many sources .
We ’re talking about building block - by - block databases so readers can find not just the latest news but also crime stats , school test scores and home values for their neighborhoods .
Then all that information must be promoted via social networks like Twitter and Facebook , according to several speakers at UC Berkeley ’s Media Technology Summit .
When a bubbly young Web marketer told about 100 assembled reporters , editors , scientists and media executives that they must build their “ whuffie factor ” ( more on that later ) , nobody batted an eye .

The bottom line : Journalists and media outlets will have to plunge into new territory and do it without any assurance that the extra work will make them enough money to keep reporting the news .
Most in the media have responded to challenges from the Internet with lots of talk about innovation but only halting action .
The result can be seen in hemorrhaging ad revenue and decimated news staffs .
Neil Henry , dean of UC Berkeley ’s Graduate School of Journalism , told the gathering in an auditorium on the sleek Google campus that the Bay Area already has lost half of its professional news reporters .
But this week ’s meeting attempted to depart from the ink - stained kvetching that can dominate these gatherings , with an emphasis on the technology - happy crowd explaining all the opportunities that the Internet provides .

“ There has been a lot of lip service until now .
But we ca n’t measure what we do by asking :
Is anybody else doing it ? ” said Alan Mutter , an analyst and one - time newspaper editor and media investor , who organized the conference for the Berkeley journalism school .
“ Innovators do n’t have great peripheral vision .
Innovators are looking ahead .
They are looking over the horizon . ”
The meeting kicked off Wednesday with John Temple , the former editor and publisher of the Rocky Mountain News , which closed in February after 150 years in business .
“ I feel like a cadaver being asked by the funeral director , ‘ How did you like the flowers ? ’ ” Temple said , before offering his autopsy on the paper .
Temple said the much - celebrated Rocky and other papers have been so worried about their printed product ( which brings in the vast majority of the ad revenue ) they ’ve given short shrift to expanding Web opportunities .
A user - powered review site like Yelp.com could and should have been driven by newspapers , Temple suggested .
But they would have fretted , he said , over minutiae like citizen contributors misspelling words .
Advertisement
“ People running a new venture need to be free to do what ’s best for that business , ” Temple said , “ regardless of the potential impact on the old . ”
Others at the event supported the call for increased openness and experimentation .
An executive with Thomson Reuters , parent of the wire service , touted the company ’s OpenCalais project , which tags and catalogs millions of pieces of information , data that will be made available to other news organizations .
Lone stories do n’t have much value .
But organizations that can group information will find “ the value of aggregated mega - data is high , ” said Thomas Tague , a vice president with the company .

Richard Gingras , chief executive of Salon Media Group Inc. , argued that “ the core of the matrix ” for news outlets in making transactions is no longer an entire website but individual stories .
Because at least half of the audience on most websites arrives there after an Internet search , stories become much more attractive when they are enriched with articles , graphics , reader discussion and the like , Gingras said .
EveryBlock.com , recently purchased by MSNBC , and the Los Angeles Times hope to apply that theory to neighborhoods they cover , augmenting news with street - level statistical compilations of everything from crime locations to test scores .
Next , journalists need to continue promoting themselves and their work with more gusto on social networks like Twitter and Facebook , said Web marketing consultant Tara Hunt .
Hunt invoked “ whuffie , ” the ephemeral social capital imagined in a science fiction novel , to make her case .
Advertisement
“ Building your whuffie is building trust , doing good things , embracing the chaos [ of ] the social networks , ” Hunt said .
“ That ’s at least 50 % . . . of the work that you are doing . ”
Maybe it was that pep talk that had me passing on the peanut butter and jelly and opening myself to the lentil bean sandwich I found at Google ’s abundant buffet .
But amid the celebration of the multiplicities , opportunities and creative chaos of the Web , one Google executive , Bradley Horowitz , also acknowledged that consumers might be drowning in media , e-mail and the “ social stream . ”
“ Tools are needed , ” he declared , “ to preserve your most precious asset : your attention . ”

So maybe , even in the age of Google , consumers are looking for someone to help cut through all the clutter to get at the important facts .
Sounds to me like they ’re looking for a journalist .

DURHAM , N.C. – Finding and treating a tumor without disturbing normal tissue presents challenges – sometimes the most effective therapies can be invasive and harsh .
Researchers at Duke University Medical Center have devised a way they might deliver the right therapy directly to tumors using special molecules , called aptamers , which specifically bind to living tumor tissue .
They screened a large pool of aptamers in a rodent with liver cancer until they found the best molecule to bind to a tumor protein .
" We are already exploring attaching chemicals to the aptamers , so the aptamer molecules could deliver tumor - killing agents where they are needed , which is the next phase of our research , " said senior author Bryan Clary , M.D. , chief of the Division of Hepatopancreatobiliary and Oncologic Surgery .
The study was published in Nature Chemical Biology online on Nov. 29 .
Aptamers are small pieces of RNA that bind to a specific target molecule , usually a protein .
They offer ease of use because they can be easily regenerated and modified and therefore have increased stability over some other agents , such as protein - based antibodies .
Notably , they have a very low chance of immune - system interference , making them great candidates for tumor diagnosis and therapy .
" Most importantly , it 's not necessary to have detailed knowledge of protein changes in the disease before the selection process , " said lead author Jing Mi , M.D. , Ph.D. , assistant professor in the Duke Department of Surgery .
" This greatly simplifies the process of molecular probe development .
The selected aptamers can be used to discover proteins not previously linked with the disease in question , which could speed up the search for effective therapies . "
The researchers used a large pool of RNA strands and applied them to a rodent with a liver tumor , the type of metastatic tumor that often results from a colon cancer tumor .
" We hypothesized that the RNA molecules that bind to normal cellular elements would be filtered out , and this happened , " said Clary , who treats colon cancer patients .
" In this way , we found the RNA molecules that went specifically to the tumor . "
The researchers removed the tumor , extracted the specific RNA in the tumor , amplified these pieces of RNA to create a greater amount , and reinjected the molecules to learn which bound most tightly to the tumor .
They repeated this process 14 times to find a good candidate .
The team found a tumor - targeting RNA aptamer that specifically bound to RNA helicase p68 , a nuclear protein produced in colorectal tumors .
" This aptamer not only binds to p68 protein in cell culture , but also preferentially binds to cancer deposits in a living animal , " Mi said .
" The nice thing about this aptamer approach is that it could be used to discover the molecular signatures of many other diseases . "
Clary said the process could be repeated with different types of tumors .
For example , a scientist might take a breast cancer line and grow it in the lung as a metastasis model and then perform in vivo selection to identify RNAs specifically binding to the lung tumor .
" This would work , theoretically , " Clary said .
" The idea of selecting molecules targeting a tumor growing in a body that results in a useful reagent for biologic exploration and therapy delivery in tumors is exciting . "
In fact , based on earlier research done with proteins called peptides , the researchers expected that the aptamer process would find proteins in the blood vessels feeding the liver tumor , but instead they found the p68 target inside of tumor cells .
" We think this is a valuable target because delivering to the sites inside of cells may make it easier to treat an entire tumor with drugs that are ' escorted ' by the aptamer , " Clary said .
He said that repeating the selection and amplification process with the same liver tumor could lead to development of other aptamers that bind well to proteins in tumor tissue besides p68 .
The team focused its initial efforts on developing an escort for p68 because this protein was known to be overexpressed in colon cancer .

The idea that one cancer death is prevented for roughly 2,000 women screened “ does n’t mean anything until you ’re the one , ” said Dr. Jacques Moritz , director of gynecology at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan .
“ No doubt about it , I ’m going to say , ‘ Well , you really do n’t need it , ’ and they ’re going to say : ‘ You do n’t understand .
I ’m getting the mammogram .
I ’m not going to take the chance to be the one person that has it . ’ ”
Most of the doctors , however , said they would inform younger women that the recommendations said they did not need mammograms if they were low - risk .
They said they would also point out that groups like the American Cancer Society and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are sticking to the earlier guidelines .
“ If we do n’t give them both views , they will not trust our judgments , ” said Dr. Ozgul Muneyyirci - Delale , associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at SUNY Downstate .
Dr. Muneyyirci -Delale said she worried that the conflicting advice might add to negative feelings many women have about mammograms , because of the pain of the test , exposure to radiation or a general distrust of medicine .
A few doctors , however , could see benefits for some women .
Dr. Deborah Gahr , a gynecologist in private practice in New York , said the guidelines would make the estimated 10 to 15 percent of women who resist have mammograms more confident in their decision .
“ In a sense , that ’s good , ” Dr. Gahr said .
“ Nothing is black and white in medicine . ”
Patients are already trying to figure out what the recommendations mean .
Dr. Daniel Kopans , a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and a strong proponent of mammography , said “ one woman came all the way from Bermuda and said , ‘ I ’m not sure if I should be screened . ’ ”
Mair Eluned Russell - Jones translated German code decrypted at Bletchley A World War II codebreaker has told how she was so afraid of giving away secrets by talking in her sleep that she was worried about going to bed .
Mair Eluned Russell - Jones , 92 , worked from 1942 at Bletchley Park , a site whose role in decrypting German signals was only revealed decades later .
She has now been honoured by Prime Minister Gordon Brown for her efforts at the Buckinghamshire mansion .
She feared her landlord was listening at her door and even fell ill .
She has now joined a number of men and women to have been publicly recognised after working at the confidential site , known as Station X. Many historians agree that the codebreakers ' efforts shortened the war by two years .
I remember mostly being bored ... however , when a code was broken it was so exciting , but it only happened about once a week
Mair Eluned Russell - Jones , pictured in her early 20s
Their success allowed the Allies to know in advance what German forces were planning .
About 10,000 people worked on breaking codes during the war , and about 1,500 are still alive .
Welsh - speaking Mrs Russell - Jones , from Caerphilly , has received the Government Code and Cipher School certificate signed by the prime minister , and a commemorative badge .
She said : " We were sworn to secrecy and the landlord seemed very interested in what we were doing .
" I thought maybe he was listening at the door in case we talked in our sleep .
I was afraid to go to sleep and became ill as a result . "
Cramped hut Her role at Bletchley Park saw her with about 20 other women in a small , cramped hut where she sat in front of a machine and decrypted the German code coming in .
She said : " There were letters in groups of five and we had to try and sort them out , which did not happen very often .
" We did n't break the code though , the people above us did , and there were not that many who could do it .
" We had to translate it from German and eventually it got to whoever it was meant for but none of us understood what we were seeing . "
Bletchley Park 's contribution to the war effort has become publicly recognised She added : " I remember mostly being bored - it was really , really boring just sitting there watching the letters coming through and trying to sort it out .
" However , when a code was broken it was so exciting , but it only happened about once a week .
" Everybody shouted with joy but then it had to go to the officers in the Army , Navy and Air Force and it was serious then , but we were pleased we had got the cipher broken and the people it was going to knew what they were fighting . "
Mrs Russell - Jones , who has five children , 15 grandchildren and one great - grandchild , was a student when a friend of hers suggested she apply for a job with the Foreign Office .
She was one of more than 1,500 Bletchley Park veterans to receive the commemorative badge and a certificate , expressing thanks for her contribution to the war effort .
Speaking of the award , Mrs Russell - Jones , who has been married to the Reverend Thomas Russell - Jones , 91 , for 63 years , said : " I am thrilled .
It has made me think back to the war , not that I have n't thought of it before .
" When I was there I really felt I was making a contribution to the war effort .
It was all worth it . "

Generacion Y homepage Cuba 's dynamic emerging blogging community has recently been testing the limits of free expression with posts ranging from vivid accounts of everyday life to sometimes risky calls for political change in the Communist - run state .
Bloggers - many of whom were born after the 1959 revolution - are trying to move debate away from the established official doctrine to exploring social and economic issues .
Most still avoid direct criticism of the government , for fear of provoking a crackdown on the country 's growing internet .
However , the government 's present tolerance could change , as an increasing number of bloggers are beginning to condemn the harassment of independent writers and are demanding structural reforms .
' New space '
The New - York based media watchdog Commitee to Protect Journalists ( CPJ ) in a report published in mid-September welcomed the " surprisingly vibrant blogosphere " that has recently sprung to life in Cuba .
" The bloggers , mainly young adults from a variety of professions , have opened a new space for free expression , while offering a fresh glimmer of hope for the rebirth of independent ideas in the country 's closed system , " the CPJ said .
Manuel Vazquez Portal , a Cuba - based award - winning journalist and dissident , says he can see a " strong connection and notable differences " between the independent press movement of his generation and the new blogging community .
" The emerging Cuban blogosphere has established itself as distinct from both the government and the dissident movement , " Mr Portal told CPJ .
The emergence of independent bloggers is " evidence of a generation shift , a sign that even a country as isolated as Cuba is slowly moving into the 21st Century , " Daniel Erikson , an expert at the Washington - based organisation Inter - American Dialogue said recently on US - based thedialogue.org .
Laritza Diversent , a lawyer from Havana , says she and her fellow bloggers were part of the post - revolutionary youth .
" We were brought up after the fall of Soviet socialism , a generation that is unbound by the political considerations of the past .
For us , blogging is saying and writing what we think , " she has said in her blog , which is written in Spanish , Las Leyes de Laritza ( Laritza 's Laws ) .
Only about 2.1 % of Cubans have regular access to the global internet and 11.5 % to the Cuban intranet , according to the Washington - based democracy and human rights organisation Freedom House .
" Bloggers can go online at government - owned internet cafes , at universities and hotels , " it says .
In recent weeks , the Cuban authorities have authorised the Post Office to install internet connections in its branches , BBC Mundo's Havana correspondent Fernando Ravsberg reports .
The cost of accessing the internet remains high for the majority of Cubans , he adds .
Defying control
The majority of bloggers do not openly criticise the government , believing this is the best way to avoid surveillance and persecution .
Yoani Sanchez , whose Spanish - language blog Generation Y was named one of the 25 best blogs in the world in 2009 by Time magazine , said that openness can disarm government efforts at harassment .
" My friends think I am taking a huge risk with my blog .
But I think this is my way of pushing back against the system , if only a little bit , " Ms Sanchez says .
But even using this strategy , Generation Y has been blocked on many occasions , and Ms Sanchez has been refused exit visas to both Germany and Spain to receive journalistic awards .
Over the last few months , the Cuban blogging community has become bolder in its attitude towards the state , demanding greater civil liberties and criticising government policies .
On the Octavo Cerco website , journalist Claudia Cadelo has been active in advocating radical political change , including the " resignation of the president of the Council of State and the entire National Assembly , multi-party elections and overhaul of the security forces " .
And Miriam Celaya , author of the Sin Evasion blog , has called the Communist Party 's Central Committee an " old machine " that cannot be fixed " , and said Cubans were experiencing " ideology fatigue " .
The Cuban government has shown little tolerance of critical opinion in the past .
It still holds 22 people in prison for the " crime " of free expression .
So far however , the government has not clamped down on independent bloggers .
Unlike China for example , Cuba has no sophisticated systems of internet control and censorship .
The reason for this , according to Daniel Erikson , is a lack of understanding of the blogging phenomenon .
" I suspect there is a generational disconnection between the activities of Raul Castro and Yoani Sanchez , " Mr Erikson says .
Moreover , " independent Cuban blogs are not being used as tools to mobilise people for political action " , he adds .
But with the country in the middle of an economic recession , writing about food shortages , healthcare or publishing critical political views could test the limits of government tolerance .
" If bloggers start opposing the government more directly , their risks will certainly increase , " Mr Erikson predicts .

The TTC has further limited the number of tokens riders will be able to buy before an anticipated fare increase goes into effect on Jan.
3 .
Collectors will now sell no more than five tokens per customer to try and prevent stockpiling by some riders in advance of a proposed increase from $ 2.25 to $ 2.50 each .
On Friday , the TTC said it would limit token sales to 10 per customer but some collectors were already running low on Monday , so a steeper limit was implemented , said TTC spokesperson Danny Nicholson .
At automatic entrances , where no collectors are on duty , vending machines will only dispense single tokens until new prices go into effect .
The fare increase has not yet been approved by the city councillors on the Toronto Transit Commission .
I had reserved an hour on the Floor of the House for a " special order . "
When the hour began , I noted that a Harvard study had concluded that 44,789 Americans die each year because they have no health insurance .
I also noted that the Urban Institute had released figures on the number of uninsured in each Congressional district .
Observing that every single House Republican had pledged to block health coverage for the insured , I then did the math :
" Alabama District 1 , Congressman Jo Bonner , 114 dead . "
" Alabama District 3 , Congressman Mike Rogers , 88 dead . "
I continued for 23 minutes , from Alabama to Ohio .
Then the Republicans demanded that I " yield , " so they could object and interrupt me .
I said no : " My time is limited , and I intend to use it . "
Flustered , the Republicans then asked my " words be taken down , " and threatened to call a roll - call vote , at 8 p.m. , on whether I should be sanctioned .
This halted the proceedings , as you can see here .
The House staff informed the Republicans that I had violated no rule of the House .
The Republicans then insisted on reviewing a recording of my speech , going through it with a fine - tooth comb to see if there was anything objectionable .
They found nothing .
Then they asked to " ring the bells " before the proceedings resumed , wasting another 15 minutes .
Finally , after an hour of Republican stalling , I finished the list :
" Wyoming , Congressman Cynthia Lummis , 73 dead . "
For the remainder of this hour , I then read real - life stories from the website namesofthedead.com .
These are submitted by people who lost loved ones because they had no health insurance .
They used to call President Harry Truman ' Give 'em Hell Harry ' .
But President Truman said , " I do n't give them hell ; I just tell the truth and they think it 's hell . "
I 'm telling the Republicans this : Lives are at stake .
If you can't stand the heat on health care , then get out of the kitchen .

Reason : Really new stuff , for real this time
EdgeLeft : The Long Strange Posthumous Life of Leon Trotsky
… an occasional column by David McReynolds , it can be circulated without further permission …
Historically the Socialist Party USA had two major splits .
The first was after the Russian Revolution , when there was an international split in all socialist parties between those who accepted the leadership of Lenin ’s Third International and those who did n’t .
In the US , [ Eugene ] Debs [ 1855 –1926 ] , who had proclaimed himself “ a Bolshevik from the tip of my head to the tips of my toes ” — reflecting the overwhelming international support for the Russian Revolution — then led the Socialist Party in rejecting Lenin ’s “ 21 demands ” [ V. I. Lenin , ‘ Theses on Fundamental Tasks of The Second Congress Of The Communist International ’ , 1920 ] .
There followed the split which led to the formation of the Communist Party .
The second major split — ( actually two in almost one year ) — was the right wing split in 1936 by the Social Democratic Federation which wanted to support Roosevelt , breaking with Norman Thomas [ 1884 –1968 ] , and the split by the Socialist Workers Party which , under James Cannon [ 1890 –1974 ] , had entered the Socialist Party and then in 1937 split , taking much of the youth of the Socialist Party with it .
By the 1960s ( in fact even by 1951 , when I joined the Socialist Party ) both the Socialist and Communist Parties were shadows of the past , battered by various currents .
The Communist Party was never able to build a mass base here after the Cold War began — Communism was seen not simply as “ radical ” but as “ treasonous ” .
The Socialist Party , in no small part because , fearful it might be accused of being communist , spent too little time on what it favored , and too much time making sure its skirts were clean .
( There is nothing simple about this — the Communist Party always had internal dissent , and there was a serious left wing in the Socialist Party , which I joined when I came into the SP . )
Thus when we leap forward to the “ final split ” in the SP in 1972 we are talking about midgets .
Max Shachtman [ 1904 –1971 ] took out his people to form the Social Democrats USA ( actually , he had the majority at the 1972 convention , so for a brief moment he was the SP — it is ironic that it is Shachtman ’s group which has since totally [?] vanished ) .
Michael Harrington [ 1928 –1989 ] finally broke with Shachtman and split to form the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee which morphed into today ’s Democratic Socialists of America .
The remnants of the old Socialist Party , some on the left , some on the right , regrouped under Frank Zeidler [ 1912 –2006 ] in 1973 to form what is today the Socialist Party USA , and which is , pretty much , the legitimate heir to the party of Debs and Thomas .
( It is under the banner of this group that I ran for President in 1980 and 2000 ) .
In the real world nothing is static .
The Socialist Party , which has about 1,000 members , has attracted newer members who are not aware of the history , and whose radicalism includes an admiration [ for ] Lenin and Trotsky .
The SP is not anywhere near another split — only genuine Trotskyist groups can split when they have less than … 1,000 members .
But I ’ve been fascinated by this odd posthumous life of Trotsky , and want to reflect on it here .
There really are n’t any Leninists running around — there are lots of people who belong to “ Marxist / Leninist ” groups , such as the Communist Party , but there are simply not a dozen different Marxist / Leninist groups in this country .
There are large numbers of socialists who are not even aware that there was a Marxist tradition before Lenin , and independent of Lenin .
There must be a few Stalinist groups , I am sure I could find them on Google , but not even the Communist Party today counts as Stalinist .
Stalin has almost no heirs .
[ Almost .
See : Protestant Stalinist Party .
Also : arch-rivals Catholic Trotskyist Party of America .
Discussion here and below . ]
In fact , the interesting thing about Stalin is that almost no one wanted to duplicate his politics .
The Japanese and Italian Communist Parties broke with Moscow very early , not long after Tito had taken Yugoslavia out of the “ Communist Bloc ” .
Mao ( a man Stalin once thought might best be “ eliminated ” ) defied Stalin almost from the beginning .
The Vietnamese were careful , in taking aid from both China and the Soviet Union , not to duplicate the Soviets in their own political patterns ( there were never any purge trials in Vietnam to equal those in the Soviet Union ) .
And Cuba stands almost in its own tradition , bending to Russia when it depended of Moscow ’s aid , but building on Cuba ’s own traditions .
It was as if everyone looked at Stalin and thought “ there is a lot there we do n’t want to repeat ” .
Even the Soviets , to the astonishment of the West , broke with their own “ tradition ” when Stalin died , and , after the murder of Beria , allowed a peaceful transfer of power to Khrushchev .
But Trotsky while dead , is still very much alive .
Sometimes as a ghost on the far right —
Max Shachtman became the first true neo-conservative , embracing the system .
His followers took key positions in the Reagan Administration and in the right wing of the Democratic Party .
Younger readers may find it hard to believe ( I admit that even I do ) that Shachtman , who went into the Communist Party in its early years , traveled to the Soviet Union , was a significant leader of the American Communist Party , ended his life supporting the US invasion of Cuba ( the Bay of Pigs ) , the US invasion of Indochina , shifted from a position critical of Israel to one of fervent support of Israel .
I knew Shachtman well , and while I did n’t like the man , or trust him , I would never have thought he would have ended in the camp of the enemy .
The original Trotskyist movement in this country formed in the late 1920s , headed by James Cannon and Max Shachtman .
It was authentically revolutionary , had an honorable tradition of work in the trade union movement .
It reflected the international split , following Lenin ’s death , between Stalin , the General Secretary of the Soviet Party , and Trotsky , the brilliant , courageous military leader of the Red Armies .
Stalin insisted that a world revolution was not in the cards history had dealt , that the only hope was to build “ socialism in one country ” .
Trotsky , by far the more revolutionary , and internationalist , argued that “ socialism in one country ” would become bureaucratic , militarized , and fatally “ deformed ” .
Both men were right .
There was to be no world revolution .
Germany , which had a powerful socialist movement , did not have a revolution and could not rescue the young Soviet Union .
Trotsky was right , the Soviet Union became a police state .
There was one crucial shift , however , which caused Trotsky to the end of his life to argue that the Soviet Union had to be defended in any conflict with the West — private property had been collectivized , and the old class had been destroyed .
Shachtman split over the matter of the Soviet invasion of Finland , setting up what would beome the Independent Socialist League , which lasted until it merged into the Socialist Party in 1958 .
Some contemporary Trotskyist groups , such as the ISO ( International Socialist Organization ) represent what might be called Shachtman ’s radical positions of the 1950s .
The official Trotskyist group , the Socialist Workers Party , long since became a cult , focused on support of Cuba largely ignoring its own Trotskyist past .
There are other groups which owe a debt to Trotsky — Solidarity , while hardly an orthodox Trotskyist group , comes out of that background .
New Politics , founded by Julius [ 1922–2003 ] and Phyllis Jacobson ( and a journal on which I was once a member of the editorial board ) had its origins in a kind of “ left Shachtmanite ” position .
I felt I served as the “ shabbas goy ” on the editorial board , since I was primarily a pacifist , and had never been a Trotskyist .
At one point — and perhaps the last intellectually significant split in the Trotskyist movement — Bert Cochran [ 1913 –1984 ] formed a new publication , the American Socialist , which had a brief useful life but could not be sustained .
These groups have made real contributions to the American Left .
They made , for the most part , a very serious effort to uphold the best of the Russian Revolution , while being frank about the disaster of Stalin .
Some of the Trotskyists did finally face the problems inherent in Leninism , the vanguard theory of change , the concept of democratic centralism , and the fact Trotsky himself was not really any nicer than Lenin .
There are always apologies made for the violent suppression of the workers uprising at Kronstadt — and I wish the Trotskyists , and Leninists , some of whom are now in the Socialist Party , would realize that if one can justify mass murder because the situation demanded it , they should be much more hesitant in writing off the Socialist Parties in the West because they , too , made compromises .
I guess my question to the Leninists is why are crimes and mistakes acceptable if committed by the followers of Lenin , but not if committed by the non-Communist left .
( Thus far the best answer I ’ve heard is that in the name of the revolution , murder , while regrettable , is defensible ) .
The Workers World Party , formed in 1956 , when the Socialist Workers Party had a split over the Hungarian Revolution , ( WWP supported the Soviet invasion of Hungary ) became a thorn in the side of many of us , with its range of front groups — the International Action Center , ANSWER , etc .
In due time WWP had a split of its own , the Party [ for ]
Socialism and Liberation , which took ANSWER with it .
WWP still exists .
If one had time and the inclination , the list of those who were in the Trotskyist movement , or touched by it , is truly remarkable .
Dwight Macdonald ‘s [ 1906 –1982 ]
Politics , Dissent Magazine , and literally dozens of small Trotskyist groups .
My own primary mentor , A. J. Muste , was briefly — very briefly — in the Trotskyist movement .
The Trotskyist movement has had one great advantage over the Communists — with very few exceptions they never actually had power .
And thus they could be pure .
All those who hold state power will find that it forces compromises .
So much for this very too brief run down .
I have read Trotsky , and Lenin , and Stalin , and a number of others from that period .
I liked Lenin and still do — I just do n’t agree with him .
My own path led me to Gandhi .
I liked Trotsky a bit less , though I concede he was brilliant .
Isaac Deutscher [ 1907 – 1967 ] , in one of his three volumes on Trotsky , cites the case where , in one of the inner- party fights , Trotsky felt he had to make a temporary peace with Stalin .
The price which Stalin exacted was that Trotsky withdraw his support from two of his own key allies .
Which Trotsky did .
Not surprisingly , his allies , once abandoned , sided with Stalin in the next round of in - fighting and helped seal Trotsky ’s fate .
All of which brings me to a deeply flawed film I rented from Netflix — Exile in Buyukada .
Deeply flawed because while showing Trotsky ’s arrival in Turkey , where he spent the first period of his exile , the sound track , featuring a narration by the wonderful actor , Vanessa Redgrave , is “ buried ” under the music .
There are occasional sub-titles , but essentially the film is only worth watching for the sense of that period .
And it is to that sense that I now want to turn my attention , ( while , by pure chance , listening to a new recording of a Shostakovitch work , featuring the Internationale ) .
Let ’s leave aside the manipulations of Shachtman , the betrayals of the Neocons , the chaos created by Workers World … and turn back to the events in the Soviet Union .
That Trotsky would be expelled from the Communist Party and sent into exile was unthinkable .
He had been essential to the revolution .
He did not leave the young Soviet Union as a dissident — he left it as a believer in the revolution .
He and his wife knew they faced death wherever they went , from Stalin ’s agents ( who did finally murder him when he was in Mexico ) .
Trotsky had no allies within the socialist movement .
He despised the socialist parties of the West .
The problem was that he had no allies at all except for the opposition to Stalin which , in the Soviet Union , could not be expressed without risking certain death .
In the West the Trotskyist movement was a small splinter in the side of the Communist movement , under steady ideological attack as “ agents of the State ” .
To support Trotsky was genuinely heroic — no one was going to pay you !
You had no chance at career advancement .
You had no allies in power anywhere in the world .
The Communists would check out books by Trotsky from public libraries in order to destroy them ( and I knew one Shachtmanite who checked out those same books from public libraries in order to save them from destruction – theft in the name of love ) .
The Communists held power in the Soviet Union .
Their parties in Western Europe were strong .
And strong even as far away as Indochina , and China , and Japan .
So those of us who have basic disagreements with Trotsky — essentially the same disagreements we have with Lenin — should pay the history of Trotsky some respect .
He was not a democrat .
It has been said , by one of those in post - Soviet Russia , that if Trotsky had won the fight against Stalin the outcome would have been just as many executions — but with a far more literary flavor .
The sadness of Trotsky ’s life is that once the internal fight in the Soviet Union had been decided , Trotsky was an heroic but lost figure .
His followers in the US ended on the subversive list , were hounded from their jobs by the FBI .
But always and always , those who took Trotsky ’s side cannot help but look back and think what the Soviet Union might have been if only Stalin had lost that fight .
I ’m very much among those who feel that American socialists need to look to American history — not Russian or Chinese or Cuban history — to chart our course .
But no one who has looked back at the early part of the 20th century can fail to be thrilled by that moment when it seemed as if the workers were actually in control of history .
It was this painful memory Trotsky carried with him as he began the first of his exiles in Turkey .
May I suggest — though my Trotskyist and Leninist friends will not hear me — that the greatest honor one could pay to Leon Trotsky would be to let him rest with the honor he earned .
And , as he broke with Stalin , so let us break with all undemocratic efforts at revolution , which would make human beings merely “ means to the end ” .
Humanity — each life — is an end in itself .
As A.J. Muste said , “ there is no way to peace — peace is the way ” .
So too , revolution begins now , as we empower ourselves to think for our own time .

Trotsky ’s ghost wandering the White House
Jeet Heer
National Post
June 7 , 2003
Influence on Bush aides : Bolshevik ’s writings supported the idea of pre-emptive war
Joseph Stalin , the Soviet dictator , was paranoid .
Perhaps his deepest fears centred around his great rival for the leadership of the Bolshevik movement , Leon Trotsky .
Stalin went to extraordinary lengths to obliterate not only Trotsky but also the ragtag international fellowship known as the Left Opposition , which supported Trotsky ’s political program .
In the late 1920s , Stalin expelled Trotsky from the Communist Party and deported him from the Soviet Union .
Almost instantly , other Communist parties moved to excommunicate Trotsky ’s followers , notably the Americans James P. Cannon and Max Shachtman .
In 1933 , while in exile in Turkey , Trotsky regrouped his supporters as the Fourth International .
Never amounting to more than a few thousand individuals scattered across the globe , the Fourth International was constantly harassed by Stalin ’s secret police , as well as by capitalist governments .
The terrible purge trials that Stalin ordered in the late 1930s were designed in part to eliminate any remaining Trotskyists in the Soviet Union .
Fleeing from country to country , Trotsky ended up in Mexico , where he was murdered by an ice - pick - wielding Stalinist assassin in 1940 .
Like Macbeth after the murder of Banquo , Stalin became even more obsessed with his great foe after killing him .
Fearing a revival of Trotskyism , Stalin ’s secret police continued to monitor the activities of Trotsky ’s widow in Mexico , as well as the far - flung activities of the Fourth International .
More than a decade after the demise of the Soviet Union , Stalin ’s war against Trotsky may seem like quaint ancient history .
Yet Stalin was right to fear Trotsky ’s influence .
Unlike Stalin , Trotsky was a man of genuine intellectual achievement , a brilliant literary critic and historian as well as a military strategist of genius .
Trotsky ’s movement , although never numerous , attracted many sharp minds .
At one time or another , the Fourth International included among its followers the painter Frida Kahlo ( who had an affair with Trotsky ) , the novelist Saul Bellow , the poet André Breton and the Trinidadian polymath C.L.R. James .
As evidence of the continuing intellectual influence of Trotsky , consider the curious fact that some of the books about the Middle East crisis that are causing the greatest stir were written by thinkers deeply shaped by the tradition of the Fourth International .
In seeking advice about Iraqi society , members of the Bush administration ( notably Paul D. Wolfowitz , the Deputy Secretary of Defence , and Dick Cheney , the Vice - President ) frequently consulted Kanan Makiya , an Iraqi - American intellectual whose book The Republic of Fear is considered to be the definitive analysis of Saddam Hussein ’s tyrannical rule .
As the journalist Christopher Hitchens notes , Makiya is “ known to veterans of the Trotskyist movement as a one - time leading Arab member of the Fourth International . ”
When speaking about Trotskyism , Hitchens has a voice of authority .
Like Makiya , Hitchens is a former Trotskyist who is influential in Washington circles as an advocate for a militantly interventionist policy in the Middle East .
Despite his leftism , Hitchens has been invited into the White House as an ad hoc consultant .
Other supporters of the Iraq war also have a Trotsky - tinged past .
On the left , the historian Paul Berman , author of a new book called Terror and Liberalism , has been a resonant voice among those who want a more muscular struggle against Islamic fundamentalism .
Berman counts the Trotskyist C.L.R. James as a major influence .
Among neo-conservatives , Berman ’s counterpart is Stephen Schwartz , a historian whose new book , The Two Faces of Islam , is a key text among those who want the United States to sever its ties with Saudi Arabia .
Schwartz spent his formative years in a Spanish Trotskyist group .
To this day , Schwartz speaks of Trotsky affectionately as “ the old man ” and “ L.D. ” ( initials from Trotsky ’s birth name , Lev Davidovich Bronstein ) .
“ To a great extent , I still consider myself to be [ one of the ] disciples of L.D , ” he admits , and he observes that in certain Washington circles , the ghost of Trotsky still hovers around .
At a party in February celebrating a new book about Iraq , Schwartz exchanged banter with Wolfowitz about Trotsky , the Moscow Trials and Max Shachtman .
“ I ’ve talked to Wolfowitz about all of this , ” Schwartz notes .
“ We had this discussion about Shachtman .
He knows all that stuff , but was never part of it .
He ’s definitely aware . ”
The yoking together of Paul Wolfowitz and Leon Trotsky sounds odd , but a long and tortuous history explains the link between the Bolshevik left and the Republican right .
To understand how some Trotskyists ended up as advocates of U.S. expansionism , it is important to know something about Max Shachtman , Trotsky ’s controversial American disciple .
Shachtman ’s career provides the definitive template of the trajectory that carries people from the Left Opposition to support for the Pentagon .
Throughout the 1930s , Shachtman loyally hewed to the Trotsky line that the Soviet Union as a state deserved to be defended even though Stalin ’s leadership had to be overthrown .
However , when the Soviet Union forged an alliance with Hitler and invaded Finland , Shachtman moved to a politics of total opposition , eventually known as the “ third camp ” position .
Shachtman argued in the 1940s and 1950s that socialists should oppose both capitalism and Soviet communism , both Washington and Moscow .
Yet as the Cold War wore on , Shachtman became increasingly convinced Soviet Communism was “ the greater and more dangerous ” enemy .
“ There was a way on the third camp left that anti-Stalinism was so deeply ingrained that it obscured everything else , ” says Christopher Phelps , whose introduction to the new book Race and Revolution details the Trotskyist debate on racial politics .
Phelps is an eloquent advocate for the position that the best portion of Shachtman ’s legacy still belongs to the left .
By the early 1970s , Shachtman was a supporter of the Vietnam War and the strongly anti-Communist Democrats such as Senator Henry Jackson .
Shachtman had a legion of young followers ( known as Shachtmanites ) active in labour unions and had an umbrella group known as the Social Democrats .
When the Shachtmanites started working for Senator Jackson , they forged close ties with hard - nosed Cold War liberals who also advised Jackson , including Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz ; these two had another tie to the Trotskyism ; their mentor was Albert Wohlstetter , a defence intellectual who had been a Schachtmanite in the late 1940s .
Shachtman died in 1972 , but his followers rose in the ranks of the labour movement and government bureaucracy .
Because of their long battles against Stalinism , Shachtmanites were perfect recruits for the renewed struggle against Soviet communism that started up again after the Vietnam War .
Throughout the 1970s , intellectuals forged by the Shachtman tradition filled the pages of neo-conservative publications .
Then in the 1980s , many Social Democrats found themselves working in the Reagan administration , notably Jeanne Kirkpatrick ( who was ambassador to the United Nations ) and Elliott Abrams ( whose tenure as assistant secretary of state was marred by his involvement with the Iran - Contra scandal ) .
The distance between the Russia of 1917 and the Washington of 2003 is so great that many question whether Trotsky and Shachtman have really left a legacy for the Bush administration .
For Christopher Phelps , the circuitous route from Trotsky to Bush is “ more a matter of rupture and abandonment of the left than continuity . ”
Stephen Schwartz disagrees .
“ I see a psychological , ideological and intellectual continuity , ” says Schwartz , who defines Trotsky ’s legacy to neo-conservatism in terms of a set of valuable lessons .
By his opposition to both Hitler and Stalin , Trotsky taught the Left Opposition the need to have a politics that was proactive and willing to take unpopular positions .
“ Those are the two things that the neo-cons and the Trotskyists always had in common : the ability to anticipate rather than react and the moral courage to stand apart from liberal left opinion when liberal left opinion acts like a mob . ”
Trotsky was also a great military leader , and Schwartz finds support for the idea of pre-emptive war in the old Bolshevik ’s writings .
“ Nobody who is a Trotskyist can really be a pacifist , ” Schwartz notes .
“ Trotskyism is a militaristic disposition .
When you are Trotskyist , we do n’t refer to him as a great literary critic , we refer to him as the founder of the Red Army . ”
Paul Berman agrees with Schwartz that Trotskyists are by definition internationalists who are willing to go to war when necessary .
“ The Left Opposition and the non-Communist left comes out of classic socialism , so it ’s not a pacifist tradition , ” Berman observes .
“ It ’s an internationalist tradition .
It has a natural ability to sympathize or feel solidarity for people in places that might strike other Americans or Canadians as extremely remote . ”
Christopher Phelps , however , doubts these claims of a Trotskyist tradition that would support the war in Iraq .
For the Left Opposition , internationalism was not simply about fighting all over the world .
“ Internationalism meant solidarity with other peoples and not imperialist imposition upon them , ” Phelps notes .
Though Trotsky was a military leader , Phelps also notes “ the Left Opposition had a long history of opposition to imperialist war .
They were n’t pacifists , but they were against capitalist wars fought by capitalist states .
It ’s true that there is no squeamishness about the application of force when necessary .
The question is , is force used on behalf of a class that is trying to create a world with much less violence or is it force used on behalf of a state that is itself the largest purveyor of organized violence in the world ?
There is a big difference . ”
Seeing the Iraq war as an imperialist adventure , Phelps is confident “ Trotsky and Shachtman in the ’30s and ’ 40s would n’t have supported this war . ”
This dispute over the true legacy of Trotsky and Shachtman illustrates how the Left Opposition still stirs passion .
The strength of a living tradition is in its ability to inspire rival interpretations .
Despite Stalin ’s best efforts , Trotskyism is a living force that people fight over .

Pasts and present . , Stephen Schwartz , National Review , June 11 , 2003 | Neoconservatives and Trotskyism , Bill King , Enter Stage Right , March 22 , 2004 | The Soviet Union Versus Socialism , Noam Chomsky , Our Generation , Spring / Summer , 1986 : “ The Leninist antagonism to the most essential features of socialism was evident from the very start .
In revolutionary Russia , Soviets and factory committees developed as instruments of struggle and liberation , with many flaws , but with a rich potential .
Lenin and Trotsky , upon assuming power , immediately devoted themselves to destroying the liberatory potential of these instruments , establishing the rule of the Party , in practice its Central Committee and its Maximal Leaders — exactly as Trotsky had predicted years earlier , as Rosa Luxembourg and other left Marxists warned at the time , and as the anarchists had always understood .
Not only the masses , but even the Party must be subject to “ vigilant control from above , ” so Trotsky held as he made the transition from revolutionary intellectual to State priest .
Before seizing State power , the Bolshevik leadership adopted much of the rhetoric of people who were engaged in the revolutionary struggle from below , but their true commitments were quite different .
This was evident before and became crystal clear as they assumed State power in October 1917 . ”
A few current and former signals intelligence guys have been checking in since this NSA domestic spying story broke .
Their reactions range between midly creeped out and completely pissed off .
All of the sigint specialists emphasized repeatedly that keeping tabs on Americans is way beyond the bounds of what they ordinarily do — no matter what the conspiracy crowd may think .
“ It ’s drilled into you from minute one that you should not ever , ever , ever , under any fucking circumstances turn this massive apparatus on an American citizen , ” one source says .
“ You do a lot of weird shit .
But at least you do n’t fuck with your own people . “
Another , who ’s generally very pro-Administration , emphasized that the operation at least started with people that had Al - Qaeda connections — with some mass - spying master list .
As the Times , in its original story , noted :
The C.I.A. seized the terrorists ’ computers , cellphones and personal phone directories , said the officials familiar with the program .
The N.S.A. surveillance was intended to exploit those numbers and addresses as quickly as possible , they said .
…In addition to eavesdropping on those numbers and reading e-mail messages to and from the Qaeda figures , the N.S.A. began monitoring others linked to them , creating an expanding chain .
While most of the numbers and addresses were overseas , hundreds were in the United States , the officials said .
… Since 2002 , the agency has been conducting some warrantless eavesdropping on people in the United States who are linked , even if indirectly , to suspected terrorists through the chain of phone numbers and e-mail addresses .
But this call chain could very well have grown out of control , the source admits .
Suddenly , people ten and twelve degrees of separation away from Osama may have been targeted .
Deputy Director for National Intelligence Michael Hayden hinted at what might be going on in a press conference yesterday :
And here the key is not so much persistence as it is agility .
It ’s a quicker trigger .
It ’s a subtly softer trigger .
And the intrusion into privacy — the intrusion into privacy is significantly less .
It ’s only international calls .
The period of time in which we do this is , in most cases , far less than that which would be gained by getting a court order .
That points to a diferent type of technology at work , as I suggested the other day .
Senator Jay Rockefeller , in a remarkable pair of handwritten letters ( one kept for safe keeping , in case someone tried to say later on that he approved of the program ) seems to back this point of view .
As I reflected on the meeting today , and the future we face , John Poindexter ’s TIA project sprung to mind , exacerbating my concern regarding the direction the Administration is moving with regard to security , technology , and surveillance .
TIA , of course , would be “ Total Information Awareness , ” Darpa ’s effort to find potential enemies of the state in the data trails of ordinary folks .
The program was cancelled a few years back .
But a whole bunch of similar efforts continue throughout the government .
A former sigint type — who also talked to Ryan , apparently — suggests a different technological approach : the NSA “ may have compromised a hardware manufacturer — say Motorola or a satellite phone manufacturer , a telecom carrier or a satellite (s ) . “
I ’ll keep my ears open .
UPDATE 11:27 AM :
There ’s a ton of surveillance - related news that has come out in the last day , including :
- FBI spied on PETA
– Bush personally asked the Times to kill its NSA story
– “ Pentagon ’s Intelligence Authority Widens “
– DoD : gay law school groups a “ credible ” terror threat
UPDATE 12:22 PM : Laura points us to an absolute must - read post from Bill Arkin today :
In the spring of 2001 , NSA began to change direction in its counter - terrorism targeting under Lt. Gen .
Hayden : rather than analyzing the mass of what was collected hoping for the gem in the growing mass of available material , NSA began a methodical process of dissecting terrorist target communications practices and network to determine what to collect .
This is commonly referred to at NSA as hunting rather than gathering .
It was a procedure that was in its infancy on 9/11 .
So what happened ?
The perceived shackles of domestic collection were removed , the gathering process began again to overwhelm the hunting process , new software , data - mining and link analysis methods were applied to isolate potential domestic targets .
UPDATE 2:07 PM : Check out Bruce Schneier for a quick history of domestic eavesdropping .
Our old pal Hannibal from Ars Technica rounds out the review .
And Garrance from around the block dives into the data mining laws .
