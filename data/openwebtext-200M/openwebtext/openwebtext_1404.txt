The little pests that keep crawling into every open orifice in your body .
If you have spent enough time living in New York City you will have suddenly noticed the re-emergence of those horrible undesirable little critters called ‘ bed bugs . ’
As you may or may not remember NY was once a bastion for these little critters at the turn of the last century with the influx of immigrants .
This time the bed bugs we have been noticing are not the tiny little microscopic insects that will always exist in large vast numbers but rather of the e human variety and dare we say they are more lethal , annoying , temperamental and toxic than a deceased elephants dung .
Now you are probably wondering if we have anyone in particular that we ‘d like to nominate as bed bug du jour and the answer to that is of course yes and they will be named in successive days once it is clear they refuse to yield to our desires to change their nefarious ways .
But for now let us run a cursory glance at the many bed bugs cruising your earlobes and doing their darnest to be the heathen that they are .
1 / The first category we ’d like to nominate are the social climbers .
You all know whom you are and if having your picture taken by a d level paparazzi or unread social wanna be mags validates your life you are a pathetic loser .
You have no purpose but to sponge off other people ( your parents principally ) and seek validation of your pathetic being by posing in essentially meaningless and vapid journals that of course cater to meaningless individuals like yourselves .
2 The second class of bed bug and ingrate is the publicist .
Please stop bugging us , we honestly hate you and unless you are on a name first name basis with us go to hell .
We are not interested in covering your new clients sham .
We are only interested in giving credence to those causes and ideas that have sustenance and cause provocative contemplation .
So stop sending us stupid email about some ass who is wearing a new diamond ear ring or shoe strap - we do n’t care !
3 / The other class of bed bug that we despise are those art collectves that call themselves art collectives when in reality all they are pathetic congregations amongst wanna bes with wanna be loser leaders .
All you do is chain smoke and dream how cool you are when in fact you ’re just a non entity pushing a non entity body of work .
4/ Bed bug number 4 that we are fed up with that serves to crawl up your rectum is the celebrity mag .
– you guys suck and bore us to death and inspire nothing but dribble and contempt for the rest of society that chooses to think outside of the celebrity box .
Other than we love your coverage of Tinsley Mortimer , sort of , but really is n’t there something beyond all of this crap to really write about ?
5 / Bed bug number 5 is the fashionista .
Please get over yourself .
We ca n’t stand the sight of you parading your ensemble mess in the street and treating it as fashion when in reality it has no cultural precedence , empirical standing or sustained contemplation .
Thank god fashion week is over cause you frankly nearly ruined the shows by your presence .
6 / Bed bug number 6 is the faux celebrity .
By that we mean idiots who go around to all the fashion shows and preen and pretend they are someone .
You my dears are just foot soldiers in the publicity stunt warfare .
No one takes you guys seriously and you have nothing serious to say , being a paid faux celebrity is just an insult and mad concoction that should immediately go away - for the sake of tears we have with held the long list of names in our roster ( for now ) .
7 / Bed bug number 7 that keeps getting stuck between our bed sheets are the self entitled loafers called hipsters .
You guys suck and just because irony is fun to poke fun at after a while we as a society get sick of your distressed sense of value , but then again everyone is entitled to live the way they want …
8/ Jappy girls and self entitled girls who think that going out with a guy means having your ass paid and cashmere valet catered to .
We are sick of your mantra that you deserve all the nice things because you have a nice ass , are a model or come from Pokeme town where ‘ sex in the city ’ illusions exist .
And if you are one of those East European Jappy girls please never look our way , cause frankly we never liked the sneer .
9 / Gay boys who act like girls .
Stop it – it ’s offensive .
If you ’re sexual preference is for men , please go for it , but for crying out aloud stop emulating false alter egos in order to justify your sexuality , all you are doing is justifying your stupidity .
So cut it out , we hate having to walk over your bed sheet mess in the mornigs .
10 / Our best friends .
These are the ones who somehow never return the phone call , and after you have saved their ass , building or written 10 articles about them are nowhere to be found when it is your turn for some love .
You know whom you are out there , and as much as we were initially inspired by your passion we were woefully turned off by your manic ego and treacherous backstabbing .
You blow my mine
Shortly after sketching this episode , we found out someone had already had this idea [ video ] .
Oh brutal brutal fate , while it ’s not identical it ’s goddamn similar .
Usually , when this happens ( it does sometimes ) we just toss the episode , but in this case we were aching to finish drawing it , so here it is , folks .
The LiMux project , which oversees Linux migration in Munich , the capital of Bavaria , has reached another milestone .
According to a 2009 development review that the deputy project leader Florian Schießl has posted on his blog , open source OpenDocument Format ( ODF ) is now the main document exchange standard , with PDF being used for non-editable files .
According to Schießl , the city administration 's standard desktops now consist of the free OpenOffice.org office suite , Mozilla 's Firefox browser , the Thunderbird email client and several other open source applications , such as the GIMP image editor .
Schießl says the transition required enormous background effort which involved eliminating many IT dependencies created by individual vendors over the years .
More than 20,000 templates had to be consolidated and converted into new templates , macros or web applications .
Most templates and text blocks are now managed via the WollMux program , which was released in 2008 .
Schießl said that the developers also had to adapt a number of corporate applications such as SAP for use with ODF .
According to the review , another achievement in 2009 was the establishment of Linux client pilot areas as a step towards the final aim of migrating all twelve of the city administration 's departments to Linux .
Schießl says this was the last fundamental step required to enable general client migration in the coming years .
Although only 2,500 of around 14,000 workstations have been converted to the custom - built basic LiMux client , the hardest part was to get them all up and running , which required going over inconsistent IT infrastructures that had developed over the years and training the IT staff for the technical switch .
As Robert Pogson observes in his blog , six and a half years after the decision was made to switch to free software , the Munich Linux pioneers have completed about 80 per cent of the project 's total workload .
According to Schießl , " the final big step , the general client migration , ' will begin in the coming months .
A target plan developed in 2008 stipulates that the switch is to be completed by 2012 at the latest .
In general , Munich adopted a " soft migration " approach and ineffective emulation of problematic processes and the creation of identical conversions of text blocks and macros was avoided .

Washington ( CNN ) --
The director of U.S. national intelligence said the government has the right to kill Americans abroad if they present a direct threat to U.S. security .
The admission from Dennis Blair came Wednesday at a House Intelligence Committee hearing on the annual threat assessment .
" We take direct action against terrorists in the intelligence community , " Blair told lawmakers at the hearing .
" If that direct action -- we think that direct action will involve killing an American , we get specific permission to do that . "
Blair said the reason he made the admission was to reassure Americans .
" We 're not careless about endangering American lives as we try to carry out the policies to protect most of the country , " he said .
Blair went on to say the United States does not target Americans for taking part in free speech , but rather will target them if they threaten other Americans or the United States .
Topping the list of such Americans may be Anwar al - Awlaki , currently living in Yemen .
Privately , many administration officials said he is one of the next American citizens abroad with whom the U.S. intelligence community wants to deal .
Al - Awlaki is a fugitive American - born preacher whom a U.S. counterterrorism official described as a " key associate of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula 's top leaders and one of their go - to men for external plotting . "
Another American security official told CNN that U.S. authorities want al - Awlaki for questioning but denied there is an explicit order to " take him out . "
U.S. security sources said last month they had concrete and independent confirmation that al - Awlaki had met with Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab , the Nigerian accused in the failed Christmas Day bomb plot aboard a plane heading to Detroit , Michigan .
Al - Awlaki has confirmed his contact with U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan , the man accused of shooting and killing 13 people in November at Fort Hood , Texas .
If the United States were to take action against American , it would be a decision based on intelligence information that a citizen is posing a threat and must be dealt with , according to Blair .
The United States often uses drones to target terrorist suspects , and the special forces have a covert capability to deal with such situations .
An abandoned Cheetah cub is being hand reared by her keeper at Longleat .
The female cub has been nicknamed “ Xena ” , after the warrior princess , which also marks her battling qualities .
Xena spent her first ten days being cared for by her mum , Wilma .
However , keepers discovered the tiny cub was cold , weak and alone on April 19 .
Despite numerous unsuccessful attempts to get mother and baby back together , the decision was taken by keepers to remove the cub and rear her by hand .
Photo Credits : Ian Turner ( Images 1 - 4 ) / Longleat
Keeper , Matt Cleverley , who has previously experienced hand - rearing a Cheetah while working in Africa , volunteered to look after the tiny cub .
Matt ’s wife , Kate , also a keeper at Longleat , also took up parenting duties .
The cub needs to be bottle - fed every four hours , day and night , until she is six weeks old .
Then , she will start to be weaned on to a meat diet .
“ No one is sure why Wilma , who was such a brilliant first - time mum with cubs Winston and Poppy in 2016 , should have abandoned Xena , ” said Matt .
“ We did everything we could to try and get her to re-bond with the baby , but it was n’t working , and we were faced with an extremely difficult choice of not interfering and letting the cub die or stepping in and attempting to rear her by hand . ”
Matt continued , “ It ’s a huge responsibility , and we ’re taking it day - by - day , but she is developing well and has already more than doubled her birth weight .
So we ’re cautiously optimistic that she will make it . ”
“ As with human babies , she does require round the clock care and attention , and Kate and myself share the duties between us . ”
“ It does mean the cub comes home with us at the end of each day , but it ’s going to be very much worthwhile if we can help get her to a stage where she can fend for herself , ” he added .
This is only the second Cheetah birth at Longleat , following the arrival of cubs Winston and Poppy in 2016 .
The Cheetah ( Acinonyx jubatus ) is officially classified as ‘ Vulnerable ’ on the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List of Threatened Species , which means it is likely to become ‘ Endangered ’ , unless the circumstances threatening its survival and reproduction improve .
In 2008 , the IUCN estimated there to be around 7,500 - 10,000 adult Cheetahs in Africa , and there are concerns the numbers have decreased significantly since then .
Longleat ’s Cheetahs are part of the European Endangered Species Programme .
In this photo released by Chile 's Presidency , Chile 's President Michelle Bachelet looks at collapsed houses after an earthquake in Concepcion , Chile , Saturday , Feb. 27 , 2010 .
An 8.8 - magnitude earthquake , which epicenter was just 70 miles ( 115 kilometers ) from Concepcion , Chile 's second - largest city , struck central Chile early Saturday .
( AP Photo / Chile Presidency )
( AP ) --
The huge earthquake that struck off the coast of Chile belongs to an " elite class " of mega earthquakes , experts said , and is similar to the 2004 Indian Ocean temblor that triggered deadly tsunami waves .
The magnitude - 8.8 quake was a type called a " megathrust , " considered the most powerful earthquake on the planet .
Megathrusts occur when one tectonic plate dives beneath another .
Saturday 's tremor unleashed about 50 gigatons of energy and broke about 340 miles of the fault zone , according to the U.S. Geological Survey 's National Earthquake Information Center .
The quake 's epicenter was offshore and occurred about 140 miles north of the largest earthquake ever recorded - a magnitude - 9.5 that killed about 1,600 people in Chile and scores of others in the Pacific in 1960 .
" It 's part of an elite class of giant earthquakes , " said USGS geologist Brian Atwater .
If the magnitude holds , it will tie with the 1906 offshore Ecuador quake as the fifth largest since 1900 .
" We call them great earthquakes .
Everybody else calls them horrible , " said USGS geophysicist Ken Hudnut .
" There 's only a few in this league . "
The Chile quake was smaller than the Sumatra quake of 2004 , a magnitude - 9.1 and was not expected to be anything nearly as destructive .
That quake and ensuing tsunami killed 230,000 people .
Another difference is that the Chile quake triggered tsunami warnings hours ahead of time in Hawaii and Pacific islands , allowing people time to flee to higher ground .
In 2004 , there was little measuring technology in place to warn Indian Ocean countries about incoming killer waves .
More than 100 aftershocks measuring magnitude - 5 or larger rattled Chile throughout the day .
So far , the quake death toll has surpassed 300 - a number that will likely rise .
Several more died when tsunami waves swamped an island off the country 's coast .
Chile is no stranger to violent jolts .
In fact , USGS geophysicist Ross Stein called the country an " earthquake hatchery . "
Thirteen temblors of magnitude 7 or larger have hit Chile since 1973 .
The latest quake took place at a boundary where two plates of the Earth 's crust grind and dive .
While that type of action gave rise to the Andes mountains that form the backbone of South America , it 's also the source of some of the largest quakes .
The Chile temblor struck a day after a smaller earthquake shook the southern coast of Japan .
Experts said the quakes appear to be unrelated .
There 's also no connection between this quake and the disaster in Haiti , said University of Miami geology professor Tim Dixon .
A quake like the one that hit Haiti , a magnitude 7 , happens somewhere in the world about every month , usually underwater .
But the type that hit Chile is among the most powerful recorded in recent history .
The faults in Haiti and Chile are distant enough that stress from one would not affect the other , Dixon said .

Stochastic Optimal Control : The Discrete - Time Case
The book is a comprehensive and theoretically sound treatment of the mathematical foundations of stochastic optimal control of discrete - time systems , including the treatment of the intricate measure - theoretic issues .
" Bertsekas and Shreve have written a fine book .
The exposition is extremely clear and a helpful introductory chapter provides orientation and a guide to the rather intimidating mass of literature on the subject .
Apart from anything else , the book serves as an excellent introduction to the arcane world of analytic sets and other lesser known byways of measure theory . "

Matthew Herbert 's attempt to document the life cycle of a pig thwarted after abattoirs and vets refuse to let him record the slaughter
A veterinarian has ruined Matthew Herbert 's plan to document the sounds of a pig's life , from birth to post - mortem supper party .
The celebrated electronic musician has been forced to cancel a " crucial " portion of his One Pig project , after a vet forbade Herbert from recording the animal 's slaughter .
" Rather frustratingly , and despite many phone calls , we have found it impossible to find an abattoir to allow us to record the death of the pig , " Herbert wrote on his site this week .
" We found one farmer willing to let us record , but then the attending vet did not allow it . "
While Herbert 's previous projects have recycled sounds from grave - sites , parliament and the human body , One Pig is perhaps his most ambitious recording .
" I will be there at [ the pig's ] birth , during its life , present at its death , and during the butchery process , " he explained on his website .
" Its body will then be given to chefs new and old , " including Fat Duck 's Heston Blumenthal , " [ and ] there will be a feast .
Maybe a pair of shoes and a drum from the skin , and a toothbrush from its bristles , and ink from its blood . "
Herbert also previously promised a flute from its bones .
While it all may sound like a grisly joke , Herbert has not approached the process with levity .
" For me the death was always a crucial part of the project , " he wrote .
" It was the part I was looking forward to the least , but the part I felt was most pertinent in my understanding of this life . "
Born in mid-August , Herbert 's pig was finally killed away from the microphones earlier this week .
As his one - line post reads : " The pig is now dead . "
It will now only live in sound .
But now that the old behemoths of the news are in decline , the unified public they assembled is fading too .
Neither the broadcast networks nor the newspapers have the reach they once did , raising concerns about whether the press will be able to serve its classic function as a watchdog over government .
That problem also has a flip side .
Precisely because the press is often critical of political leaders , it provides them legitimacy when it validates the grounds for their decisions .
A press that is widely trusted by the public for its independence and integrity is also a resource for building consensus .
Thus when the public sorts itself according to hostile , ideologically separate media — when the world of Walter Cronkite gives way to the world of Glenn Beck and Keith Olbermann — political leadership loses a consensus - building partner .
This is the problem that faces Barack Obama .
It is not , however , an unprecedented one .
To most Americans , at least until recently , it had long seemed a settled matter that the media should have no relationship with political parties — but that has not been the norm throughout American history , much less in other countries .
In many democracies , newspapers and other media have developed in parallel with political parties ( sometimes directly financed and controlled by them ) , while elsewhere the media have been independent , with no partisan connection .
The prevailing model for how American presidents interact with the media has gone through three historical stages .
As a young republic ( and to a large extent even after the Civil War ) , the nation had partisan newspapers ; the second stage , stretching across the 20th century , was characterized by powerful , independent media outlets that kept their distance from the parties ; and in the third stage , we now have a hybrid system that combines elements of the first two .
The founding period in American history created a new and richly supportive environment for the press .
Britain and other European states , seeing popular newspapers as a political threat , had limited what they could say and imposed heavy taxes to raise their costs and reduce their circulation .
America ’s Founders , in contrast , believed that the circulation of news and political debate could help preserve their fragile republic .
So besides guaranteeing the press its freedom , they excluded it from taxation and subsidized its development by setting cheap postal rates for mailing newspapers to subscribers .
The government thereby underwrote the costs of a national news network without regulating its content .
Public officials also subsidized specific newspapers they favored , by awarding generous contracts for government printing and paying fees for official notices .
Together with subscription and advertising income , the postal and printing subsidies provided the financial basis for a development of the press so rapid that by 1835 , the United States , even though it was still almost entirely rural , probably had the highest per capita newspaper circulation in the world .
Tomorrow will mark three weeks since the massive January 12th earthquake in Haiti , and tent cities remain full , even as some businesses and factories are beginning to reopen in Port - au - Prince .
Now that massive amounts of aid have arrived , distribution problems have cropped up and are being addressed .
The World Food Program has begun a new system of delivering rice to 10,000 Haitians per day at each of 16 women - only distribution points around the city - restricted to women , since young men often muscle their way to the front of distribution lines , and the women are viewed as more likely to fairly divide up the food .
Aid chiefs and donor nations are warning that Haiti will need at least a decade of painstaking reconstruction .

Arabs became refugees following leaders ' promise :
" A week , two weeks ... and you 'll return to Palestine "
by Itamar Marcus and Nan Jacques Zilberdik
" They [ Arab leaders ] said : ' A week , two weeks , approximately , and you 'll return to Palestine , ' " said Sadek Mufid .
" We headed first from Dir al - Qasi [ northern Israel ] to Rmaich [ Lebanon ] , considering what they ( Arab leaders ) said at the time : ' By Allah , in a week or two , you will return to Palestine . '
The Arab armies entered Palestine , along with the Arab Liberation Army .
We left - we and those who fled with us - and we all headed for Lebanon .
Some people came to Rmaich and others came to the villages on the border , such as Ein Ibl and also to Bint Jbeil .
People scattered .
And we have about 11 or 15 [ refugee ] camps in Lebanon . "

Mike Dolce
Mike Dolce earned his spot in the house with a KO victory but things did n’t go as well in the first round of the competition as he lost out to Jesse Taylor by rear naked choke .
He was n’t recalled for the season finale .
Since the show Dolce has continued fighting , but so far he has failed to make an impression , winning just one of his last five fights .
His last two opponents , Shane Primm and Roman Mitichyan are also former TUF competitors , and both ended in defeat for Dolce .
Fighting is not the only string to his bow however .
Dolce is also a strength coach and nutritionist , and amongst other pursuits has developed ‘ The Dolce Diet ’ , a weight cutting program that has been used and endorsed by fighters like Quinton Rampage Jackson , Michael Bisping and Chael Sonnen .
He also recently made a return to The Ultimate Fighter as an assistant coach on the 10th season of the show .
With a pro record of 3 - 7
Dolce is hoping to get his fighting career back on track with a win at an Adrenaline MMA event in February against the Dennis Olson ( 8 - 2 ) .

Anyone who follows my exploits will have noticed I 'm a tireless proponent of ELPA , the Emacs Lisp Package Archive .
As a maintainer of several Elisp libraries , ELPA makes my life easier by helping me sidestep the boring problems of distribution and installation .
You may not know that package.el , the software behind ELPA , has been submitted for inclusion in the next version of Emacs .
I 've taken up the task of getting it ready .
Including something like package.el into Emacs is a big job , and it 's something that can only happen gradually .
Emacs comes with a number of applications such as Org Mode and Gnus that are developed externally to Emacs and merged periodically into the main Emacs source tree .
If they were to be redone as packages they could still be distributed with Emacs builds but kept out of the source tree .
They could also be upgraded and installed / removed independently of Emacs ' historically long release cycles .
If you 've submitted packages to ELPA before , you know it 's a process that could use some streamlining .
Currently it 's all done by email , and packages must be manually uploaded by a single maintainer before they appear to users .
This has long been the biggest shortcoming of ELPA .
I 've written some additions ( package - maint.el ) that allow you to automate the maintenance of a package source .
Basically you provide it with a list of git URLs , and it will check out each tagged version and create a package from it .
Of course , that would n't be useful without giving clients the ability to get packages from multiple sources at once , which I also added to package.el .
If you maintain any Emacs packages of your own , please try out my changes to package.el .
If you use any of my packages , try upgrading and adding my package source to your list .
( add - to - list ' package - archives ' ( " technomancy " .
" http://repo.technomancy.us/emacs/ " )
t)
That way you 'll get access to my updates as soon as they 're tagged rather than waiting for them to be manually uploaded , though currently the latest versions of all my packages are in ELPA .
Next steps are closer integration with Emacs in order to have packages installable on a system - wide level as well as a per-user level , prerelease version number support , and extraction of some built - in Emacs libraries as packages .
Suggestions , bug reports , and patches welcome !
Update : package.el has been integrated into Emacs 24 .
If you use Emacs 23 , please use this version instead .
Update : I 've started using Marmalade instead of maintaining my own repository .
Update :
Never use any package repository that does n't have TLS , including Marmalade .
In fact , you should probably just install packages using your version control system you 're already using for your dotfiles .

Rodent 's Revenge and SkiFree - Good Old Days of Gaming
Posted by Kaleb Brasee on Saturday , February 14th , 2009 at 03:09 PM
I was looking through my directory on my hard drive today and reminiscing ( yeah , I have files that are 15 years old , I think that counts as reminiscing ) .
In the " ancient " directory I found two awesome old games that I had forgotten all about : Rodent 's Revenge and SkiFree Rodent 's Revenge is a great little strategy game where you 're a mouse that has to corner cats using blocks so that they do n't catch and eat you .
Somehow , cornering a cat means that it evaporates , but I 'm not exactly sure how or why that happens .
You can download Rodent 's Revenge here SkiFree is a twitch action game where you ski down a hill , slaloming or freestyling among trees and hills and lifts and dogs and other skiers .
And eventually if you ski far enough down the hill , a yeti eats you .
The slalom mode keeps track of your best times — I remember trying for hours to get better and better times on the tree slalom .

VANCOUVER , British Columbia --
On a day that was being billed as a day for the ages in international hockey , this was undeniably a hit for the ages .
Alex Ovechkin's devastating open-ice hit on Jaromir Jagr tilted their preliminary - round game in favor of the Russians by a 4 - 2 count Sunday , and the postgame joke in the mixed zone was that Jagr would come in and thank Ron Francis and his old Pittsburgh Penguins teammates because his bell was rung so hard .
AP Photo / Chris O'Meara Alex Ovechkin's hit on Jaromir Jagr led to Russia 's third goal of the game .
Alex Ovechkin's hit on Jaromir Jagr led to Russia 's third goal of the game .
Jagr showed up to talk to the media with a broken visor , apparently courtesy of the Ovechkin hit , but did n't appear to have been teleported back to 1992 , and quickly took responsibility for what was the game - changing play .
Jagr was crossing through center ice about 1:40 into the third period , when Ovechkin leveled him with a shoulder that separated Jagr from the puck and sent him sprawling .
The Russians scooped up the loose puck and Alexander Semin fed a nice cross-ice pass to Evgeni Malkin , who scored to give the Russians a 3 - 1 lead .
" Before you ask me the question , I know I made a mistake , " Jagr said .
" The hit does n't [ really bother me ] .
The mistake , the turnover , they scored the goal , that hurts , that hurt me the most . "
Asked when he was last hit that hard , Jagr laughingly joked , " I do n't remember .
I do n't remember anything . "
The loss was the first of the tournament for the Czechs , while the Russians won after dropping an emotional shootout game against the Slovaks in their previous outing , taking over the top spot in the so - called " pool of death " and passing through to the quarterfinal games Wednesday .
Ovechkin , for his part , stopped to talk to media in the mixed zone for about 20 seconds before taking off .
As a self - styled champion of the NHL 's continued involvement in the Olympics , he 's hardly winning friends and influencing people .
" It is just a moment .
If I have a chance to hit somebody , it does not matter who it is , " said Ovechkin .
The Washington Capitals ' star had two assists in this game , but his real presence thus far in the Olympic tournament has been marked more by his physical play .
He and Slovak defenseman Zdeno Chara battled throughout an earlier game , and the Russians were the more physical of the two teams Sunday .
" I think overall we 're playing a really physical game , " said Ilya Kovalchuk .
" It shows a lot of emotions .
It 's a really important game for both teams .
It 's for first place , but definitely that hit turned the game around a little bit .
We all know [ Ovechkin ] can hit .
It 's part of the game and he finished his check . "
Actually , that 's pretty funny .
Ovechkin finished his Czech , all right .
" It 's a lift , it 's a great hit , a clean hit , right at the time when Jags tried to pick up the pace a bit and we scored right away , so momentum was great , " Russian defenseman Sergei Gonchar said .
" We have a lot of guys who can score the goals .
From now on , every game of the tournament is so important , so it 's not about who scores the goals , it 's about doing the right things , and Alex has obviously done the right things for us . "
Russia 's top line
On the heels of Canada and the United States juggling their top forward lines , Russia also followed suit with Malkin replacing Pavel Datsyuk on the No. 1 unit between Ovechkin and Semin .
The line produced one five - on - five goal and the game - winner by Malkin 1:49 into the third period , and overall looked more dangerous than the Datsyuk - led unit in the previous two games .
" I think we played well , all four lines played well , " said Ovechkin .
Datsyuk dropped back to center Kovalchuk and Maxim Afinogenov .
So if NHL rivals Ovechkin and Malkin can play on the same line like Mike Richards and Sidney Crosby for Canada , guess anything is possible , eh ?

There was intrigue heading into Sunday 's big game against the Czechs as to whom would be in net for powerhouse Russia : Evgeni Nabokov or Ilya Bryzgalov
Both are having outstanding NHL seasons .
But Bryzgalov was between the pipes last spring when Russia won its second consecutive World Championship title , which led many to believe the Phoenix Coyotes netminder might have the edge over his San Jose Sharks counterpart to be the No. 1 man in this tournament .
Apparently , that was just a thought shared by North American media .
" Absolutely no one in Russia believed it should be anyone other than Nabokov , " a Russian hockey writer told ESPN.com following Sunday 's win , a huge victory that gave Russia its pool and a bye into the quarterfinals .
With Nabokov 2 - 0 in this tournament with a 2.00 goals - against average and .911 save percentage , and Bryzgalov a hard - luck loser to Slovakia in a shootout , it would appear the Sharks ' goalie is the man from here on out .
Not that he wanted to start thinking ahead Sunday .
" It 's too early to make any decisions , have any conclusions , " Nabokov said after stopping 23 of 25 shots Sunday .
" We still have to work on a lot of things , we still have to put together another good game and get going .
But I thought it was a good start for us today . "
He was then yanked from the interview area by a Russian team official , so we did n't get to ask him more than one question .
But this much is clear :
Of all the Sharks in this Olympic tournament , who all have a lot to prove in these pressure - packed games given their collective NHL playoff performances over the past few seasons , no one has more to show than Nabokov .
For our money , he was the No. 1 reason the top- seeded Sharks were upset by the eighth - seeded Anaheim Ducks in last season 's playoffs and enters this season needing to prove he 's a money goalie .
He just happens to be an unrestricted free agent July 1 .
Nothing like a gold medal and a deep NHL playoff run to help ring the cash register .
Sometimes things that seem like a good idea really are n’t , and sometimes things that seem like a bad idea really are n’t either .
I have n’t decided if this is a good idea or a bad idea yet , or even if it was successful or unsuccessful .
So while creating the Chinese 5 Spice infused vodka for the Chinese 5 Spice Belgian Dubbel I decided I was going to mess around with making a Hop Vodka also .
Originally I had contacted the distiller at Dogfish Head Brewery to get her advice on what kind of proportions were necessary , how to filter , and if they had ever tried it .
She responded that they have never tried a Chinese 5 Spice vodka , but had tried a Hop Vodka without too much success .
Her advice was two handfuls ( she guessed 2 oz ) of whole leaf hops to 750 ml of vodka .
Let soak for 48 hours then strain , then filter through charcoal ( like a Brita filter ) .
She said with their experiment it was still too strong and they then cut the infused vodka with 750 ml of plain vodka , so really 1 oz to 750 ml .
So for my experiment I used 1 oz of Cascade whole leaf hops to 375 ml of vodka .
I let this soak for 48 hours giving it a shake whenever I happened to walk by .
I then inverted the jar and strained the hops out through the vodka for 24 hours .
After that time there was just over 200 ml of hop infused vodka , where ’d the other 150 ml go , I ’m not sure I guess the hops drank it .
The Hop Vodka is a bizarre bright yellow / orange and smells very much of hops , but also with a grassy tone to it .
The flavor is , … intense !
It covers all aspects of the hop , bitterness , flavor , and aroma , plus the grassy / green / flowery type thing .
And of course it ’s vodka , so it ’s hot , well , at least to me .
So far now I ’m not sure if I like it , it ’s big .
I think if ( when ) I do it again I ’ll use a higher vodka to hops ratio , like 1 oz to 750 ml , and / or let the hops sit on the vodka for a shorter time frame , like 24 hours instead .
So what ’s next ?
I think Hop Bombs are next , think a Boiler Maker but with Hop Vodka and DFH 60 Minute IPA !
I think I just made myself a little excited 🙂
Giant rainforest trees , rare and beautiful orchids , spectacular palms , minute fungi , wild coffees and an ancient aquatic plant are among more than 250 new plant and fungi species discovered and described by botanists from the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew in this , the botanical organisation 's 250th anniversary year .
The new species come from a wide - range of fascinating locations including Brazil , Cameroon , East Africa , Madagascar , Borneo and New Guinea .
Nearly a third are believed to be in danger of extinction .
Following in the footsteps of their famous botanical predecessors such as Sir Joseph Banks , Sir Joseph Hooker , and Charles Darwin , taxonomic botanists at the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew continue to explore and study the world 's plant and fungal diversity , making astonishing discoveries every year .
Their work involves a combination of fieldwork in remote and exotic parts of the world , and research in the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew's Herbarium , a vast scientific collection of over seven million dried plants specimens , perhaps the largest of its kind in the world .
This work has never been more relevant and pressing than in the current era of global climate change and unprecedented loss of biodiversity -- especially as we count down to the International Year of Biodiversity in 2010 .
" These new discoveries highlight the fact that there is so much of the plant world yet to be discovered and documented .
Without knowing what 's out there and where it occurs , we have no scientific basis for effective conservation .
It is vital that these areas of botanical science are adequately funded and supported .
Examples of the new discoveries are listed below .
Canopy Giants from the rainforests of Cameroon
Among the most gigantic of the new species discoveries are three towering rainforest trees discovered by Xander van der Burgt , and colleagues in the Korup National Park in Cameroon .
Talbotiella velutina ( www.kew.org/plants-fungi/talbotiella-velutina.htm) and Lecomtedoxa plumosa both reach more than 30 m into the forest canopy , but Berlinia korupensis ( www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Berlinia-korupensis.htm), named by Dr Barbara Mackinder , tops these at more than 42 m in height with a buttressed trunk almost 1 m wide .
The Berlinia is a member of the pea family ( Leguminosae ) .
It bears beautiful white flowers from which enormous pods some 30 cm in length develop .
The pods explode when ripe , propelling the seeds ballistically away from the mother tree .
Surveys of the Korup National Park revealed that this tree is extremely rare .
" We found just 17 trees in our surveys , " says van der Burgt .
" Even though Korup is protected , Berlinia korupensis is critically endangered due to human pressures on the park .
"
The Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew and in -country collaborators have discovered and described more than 100 new plant species from Cameroon since 1995 , although Dr Martin Cheek , leader of the programme in Cameroon , comments that " species discovery is accelerating [ with ] more than 50 of these new species described since 2005 . "
From the tallest to the smallest
advertisement
The smallest species on this year 's new species list are wood - rotting fungi , which are less than a millimeter thick and cover their hosts like a lick of paint .
With a Swedish colleague , Dr Brian Spooner and Dr Peter Roberts , the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew 's experts on fungal taxonomy , have just described five of these minute fungi .
" They are small , but they perform a vital role in decomposition of plant material and recycling of nutrients , " says Dr Spooner .
These new fungi were among many specimens collected during a joint Anglo - Australian expedition to the Kimberley Region of Western Australia in 1988 and which are still under study .
Other miniature discoveries in this year 's list include two new species of Gymnosiphon ; bizarre little flowering plants less than 10 cm tall that derive their energy not from the sun but from underground fungi ( www.kew.org/plants-fungi/gymnosiphon-afro-orientalis.htm).
Marie Briggs , the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew botanist , who discovered one of these plants in Madagascar in 2007 , seems to have a penchant for discovering small plants .
While on an expedition to western Madagascar in 2009 she found specimens of a new genus of succulent belonging to the coffee family ( Rubiaceae ) , and which is less than 3 cm tall .
Mountains of orchids
With just over 25,000 species , the orchids are probably the world 's largest flowering plant family .
The Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew 's orchid experts Dr Jeff Wood and Dr Phil Cribb have added 38 new species to the total this year alone .
Wood has been studying the orchids of Mount Kinabalu , the highest mountain in Borneo ( 4095 m ) , for more than a decade and yet continues to discover species new to science .
" Kinabalu is unbelievably rich , " says Dr Wood .
" In an area of just 1,200 square kilometres 866 different orchids occur , including 13 new species described this year alone . "
But there is trouble in paradise ; Borneo 's forests are being devastated by widespread logging for timber and oil palm plantations .
Dr Wood has named a further 15 new species this year , all of which have been discovered in logging areas in Borneo .
Orchids face a further threat -- illegal collection for the horticultural trade .
Wood 's research is essential -- put simply , by placing these spectacular plants on the map , he is throwing them a lifeline .
Two dozen new palms
An astounding 24 new species of palm feature on the list .
Some are enormous forest canopy trees , such as the 25 m tall Cyrtostachys bakeri ( www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Cyrtostachys-bakeri.htm), discovered by Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew palm expert Dr Bill Baker in Papua New Guinea , but most are slender , elegant palms from the rainforest undergrowth .
Twenty of the new palms come from Madagascar , which is home to 188 palm species .
" After 20 years of research , we 're still finding new species in Madagascar , " says Dr Baker .
" A half of all known Madagascar palms have been discovered by Kew botanists . "
Less than 10 % of Madagascar 's original vegetation remains and a further 200,000 - 300,000 hectares of forest are destroyed every year .
As a result , 90 % of Madagascar 's palms , including all of the 20 new species , are threatened with extinction because of habitat loss and destruction of palms for the numerous useful products that they provide , such as food and construction materials .
Some are incredibly rare ; for example , fewer than 10 individuals of one of the new species , Dypsis humilis ( www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Dypsis-humilis.htm), were found in a single forest patch used heavily by local people for timber .
Innovative conservation strategies involving local communities are needed to save these species .
This approach has been effectively employed for the conservation of the ' suicide palm ' , Tahina spectabilis ( www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Tahina-spectabilis.htm), discovered in Madagascar by a collaborative team led from the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew in 2007 .

The coffee species that could save your daily cup from climate change
Seven wild coffee species , mostly native to the mountains of northern Madagascar , feature on the list .
This takes the total number of new coffee species discovered by the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew and its partners over the past ten years to nearly 30 , including some weird and wonderful species .
Coffea labatii and Coffea pterocarpa ( www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Coffea-pterocarpa.htm) have winged fruits , while Coffea namorokensis and Coffea bissetiae are distinctly hairy , and Coffea ambongensis and Coffea boinensis have the largest seeds of any coffee species : their ' coffee beans ' are more than twice the size of those of Coffea arabica ( Arabica coffee www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Coffea-arabica.htm), the main species used in the commercial production of coffee .
" We 're still finding new species of coffee , including those directly related to crop plants , " says the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew 's coffee expert Dr Aaron Davis .
" Coffee is the world 's second most traded commodity , after oil , with at least 25 million farming families dependent on its production for their livelihoods , yet we still have much to learn about its wild relatives .
We estimate that 70 % of wild coffee species are in danger of extinction due to habitat loss and climate change .
" Conserving the genetic diversity within this genus has implications for the sustainability of our daily cup , particularly as coffee plantations are highly susceptible to climate change .
Those involved in the coffee trade could help to future - proof the industry by working with Kew and its partners to create reserves to conserve coffee genetic resources . "
Ancient aquatic plant on the rocks
Isoetes eludens ( www.kew.org/plants-fungi/isoetes-eludens.htm), a species of an ancient group of spore - plants known as quillworts , and so named because it eluded its discoverers for seven years , was found in a mountain - top rock pool in a remote corner of Namaqualand , South Africa by the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew's Director , Professor Stephen Hopper .
Botanists are concerned that these exposed temporary rock pools -- known by the local Nama people as ! gau -- are vulnerable to climate change which could mean the 5 cm high plant 's days are numbered .
Urgent collection of spores and long - term storage in seed banks is an important next step to secure the conservation of this intriguing species .
Quillworts date from fossils aged more than 150 million years old in an era before the evolution of flowering plants .
" To discover a completely new species in a small pool just 2 m in diameter and 15 cm deep was an unexpected delight .
It highlights how much more work is needed to reveal the full diversity of the Cape 's world - famous flora , " says Professor Hopper .
Critically endangered ' cancer cure ' yam
Dioscorea strydomiana is a critically endangered species from South Africa with only two populations of about 200 plants known in the wild .
It does not look like a typical yam -- it is shrub - like in appearance with a huge , slow growing , lumpy wooden tuber above the ground measuring up to 1 m in height and diameter .
The tuber sprouts multiple shoots each spring .
The species is regarded as a cancer cure in the region where it grows and as a result is under threat from over - collection by medicinal plant collectors who cut pieces off the tubers .
The Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew 's yam expert , Dr Paul Wilkin , describes this species as " the most unique and unusual yam I have come across , and probably the most threatened . "
Indigos and relatives
Fourteen species of the blue dye indigo producing genus Indigofera have been described as new to science in 2009 .
Few natural by - products have played as prominent a role in history and in international trade as indigo .
It has been a valued dye from the earliest human civilizations because of its compatibility with all types of natural fibres and its ability to be combined with other natural dyes to create a range of colours not possible to produce with synthetic substitutes .
The Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew has had a long - standing interest in the research of this genus and these discoveries arose during ongoing research in southern tropical Africa .
Of the 14 new species described , 11 are highly localised and are threatened with extinction .
Indigofera has more than 750 species and occurs throughout the tropical regions of the world .
It is member of Leguminosae ( pea family ) .
Discovered in a glasshouse
Most of this year 's discoveries come direct from the wild , but in one case , a new species was found closer to home -- in Kew Gardens ' Princess of Wales conservatory .
Dr Iain Darbyshire , an expert on African botany , stumbled across Isoglossa variegata ( www.kew.org/plants-fungi/isoglossa-variegata.htm) during a lunchtime wander in the glasshouse , where it was used for tropical bedding .
Dr Darbyshire , who has contributed 36 new species from the Acanthus family ( Acanthaceae ) alone to this year 's list , later found specimens in the Herbarium .
It was first collected nearly 100 years ago but on another specimen from the 1950s there is a note stating " Name urgently desired . "
Fifty years on , the job is now done , the delay reflecting the overwhelming task of charting the world 's plants .
Isoglossa variegata is one of more than 100 new species from East Africa and southern tropical Africa and is part of a major commitment by the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , initiated some 50 years ago , to document the flora from this area in two major projects , the Flora of Tropical East Africa and Flora Zambesiaca .
These great works , which document around 12,500 and 10,000 species respectively , are now nearing completion .
Brazilian passion
Passiflora cristalina ( www.kew.org/plants-fungi/passiflora-cristalina.htm) is among the 20 new Brazilian species discovered by the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew this year .
It is a striking red passionflower with edible egg - shaped fruits and is thought to be pollinated by hummingbirds .
Dr Daniela Zappi discovered it during an expedition to the Amazon rainforest in Mato Grosso , Brazil .
The plants in this part of the Amazon are poorly known and threatened by deforestation from cattle farming .
" We are almost certainly losing species from this region before they are known to science , and our work is a race against time . " says Dr Zappi .
" The survey work we have carried out so far is a major step forward in scientific knowledge and is being used by local government agencies to develop a much - needed plan to protect this area . "
Also on the list is a new legume genus , Tabaroa catingicola , discovered by Brian Stannard from the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew and his Brazilian colleagues , on the lower slopes of the Rio de Contas mountain range in southwestern Bahia .
The legume family is of great research significance because so many species are used throughout the world as sources of food and medicine .
Great potential exists to utilise more species , which is why continued taxonomic research into this family is essential .
Knee - high eucalyptus discovered in SW Australia
To many British gardeners the eucalyptus is a fast growing monster ; casting shade and debris… usually in the neighbour 's garden .
In Australia , however , the over 900 species of eucalypts are integral to the landscape and culture and come in all shapes and sizes .
It seems fitting , therefore , that the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew's Director , Professor Stephen Hopper , an Australian himself , has recently described two fantastic new species in southwest Australia .
" You might expect that the plants of Australia are already well - known , " says Professor Hopper , " but these kinds of finds are far from unusual , especially in the southwest . "
Professor Hopper discovered Eucalyptus sweedmaniana ( www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Eucalyptus-sweedmaniana.htm) with his colleague Luke Sweedman , after whom he named the plant .
It is a dwarf in comparison to most eucalyptus species , forming a low - growing mallee ( shrub ) around 1 m high .
It survives the bush fires that are common in the area by dying back to a woody underground rootstock , known as a lignotuber , from which it can resprout later .
The second new species ( Eucalyptus brandiana www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Eucalyptus-brandiana.htm), although larger than sweedmaniana , is n't so lucky ; it lacks a lignotuber and is killed by fire .
Both species are known from just a few hundred plants each and are in need of conservation .
However , both have potential as ornamentals in Australia ( and perhaps elsewhere ) , which could provide a welcome backup plan to secure their futures .
The full list of over 290 new discoveries can be found on www.kew.org/new-discoveries, together with profiles of selected species , an interactive map and a link to a specially created Google Earth layer .

SPRINGFIELD – A Springfield man settled a federal civil rights lawsuit with the city and Police Department after he was shot in the hand during a traffic stop in 2008 .
Louis Jiles , 20 , who is black , agreed to drop a police brutality complaint he filed against two white officers and the city after officials agreed to pay an undisclosed amount of money .
Jiles ' attorney , Perman Glenn III , would only say the settlement was " under six figures " and was agreed upon after a three - hour negotiation before a federal magistrate judge on Friday .
A lawyer for the city , John T. Liebel , confirmed an agreement had been reached but would not cite the dollar amount pending a signed settlement decree .
" It 's significantly south of $ 99,999 , " Liebel said .
The settlement comes amid intense police scrutiny after another black suspect was beaten by a patrolman wielding a flashlight during a traffic stop in November .
A police report states Officer Jeffrey M. Asher hit a drug suspect , Melvin Jones III , several times after Jones grabbed another officer 's gun during a struggle .
The incident was caught on videotape by a bystander and sparked a public furor when the tape was released to the media .
While Jones ' extensive criminal record has muddied the public debate over the incident , Glenn said Jiles had no such history .
" Nothing .
He was charged with disrupting a public assembly as a kid , " Glenn said .
Jiles was pulled over on Kensington Avenue after running a red light on July 5 , 2008 .
Officer Steven
Hill fired three times after he mistook a beer bottle in Jiles ' car for a gun , officials said previously .
A police report said Jiles ignored a command by two patrolmen to put his hands up and reached into the back seat .
However , Glenn said a forensic expert found that all the blood spatter was on the dashboard , suggesting Jiles ' hands never left the steering wheel .
" This case really rose and fell on forensic evidence , " Glenn said .
The settlement followed probes by the district attorney 's office , police supervisors and an independent arbitrator – all of whom cleared Hill and partner David Barton of wrongdoing .
" It was an unfortunate incident .
But not all unfortunate incidents amount to a civil rights violation , " Liebel said , noting that the settlement did not include any admission of wrongdoing or liability by the city or the police department .
Barton and Hill were briefly placed on desk duty during the flurry of investigations that followed the shooting , but were put back on streets last year .
Glenn said Jiles has fully recovered from the gunshot wound and has regained full use of his hand .
Jiles declined to be interviewed , and simply said : " I won , " when a reporter asked for a comment .
He pleaded guilty to running a red light .
Other criminal charges linked to the stop were dropped .
Perl 5.11.5 comes out tomorrow and Perl 5.12 should be out soon .
( Much credit goes to people such as Jesse Vincent and David Golden , to name two , for getting Perl 5 on a regular release cycle . )
I 've long promised to write about the Perl 5 support and deprecation policy and how that affects users .
Perl 5.10.1 was , by definition , a minor revision .
Perl 5.12 is a major revision .
The nominal difference is which component of the version number increases .
By intent , users of 5.10 ( actually 5.10.0 , but often abbreviated ) should be able to upgrade that installation in place to any subsequent minor release in the 5.10 family .
The upgrade is n't always completely transparent , but the intent is that , modulo bugfixes , it should be .
When 5.10.0 came out , work started on a new Perl 5 release family called 5.11 ( that 's not entirely true , but it 's sufficiently true for this explanation ) .
This is the unstable series intended for development and testing which will become 5.12 in the next couple of months .
You are welcome to download , configure , build , test , and even install 5.11 , but you should be comfortable without support from p5 p for upgrades and changes .
The monthly releases in the 5.11 ( and soon , the 5.13 ) series represent points of stability and review so that the Perl 5 developers can concentrate on the quality of what will become 5.12.0 .
When 5.12.0 comes out , you will notices changes from 5.10.0 in terms of new features , removed features , and upgrades to the standard library .
While most code should work unmodified with 5.12.0 as it did with 5.10.0 , some modules will need updates .
You likely also have to recompile any modules with XS components .
In subsequent entries , I 'll write more about the implications of all of this , when you should upgrade , how deprecations and changes work , and the binary compatibility policies of Perl 5 .
I fail to see how extending the royalty ' freeness ' through 2016 helps Mozilla , or any of the h.264 detractors .
It 's more likely a devious way to entrench the standard , then hold the world hostage six years from now .
The Mozilla VP is exactly right .
I see maybe two options :
1 . A white knight ( Google ) buys the license and open - source 's it .
Unfortunately , probably extremely unlikely .
2 . The open - source world bands together and improves the Ogg codec ( or invents something new ) to the point it can compete with h.264 in terms of quality and compression .
It may not seem like it , but even the laziest of couch potatoes is a human dynamo .
The act of breathing  of moving the ribs to draw air into the lungs and expel it  can generate about a watt of power .
And if the potato actually gets up off the couch and walks briskly across the room , each heel strike can produce even more power , about 70 watts ’ worth .
That energy could be put to work , charging a cellphone , say , or a medical sensor in the body .
The problem is how to harvest it .

Bill Moyers smacks the Democrats and Republicans for sucking up to corporate lobbyists at their retreats and Mitch McConnell for the hypocrisy of his statement on the Citizens United v. FEC Supreme Court ruling .
BILL MOYERS : Everybody 's been talking about that Republican retreat last weekend , where President Obama engaged his opponents in a give and take .
But what you may not know is that it was organized by something called the Congressional Institute .
Nice highfalutin civic bunch , you might deduce from its name .
Turns out the Congressional Institute is funded by corporate contributions and run by top Republican lobbyists .
There are fourteen members on its board - - twelve are registered lobbyists .
And the contributors to the Congressional Institute read like a who 's who of corporate America .
Among its benefactors have been General Motors , Lockheed Martin , Time Warner , UPS .
The institute 's chairman lobbies for among others , Goldman Sachs , B.P. , Health Net and AHIP .
That 's the trade group for the health insurance industry that fought tooth and nail against the public option and brought the White House to its knees .
Now if any Democrats out there are gloating over this , I 'm not finished .
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee also had a cozy little retreat last weekend at a Ritz - Carlton resort in Miami Beach , which boasts " sumptuous marble baths , " a spa , and a two million dollar art collection .
The website Politico.com reports that in addition to prominent Democratic senators there were plenty of representatives from industries the Democrats regularly attack when they wear their populist hat : the American Bankers Association , the tobacco giant Altria , the oil company Marathon , several drug manufacturers , and the defense contractor Lockheed Martin , as well as Heather and Tony Podesta -- two of the biggest corporate spear carriers on K Street and two of the biggest Democrats in town .
Very , very intimate .
And very , very politically incestuous .
One final note : after the Supreme Court handed down its decision two weeks ago , Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the leader of Senate Republicans , praised it from the senate floor .
He dismissed the notion that the decision might allow a flood of foreign money to influence our elections .
Now we learn from TalkingPointsMemo.com that Senator McConnell has received substantial funds from a subsidiary of a big foreign defense contractor that 's currently being investigated by the Justice Department for bribery .
Senator McConnell has been quite good to that subsidiary -- this year alone he 's requested seventeen million dollars in earmarks for its Louisville facility .
Yes , the sun , and the dollar signs , shine bright in Senator McConnell 's old Kentucky home .
Let 's face it , two political parties ; equal opportunity hypocrites .

Conan O’Brien made a triumphant exit from NBC Friday night , accompanied by one of the most impressive outpourings of support by younger viewers that any late - night host had ever seen  and Mr. O’Brien was effusive in his thanks for their backing .
But he might have said :
Where were you when I needed you ?
In the tumult that surrounded NBC ’s late - night shake - up last week , one thing was certain :
If even a small fraction of the additional younger viewers who flocked to Mr. O’Brien ’s show last week had turned up regularly in his earlier ratings results , he would almost surely still be hosting “ The Tonight Show . ”
Instead , for most of this past fall , Mr. O’Brien struggled to command the young viewers he needed to counter a falloff in overall audience numbers .
While he began to drop behind his chief late - night competitor , David Letterman on CBS , among total viewers , it was more alarming to NBC that Mr. O’Brien was not consistently beating Mr. Letterman in several important advertising - sales demographic groups  viewers 18 to 49 and 25 to 54 .
( He did beat Mr. Letterman virtually all the time in the 18 - to - 34 group . )
A SOUTH Australian policeman has been arrested for drink - driving after allegedly blowing three times over the legal limit .
The man was detected after complaints from a member of the public about his driving at Smithfield northeast of Adelaide overnight , police say .
He allegedly blew .165 , more than three times the .05 legal blood alcohol limit in South Australia and has had his car impounded .
The 39 - year - old police officer from Aldgate , southeast of Adelaide , was arrested at a Craigmore address and has been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and exceeding the prescribed concentration of alcohol .
His vehicle was seized and impounded and his driver 's licence was immediately disqualified for 12 months .
He has been bailed to appear in the Elizabeth Magistrates Court on February 15 2010 .
A South Australian police spokesman said he did not know if the officer had been suspended from duty .
BRUSSELS , Belgium —
After weeks of pointing fingers at Athens for sparking a crisis in the eurozone , Brussels itself is being blamed for many years of passing the buck , so to speak .
Late Monday night came the most visible sign that the eurozone is taking a close look at its own processes .
“ I ’d like to apologize to the world at large that I was n’t able to prevent a bad decision , ” said Eurogroup President Jean - Claude Juncker , referring to the fact that finance ministers , under his leadership , had previously rejected giving the EU statistics agency some fact - checking powers .
“ I ’m sure we were wrong , I confess it , ” Juncker said , “ not to have looked closely enough at divergencies of competitiveness that we had noted in Greece and elsewhere … we had n’t drawn all the operational conclusions that we might have drawn from that fact . ”
The Eurogroup comprises the finance ministers of countries that have adopted the euro and has oversight of European Union matters affecting the eurozone .
Juncker ’s humility was striking in a city full of blustery bureaucrats , but he may also be trying to head off accusations of hypocrisy .
As Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou has become more frustrated with taking the heat for his country ’s immense economic mess and its implications for the rest of Europe , he has hit back , saying there has been “ quite a big effort in the European Union to hide their responsibilities behind Greece . ”
Juncker noted a 2005 effort by the EU ’s executive arm , the European Commission , to equip the EU ’s statistics agency Eurostat with the right to check up on figures submitted by member states .
The recommendation was rebuffed at that time because finance ministers did not want to give up autonomy to the Luxembourg - based EU agency .
That decision allowed Greece to get away with submitting falsified finance reports and now allows the EU some degree of deniability .
Despite his candid admissions , Juncker defended the EU by saying , “ If we have n’t spotted everything that we should have spotted in the case of Greece , that ’s not due to a lack of observation on the part of the commission or the eurogroup .
It ’s due to a Greek way of presenting figures which were n’t all ones we could validate . ”
Even so , there was plenty of warning that Brussels ’ suspicions should have remained on permanent high alert when it came to Greece :
The country ’s very entry into the eurozone was predicated on falsified figures .
In 2004 , Athens admitted that it had lied about its national deficit three years earlier in order to be allowed to join the euro area .
Greece 's finance ministry had claimed that its deficit was below the EU limit of 3 percent of GDP in 1999 , on the basis of which it was allowed to adopt the euro .
The country later acknowledged that , even if that were true then , the deficit had n’t been that low since .
Even so , the other eurozone countries , some of which had also breached the 3 percent limit at times , assured Greece it would not be kicked out .
So the EU should have kept its eyes on the ball , suggested Greek political economist Sotiria Theodoropoulou , who specializes in the EU at the European Policy Center in Brussels .
She said the crisis had actually been building for three decades .
“ Messy public finances and the Greeks living beyond their means is not something that started yesterday , ” Theodoropoulou said .
“ I do n’t want to let the Greeks off with any excuses .
They are completely responsible for the state of the budget deficit and the public debt .
But how could the European Commission and Eurostat let things get that bad ? ”
Theodoropoulou underscored that Greek culpability should not mean “ they should be left alone because they operate in the broader market which is interdependent . ”
Spain and Portugal , while also heavily indebted , are escaping most of the heat for the moment , she noted , because they showed more spending restraint .
Spain in particular should not be thrown in the same category as Greece , Theodoropoulou said , having saved a lot of money during better economic times .
The Greeks have always been spendthrifts :
Even though the country had one of the highest growth rates in Europe for almost a decade , it did n’t manage to reduce its debt .
“ That ’s their biggest sin , ” she said .
“ If you do n’t consolidate your public finances when your output grows , then obviously now that the economic situation is so dire it ’s more difficult .
They do n’t have the alibi of ‘ at least they tried . ’ ”
Apart from Juncker , the EU does n’t seem inclined to apologize for the past , but it is looking forward intently , trying to rectify the dearth of coordination and oversight .
New Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn says he will soon present a plan to create better communication and transparency amongst member governments , a concept that might have been shot down as a violation of national privacy before the current crisis .
The 2005 proposal on boosting Eurostat ’s audit powers will now be resubmitted to member states , unchanged from its earlier form , and the commission expects it to pass .
Asked where that confidence comes from , commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj Tardio laughed wryly : “ Read the newspapers ! ”
Editor 's note :
This story was updated to clarify an attribution .
The University of Notre Dame is being rocked by a controversy over an anti-gay cartoon printed in the student - run newspaper , The Observer .
The cartoon depicts a conversation between two figures that reads :
“ What ’s the easiest way to turn a fruit into a vegetable ? "
“ No idea . ”
“ A baseball bat . ”
Earlier , the cartoonist , who has not yet been named , posted the original version of the cartoon on his blog .
In this version , it shows the punch line as “ AIDS ” instead of “ a baseball bat . ”
The paper , he claimed , preferred “ not to make light of fatal diseases . ”
In a statement to the press today , The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ( GLAAD ) claimed “ The Observer made a dangerously misguided decision that promoting violence was somehow superior to making fun of HIV / AIDS .
Both versions of the cartoon were abhorrent . ”
GLAAD contacted The Observer ’s editor , Jenn Metz , who relayed a tearful apology by phone .
She explained that she was not present when the decision to run the cartoon was made , and that she was incredibly upset that others on staff had made that decision .
An apology printed in the paper this morning included the following :
The editors of The Observer would like to publicly apologize for the publication of “ The Mobile Party ” in the Jan. 13 edition .
The burden of responsibility ultimately lies on us for allowing it to go to print .
There is no excuse that can be given and nothing that can be said to reverse the damage that has already been done by this egregious error in judgment .
Allowing this cruel and hateful comic a place on our pages disgraced those values and severely hurt members of our Notre Dame family — our classmates , our friends .
For this , we sincerely apologize .
Unfortunately , the language of hate is an everyday reality in our society . ”
( CNN ) --
A portrait is beginning to emerge of Joseph Andrew Stack , the man officials believe set his house on fire and then intentionally crashed his small aircraft into an office building in Austin , Texas .
Stack , 53 , owns a Piper Cherokee PA - 28 , according to aviation records , and federal officials believe that is the plane that crashed into the building Thursday .
Authorities said the remains of two people were found in the building after the crash .
They were not immediately identified .
Share images , information about the crash
A message on a software company Web site registered to Stack appears to be a suicide note .
" If you 're reading this , you 're no doubt asking yourself , ' Why did this have to happen ? ' " the message said .
" The simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time . "
At the FBI 's request , the letter was later removed from the site .
As recently as February 7 , the Web site was for Embedded Art , which appears to be a software company founded by Stack .
" Embedded Art is a small independent software house , specializing in process control and automation , " a cached version of the Web site said .
" In its current form it represents the culmination of 20 years of experience in the software development consulting business .
Founded by Joe Stack in 1983 ( under the name of Prowess Engineering ) in Southern California , the company thrived for 15 years until shifting focus to the Sacramento area to take advantage of growth in the Silicon Valley . "
The Web site changed over on February 16 , indicating Stack had possibly been planning to post the note for at least two days .
The document had been revised 27 times since the 16th , according to the site 's page information , and was finalized at 1:42 a.m. ET -- about eight hours before he is believed to have taken his plane from the airport .
In the long message , the writer rails against the government and , particularly , the Internal Revenue Service .
Read the apparent suicide note ( PDF )
The building into which the airplane crashed is a federal IRS center with 199 employees .
" I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different , " the online message said .
" I am finally ready to stop this insanity .
Well , Mr. Big Brother IRS man , let 's try something different ; take my pound of flesh and sleep well . "
In the letter , the writer , who signs as Joe Stack , said he feels some frustration in writing , " given my gross inability to gracefully articulate my thoughts in light of the storm raging in my head . "
Details in the letter coincide with details of Stack 's life , such as his move from California to Texas in 2004 .
Once in Austin , he bought a $ 230,000 home in a leafy subdivision , the same home that he allegedly set on fire before piloting the plane into the building .
Photos from the scene of the fire showed a fire truck parked in front of a large brick house , flames and plumes of thick smoke rising into the sky .
CNN affiliate KXAN reported Stack 's wife , Sheryl , and 12 - year - old stepdaughter had moved into a hotel on Wednesday evening after , friends said , Stack went " ballistic " about his IRS problems .
Stack 's wife is listed as a teaching assistant at the University of Texas - Austin .
The examples of Stack 's apparent frustration in the note coincide with financial troubles his companies had .
The California Franchise Tax Board said Stack 's Software Systems Service Corporation license was suspended June 1 , 2004 , for not paying taxes in 1996 and 2002 , CNN affiliate KCRA reported .
And another of Stack 's companies in California -- known as Prowess Engineering , which became Embedded Art -- had its license suspended November 1 , 2000 , for a failure to file a 1994 tax return , KCRA reported .
Thursday 's incident left those who knew Stack scratching their heads .
" I can't believe it 's the same person , " said Ric Furley , an Austin musician who played in a band with Stack for a period more than two years ago .
Stack played bass , the accordion and sang for the band , according to the band 's Web site .
Stack was very musical , and conversations with his bandmates typically revolved around music , not grievances he may have had .
" He was very easygoing , " Furley said , adding that he guessed it was insanity that led Stack to his alleged suicide mission .
" What else could it be ? "
In the online message , the writer noted how during past times of crisis , like during the Great Depression , some of the wealthy who lost everything were known to have killed themselves .
" Now , when the wealthy f--- up , the poor get to die for the mistakes ... is n't that a clever , tidy solution , " the letter said .
The letter also hinted at darker thoughts .
" Nothing changes unless there is a body count , " it said .
" I choose to not keep looking over my shoulder at ' Big Brother ' while he strips my carcass , I choose not to ignore what is going on all around me , I choose not to pretend that business as usual wo n't continue ; I have just had enough . "
He plainly stated his conclusion : " Sadly , though I spent my entire life trying to believe it was n't so , but violence not only is the answer , it is the only answer . "

Stefan GP is still pushing with its intention to race in Formula 1 this year despite not having an entry .
The Serbian car , however , has been fired up and it's ready to start testing , with team boss Zoran Stefanovic confirming talks with Jacques Villeneuve are progressing well .
AUTOSPORT talked to Stefanovic right after his car came to life for the first time .
Zoran Stefanovic :
This morning , 19 February 2010 , was another stepping stone for Stefan Grand Prix .
This morning at 8:00 , the first car - Stefan 01 - was fired up for the first time .
The car ran faultlessly , there was no problem whatsoever , and we could race or test on a racetrack , but we 're just waiting for tyres .
Q . The fire - up was in Cologne ?
ZS : Yes , in Cologne , in the race bays .
The car is completely assembled and the second one is already underway and will be ready also in several days .
Q . The car is in Serbian red colours ?
ZS : Yes .
Q. Just red or other colours ?
ZS : No , only red .
Q. Will it have any sponsorship logos ?
ZS : It will , but at the moment it 's not yet on the car .
We will prepare it for the presentation completely .
Q. Was Pascal Vasselon there ?
ZS : I do n't know because at the moment I am in Serbia , doing other things which are important , but I really regret it because it is a big day and I was n't there .
Q. How big is your own team ?
ZS : At the moment nearly 60 .
Q. And then additional Toyota people ?
ZS : Yes .
The total number of people we 're expecting to employ this year will be up to roughly 180 .
Q. Does that include Toyota people ?
ZS : No , it 's seperate .
Q. All based in Serbia ?
ZS : At the moment in Cologne .
Q. Your adverts say some in Cologne , some in Serbia , are you planning to move the whole operation to Serbia ?
ZS : We 're talking about the technical side .
At the moment the technical side is in Cologne but in the year we will start to see what we are going to do in Serbia , because in Serbia is just the legal part .
Q. How many people do you have in Serbia at the moment ?
ZS : At the moment a small number of people because it 's separate , but it will be a different structure .
There will be three different companies .
Q. SGP Engineering will be based in Cologne ?
ZS : It will be based in Serbia , but it will have an off - shoot in Cologne .
There will be part of it in Cologne .
Q . Where do you stand on tyres ?
ZS : What we have at the moment is an answer from Bridgestone that they are only supplying to teams which are participating in Formula 1 , but we are positive that they may supply GP2 tyres .
Q. If you can't get tyres from Bridgestone , what are your options ?
ZS : We will see .
We are working on it at the moment and we can't comment more .
We think that safety will prevail .
Q . Have you heard any more from the FIA about your entry ?
ZS : Not yet .
We are expecting it to be clarified relatively shortly because all of us know what the situation is .
In the meantime we are working very heavily on sorting out the drivers ' contracts .
Q . When will we have news on the drivers ?
ZS : At the moment we have to say that we are very near .
We are very near to a contract with Jacques Villeneuve , and probably also with another driver as our reserve driver .
But the first one which will be with us is Kazuki Nakajima .
It is almost inevitable , that in a time of prolonged crisis , that a nation should look beyond its own borders in search of someone to blame .
For America in the 21st century , any attempt at placing blame on China or Mexico or even the Middle East is misplaced for a simple reason : America has more influence on the world than the world has on us .
Say that out loud a few times and let it sink in .
Our ability to project power is unprecedented , and the effect of this has been a radical shift in cultures around the world .
American industry and money has become the paradigm by which the world does business , and what we see beyond our borders are echoes and reverberations of our own history and social essence .
The Tijuana Speakeasy
In Mexico , we re-live our tortured past of prohibition .
Rather than liquor , the plants we have helped them ban have created thriving black markets and criminal cartels .
Hardly any different from our own all - American organized crime families of the 1920s , Mexican gangs are instead an unintended product of our own foreign policy goals .
Depicted as a violent influence on America , it is our money that funds the production of drugs and it is our weapons that they 're purchasing back with the profits .
For many tourists , Mexico is also America 's narcotic speakeasy .
The gateway city of Tijuana is a well - known destination of all sorts of yankee - doodle - hedonists .
Far from the armored SWAT teams of U.S. drug enforcement , many a young adventurer trusts that a few green dollars is enough to get them out of trouble with Mexico 's often - corrupt police .
To the extent then that Mexican drugs and gangs are a problem in America , they are a problem because of America ...
Immigrants are Capitalism
The other common complaint about Mexico is that the immigrants are an economic drain on our domestic economy .
The myth is that they come here for the sole purpose of soaking up welfare payments and enjoying our lavish social benefits .
Wait a minute ...
What lavish social benefits ?
Mexico is much closer to achieving universal healthcare coverage , and America is n't exactly known for generous welfare benefits or any sort of long - term public support .
Instead , immigrants are the type of people who are willing to take big risks and invest hard work in the hope of eventually profiting from their productive behavior .
If that sounds familiar , its called the American dream - something we used to celebrate back when we were the immigrants .
China 's Gilded Age
Across the Pacific , China is experiencing an era of sustained economic booms that is unprecedented .
Well , its almost unprecedented because America did it first .
In the time American historians categorize as the Gilded Age , we managed to go from a fairly backward rural society to the world 's # 1 manufacturer of industrial goods .
The era was marked with miserable working conditions , extreme gaps between wealth and poverty , corrupt individuals fighting for favorable government concessions , and a strong pressure for the marginalized members of society to conform and contribute .
If they 're taking our jobs , its because we long ago abandoned those 12 hour work - days and child labor profits .
It does n't make much sense for us to be jealous of them , unless Americans are just that intent on turning back the clock and living in a " simpler " time .
By simpler , I mean you would n't be able to afford the computer you 're reading this from if you really had to compete with Chinese laborers for a blue - collar job .
That is n't China 's fault , its just a fact that 19th century jobs do n't provide enough money to buy and maintain 21st century technology .
King George - Bush of Arabia
Some historians and military strategists might let you in on a big secret of America 's foreign policy :
In the years following World War 2 and the collapse of the British Empire , we effectively assumed unofficial control of England 's remaining colonies .
For a little more back history :
As a result of World War 1 , the Ottoman Empire was defeated and carved up into European colonies .
During World War 2 , England and Germany battled over control of the region .
After the war , and absolute American victory , we moved to quickly implement a policy of " twin pillars . "
By creating an unbreakable alliance with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Iran , we would cement our control over the region , securing access to cheap oil and controlling the public opinion in a way that kept out Soviet influence .
There 's no doubt that we intervened to set up a friendly regime in Iran , and there 's little argument that our action triggered a wave of blowback that has lasted for generations and likely to persist well into the future .
It should n't sound too surprising that the colonies would eventually resist King George and demand full independence .
Its easy to blame someone ;
Its hard to really fix a personal problem
We 're tempted to look outward and find a scapegoat , but the best we can do is see our own reflection in what we dislike about the world .
The last 100 years have been one of unquestionable American ascendancy , and the force we project is many times stronger than the influence we receive .
Sure , we eat tacos and fried rice now , but even those are extremely Americanized products that might not be recognizable in the nations they supposedly originated from .
At the same time , they know exactly what a McDonald 's cheeseburger is supposed to be .
Its convenient to blame Mexican and Chinese labor , but we 're the ones with the advantage of designing global financial systems , printing the reserve currency , and deploying the world 's most powerful army to secure our national interests .
So the next time you 're tempted to blame some other country for America 's economic or political problems , just remember how little influence they 've truly had on our path and decisions .
This may lead to some difficult choices in regard to our domestic policies , but we 're going to have to address these tougher conflicts before we can truly progress to the next level of our national - and individual - potential .
Philadelphia TSA screeners forced the developmentally delayed , four - year - old son of a Camden , PA police officer to remove his leg - braces and wobble through a checkpoint , despite the fact that their procedure calls for such a case to be handled through a swabbing in a private room .
When the police officer complained , the supervising TSA screener turned around and walked away .
Then a Philadelphia police officer asked what was wrong and " suggested he calm down and enjoy his vacation . "
Ryan was taking his first flight , to Walt Disney World , for his fourth birthday .
The boy is developmentally delayed , one of the effects of being born 16 weeks prematurely .
His ankles are malformed and his legs have low muscle tone .
In March he was just starting to walk …
The screener told them to take off the boy 's braces .
The Thomases were dumbfounded .
" I told them he can't walk without them on his own , " Bob Thomas said .
" He said , ' He 'll need to take them off . ' "
Ryan 's mother offered to walk him through the detector after they removed the braces , which are custom - made of metal and hardened plastic .
No , the screener replied .
The boy had to walk on his own .

Advertisement Researchers at San Diego Zoo have been studying what has been described as the " secret language " of elephants .
They have been monitoring communications between animals that cannot be heard by human ears .
The elephant 's trumpeting call will be familiar to most people , but the animals also emit growls .
Their growls , however , are only partly audible ; two - thirds of the call is at frequencies that are too low to be picked up by our hearing .
To learn more about the inaudible part of the growl , the team attached a microphone sensitive to these low frequencies and a GPS tracking system to eight of the zoo 's female elephants .
The researchers could then correlate the noises the animals were making with what they were doing .
Matt Anderson , who led the project , told BBC News : " We 're excited to learn of the hierarchy within the female herd and how they interact and intercede with one another . "
Predator warning ?
The team has already learned that pregnant females use this low frequency communication to announce to the rest of their herd that they are about to give birth .
Only a third of an elephant 's growl is audible to humans " We 've seen that after their long gestation of over two years , in the last 12 days we see a manipulation of the low part of the growl , the low part that we can't hear .
" This we believe is to announce to the rest of the herd that the baby is imminent , " said Dr Anderson .
The researchers believe that this also warns the elephants to look out for predators .
" You may think that a baby calf of about 300 pounds would not be as open to predation as other species , " he says .
" But packs of hyenas are a big threat in the wild . "
Dr Anderson and his team are continuing to analyse data in order to learn more about this secret elephant language .

We 'll have more on the Dallas Stars ownership situation tomorrow .
When the Dallas Stars traded for Kari Lehtonen last week , there 's a good chance that Stars fans were familiar with the name and his story , but perhaps not too familiar with his actual game .
Lehtonen has played in the Eastern Conference his entire , short career and Stars fans have not had much exposure to the young man who is supposedly our goaltender of the future .
So Defending Big D set out to break down the play of this promising netminder , whom most claim to have world class talent and the potential to reach elite status in the NHL .
Before I get into our film review , a quick profile on Kari Lehtonen .
Born in Helsinki , Finland in 1983 he started his professional career playing for Jokerit of the SM - Iiiga , the top pro league in Finland .
It 's a tough league and has become known for producing top talent worldwide .
In his first two full seasons with Jokerit , 2001 - 2003 , he posted a 1.88 goals - against average with nine shutouts in 68 games .
Following his first full pro season , he was drafted 2nd overall by the Atlanta Thrashers and made the transition to North America for the 2003 - 04 season .
His first foray into North American hockey with the Chicago Wolves in AHL was a resounding success .
He went 20 - 14 - 2 with a 2.41 GAA and an impressive .926 save percentage .
He also won all four NHL games he appeared in , allowing just five goals with one shutout .
He would spend the entire 2004 - 05 season during the NHL lockout with Chicago , winning 38 games and posting a 2.27 GAA with a .929 save percentage .
His high level of success in the AHL led the Thrashers to permanently call him up for the 2005 season , yet he seriously injured his groin in the first game of the season and would appear in just 38 games that year .
He would lead them to the playoffs for the first time in franchise history in 2007 with a 34 - 24 - 9 record , and a .912 save percentage .
He would famously fall apart in the first round against the New York Rangers , allowing 11 goals in two games before being benched .
He 's played in just 94 games since the start of the 2007 season .
Many are concerned about his injury history , and it appears that his injuries troubles started with several violent collisions in 2005 and he 's struggled ankle and groin injuries ever since .
He also was in a very violent collision at the end of the 2009 season , against the New York Rangers and has played in just one NHL game since .
This past summer , Lehtonen underwent a laminotomy , a procedure that removes a part of the bony covering of a nerve root along the spine .
This is performed in order to relieve severe back pain resulting from a intervertebral disc rupture .
Judging from the responses of people who have had this surgery , it 's a significant recovery period but the pain that wracked the back , arms , legs and neck from the injury is completely gone .
According to Lehtonen , and the Dallas Stars doctors , he has completely recovered and is now pain free for the first time in a long time ; now it 's just a matter of getting back out on the ice and playing hockey .
Now , on to the film review .
I must warn you , however .
This is a long one .
While going back and watching a number of Kari Lehtonen games , it 's easy to see why he is generally considered to have so much potential .
And it 's not just potential ; he has played at a very high level in the NHL over a five - year period and he is just 26 years old .
He 's just now reaching what many consider the prime of a goaltender 's career , and the Stars could have nabbed a top - 5 goaltender to be with the team for next five to seven years .
The first thing that jumps out is that Lehtonen is a technician in net .
Like most goaltenders that come from Finland , he is very calculating and direct with his mechanics and plays a nearly flawless positional game .
He 's also a very , very large goaltender ; he 's listed at 6 - 4 , 215 pounds but looks much bigger than that in net .
He 'll also play far , far out on top of his crease and really challenge shooters .
He has impressive flexibility for a player of his size and he 'll cover a lot of the net down low , a lot , when he 's spread out across the crease .
He 's also one of the best goaltenders I 've seen in the way he is able to stay square to shooters as he moves for position .
He knows that his size and positioning are his biggest advantage and he works hard to maintain that advantage on shooters .
And there is zero doubt that he is a butterfly goaltender ; perhaps the most traditional butterfly in the NHL right now .
He goes down often , and he stays in that wide stance , low to the ice as much as possible .
His size allows him to get away with it , and I rarely saw him beat high when he was challenging .
Where it gets concerning is his mobility across the crease , and his propensity to overreact to plays that cross in front of him .
His best trait is his aggressiveness as he challenges shooters , and he get 's in trouble when he starts backing down into his crease .
He also appears to be a goaltender who is driven by his confidence .
When he's on top of his game he is nearly unstoppable , but when he gets rocked once he starts to fold .
That 's why you 'll see him , throughout his career , allow 1 and 2 goals for a week and then allow 6 and 7 two games in a row .
Now , onto the actual film review .
I chose three games from March of 2009 to look at , as these were his latest games in the NHL .
He had really started to put together a big couple of months at the end of the season and was looking strong .
But the final four games were very disappointing .
This is very lengthy , as I wanted to cover many aspects of Lehtonen 's game .
As always , click on the thumbnails for a larger picture .
Above :
Here is a good look at his positioning in the butterfly on a shot from the circle to his right .
He does n't give much room , and he easily directs the puck away from the pressure in front .
Some say his rebound control is suspect ; I 'd give it a ' B ' overall .
Above : Ok Stars fans , get ready for a big change .
Kari Lehtonen is about 22 % of the puck handler that Marty Turco is .
He does not handle the puck very often , and when he does there 's a 50 - 50 chance he 'll turn it over .
Here , he takes the puck behind the net and blindly shoots it back up the boards .
Above & below :
He gives the puck cleanly to an Avalanche player along the boards , resulting in a turnover and a prime scoring chance .
The puck is shot back behind the boards , where it 's thrown immediately out front .
Below , you can see his butterfly positioning as the puck is shot from very close , as he keeps his upper body high and square and his pads flared out along the goal line .
It was a relatively easy stop .
Above :
You can see here , once again , his butterfly technique as he challenges a shot from the high slot , coming out high in crease to take away shooting angles .
Above :
In this sequence , you can see Lehtonen 's ability to stay square as he moves across his crease .
He starts off moving to his right , but the puck comes into the middle .
Above :
The puck is bouncing around in front , and Lehtonen stays square , pads low to the ice as moves with the puck .
Above :
He 's low to the ice , spread wide and taking away any possible shooting angles as the puck comes near .
Notice how high in the crease he is , despite the traffic in front .
Above :
This was perhaps his best game in the 2009 season , as he stopped 50 shots against Washington .
Here , once again , you can see his positioning high in the crease as he stops an Alex Ovechkin shot .
Above :
His strength , and positioning down low , as he stops Ovechkin in tight ....
Above : Not once ... but three times .
He stretches , shows great flexibility as he keep Ovechkin out of the net .
Above :
Here , once again , you can see the traditional butterfly on display .
Above :
High in his crease , square to the shooter as the puck moves across the high slot .
Another easy save off a big shot from the point .
Above : Here 's a great sequence .
The Atlanta defense allows a forward to get behind them and down low .
The shooter wants to take advantage of Lehtonen 's supposed lack of mobility ( or any goaltender 's really ) and takes the puck across the crease .
Above :
You can see Lehtonen , once again , maintaining himself square to the shooter as he moves across .
Above : Lehtonen then starts the traditional pad stack as the shooter starts running out of room and gears up for a quick shot .
Above :
It 's amazing how quickly such a large goaltender was able to move across and stack his pads .
Here , the puck bouncing away ...
Above : Another angle of the same play .
You can see Lehtonen remaining as square as possible as long as he can .
As the shooter cocks to fire the puck , Lehtonen challenges him and starts to stack his pads .
Above :
It 's a gamble , but he quickly took away as much shooting angle as he possible could on a tough play .
Above : Now for some bad .
This shows what happens when Lehtonen does n't maintain his positioning and backs down .
Here , Alex Tanguay is all alone in the crease as the pass comes in from the left of Lehtonen .
Above : Lehtonen whiffs on a poke check , is back in his crease and the puck is tipped over his glove .
Lehtonen does not seem to have a fast glove hand , by the way .
Above : Another angle of the same play .
You can see the bad positioning here .
Above :
Here 's a great play , closely followed by a bad one .
Lehtonen 's perfect butterfly takes away any angle for a shot very low , as the shooter is once again all alone in the crease .
Above : Pefect butterfly .
The shot goes off his pads and off to his left .
The issue here is that Lehtonen over compensates to his left and the puck ends up coming back across the crease .
Above : Different angle .
He 's started moving to his left , but the puck is now moving back to his right .
Tough for any goaltender to change position like that , but here he struggles to quickly react from his initial push .
This is something I saw a number of times watching him play and something we 'll see a bit later .
Above :
The end result .
He flails to his right as the puck is shot into an open net .
Above :
Now here is a very interesting and impressive sequence .
The puck starts off behind the net and is passed out front to the top of the slot .
Notice how wide and tall Lehtonen is along the crease .
Above .
The puck goes out top , and Lehtonen starts to react .
Now if this had been a one - timer , there might have been an issue but he 's given an extra split second .
The shooter receives the puck and winds up for a snap - shot .
Above : Immediately , Lehtonen is square and far out on top of his crease , challenging the shot .
A couple of defenders block the puck , which goes off to Lehtonen 's right .
Above :
You can see Lehtonen start to react to the puck moving right , as it's picked up and shot quickly .
Above : Lehtonen makes the save , but look at how far out from his crease he is .
He can't handle the rebound , and the puck ricochet 's to his left .
Above :
The puck is far to his left , as Lehtonen is extremely out of position .
Above & below :
He is back in ' position ' before the shot is made and makes the save .
Ha !
How crazy would that sequence be for Stars fans ?
Above :
Time for some bad again , once again a result of poor positioning .
Lehtonen does not have the reflexes to make up for poor positioning and here we see what happens if he 's caught low in his crease .
It 's also important to note that he had already allowed 4 goals in this game and definitely did not look as confident as I 'd seen him just a week before against Washington .
Here , the puck is along the boards and is going to be passed right in front for a one timer .
It 's tough to see his positioning here , but Lehtonen is not challenging like he normally does .
Above :
The shot is being made , and instead of skating out to challenge the shot Lehtonen stays still and waits for it .
It 's reactive , and it 's dangerous when facing NHL shooters .
Above :
He goes wide as the shot comes in , and does not have the reflexes to adjust to the low shot .
Above :
The puck is scored five - hole , and you can see how low in his crease Lehtonen is .
There is n't an opposing player within 15 feet of the crease , so there was no reason for him to be that low .
This was a trend with Lehtonen , when he had allowed a number of goals already .
When it rains , it pours .
Above :
In this final sequence , we can see the issues that Lehtonen has with overcompensating with his movements across the crease .
This goal is the 6th he allowed in the game .
Here , the shot comes in from the right point .
Notice Lehtonen is back out on top of his crease .
Above :
The shot was meant to be a pass to the left side of the crease ( a shass ) , but it is blocked .
The problem is that Lehtonen had already started moving to his left .
Above : Different angle .
The puck is to Lehtonen 's right , and here he is working hard to recover and get back to his right .
The puck never came close to reaching the middle of the slot on the original pass .
Above :
He overcompensates to his right , going down low in anticipation of a shot .
Yet the puck is passed back across the crease , as he is moving and going down to his butterfly .
Above :
At this point , he had enough time to push off and square up to the shooter , yet opts instead to slide back to his left and try and stack his pads .
Above :
The shot is actually flubbed , and flutters over a sprawled Lehtonen and into the net .
His strengths are when he's on his skates or on his knees , squared up and using his size and mechanics .
A Dominik Hasek , he is not .
So what have we learned ?
I finished on a sour note with that final sequence , but I was highly encouraged by what I saw overall .
One thing is for certain , this is a completely different goaltender and netminding approach than what we 've been used to with Marty Turco .
I rarely saw a ' snow angel ' in the crease , and Lehtonen showed an incredible ability to stay square , high in his crease and challenge the shooters .
I rarely saw him get beat up high , and most goals scored were because of poor positioning .
It 's also important to note that Lehtonen played behind an atrocious Atlanta defense .
He routinely faced 30 - 40 shots , yet maintains a solid .912 save percentage in the NHL .
Not to say that the Dallas defense is much better , but this is not a goaltender whose numbers have been inflated by the defensive prowess in front of him .

A man was arrested and questioned by police for seven hours after joking about blowing up an airport on Twitter .
After snow had caused the closure of Doncaster 's Robin Hood airport , Paul Chambers was concerned that his flight to Ireland would be cancelled and posted a message on the social networking site .
The 26 - year - old wrote : " Robin Hood airport is closed .
You 've got a week and a bit to get your s**t together , otherwise I 'm blowing the airport sky high ! ! "
Chambers told The Independent : " I would never have thought in a thousand years that any of this would have happened because of a Twitter post .
I 'm the most mild - mannered guy you could imagine .
" They said I was being arrested under the Terrorism Act and produced a piece of paper .
It was a print - out of my Twitter page .
That was when it dawned on me . "
He added : " I had to explain Twitter to them in its entirety because they 'd never heard of it .
Then they asked all about my home life , and how work was going , and other personal things .
" The lead investigator kept asking , ' Do you understand why this is happening ? ' and saying , ' It is the world we live in ' . "
A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police confirmed : " A male was arrested on 13 January for comments made on a social networking site .
He has been bailed pending further investigations . "
Chambers has been released on bail until February 11 .
The police confiscated his iPhone , laptop and home computer .

Prosecutors in China are proceeding with a court case against four detained Rio Tinto executives , including Australian Stern Hu .
It has been more than six months since four of Rio Tinto 's iron ore trading team were taken into custody in Shanghai , facing accusations of industrial espionage .
Until last night there was still some hope in the Rio camp that Hu and his three Chinese colleagues might not have to face a Chinese court and the likelihood of a prison term .
But Chinese prosecutors have decided there is enough evidence to proceed with the case and the Shanghai No. 1 Intermediate People 's Court will soon be the scene of a trial which is likely to test Australia - China relations .
But when Liu Caikui , Ge Mingqiang , Wang Yong and Hu go to trial , their hearing will be in all likelihood behind closed doors .
Representatives from Rio Tinto , the Australian Government and even the executives ' families are by no means guaranteed access to the trial .
No trial date has been announced but this weekend the traditional Chinese New Year holidays begin , which means the hearing probably will not happen for at least a couple of weeks , at the earliest .
According to court documents , prosecutors will accuse Rio Tinto 's iron ore negotiating team of " taking advantage of their position to seek profit for others and asking for , or illegally accepting , huge amounts of money from Chinese steel companies " .
The strange thing is that if the men are accused of bribing steel company executives to entice them to hand over sensitive information relating to their company 's bottom line in iron ore price negotiations , why would the Rio staff be receiving huge amounts of money instead of just handing it out ?
Hopefully when the case moves to a trial some concrete information will be made public about the precise nature of what the men are supposed to have done .
Rio Tinto says its staff are innocent .
But according the wire service Xinhua 's translation of Chinese court documents , prosecutors say the Rio executives " lured the heads of Chinese enterprises with promises , or through other illegal means , to obtain the steel companies ' commercial secrets on multiple occasions , causing extremely serious consequences for the companies " .
Last week Rio Tinto appointed a 30 - year veteran to the position of managing director for China .
Ian Bauert is a fluent Mandarin speaker who set up Rio 's first office in China more than 25 years ago .
He may be walking into a minefield .
This year 's round of iron ore price negotiations are supposed to be going on at the moment .
Rio Tinto has to keep doing business in China with four of its staff facing lengthy jail terms if they lose in court - and Chinese prosecutors do tend to win these cases .
Financial Services Minister Chris Bowen says the Government is offering Hu the appropriate consular support .
" China is a sovereign nation and has its own legal system ; we 'll be working within that legal system with his representatives to ensure that he gets whatever assistance is necessary and appropriate from the Government , " he said this morning .
" I understand he does have legal assistance in the proceedings , he has legal representation , and I understand our embassy officials have been in contact with those legal officials .
" Of course we would hope this matter gets resolved as quickly as possible , as we have said all the way through . "
Editor 's note ( February 11 ) : Due to an editing error , this story originally incorrectly attributed quotes about iron ore price negotiations and the case against Rio Tinto 's executives to Mr Bauert .
It has been amended to remove that attribution .
The ABC did not speak to Mr Bauert in compiling this report .
Decades ago when I was working under an “ apprenticeship , ” my mentor had a few words of advice .
“ Always have a Plan C , ” she said .
“ Do n’t you mean Plan B ? ” I asked .
“ No , ” she said , “ Plan C . ”
At the time I took those words for the eccentric ravings of a jaded old woman , but many times thereafter I realized she was right .
Friday was one of those times .
For the past few months I ’ve had a small problem with partition sizes on my central machine — the one I rely on to be rock - steady .
Originally when I built it , I allocated only 2 Gb to the root partition , and ordinarily that would be enough considering the / boot and / home folders are separated out to other partitions .
I have no real rationale for those things ; I started doing that a long time ago and have stayed with it even up until now .
( Actually , I do have a few rationales . )
However , what I have noticed with Crux is that jumping between kernels can take up to 1 Gb of space , considering all the compiling and so forth .
Maybe that ’s not the case for everyone , but if I check the size of a decompressed tarball in /usr / src , after the kernel is built , the folder can occupy up to a whopping 600 Mb .
Do n’t ask me where it comes from .
I ’m just an unwitting participant .
I have no complaint with that , and I certainly have no truck with the people who design those things .
Six hundred megabytes or six , it makes no difference to me … except that if I jump from , for example , 2.6.31.5 to 2.6.32.2 , I suddenly have more than a gigabyte in space taken up by system files .
So I was willing to try repartitioning those areas via the GPartEd Live CD ; after all , I have more than 50 Gb available on the drive , if you count all the unused space dedicated to /home .
A long time ago the live version of GPartEd came in quite handy for me , and I used to keep a spare one around just for emergencies .
I downloaded the most recent stable version , just for this occasion .
To make an already long story short , something went wrong while the resizing and shuffling were underway , the screen went black and the system hung with no response .
It ran like that for more than an hour and a half ( I was afraid to cut the power while the drive light was still flickering ) , but when it looked like it was done I disconnected the AC and tried it out .
And as you might expect , everything was scrambled .
I do n’t know what happened when GPartEd hiccuped , but the system halfway booted , then lost track of itself and exploded in a digital fireball of error messages .
No problem .
I have a Plan B . I am a faithful Clonezilla fan , and I was comfortable copying a spare image back across USB1.1 ( ouch ) .
Except that Plan B fell through when the last partition it had cloned — the / home partition — had somehow been invalidated , and could n’t be restored .
I crossed my fingers that maybe it was just a fluke error , but when I rebooted my account was dropped at / , and all the configuration files were missing .
I ran e2fsck against the “ empty ” home partition and came up with an endless stream of errors in sequence , so I reformatted that partition , made a new / home / kmandla folder … and went to Plan C .
Because I keep a plain - jane sync of my home directory on an external drive , just for backup purposes .
Because I like to move the same configurations between machines .
And because I always have a Plan C. 😉
In all , the catastrophe was averted , nothing needed recompiled or rebuilt , and in actuality , that folder had been synchronized at a more recent date than the Clonezilla backup , so the files would have needed refreshed anyway .
Of course , the original problem — tight space in the root partition — still stands , and because I am a glutton for punishment I tried the same repartitioning stunt again and got the same screwball behavior in GPartEd , but nothing was lost in the attempt (s ) .
I do n’t mind a freak accident or two , just so long as no one gets hurt .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Scientists working on the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC have just published results of the first analysis of data from the highest energy particle collisions ever carried out , bringing us another step closer to answering some of the most fundamental questions about our Universe .
The results appear in the Journal of High Energy Physics ( JHEP ) .
“ Our findings provide the first information on the characteristics of charged particle production in this new energy range , ” says Prof.
Guido Tonelli , Spokesperson of the CMS experiment , “ The results confirm previous measurements , and expectations for the new energy regime .
They are important to help us modelling the experimental backgrounds for future measurements at even higher energies . ”
The LHC provided first collisions in late November 2009 , after about 20 years of extremely challenging design and construction work for both the accelerator and the experiments .
About three weeks later , protons were accelerated for the first time in the LHC itself to an energy of 1.18 TeV / beam , the highest energy yet attained in accelerators .
Around one hundred thousand collisions were recorded by the four LHC experiments at this energy .
CMS is one of two so - called general - purpose experiments which look into the unknown and search for new physics .
It is designed to see a wide range of particles and phenomena produced in the LHC ’s high - energy collisions and will help to answer questions such as :
What is the Universe really made of and what forces act within it ?
And what gives everything substance ?
It will also measure the properties of previously discovered particles with unprecedented precision , and be on the lookout for completely new , unpredicted phenomena .
Such research not only increases our understanding but may eventually spark new technologies that change the world we live in .
UK institutes involved in CMS ( Bristol University , Brunel University , Imperial College and Rutherford Appleton Laboratory ) played major roles in the design and construction of the experiment and Prof T. Virdee of Imperial College was also the CMS Spokesperson for several years leading up to first operation .
The first published measurements by CMS depend on the charged particle tracking detector , using silicon pixel and microstrip sensors .
The radiation - hard electronics of the microstrip tracker were designed in a collaboration between Imperial College , Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and CERN .
Prof. G. Hall , UK - CMS Spokesperson , notes “ It is fantastic to see how well the CMS silicon tracker performs , and how rapidly it has met our design goals . ”
Prof. T. Virdee , the former Spokesperson , comments that “ After two decades from conception to completion of construction , this publication marks the true start of an equally long phase of the extraction of science from CMS , widely expected to be revolutionary ” .
Following the 2009 run there was a technical stop to prepare the LHC for accelerating protons to an energy of 3.5 TeV / beam .
Beams will soon start circulating again and a long run , lasting some eighteen months , will begin at the end of February .
This should enable the experiments to accumulate enough data to explore new territory in all areas where new physics is expected .

MEXICO CITY , Mexico — The United Nations ' drug law enforcement body has reprimanded Latin American countries that have decriminalized narcotic use , delivering a blow to the growing movement looking for a change in drug policy in the region .
The U.N. body says it is particularly concerned by a 2009 law in Mexico that decriminalizes possession of small amounts of cannabis , cocaine , heroin and other drugs .
“ This legal act may give the wrong signal , ” says a report released Wednesday by the International Narcotics Control Board , an independent body that monitors the implementation of U.N. drug control conventions .
The board said it wanted to remind the Mexican government that U.N. conventions require that the possession , purchase or cultivation of narcotic drugs be classified as a criminal offense .
The report also attacks the Argentine Supreme Court for a ruling last year that it is unconstitutional to punish the personal use of cannabis .
While not dishing out specific punishments , the narcotics control board has an important influence on drug policy , particularly in the developing world .
Activists in the bubbling drug reform movement here say that the board is taking a too conservative line , and argue that U.N. conventions do not prohibit governments from pursuing more progressive policies toward the treatment of drug addicts .
“ Just putting all consumers in jail is a wrong policy .
It does n’t help society to do better and you probably destroy lives instead , ” former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria told GlobalPost .
“ The United Nations meets every 10 years to say that in the next 10 years the world will be free of the consumption of drugs but it never happens .
And the violence problems are putting Mexico and Colombia in real danger . ”
Gaviria , who ruled Colombia from 1990 to 1994 and oversaw the police killing of cocaine baron Pablo Escobar , has recently joined the drug policy reform lobby — a broad - based movement that argues that the prohibition of drugs fuels violence while not stopping consumption .
The report criticized the participation of Gaviria and others in this campaign .
“ The board notes with concern that in countries in South America , such as Argentina , Brazil and Colombia ( and in countries in North America , such as Mexico and the United States ) , there is a growing movement to decriminalize the possession of controlled drugs , ” it says .
" Regrettably , influential personalities , including former high - level politicians in countries in South America , have publicly expressed support for that movement .
The Board is concerned that the movement , if not resolutely countered by the respective Governments , will undermine national and international efforts to combat the abuse of and illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs . ”
Some international watchdogs say that with such criticism , the U.N. board is overstepping its mandate , which is to uphold the U.N. conventions rather than comment on political debates .
“ They are making comments based on conservative moral perceptions and not on legal or medical considerations , ” said Pien Metaal , of the Drugs and Democracy Program at the Holland - based Transnational Institute .
While the United States has historically pushed for the war on drugs at the U.N. , other powers are now bringing conservative ideas to the table , Metaal said .
Among the current narcotics board members are representatives of the Russian Federation , China and Nigeria , which all support hard - line prohibitionist policies toward narcotics .
Meanwhile , the United States itself is beginning to take a more flexible line , with a growing number of states decriminalizing the possession of marijuana and legalizing the drug for medical sales .
In November , Californians will vote on a motion to fully legalize marijuana .
If approved , such a law would put California at legal odds with the narcotics board .
American drug reform activists say that the United Nations needs to overhaul its drug policy institutions so the world can move forward on the issue .
“ These kind of reports show the INCB is just a profoundly political organization , ” said Ethan Nadelmann , director of the New York - based Drug Policy Alliance .
“ The board needs to be abolished . ”

A wide appreciation of the implications of " Conspiracy Theories " by Harvard law professors Cass Sunstein and Adrian Vermeule ( http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1084585&rec=1&srcabs=292149) has been slow in coming .
What makes the article and the views expressed therein all the more significant is that author Sunstein in 2009 was made Administrator of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget by President Obama ( click here ) .
( Note : The 2008 article at the Social Science Research Network 's website appeared in virtually identical form in the Journal of Political Philosophy 17 ( 2 ) , 2009 , pgs 202 - 227 , except that the Journal 's version , which carries the title " Conspiracy Theories : Causes and Cures " , lacks several terminal pages dealing largely with 9/11 theories outside the U.S. .
References to pages below are for the easily downloaded online article for those who want the entire article .
The actual Journal is scarce and requires $ 41 for a download . )
While the article 's title suggests conspiracy theories broadly , the 9/11 Truth Movement is the paper 's focus , and it reveals substantial concern regarding that Movement 's ongoing advance .
Particularly ominous is that the authors , who use " theorists " and " extremists " interchangeably , limit their focus " to potentially harmful theories " .
To whom , one might wonder , would the 9/11 Truth Movement , so " worrisome " for the authors , be harmful ?
And why do the authors consider the 9/11 Truth Movement such a " serious threat " that it should be " broken up or at least muted by government action " ?

( NewsTarget ) Stressed out by your kids ?
Well according to a new study , your kids may be doing your blood pressure , which is influenced by stress , more good than harm .
A new study published in the peer - reviewed journalindicates that , contrary to what you may think , the parent - child relationship lowers blood pressure .
Researchers from Brigham Young University determined this by following approximately 198 adults for a 24 - hour period .
For 24 hours , the participants wore a blood pressure monitor that kept track of their blood pressure at random points throughout the day .
Of course , there are a number of factors that can contribute to a person 's blood pressure .
So they took into account specific physical factors when comparing blood pressure measurements to those who did not have children ( i.e. , age , body mass , gender , exercise , smoking ) .
According to the researchers ' analysis , parents with children had a systolic blood pressure rate that averaged 4.5 points lower than non-parents and a diastolic pressure rate that averaged 3 points lower than non-parents .
The researchers said that while children tend to provide stress to the average parent , the meaning and depth of the parent - child relationship seems to counterbalance that stress .
" While caring for children may include daily hassles , deriving a sense of meaning and purpose from life 's stress has been shown to be associated with better health outcomes , " said Julianne Holt - Lunstad , the study 's lead researcher and psychologist at BYU .
The surge of death rates from hypertension ( a 20 percent increase from 1996 to 2006 ) is no doubt due to a multitude of factors , but there 's at least some circumstantial evidence to support Holt - Lunstad 's findings .
As the rate of people with hypertension has steadily risen , the birth rate in the United States has declined every year since 1990 ( with the exception of 2007 , the most recent year available , when the birth rate increased 1 percent ) .
What 's more , the United States ' birth rate is among the lowest in the world .
Of 223 countries , the U.S. birth rate is 125th ( an average of 2.05 children born per woman ) .
Eight of the top 10 countries in birth rate reside in Africa .

US Media Replays Iraq Fiasco on Iran Major U.S. news organizations , including the New York Times and the Washington Post , are engaged in a replay of the kind of slanted coverage that paved the way to war in Iraq , only this time regarding Iran .
Email
Printer friendly
The treatment of Iran ’s election last June , the depictions of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the alarm over Iran ’s nuclear program all parallel the one - sided coverage that the U.S. news media directed toward Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and Iraq ’s alleged WMD program before the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 .
In both cases , the leading U.S. news outlets took sides ; they cast developments in the “ enemy ” Muslim nation in the harshest possible light ; they treated the leaders as unrelentingly evil ; they exaggerated the threats ( and potential threats ) posed by the country ’s weaponry , real and imagined .
Without doubt , there were many unsavory aspects to Saddam Hussein as there are with Iran ’s Ahmadinejad .
However , the U.S. media 's depictions of the two leaders lacked nuance , with only the most extreme and unflattering interpretations of their words and actions allowed .
In short , the Times , the Post and nearly all other U.S. news outlets have behaved more like propaganda vehicles than professional journalism organizations .
The anti-Iran bias , like the earlier anti-Iraq bias , is most notable on the editorial and op - ed pages but also pervades the news columns .
For instance , echoing U.S. policymakers , the U.S. news media often warns about the danger from a prospective Iranian nuclear weapon , claiming it would touch off an arms race in the Middle East .
What the news organizations almost never mention is that several countries in the region already have nuclear weapons , including Israel whose undeclared arsenal is considered one of the most sophisticated in the world .
Pakistan developed a nuclear bomb in the 1980s , with the acquiescence of the Reagan administration which saw the bomb as an acceptable tradeoff for Pakistan ’s assistance in supplying the Afghan mujahedeen in a covert war against Soviet forces in Afghanistan .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Reagan ’s Bargain / Charlie Wilson ’s War . ” ]
Pakistan ’s bitter rival , India , also possesses nuclear weapons as does Russia , meaning that Iran is surrounded by nuclear powers .
The consistent failure of the Post , the Times and other leading U.S. news organizations to mention this relevant fact denies the American people the necessary context for evaluating Iran ’s behavior .
Instead , Iran and its purported interest in a nuke are portrayed as the behavior of irrational extremists .
Iran , of course , insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes , not for a bomb .
And there is at this point no clear evidence that Iran is lying .
Indeed , U.S. intelligence agencies have asserted that Iran abandoned its pursuit of a nuclear warhead design in 2003 .
Singling Out Iran
So why is Iran being singled out for condemnation regarding its speculative interest in a nuclear weapon while Israel , Pakistan and India get a pass for their actual nuclear weapons ?
One argument that U.S. news organizations make is that Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty while Israel , Pakistan and India are not and that therefore it is more objectionable for Iran to evade the treaty ’s provisions than for the others to simply ignore the treaty outright .
But the argument makes little sense .
It amounts to giving a pass to rogue nuclear states that have refused to sign the treaty .
The absence of this outrage is especially notable regarding Israel , even after it imposed draconian punishments against one Israeli technician , Mordechai Vanunu , for divulging facts about the nuclear program in 1986 .
Vanunu was kidnapped in Italy , spirited back to Israel and tried in secret .
He was put in solitary confinement for 11 years during an 18 - year sentence .
Even today , Vanunu faces arrest for speaking with foreigners , yet this whistleblower remains almost as big a pariah with the U.S. press as he does with the Israeli government .
[ See “ Ellsberg on Vanunu ’s Arrest . ” ]
While American journalists silence themselves about Israel ’s secret nuclear arsenal and treat the persecution of Vanunu as somehow deserved , they rail against Iran ’s nuclear program even though it is under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency and remains far short of any breakout capability for a nuclear weapon even if Iran ’s government decided to build one .
Another argument , used to justify the double standard , is that Iran is a particularly dangerous nation ; that it has supported Arab groups , such as Hezboilah and Hamas , which some governments in the West label “ terrorist ” ; and that Iranian leaders reject Israel ’s status as a Jewish state and have wished for that religious / ethnic designation to end .
However , many people in the Middle East and around the world consider Hezbollah and Hamas to be resistance and / or political groups that have struggled against Israeli occupation of Lebanese and Palestinian lands , respectively .
While the groups have resorted to violence , sometimes against civilians , Israel does n’t have clean hands on that point either .
Israel is renowned for its cross - border assassinations and for its conquest of neighboring territory .
Israel invaded and occupied parts of Lebanon in the 1980s and engaged in a bloody offensive there as recently as 2006 .
Israel also has conducted a harsh occupation of Palestinian lands , assassinating Palestinian leaders and taking prized lands for Israeli settlers in defiance of United Nations resolutions and the intermittent protests of Israel ’s chief ally in Washington .
Israeli forces killed more than 1,000 Palestinians , most of them civilians , in an offensive in Gaza a year ago .
By contrast , Iran has for generations been a relatively peaceful regional power .
Its eight - year war with Iraq began when Saddam Hussein ’s forces invaded Iran in 1980 , possibly with a “ green light ” from the United States and Sunni Arab states , such as Saudi Arabia , which feared the spread of Iran ’s Shiite fundamentalism .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Lost History Hurts Obama ’s Iran Bid . ” ]
The war was sustained by President Ronald Reagan ’s secret decision to tilt toward Iraq .
Further , any objective observers would have to recognize that the United States has been the most active nation on earth intervening in other countries ’ affairs over the past six decades , often violently .
Links to Terrorists
As for links to terrorist organizations , Pakistan and the United States have arguably dirtier hands than Iran .
In the 1980s , during the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan , Pakistan collaborated with Sunni Muslim extremists , including Saudi Osama bin Laden and other violent operatives who later formed al - Qaeda .
In the 1990s , Pakistan ’s intelligence service , the ISI , nurtured the Taliban and backed their takeover of Afghanistan , remaining their staunchest ally up to the 9/11 attacks .
The ISI also is known to deploy militants against India in the disputed territory of Kashmir , and Pakistan has been the base for bloody terrorist attacks such as the 2008 massacre in Mumbai , India .
The United States , too , is far from blameless on the terrorism front .
To this day , U.S. authorities harbor known Cuban terrorists in Miami and elsewhere , including Luis Posada Carriles who was implicated in the mid-air bombing of a Cubana airliner in 1976 .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Bush Hypocrisy : Cuban Terrorists . ” ]
Since detonating two nuclear bombs against Japan at the end of World War II , U.S. officials have periodically discussed or threatened nuclear attack against other countries if they did n’t comply with American wishes , including non-nuclear states like North Vietnam when President Richard Nixon was engaged in his so - called “ madman ” strategy .
Even today , while complaining about Iran ’s suspected interest in building a nuclear weapon , U.S. authorities , including President George W. Bush and apparently President Barack Obama , have left open the possibility of nuking Iran .
They have made a point to insist that “ all options are on the table , ” and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , while a candidate for President , threatened to “ obliterate ” Iran if it attacked Israel .
Yet , to read the leading American newspapers , one would assume that Iran was the only dangerous country operating in that part of the world .
Bias on the Election
There also is the curious way the U.S. media handled the Iranian election last June 12 .
The New York Times and the Washington Post editorialists routinely describe the election as “ fraudulent , ” without any qualification or factual substantiation .
This is similar to how Post editorial page editor Fred Hiatt pronounced in 2002 and early 2003 that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .
Only later , after the U.S. invasion and the discovery of no caches of WMD did Hiatt concede that maybe the Post should not have been so categorical .
“ If you look at the editorials we write running up [ to the war ] , we state as flat fact that he [ Hussein ] has weapons of mass destruction , ” Hiatt said in an interview with the Columbia Journalism Review .
“ If that ’s not true , it would have been better not to say it . ” [ CJR , March / April 2004 ]
Yes , there was a time in American journalism when it was considered serious business to state as fact something that was not true .
However , in Hiatt ’s case – despite the deaths of more than 4,300 American soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis – there has been no change in the leadership of the Post ’s editorial pages .
Hiatt , like his counterparts at the New York Times , is now certain that the Iranian election was “ fraudulent ” without equivocation .
The evidence , however , points in a much more uncertain direction .
Many of the assumptions of the U.S. and Western press about election fraud turned out to be false , such as the belief that Azeris would have voted heavily for one of their own , Mir Hossein Mousavi , instead of for Ahmadinejad .
But a pre-election poll , sponsored by the New America Foundation , found a 2 - to - 1 breakdown for Ahmadinejad among Azeris .
Part of the reason appeared to be that Ahmadinejad had poured government resources into that area .
Another frequent complaint from the Western press was that Ahmadinejad ’s claim of victory came too fast , but that ignored the fact that Mousavi was out with a declaration of victory before any votes were counted .
The first partial results , showing Ahmadinejad in the lead , came out hours later .
The reason why Ahmadinejad might have really won the election was that his support was concentrated among the urban and rural poor who benefited from government food giveaways and jobs programs and who tend to listen more to conservative clerics in the mosques .
Mousavi seemed to acknowledge this point when he released his supposed proof of the rigged election , accusing Ahmadinejad of buying votes by providing food and higher wages for the poor .
At some Mousavi rallies , his supporters reportedly would chant “ death to the potatoes ! ” in a joking reference to Ahmadinejad ’s food distributions .
Yet , while passing out food and raising pay levels may be a sign of “ machine politics , ” such tactics are not normally associated with election fraud .
Generally speaking , Mousavi had the backing of the urban middle class and the well - educated , especially in the more cosmopolitan capital of Tehran where universities became a center for protests against Ahmadinejad .
The president ’s policies – and his offensive comments questioning the Holocaust – have created hardships for this voting bloc , which has found it hard to travel and do business in the face of Western sanctions and restrictions .
So , the election outcome could have been explained simply by Iran ’s middle class and intellectuals voting heavily for Mousavi , while larger numbers of poor and conservative Muslims might have broken for Ahmadinejad .
Opposing a Recount
The last real hope for definitive evidence proving that Ahmadinejad ’s victory was fraudulent may have passed when Mousavi rejected the possibility of a recount .
Instead Mousavi insisted on an entirely new election .
Mousavi ’s objection to a recount drew support from the New York Times ’ top brass .
“ Even a full recount would be suspect , ” the Times wrote in an editorial .
“ How could anyone be sure that the ballots were valid ? ”
But one reason for a recount is that examining ballots can unearth evidence of fraud , especially if ballot - box stuffing was done chaotically or if the tallies were simply fabricated without ballots to support them , as some Western observers have speculated regarding Iran .
This perception gap between the West and Iran over the legitimacy of the election now has become a powerful point of dispute between the two sides .
A poll by WorldPublicOpinion.org questioned 1,003 Iranians across the country between Aug. 27 and Sept. 10 , 2009 , discovering that 81 percent said they considered Ahmadinejad to be the legitimate president of Iran .
Only 10 percent called him illegitimate , with eight percent offering no opinion .
Sixty - two percent said they had strong confidence in the election results and another 21 percent said they had some confidence in the official vote count , for a total of 83 percent expressing favorable views on the election .
By comparison , only 13 percent said they had little or no confidence in the results .
Those poll results were either ignored by the U.S. news media or discounted as the result of fearful Iranians simply saying what their government wanted to hear .
However , similar polls have been conducted in countries around the world , including during the U.S. military occupation of Iraq , and have been regarded as useful measures of public opinion .
In the six months following that poll , the Post , the Times and other Western news outlets have continued to insist that the Iranian election was “ fraudulent , ” thus giving moral backing to street protests seeking to overthrow Ahmadinejad .
However , if the election indeed was legitimate , then the American news media is helping to create political support for the removal of a democratically elected government .
Bush and Regime Change A similar situation occurred in Iran in 1953 when the United States and Great Britain opposed Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh , who was seeking to nationalize Iran ’s oil resources .
The CIA undertook a propaganda campaign to depict Mossadegh as unstable while also passing out millions of dollars to rally big crowds demanding his ouster .
Given that history – and Iran ’s inclusion on President George W. Bush ’s “ axis of evil ” list – it would not be unreasonable for the Iranian government to suspect that the United States , possibly with its UK junior partner , is conducting a new covert operation today .
Prior to the June 12 election in Iran , it was well known and widely reported that Bush had signed a covert action finding targeting Iran ’s Islamic government with a major program of propaganda and political destabilization .
In the July 7 , 2008 , New Yorker magazine , investigative reporter Seymour Hersh wrote that late the previous year , Congress had agreed to Bush ’s request for a major escalation in covert operations against Iran to the tune of up to $ 400 million .
“ The Finding was focused on undermining Iran ’s nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through regime change , ” one person familiar with its contents told Hersh .
The operation involved “ working with opposition groups and passing money , ” the person said .
Other news organizations reported similar facts , with Bush administration officials even citing the aggressive covert action as one reason why the Israelis should tamp down their heated rhetoric about launching a military strike against Iran ’s nuclear sites .
Yet , when the Mousavi campaign took on the appearance of a “ velvet revolution , ” with Mousavi claiming victory before any ballots were counted and then organizing mass demonstration when the official vote count went against him , the U.S. press corps mocked any suggestion from Ahmadinejad ’s government that foreign operatives might have had a hand in the disruptions .
Not to say that Mousavi ’s campaign was orchestrated from outside Iran – nor to suggest that it did n’t speak for genuine grievances inside Iran – but the U.S. press corps behaved as if it had forgotten its own earlier reporting about the CIA covert operation .
It was hard to avoid the conclusion that the big American media was taking sides with Mousavi .
The Iran - Contra Connection
Truly objective journalism at least might have included some historical facts about the three chief opposition leaders and their longstanding ( often secret ) ties to the West .
In the 1980s , then Prime Minister Mousavi was , in effect , the control officer for Manucher Ghorbanifar , the Iranian agent who hooked up with neoconservative activist Michael Ledeen for clandestine Iran-Contra weapons shipments that involved both the United States and Israel .
In November 1985 , as one of the missile shipments via Israel went awry , Ghorbanifar conveyed Mousavi ’s anger to the White House .
" On or about November 25 , 1985 , Ledeen received a frantic phone call from Ghorbanifar , asking him to relay a message from the prime minister of Iran to President Reagan regarding the shipment of the wrong type of HAWKs , ” according to Iran - Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh ’s Final Report .
“ Ledeen said the message essentially was ‘ we 've been holding up our part of the bargain , and here you people are now cheating us and tricking us and deceiving us and you had better correct this situation right away . ’ ”
Ghorbanifar also had dangled the possibility of Reagan ’s national security adviser Robert McFarlane meeting with high - level Iranian officials , including Mousavi .
In May 1986 , when McFarlane and White House aide Oliver North took their infamous trip to Tehran with the inscribed Bible and the key - shaped cake , they were planning to meet with Mousavi .
Another leading figure in today ’s opposition , Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , also sat at the center of the web of arms deals that Israel arranged for Iran in its long war with Iraq .
Rafsanjani , who was then parliamentary chairman , built his personal fortune , in part , as a war profiteer benefiting from those lucrative deals with Israel .
[ For more on the arms deals , see Ari Ben- Menashe ’s Profits of War . ]
A third key opposition leader , Mehdi Karoubi , and his brother Hassan also were linked to the secret arms deals .
Mehdi Karoubi has been identified as an intermediary as early as 1980 when he reportedly had contacts with Israeli and U.S. intelligence operatives and top Republicans working for Ronald Reagan .
[ See Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
The brother , Hassan Karoubi , was another Iran - Contra figure , meeting with Ghorbanifar and Ledeen in Geneva in late October 1985 regarding missile shipments in exchange for Iranian help in getting a group of U.S. hostages freed in Lebanon , according to Walsh ’s report .
Normally , such an unusual line - up of opposition leaders might be expected to raise some eyebrows in the U.S. press corps .
If the CIA or Israeli intelligence were trying to achieve regime change in Iran , they might reasonably reach out to influential figures with whom they ’ve had prior relationships .
But all that history , as well as the media ’s prior knowledge of Bush ’s covert operation seeking “ regime change ” in Iran , disappeared , not to be mentioned in the volumes of reporting about the June 12 election .
The stories all were about spontaneous demonstrations in protest of Ahmadinejad ’s allegedly fraudulent reelection .
The U.S. news media may understandably view Ahmadinejad with disdain , for his bluster and especially his outrageous comments about the Holocaust .
Sometimes that repulsion has been palpable , such as when New York Times executive editor Bill Keller personally traveled to Iran to witness the election and co-authored a news analysis that started with a joke about Ahmadinejad having lice in his hair .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Taking Sides in Iran . ” ]
But one might at least have hoped that the death and destruction in Iraq would have taught these media figures a painful lesson : that sometimes loose talk about foreign “ enemies ” can contribute to horrendous human suffering .
Journalists might also recall the old principles of the profession : fairness , commitment to facts , and objectivity .
Robert Parry broke many of the Iran - Contra stories in the 1980s for the Associated Press and Newsweek .
His latest book , Neck Deep : The Disastrous Presidency of George W. Bush , was written with two of his sons , Sam and Nat , and can be ordered at neckdeepbook.com .
His two previous books , Secrecy & Privilege : The Rise of the Bush Dynasty from Watergate to Iraq and Lost History : Contras , Cocaine , the Press & ' Project Truth ' are also available there .

Stories abound as to how the Island of Martha ’s Vineyard got its name .
But there are no volumes which tell the tale of how it got its apostrophe .
Or that said apostrophe is protected by federal decree .
In the first of his three - volume History of Martha ’s Vineyard published in 1911 , George Banks wrote , “ There was great uncertainty in the 17th century , even among the inhabitants of the island , as to its correct name . . .
But at length , Martha , whoever she was , triumphed over them all , and for two centuries the Vineyard has had her name as a prefic unchallenged , and without rival . ”
Mr. Banks did not know the whole story .
In 1890 , United States President Benjamin Harrison established the United States Board on Geographic Names in an effort to settle contradictions and inconsistencies over geographic names which emerged following the Civil War .
Based in Reston , Va. , the board exists to this day and is to thank for restoring the ‘h’ to Pittsburgh and splitting Bel Air into a two - word name .
Since its inception , the board has enforced a strict policy discouraging the use of apostrophes in place names .
The board ’s Web site gives no firm reason for the policy , but suggests a few theories : that historically , an apostrophe looked too much like a rock in water when printed on a map , or that the board did not want to show possession for natural features .
According to the archives of the Vineyard Gazette , one of the first actions taken by the board was to enforce its policy on the United States Post Office Department .
Thus in 1894 , the official department guide wiped out 1,665 apostrophes across the country , regardless of local custom or history .
In 1933 , a rabble from the Vineyard fought back .
Beaten into submission , and breaking with its longstanding policy , the board approved the use of the apostrophe in Martha ’s Vineyard .
“ In the 1920s , the Edgartown folk raised such a howl that federaldom put it back , ” reads a type - written letter sent to former Gazette editor Henry Beetle Hough by a disgruntled resident of Thompson Point ( formerly Thompson ’s Point ) , Vermont .
In his 1949 supplement to The American Language , the influential American writer and prose stylist H. L. Mencken referenced the decision and described the effort as a vigorous local protest .
According to the New York Times , the United States Board on Geographic Names receives some 30 apostrophe applications each year .
Only four places have followed in the footsteps of the Vineyard and been granted a legal apostrophe .
They are Ike ’s Point in New Jersey ( granted in 1944 because , according to the board Web site , it would be unrecognizable otherwise ) , John E’s Pond in Rhode Island ( 1963 , because otherwise it could be confused with John S Pond — note that neither pond has a period in its name , the use of which the board also discourages ) , Carlos Elmer ’s Joshua View in Arizona ( 1995 , otherwise three apparently given names in succession would dilute the meaning of seeing the Joshua trees ) and Clark ’s Mountain in Oregon ( 2002 , to correspond with the personal references of Lewis and Clark ) .
The Gazette archives do not chronicle the extensive local campaign of the 1930s , but there is indication of a renewed threat to that apostrophe in the mid 1960s after rumor spread that the initial ruling would be put aside .
“ There can be few names more expressive and intrinsically satisfying and beautiful than Martha ’s Vineyard , and few so deprived of rightness and symmetry as the ravished Marthas Vineyard , ” Mr. Beetle Hough wrote in a 1965 editorial .
A few years later , after James Reston became publisher of the Gazette , the Washington Post had this to say : “ Delete that apostrophe and we can expect journalistic thunder from the usually mild - mannered James Reston , the Washington - based New York Times columnist , who also is publisher of the weekly Vineyard Gazette . ”
Reached at his home this week , Arthur Railton , former editor of the Dukes County Intelligencer , mused on the use of the apostrophe and its placement in the Island name .
“ An apostrophe suggests ownership , and Martha never owned a vineyard of course , so I do n’t know how it got there , ” he said .
“ I ’m glad it ’s there , ” he continued .
“ Without an apostrophe , it seems like a different name .
With the apostrophe , it makes it sound as though it is Martha ’s vineyard , but without the apostrophe , I do n’t know what it would be . ”
Basil Welch , the octogenarian cemetery superintendent in Chilmark , was similarly perplexed .
“ I ’ve never heard of it .
I do n’t know the reason for it , ” said the man who spends his days walking among the gravestones of Chilmarkers gone by and knows a thing or two about Vineyard lore .
“ Why would they frown upon an apostrophe ? ” he asked .
Although he could not speculate as to the origin of the apostrophe , he did have his own take on how this Island received its name .
“ Bartholomew Gosnold had three daughters and he named a group of islands , one after each daughter , ” Mr. Welch recounted .
“ There was Elizabeth , who got the Elizabethan Islands , Martha , who had her Vineyard , and there was only one island left , so Nan took it ! ”
“ Well , this is news to me , ” said Chris Scott , executive director of the Martha ’s Vineyard Preservation Trust , a nonprofit organization which maintains and preserves historic Vineyard landmarks , when asked about the positioning of the punctuation .
“ We ’ve all known that Martha ’s Vineyard is a very special place and this gives us reason to think it ’s even more special . ”
He remembered a tale told by Matthew Stackpole , former executive director of the Martha ’s Vineyard Museum .
“ Bartholomew Gosnold is credited with naming both Cape Cod and Martha ’s Vineyard , ” Mr. Scott said .
“ From the accounts of the voyage , there was an enormous number of cod offshore , so he named it Cape Cod .
When he got to Martha ’s Vineyard , he found even more cod , but he had already named the Cape , so he named the Island after his mother in law , who subsidized his voyage .
If he had gotten here first , it could have been Martha ’s Cape and Cod Island .
It could have been the Cape ’s problem with the apostrophe ! ”
As history shows , the Vineyard has clung to its apostrophe over the years , but recently , the punctuation mark has been something of a bugaboo for this newspaper .
After a recent makeover of the Gazette home page ( mvgazette.com ) , the Web browser Google stopped including Gazette articles in its Google news alerts .
The reason ?
Two types of apostrophes are used in technology coding .
The old Gazette Web site used a software code with the standard apostrophe ; the new one uses a code and an apostrophe which Google does not read .
What ’s a veteran Googler to do ?
Until he can solve the problem , the Gazette ’s webmaster has a suggestion .
“ You should type Martha Vineyard , no apostrophe and no ‘ s ’ , ” he said .

Ich mache das alles nicht nur um möglichst schnell möglichst reich zu werden ( schön wärs , aber spielen tuns`es nicht ) sondern vor allem weils mir Spaß macht .
Das wollte ich schon immer machen : schöne Sachen an nette Leute zu verkaufen .
Jetzt mach ichs und ich freue mich Ihnen hier mein Programm vorstellen zu dürfen :
Gemälde Reproduktionen - mit Öl auf Leinwand handgemalt !
Das Original Gemälde der " Fischerboote " von van Gogh , welches ich vor kurzem in der Albertina in Wien gesehen habe , hat , wenn man es nur aus ein paar Schritten Entfernung betrachtet , eine faszinierende Ausstrahlung .
In meiner ersten eigenen Wohnung hatte ich einen Kunstdruck diese Bildes aufgehängt , war ja auch ganz dekorativ .
Unlängst habe ich mir dann aber das selbe
Bild von einem meiner Vertragsmaler als Ölgemälde anfertigen lassen und das ist schon was anderes , großartig !
Klar würde man meine Reproduktion neben das Original Gemälde hängen , dann würde man vielleicht geringe Unterschiede sehen , aber wer macht das schon ?
So ist die Ölbild - Gemälde - Reproduktion eine echte Alternative , der Unterschied zwischen dem Poster und dem Ölbild in Ausstrahlung und Wirkung ist ein gewaltiger , wobei die Preise aber nicht so weit von einander entfernt sind .
War früher eine gute Reproduktion noch ein teuerer Spaß , so bleiben die Preise für schöne Ölbilder heute im unteren dreistelligen Bereich , die kann sich wirklich jeder leisten .
Dabei biete ich aber nur beste Qualität an .
In der internationalen Reprobranche sind drei bis vier Qualitätsstufen üblich " museum " , " high " , " medium " und " commercial " .
Ich liefere Ölbilder nur in der höchsten Qualitätsstufe * Museum * , weil ich auch Spass an meiner Arbeit haben will , vor allem durch zufriedene Kunden !

Portraits und andere Ölbilder Gemälde nach Foto handgemalt
Das halte ich überhaupt für den Knüller !
Ein Foto ist schnell gemacht , eine Vergrößerung kostet ein paar Euro und schon hängt es an der Wand .
Ist aber nichts besonderes , ein Foto unter vielen eben .
Wenn jetzt aber ein begabter Maler das selbe Foto als Vorlage nimmt und ein Gemälde danach schafft , ist das doch ganz was anderes !
Das hat eine ganz besondere Wirkung , ein echtes Ölbild mit einer einzigartigen Ausstrahlung .
Wie das Hochzeitsbild hier rechts , wobei das Ölbild nahezu hundertprozentig dem Foto geglichen hat .
Abgesehen von dieser Wirkung kann auch beim Malen des Ölbildes manches getrickst werden , das mit fototechnischen Mitteln sehr schwierig und aufwändig , wenn nicht unmöglich wäre .
Aus 2
Fotos malen wir mit der Hand , Ölfarbe auf Leinwand , ein wunderschönes Gemälde .
Zum Beispiel dieses schöne Bild mit den beiden Pferden : als Vorlage hatte ich zwei Fotos , eines von jedem Pferd , da war ein Hintergrund , da waren die Halfter und die Fliegen auf den Köpfen der Pferde .
Das war aber gar kein Problem , die beiden Pferdchen auf einem Bild zu vereinen und die störenden Details zu entfernen .
Oder das Ölgemälde das wir in Farbe von einem fünfzig Jahre alten Schwarzweißfoto , einem Hochzeitsbild , gemalt haben .
Oder das Gemälde das nach einem
Foto gemalt wurde mit dem schönen Panorama irgendwo in den Tauern , wo leider nur der Hinterkopf zu sehen ist .
Da haben wir noch ein Foto ( schwarzweiß ) aus dieser Zeit gefunden , welches der Maler als Vorlage verwendet hat um den Kopf im Profil zu zeigen .
Und da gibt es noch unzählige Möglichkeiten , sehen Sie bei meinen Referenzen .
Bei Fragen schreiben
Sie mir einfach ein eMail , ich antworte umgehend .
Portraits und andere Aquarelle , oder Bleistiftzeichnungen nach Foto handgefertigt .
Aber auch die Liebhaber von Aquarellen und Bleistiftzeichnungen kommen bei mir auf ihre Rechnung .
Nicht jeder bevorzugt die kräftig farbigen Ölbilder , vielen gefallen die zarteren Bleistiftzeichnungen , oder die duftigen Aquarelle besser .
Ihr Haustier , ein lieber Freund , oder Verwandter nach einem Foto als handgezeichnete BleistiftzeichnungUnter unseren Vertragskünstlern finden sich auch Spezialisten für Aquarelle und Bleistiftzeichngen , die nach Ihrer Vorlage zeichnen , oder malen .
Hier zum Beispiel Marilyn Monroe auf einem handgemalten Original Aquarell .
Selbstvertändlich verwenden wir auch hier nur bestes Material , hochwertige Zeichen - und Malkartone und beste Farben und Stifte .
Neben Motiven , die von Ihnen beigestellt werden , können Sie auch Reproduktionen der Werke berühmter Maler als Bleistiftzeichnung , oder als Aquarell beziehen .
Meistens kennt man ja nur die Ölbilder der großen Meister , dabei haben fast alle auch Unmengen von tollen Bleistiftskizzen und Zeichnungen geschaffen und eine Unzahl von wunderbaren Aquarellen gemalt .
Diese Abteilung ist noch im Aufbau und noch nicht im Shop integriert .
Wenn
Sie sich für ein solches Bild interessieren , schreiben Sie mir einfach ein eMail , ich antworte umgehend .
Bilderrahmen , Barockrahmen , Keilrahmen
Theoretisch könnte man ein Gemälde auch direkt an die Wand heften , ernsthaft wird das aber niemand erwägen .
Also brauchen
Sie einen passenden Rahmen , welcher Ihr wertvolles Gemälde erst so richtig zur Geltung bringt .
Zuerst wird das Ölbild auf einen Keilrahmen gespannt , der aus vier Profilleisten zusammengesteckt wird .
Innen in den Ecken werden Keile eingesetzt , die es ermöglichen , daß Ihr Ölbild bei Bedarf nachgespannt wird .
Manche moderne Ölbilder schauen auch nur auf Keilrahmen gespannt schon gut aus , die meisten , vor allem klassische , Ölgemälde wirken aber mit einem schönen Schmuckrahmen noch viel besser .
Zur Auswahl stehen grundsätzlich zwei Arten von Bilderrahmen : die aus maschinell gefertigten Leisten ( modern / glatt , oder klassisch / verziert ) zusammengefügten , oder die in Handarbeit nach Ihren Wünschen hergestellten Barockrahmen .
Es liegt in der Natur der Sache , daß die handgeschnitzten , vergoldeten Barockrahmen preislich deutlich höher liegen , als die aus fertigen Leisten zusammengesetzten modernen Rahmen .
Wobei ich nichts gegen die letzeren sagen will , meine eigenen Bilder sind alle in solchen Rahmen , aber so ein Barockrahmen ist eben ein Kunstwerk für sich .
MELBOURNE'S timetables are far too complicated and need to be drastically simplified as part of a major two - year regeneration of the rail network , the new head of the city 's rail system says .
A '' run - to - failure philosophy '' that had endured under previous train operators was no longer good enough , Metro chief executive Andrew Lezala said yesterday in an interview with The Age .
'' It is time for the railways to step up now and play our part in keeping Melbourne moving , because with another 1 million people coming in the next 15 years , the roads simply wo n't cope , '' he said .
Mr Lezala does not own a car in Melbourne , does not yet have a myki card and rides the tram to work from his inner-city home .
Yesterday , at the end of another torrid week for Melbourne train travellers - with 43 - degree heat on Monday resulting in 247 of 2050 scheduled services being cancelled - Mr Lezala said the city deserved better .

Every stay in Luang Prabang should include a day trip to the Pak Ou Buddha Caves .
This Buddhist monastery was carved out of a giant limestone rock located in the waters near Pak Ou , at about an hour or two hours by boat from the Luang Prabang town centre .
The caves can be divided into a lower cave , the Tham Ting , and an upper cave , the Than Teung .
The caves can only be accessed by boat and has been a sacred site of great value for Buddhist pelgrims through the years .
Today also a lot of tourists visit the Buddha caves to learn more about the Lao culture and their impressive Buddhist statues which I found hard to number as they are literally thousands and thousands .
The caves on the Mekong ..
You can arrange a day trip by long boat to the Pak Ou caves through any given tourist agency around town .
Pak
Ou is located not to far away from Luang Prabang but the journey has to be travelled up stream on the Mekong River .
Also at the Pak Ou caves you will see children trying to sell you incense or caged birds to honor the shrines .
Buying a cage does n't mean the animal has to die , one of the kids explaned , and you would actually buy the bird 's freedom .

A FEW years ago , Burger King , a fast - food chain , conducted a study of the eating habits of some of its most frequent customers .
A few dozen “ SuperFans ” , as the firm calls them , recorded and photographed everything they ate for two weeks .
The results were collected in a book called “ Food for Thought ” .
Unsurprisingly , this book is not publicly available : amateur photos of heaps of junk food are hardly an enticing advertisement for a firm that supplies the stuff .
Nonetheless , “ Food for Thought ” gives an insight into why some Americans have such poor diets .
The fast - food fans in the book typically lead chaotic lives .
They often toil long , irregular hours for not much money .
They grab food when they can , skipping many meals and gorging at unorthodox times .
They favour whatever is quick , convenient and comforting .
( “ I selected the pie because it was easy to grab out of the fridge , ” says one . )
They often have an imperfect grasp of nutritional science .
( “ I am eating chocolate muffins at work because they are not too heavy , ” says another . )
Oddly for a piece of corporate research , the book contains passages that are quite moving .
One single dad 's diary shows him eating nothing but junk for days on end .
Then , one evening , he visits his aunt 's house and she cooks him a feast of real food : pork , okra stew , collard greens and corn bread .
At 33.8 % , America 's obesity rate is ten times higher than Japan's .
In all , 68 % of Americans are either obese or overweight .
( Some studies yield lower numbers , but since they typically ask people how much they weigh , rather than weighing them , scepticism is in order . )
Few problems , besides death , afflict more people .
Americans are more likely to be overweight than to pay federal income tax .
But the good news is that the nation may have stopped getting fatter .
A study published this month in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) found that American women were no more likely to be obese in 2008 than they were nearly a decade before .
For men , there was a small rise in obesity over the same period , but no change in the past three years .
Among children , too , there was no change in obesity rates except among the very heaviest boys , whose numbers increased slightly .
Could it be that the American obesity epidemic has reached a plateau ?
If the national girth really has stopped expanding , that would be a blessing , though of course it is a big fall in obesity that is really required .
Although a little extra heft is no big deal , many Americans are so ample that it ruins their health .
That places a burden on the health - care system : each obese American racks up medical bills 42 % higher than an American of normal weight , according to Eric Finkelstein and Justin Trogdon , writing in Health Affairs .
Add to that the indirect costs of obesity , such as lost productivity due to sickness or premature death .
The startling Republican victory in Massachusetts this week throws Barack Obama 's health reforms up in the air .
But the issue will not go away .
And a plateau in the obesity rate would make some kind of reform a bit less expensive .
It will not lead to a sudden dip in health - care costs , predicts Mr Trogdon .
But it could substantially slow the rate at which they are rising .
Previous projections typically assumed that Americans would keep on ballooning .
As a thought experiment in 2008 , Youfa Wang of the Johns Hopkins Centre for Global Health drew a line from recent trends and projected that 100 % of Americans would be overweight by 2048 .
By 2030 , his model showed health - care costs attributable to excess weight approaching a trillion dollars a year .
The latest numbers remind us how little is known about public health .
Of course , people put on weight when they consume more calories than they burn off .
But no one knows for sure why America 's obesity has trebled since 1960 .
Plausible theories abound .
As people grow richer , food becomes relatively cheaper .
Time grows more precious : hence the lure of fast food .
Desk work burns fewer calories than spadework .
And labour - saving devices do just that : if we still washed dishes and clothes by hand , we would burn off five pounds of flesh each year , reckons Barry Popkin , the author of a book called “ The World is Fat ” .
All this is no doubt true , but it does not explain why Americans are fatter than people in other rich countries , nor why they appear to have stopped getting fatter .
No to nannies
Kathleen Sebelius , the health secretary , says that “ fighting obesity is at the heart ” of health reform .
But telling people to eat more healthily is like telling them not to have risky sex .
Americans are suspicious of the nanny state at the best of times , let alone when it nags them to curb their most basic instincts .
Some regulations help : forcing restaurants to post calorie counts on dishes , for example , prompts diners to pick less calorific treats .
But politicians are reluctant to attack voters ' favourite vices too vigorously .
A recent proposal to tax sugary drinks , for example , went nowhere .
Opponents argued that it would disproportionately affect the poor .
True enough , but the poor are disproportionately likely to be overweight .
The constant barrage of pro-vegetable propaganda in schools may have raised awareness of the need for a balanced diet , reckons Mr Trogdon .
And popular pressure has prompted many fast - food outlets to offer salads and other wholesome fare .
But even if good food were freely available , losing weight is hard .
Every year , 25 % of American men and 43 % of American women attempt it .
“ [ F ] ailure rates are exceedingly high , ” notes a JAMA editorial .
But there is hope .
Eating is social .
Studies suggest that people guzzle more if they have overweight friends and relatives , and less if they do n't .
So if Americans have stopped getting fatter , their children have a better shot at staying trim .

The files contain verbal and drawn accounts of UFO encounters Reports of a UFO hovering over former Conservative Home Secretary Michael Howard 's home are among thousands of odd sketches , strange sightings and alleged close encounters detailed in newly released UK documents .
More than 6,000 pages of reports describe people 's experiences with unidentified flying objects , mainly between 1994 and 2000 .
Among them are details of how the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) received reports of a large , triangular unidentified flying object hovering in the sky above Mr Howard 's home near Folkestone , Kent , on 8 March 1997 .
Government correspondence , local newspaper reports and details of an RAF investigation into the sighting all feature in the files .
Eyewitnesses in Burmarsh and New Romney reported seeing the " humming " object , said to have been the size of two passenger planes .
' Huge triangle ' Newspaper cuttings from the time reveal that Chris Rolfe , co-ordinator of group UFO Monitoring East Kent ( UFOMEK ) , warned how the object could have been looking for Mr Howard , who later went on to lead the Tory party .
Mr Rolfe said : " It would seem the UFO was disinterested in Sophie , the girl who reported it and watched it for quite a long time .
" This certainly makes it seem like it had a purpose and has left me wondering if its purpose had something to do with Mr Howard . "
Michael Howard was home secretary at the time of the UFO sighting UFOMEK compiled its own report on the sighting and sent it to the prime minister , the Home Office and the MoD .
One eyewitness account in the UFOMEK report said : " It was just a huge triangle thing , which was a lot bigger than an aeroplane or anything like that .
" It had lights all around the outside , and this disc attached to the back , and a big light on the front .
I pulled up to a stop and as I did it shot off . "
The RAF investigation into the sighting found nothing unusual .
Alien illness ?
This case and more UFO encounters are revealed in the fifth instalment of document releases as part of a three - year project between the MoD and The National Archives .
In another account , a man in Ebbw Vale , Blaenau Gwent , claimed to have seen a UFO as he was driving his car on a clear and dry night , at 2240 on 27 January 1997 .
DRAWINGS FROM THE UFO FILES Many of the released files included sketches .
A craft containing three beings was drawn by a passenger on a flight from Heathrow to Hong Kong in 1993 .
A drawing and description of a " flying saucer " sighting over Watford in Hertfordshire was also among the 6,000 pages of newly - released documents .
A sighting above Trenale Lane , near Tintagel , Cornwall , was also documented .
The artist identified a dome at the front of the craft as the cockpit .
Another eyewitness submitted a drawing of a triangle - shaped craft seen close to a pylon above Knutsford in Cheshire .
Two " missile - shaped " UFOs were also captured in a sketch by a witness in Smethwick , West Midlands , in 1954 .
A triangle - shaped craft was also drawn by a witness who described seeing it above Oldbury , West Midlands , on 9 August 1995 .
Another notes the diameter of the unidentified craft they saw flying above their car in Malmesbury in Wiltshire .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
In his report to police the following day , the man , from Newport , Gwent , said his car had been surrounded for five minutes by a " tube of light " which had swept towards him from the north east , during which time both his radio and mobile phone stopped working .
The man reported that he was ill following his brush with the unknown .
The report said : " He felt and was indeed sick later on .
He is still feeling ill today ( 28/1/97 ) and has developed a skin condition .
Advised to see doctor . "
This sort of episode would be classed by UFO experts as a " close encounter of the second kind " - a UFO sighting followed by an associated physical effect .
Plane sighting
In another report , recorded on 11 June 1997 without a location , a man claimed he had been visited by a flying man - what is referred to as a " close encounter of the third kind " .
The man said he had been sat in his living room , where he also slept , when a man walked in and lay on his quilt .
The report said : " The window then went all white and the [ visiting ] man whooshed through the window .
" [ The witness ] then called the police who would n't come to his house because they thought he was ' a nutter ' , so he phoned Scotland Yard and the fire brigade .
" He wanted the police to see the quilt where the man had been because the indentation showed that the person just lifted off the quilt without getting up from it in a normal way .
" The man stressed that he was not a crank and was not on drugs . "
The pilots of a Boeing 737 aircraft had a " near miss " with a UFO on 6 January 1995 while they were approaching Manchester Airport , the files reveal .
British Airways Captain Roger Wills and co-pilot First Officer Mark Stuart both saw a lit object fly down the right - hand side of the aircraft at high speed from the opposite direction .
Manchester Air Traffic
Control did not record any known traffic in the vicinity on radar and the incident was investigated by the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) .
But neither it or the MoD could find evidence of extra-terrestrial activity .
Reports change
Also included in the latest releases is a letter from senior MoD official Ralph Noyes , in which he describes seeing a film of UFOs captured by RAF fighter pilots in 1956 .
Mr Noyes claims the footage was shown at a secret underground screening arranged for air defence staff at the MoD in 1970 .
And a memo reveals how former Prime Minister Winston Churchill expressed curiosity in " flying saucers " and requested a briefing from his ministers .
It 's impossible to prove a direct link between what people are reading and watching and what they report as UFOs but one interpretation could be that the latest advances in technology may be influencing what people see in the sky
Dr David Clarke
He was told in reply that following an intelligence study conducted in 1951 , the " flying saucers " could be explained by " one or other " of four causes .
These were known astronomical or meteorological phenomena , mistaken identification of conventional aircraft , optical illusions and psychological delusions , or deliberate hoaxes .
Experts say the records highlight how shapes of reported UFOs have changed over the last few decades , possibly explained by representations of UFOs in popular culture .
Many reports in this latest file describe aircraft as big , black and triangular in shape with lights along the edges , whereas the predominant form in the 1940s and 1950s was saucer or disc - shaped .
Dr David Clarke , author of The UFO Files , said : " In the 1950s , the next big leap in technology was thought to be a round craft that took off vertically and it's intriguing to note that this is the same period when people began to report seeing ' flying saucers ' in the sky .
" In the period the latest file release covers , triangular - shaped US stealth bombers and Aurora spy planes featured heavily on TV , such as The X Files ... , and films such as Independence Day released in 1996 , and the shape of reported UFOs corresponds .
" It 's impossible to prove a direct link between what people are reading and watching and what they report as UFOs but one interpretation could be that the latest advances in technology may be influencing what people see in the sky . "
The files are available to download for free for a month from the National Archives website .

While American politicians continue to indulge the unsustainable excesses of a federal government already littered with unnecessary functions , other nations have wisely begun to read the handwriting on the wall .
What does it say ?
Cut , cut , cut !
Take Ireland , which ( like America ) found itself buried under a mountain of deficit spending in 2009 as the global economic recession crippled income and revenue growth .
Making matters worse , a huge speculative housing boom swept across the nation just prior to the bottom falling out of the global economy , which has made its recession even more severe .
In fact Irelands unemployment rate is currently 12.8 % - the third highest rate in all of Europe .
Things got so bad that at one point last year , the Irish government was borrowing 400 million ( $ 575 million ) a week just to keep its head above water , with its deficit rapidly approaching 20 % of its gross domestic product .
At that level , the very financial survival of Ireland would have been at risk , according to the countrys finance minister .
1
Sound familiar ?
Its almost exactly whats happening in America , albeit on a smaller scale .
Yet while American politicians are pushing new socialist spending sprees and bigger government power grabs in 2010 , Irelands government is doing exactly what the countrys businesses and families have been forced to do as a result of the downturn find ways to make ends meet .
In addition to slashing salaries for more than 400,000 government workers ( including its top administration officials ) , Irish leaders have also shown a willingness to trim back numerous social welfare programs .
All told , the Irish cuts will save as much as $ 6 billion this year and as much as $ 22 billion over the next four years .
Ireland is not making these decisions in a vacuum .
In fact , the country has already learned the hard way that unchecked government growth does not translate into recovery .
During the 1980s , a massive expansion of government debt ( and a failure on the part of political leaders to make cuts when they were necessary ) spawned anemic economic growth , soaring interest rates and an unemployment rate that soared to nearly 20 % .
Irish economists refer to this period as the lost decade .
In the 1980s , we saw what can happen when you ignore the problem of overspending , Alan Ahearne , a special adviser in Ireland 's Finance Ministry , told The Washington Postin December .
We 're not going to make that mistake again .2
American politicians , on the other hand , are tripping over themselves in a headlong rush to make precisely that same mistake on a much larger scale .
Not content with a dramatic expansion of the size and scope of the federal government , President Barack Obama and his Congressional allies are planning to pour billions of additional taxpayer dollars down the sinkhole of state government bureaucracies in 2010 this in spite of clear and compelling evidence that such spending has failed miserably to stimulate economic recovery .
Meanwhile , a seemingly un-scalable mountain of government debt grows even higher while the taxpayers ability to repay it is further hamstrung .
In fact , according to a recent report from the Heritage Foundation , Obamas budget proposals would impose $ 13 trillion in deficit spending over the coming decade , bringing annual budget deficits in America to more than $ 2 trillion and the U.S. public debt to more than $ 20 trillion .
3
This is beyond reckless it is courting economic calamity on an unprecedented scale .
Yet unlike leaders in Ireland , politicians in America appear incapable of grasping the fundamental reality that nations cannot borrow their way out of debt or borrow their way into prosperity .
The longer Americas current leaders refuse to acknowledge this self - evident truth , the deeper the hole gets for the American taxpayers .
Many people are low on money these days and those with any little money left probably do n’t even want to spend them .
Instead , they can turn them into amazing works of art like the ones above .

A heavyweight looking title , but this post is really about nothing more than doing arithmetic .
I 've seen many articles on type level arithmetic .
They all seem to share the idea that the Haskell type system can be made to perform computations by treating types as symbols that can be manipulated according to rules .
But every article I have seen seems to miss the important idea that the naturals do n't have to simply be empty symbols - that they are perfectly good types with elements and that the basic operations of arithmetic have nice a interpretation as functions between types .
Implementing these missing pieces will also give an example of categorification
As usual , some Haskell administration first because this post is runnable Haskell code :
Here are what are commonly called ( some of ) the Peano axioms defining addition and multiplication :
The idea is that S represents the " successor " function maping n to n+1 .
Using just these definitions , and induction , we can define addition and multiplication for all natural numbers .
For example , 3 is represented by SSS0 and 2 by SS0 and we can compute 3+2 using But where do addition and multiplication come from ?
One point of view is that the natural numbers are what we get when we take finite sets but consider sets of the same size to be equal .
We can do the same with finite types .
The typeandboth have two elements ( ignoring bottoms ) and are isomorpic .
We can just consider these to be the same type , called 2 .
Given two typesandwe can form .
The number of elements in this new type is the sum of the number of elements inand .
If we blur the distinction between isomorphic types we can thinkas being the addition operator .
Similarly , can be thought of as multiplication .
The Peano axioms now describe the properties of addition and multiplication defined in this way .
When we consider different types to be equal we lose some information .
In particular , we lose that fact that given two types of the same size , we can construct an explicit isomorphism between them .
But there 's no need to do this .
We can go back to the Peano axioms and reinterpret them as a recipe for constructing the isomorphism .
If we do this , then any theorem we prove ( constructively ) using the Peano axioms can be interpreted as explicitly constructing an isomorphism between types .
We normally just forget about the isomorphism .
This ' forgetting ' is so common that it has a name : decategorification .
Putting the structure back is called categorification
We will represent the natural number n as a type with precisely n elements .
We 'll start with the type representing zero .
Obviously it must have no elements .
It 's traditionally called Thatwill cause no problems as we can never pass an argument intoIfis playing the role of 0 we need something to play the role of S .
That 's .
Given a typeis the type with one more element .
So we can mimic the definitions of the natural numbers : and so on .
I 'll call these the natural number types .
We can also label the elements of these types .
Here are some elements :
Now we can define addition .
We want to be able to take a pair of natural number typesandand construct an explicit isomorphism betweenand a natural number type which I 'll label .
I 'll call the isomorphisms one wayand the other way .
Here 's a suitable type class :
From axiom 1 we want 0+b=b .
This immediately gives :
We can view axiom 2 , Sa+b = S ( a+b ) , as : The implementation ofimplements the mapping of the shaded square directly .
If we ignore the shaded square and consider only the unshaded ones , then we are left with another simpler addition .
We can implement the isomorphism for that by usingrecursively .
Here 's the code : Now we can implement multiplication similarly .
First the type class : Multiplication by zero gives zero .
This is straightforward to implement for the simply reason that we do n't actually have to implement isomorphisms for the empty type :
( That 's not quite true , Haskell , for some reason , forces us to write a line of code that can never be used .
I think this ought to be fixed . )
That 's it .
We 've decategorified type level arithmetic .
Given an equality like 2*3=6 we automatically get an isomorphism likeBut what about more general equation like 2*2+5 = 3*3 ?
Can we automatically construct the isomorphism ?
One approach is simply to reduce each side of the equation to its canonical form , in this case 9 , and then use this to construct a pair of isomorphisms , one from the left hand side to the 9 element natural number type , and one from 9 element natural number type to the right hand side .
We 'll use a type class to indicate that a type can be reduced to canonical form .
The map doing the reduction will be calledis already in canonical form so there 's nothing to do in this case :
If something is of type , andis reducible to canonical form , then we can simply reducein two steps :
Now I give the rule for reducingto canonical form .
We just have to reduceandto canonical form and then applyNow we need to do the same for multiplication .
I 'm beginning to feel sorry for the stress we 're putting the compiler through :
Now using the canonical forms we can build the isomorphism for any equation :
So let 's return to 2*2+5=3* 3 .
The isomorphism should be :
If we 've done our job correctly , the compiler wo n't complain that it can't build the isomorphism .
If you really want you can try running this code for a few values :
Try writing code to implement the inverse , checking that it does give the inverse for these three cases .
So there you have it , categorified arithmetic .
Of course categorifying the naturals is n't so hard .
But what does it mean to categorify the number π?
You 'll have to read some John Baez to find out more .
There sort of is an application of the operations defined above .
The typesay is the type of indices into a three element type .
More generally , these natural number types give indices into fixed length containers and the addition and multiplication operations give type safe ways to map between containers that have the same size .
This could be used to pack n-dimensional fixed size arrays into 1 - dimensional arrays and vice - versa with compile - time checking of array indices .
In practice , however , the compiler would need to be smart enough to realise it could use integers internally rather than the more complex structures it 's probably using .
But it 's curious to see similar operations appear in some OpenCL array manipulation code I 've been playing with .
The code above is n't all that pretty .
As I 've said before : Haskell is two languages .
There 's the value level language and the type level one .
The former is much prettier than the latter , especially if you can use type inference to eliminate the latter .
By the way , you can viewas a command to trigger the Haskell compiler to prove there is an isomorphism between two types of a certain class .
This is very similar to what a tactic in Coq does .
In fact , the code I 've written above is very similar to what a proof in Coq might look like .
The main difference is that Coq gives you a helping hand and can fill in details whereas Haskell forces us to do all of the work ourselves .
When I was still at high school a friend returned to visit after a few months at university .
He 'd been playing with Prolog and showed me how to define Peano arithmetic in that language .
Since then , I 've sort of been obsessed with squeezing Peano arithmetic out of every computational system that can do it .
Hence my C++ code here .
I looked him up on the web and it turns out he also wrote the original BSD automounter .
Small world .
She pointed to herself as an example .
“ In my marriage , I have more education and , because he ’s retired , more income , ” she said .
“ I picked him not because I needed a meal ticket , but because I liked the fact that he respected me and had no problem sharing the responsibilities of daily life with me .
More and more women now are able to make those choices . ”
The changing roles in marriage often are n’t what many couples plan , but instead are a reaction to unexpected financial pressures .
That ’s what happened to Cynthia and Brian Walder of West Springfield , Mass. , who had four children in five years .
Although her first and second pregnancies were carefully planned , a surprise set of twin boys meant that their day care costs would be prohibitive if both parents kept their jobs .
“ Someone had to leave their job and stay home , ” said Ms. Walder , who is 34 .
Her marketing job with an insurance firm provided the family ’s health benefits , so about a year ago , Mr. Walder , a 36 - year - old real estate broker and consultant , opted to stay home .
“ It was stressful , ” he said .
“ If you ’d asked me five years ago would I be in this spot , I ’d say ‘ No way . ’ ”
While it ’s widely believed that a woman ’s financial independence increases her risk for divorce , divorce rates in the United States tell a different story : they have fallen as women have made economic gains .
The rate peaked at 23 divorces per 1,000 couples in the late 1970s , but has since dropped to fewer than 17 divorces per 1,000 couples .
Today , the statistics show that typically , the more economic independence and education a woman gains , the more likely she is to stay married .
And in states where fewer wives have paid jobs , divorce rates tend to be higher , according to a 2009 report from the Center for American Progress .

Sociologists and economists say that financially independent women can be more selective in marrying , and they also have more negotiating power within the marriage .
But it ’s not just women who win .
The net result tends to be a marriage that is more fair and equitable to husbands and wives .
When I was in elementary school , I was a bit of a tom boy .
I spent every recess ignoring the gaggle of girls gathered by the monkey bars in favor of a sweaty game of soccer with the boys .
To me , boys were superior because boys were simple and easy to understand .
To win the respect of a boy , you simply had to run just as fast , throw just as far , and punch just as hard as they did .
With girls , it was a different story .
Girl World is full of subtle manipulations , vague power struggles , and intense mental warfare .
I was brought up to be a very straight forward and honest kid , but in Girl World , the ability to lie well was your greatest asset .
If you could n’t fake concern for a weaker kid one second and then rip her to shreds 10 seconds after she walked away , you could n’t hang with the girls .
So I did n’t .
I hung with the boys .
This worked out beautifully until Junior High rolled around .
It was at this point that the boys started puberty and the practice of having a girl friend they were n’t fucking suddenly became taboo .
So , I was pushed out of the group .
For a couple of days , I was bitter about this , but after much wound licking , I decided to suck it up and make some girlfriends .
The only problem was that I was absolutely clueless on how to go about it .
Fast forward to seventh grade gym class where I witnessed for the first time a group of girls bullying another girl .
The victim was a gawky kid named Kristy who apparently had a pretty ridiculous sounding last name .
Another girl , Wendy , began taunting her because of it and had even managed to convince some of her vicious harpy friends to join in with the name calling .
That ’s how girls bully .
They never confront a victim alone .
They never say a word unless they have a bunch of loud mouth friends behind them backing them up .
They are the worst kind of coward .
To make a long story short , I got up in Wendy ’s face and called her some choice names of my own .
Gawky Kristy was eternally grateful and ended up becoming my first female friend .
The day I told Wendy to shut her fucking pie hole was the last day they ever picked on Kristy .
Instead , they started picking on me .
I cannot stress this point enough , but girls do n’t pick on other girls the same way that boys pick on other boys .
If you want to pick on a boy , you snap him with a wet towel in the locker room .
Or you play keep away with his basketball .
Or you lick your finger and stick it in his ear .
If Wendy had done something like that to me , I would have been better equipped to defend myself .
Instead ,
Wendy gathered her harpy friends around her in a circle so they could whisper and giggle and shoot nasty looks in my direction .
If I approached them , all confidence , and challenged them to say what they had to say about me to my face , they ’d roll their eyes and insist , “ We were n’t even talking about you .
Paranoid much ? ”
But they were .
If I bent over to grab something out of my locker , they ’d oh so accidentally bump into me and knock my head against the metal .
When I turned around , furious , they ’d say , “ Oh SO SORRY !
Did n’t see you standing there ! ” and then they ’d scurry away vainly trying to suppress grins behind their hands .
Wendy did n’t want my lunch money and she could n’t care less about publicly proving her strength to the rest of our peers .
The only goal of Wendy ’s was to totally isolate me from the rest of the girls in my grade .
Wendy wanted to make me into an outcast .
The main goal of Girl Bullying is to completely destroy your self esteem .
It is not enough for girl bullies to convince others that they have gained the upper hand with you .
They want to convince you that you ’re a loser .
They want to use all the people they manipulated into disliking you as evidence that you ’re a failure and a totally unlikable person .
They want you to go home and cry into your pillow and think , “ Wow .
Wendy must be right about me .
Just look at all the people that agree with her . ”
Even then , I realized that most of the people who befriended Wendy only did so because they were afraid of her .
Woman , as a whole , have a really hard time accepting criticism and often mistakenly believe that if the negative spotlight is shining on someone else , no one will notice all the places were they fall short .
The weaker ones almost always attach themselves to someone like Wendy in the hopes that enough ass kissing will ensure that they will never get attacked .
I guess what I ’m trying to communicate with all this long winded philosophizing is that Girl bullies are far more complicated and sophisticated than boy bullies .
And I , having very little experience in that world , had n’t the foggiest clue on how to deal with them .
One day in gym class we got all set to play hockey .
Because of my general aggressiveness when it came to sports , I was chosen to play forward .
Wendy just happened to be the goalie on the other team .
When I picked up my stick , I became determined to score a point against Wendy .
I thought if I could just make her look foolish and weak athletically , then I would ‘ win the war ’ against her and her friends .
Obviously , I was still trying to play by boy rules in Girl World .
I gained control of the puck and headed down the court towards Wendy .
A few feet from the net , I began swinging my stick fiercely .
Wendy was trying her best to block my puck , but she never quite managed to knock it completely out of my control .
I gave up trying to finesse the puck into the net and started swinging my stick harder … trying to score using brute force .
At one point , my stick connected with Wendy ’s shins with a loud smack that echoed in my ears .
Instead of stopping , I swung the stick again and was rewarded with the faint plinking sound of my puck hitting the back of the net .
I stepped back , triumphant , convinced that I had finally gained the upper hand .
Wendy rolled her eyes and smirked at one of her friends .
Suddenly , I realized once and for all that boy rules would never work in Girl World .
If I wanted to beat Wendy , I either had to crush her spirit or steal her boyfriend .
To crush her spirit , I had to play her game .
I had to seek out her past victims and rally them around me .
We would have to rise up , together , and bully her like she had bullied us .
We would have to turn all of her friends against her and make her believe in her own inferiority .
Something like this would be more than effective , but it would take months and I was an impatient young woman .
And Wendy did n’t have a boyfriend to steal .
These two truths hit me simultaneously as I looked into Wendy ’s sneering eyes after I had scored that point in Gym class .
I realized that my aggressive athleticism would n’t be admired and respected in Girl World , but used against me later .
Vicious rumors where my sexuality would be questioned would be my only reward for scoring that point .
I thought to myself , “ Fuck it .
Might as well run with it . ”
Then I threw down my stick and I clocked her .
That morning , God , my gym teacher , and all of my classmates watched in horror as I beat the shit out of Wendy like she was paying me to do it .
Everyone was so shocked by my attack that it was n’t until I started bouncing Wendy ’s head off of the glossy gym floor that someone pulled me off of her .
As my gym teacher and a couple of other girls restrained me , Wendy sat up , backed away from me like a scared animal , rose shakily to her feet , and ran out of the room crying hysterically .
I ended up in a little trouble , but in the end , Wendy never said jack shit to me or about me ever again .
I guess sometimes boy rules do work in Girl World , if you take it far enough .
That happened nearly two decades ago and I ’m not particularly proud of myself for pummeling some girl in seventh grade gym class even if she richly deserved it .
What I am most proud of was that I refrained from playing her game .
Like I said before , I could have ended Wendy ’s bullying by gathering the troops and rallying against her .
Plenty of girl wars have been fought and won that way and until women refuse to be ruled by their insecurities , many more will be fought and won that way in the future .
This is not to say that I am taking the moral high ground or dismissing girl rules as inferior to my own violent tactics .
In the end , bitchiness is bitchiness whether it comes in the form of whispers and giggles or a smack across the face .
All I ’m saying is that the whispers and giggles are not my style .
I am not above being the puppetmaster , I ’m just no good at it .
If I would have fought fire with fire with Wendy , I would have failed and humiliated myself in the process .
So I ’m glad I did it my way .
Generally , if I have something to say to someone , I say it and I ’ll keep saying it even if there is n’t a single person alive willing to ‘ back me up . ’
My intent has never been to systematically ruin someone ’s self esteem and I am not vindictive enough to attempt to make someone into a social outcast .
But kudos to you , if you are .
It takes a certain talent and ambition which I most definitely do not have .
Me ?
It ’s more likely that I ’ll break your nose before I ’ll crush your spirit .
Either that or I ’ll steal your boyfriend .
MAG More info » Review
How many people on the same map ?
February 15th , 2010 by reviewed on PS3 by Justin Snyder
It 's huge !
MAG is a strange beast .
At first , my experience was a frustrating one .
When I booted it up for the first time , joined the Raven PMC and hopped into battle , I realized that this was not your average shooter .
I almost switched the game off entirely .
I am glad I stayed online for a while longer as I have been having quite a lot of fun .
The most notable difference between MAG and its peers is the sheer scale of its online battles .
It does n't really sink in right away but you soon realize just how much more is happening on the battlefield , providing a truly unique experience .
It is not uncommon in games such as Modern Warfare 2 , Halo 3 or even Battlefield : Bad Company to spend more than a minute without encountering anyone besides your teammates .
In MAG , that 's just not the case .
Sure , you sometimes need to run a little ways to get to the center of battle but there are always a few smaller battles in MAG to keep you entertained on its huge maps .
In fact , the maps are so big that there are plenty of flanking opportunities resulting in very dynamic battles .
In suppression mode , even with these large maps , the battle almost always flares up right in the middle with players throwing themselves into the fray with much enthusiasm .
Character
If you have become accustomed to the ever so popular regeneration aspect in shooters , the health concept may throw you off at first .
In MAG , you will need a first aid kit and a quiet place to recover to full health .
It may take a little time to get used to and wo n’t take away from the fun at all .
MAG takes a novel approach to configuring your character ’s load - out .
You are limited to a certain number of “ C’s ” .
Each weapon , attachment , equipment , and armor type has a corresponding number of C’s .
Every player is given 3400 C’s to work with giving you the ability to customize your character to a great extend .
Better yet , this limit is true for all players and keeps the higher level players from getting too strong in terms of equipment .
The game 's leveling system is both simple and straightforward .
Each level gained earns the player one point towards advanced abilities that can be chosen from the game ’s skill tree .
There are multiple branches that essentially allow players to form their own classes .
Some players may like to level up their healing and repair skills in order to play the field support role .
Others may prefer running and gunning and can upgrade their assault rifles and going the direct action route .
While the game does put labels on the different tiers within the skill tree , it is easy for players to create their own amalgam of the classes should they wish .
Voices in the dark
One of MAG ’s best features is its command system .
Sure , many people do n’t like being told what to do but a game like MAG requires a tiered command system .
How else would you okay 128 v. 128 player battles without seeing pure chaos ?
The Squad Leader , Platoon Leader or Officer in Charge can issue orders simply by pulling up the map of the battlefield , moving the cursor to the right spot and hitting the right button .
It is a quick and simple method that is perfect for changing objectives in the heat of battle .
Being a leader comes with a few perks of its own ; Squad Leaders can summon UAV to assess the battlefield and call airstrikes at targeted areas of the maps while Platoon Leaders and the Officer in Charge have the same powers but can call in different kinds of support .
Despite all of the things that the game does right , it is not without problems .
While the command system works well , that does n’t necessarily mean people will follow your orders .
Many people do their own thing and do n’t pay any heed at all to the big picture .
This problem is further amplified by the severe lack of microphones among the PS3 population .
On average , any match I have played had two or three people with headsets out of the eight in a squad .
So it is entirely possible that the squad leader does n’t have a microphone .
For a game that is centered around teamwork and cooperation , that ’s a serious problem .
Rumor has it that Zipper is working on an update that will require the use of headsets .
An interesting idea but I fear the number of players will drop considerably .
From a graphical standpoint , MAG is a little bare .
In order to manage the 256 player battles , Zipper had to make some sacrifices , and graphics was among them .
They are not bad enough to be considered last - generation but they can’t keep up with games such as Modern Warfare 2 or the upcoming Battlefield : Bad Company 2 .
For an online - only shooter , though , the graphics are n’t the biggest concern .
Maybe it had some single - player component , it would matter more .
Not for everyone
For a game that is as large as MAG , it is surprising that I have n’t encountered any lag issues .
I have , however , encountered more than a few glitches , some more problematic than others .
Once I found myself inside a trailer after a medic revived me .
There was no way out and I was stuck until I committed ‘ digital suicide ’ and respawned .
Another issue is how dead bodies are n’t … well , dead .
They keep twitching even after their previous ‘ owner ’ has respawned and is once again fully engaged in the battle .
Glitches aside , MAG is a bundle of fun .
I ca n’t really tell exactly why but whenever I play other shooters now I just feel like something is missing .
It ’s not that the game does anything drastically different but does offer a very complete experience .
For anyone that thoroughly enjoys the online component of their shooters , MAG is a must - try .
I would love to say must - buy but this truly is n’t a game for everyone .
Especially those who do n’t wish to conform to team - based gameplay should give this game a wide berth .
For everyone else , however , I see MAG developing a strong and devoted community who will enjoy a unique online experience .
The Iranian education system has found some particularly creative ways of teaching children about the strategic objectives of the Islamic Republic .
Their pedagogical approach is to hold a celebration in which children launch " missiles " at the Zionist enemy .
Some 650 of such " missiles " were fired at Israel shortly after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called upon his Syrian counterpart Bashar Assad to respond to any Israeli provocation and " to put an end to this once and for all . "
Paper airplane competition , Iranian style
An Iranian internet site reported Monday that a " symbolic " competition was held on the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution .
Hundreds of pupils gathered in order to launch paper airplanes at Israel
Sixteen groups of students from the north of the country competed to launch " missiles " at their bitter enemy from their paper airplanes .
According to the report , the competition was held at the local university in the town of Babolsar , which is in the Mazandaran province .
" We also had a hard time believing it at first after reading the headline , but then we noticed that the article is real , " wrote the Iranian site that reported on the peculiar competition .
by The Narrator
“ Own a flat screen television ?
If not you ’re missing out .
In high definition everything is so clear and real looking … ”
A trendy comment today on movies or TV shows is “ realistic ” .
Over and over I hear this adjective applied to various bits of entertainment as an endorsement of it .
The special effects are “ realistic ” or the fight scenes are “ realistic ” and so on .
I have to wonder , what exactly does it mean to say a movie is realistic ?
If there are writers , actors , directors , editors , pre-production , post production , sound and visual effects companies involved over the course of generally a year and half , what exactly does “ real ” mean in regards to packaged entertainment ?
One example I ’ve heard pointed out is the ubiquitous ‘ blue screen ’ or back - projections employed in films since the 1920 ’s , if not before .
These were most commonly used in scenes where an actor or actress appears to be driving .
Now they are quite obviously in a mock - up of a car in front of a projection of scenery going by .
But does this matter ?
I ’ve read that the reason special effects have improved is that audiences today are more sophisticated than those in past times .
However , is the need to be convinced that a space - ship is realistically rendered in CGI as it dog fights with aliens from Beta reticuli on the planet Zorbom really demonstrative of a sophisticated mindset ?
It may seem an insignificant question but it gets to the heart of the current mentality of many a citizen of The West and their relationship with media .
And it is n’t just in the realm of goofy sci- fi films .
A few years back I was encouraged to see a new James Bond film because , and I quote , “ it ’s not like the old ones .
This one is more grounded and realistic . ”
I ’ve never been much of a James Bond fan but I gave it a shot .
And within the first twenty minutes I witnessed a superhuman comic book character running mile after mile without breaking a sweat , men free - climbing buildings like Spiderman , people jumping to the ground from two stories up ( from atop cranes ) – tuck - roll - then hop up and start running some more .
This was capped off by the hero single - handedly defeating an army of heavily armed soldiers and slipping away during a massive explosion that , though wreaking tremendous damage and knocking everyone to the ground ( save the hero ) , did not appear to harm a hair on anyone ’s head .
Apparently this was “ realistic ” .
Of course , by “ real ” , what the promoters of such “ realness ” mean are that the fake explosions and fake car crashes and fake fight scenes are carefully filmed , edited and detailed in their fakeness .
Thus ‘ details ’ becomes the accepted substitute for authenticity .
When you consider this new drive for , detailed , realistic looking staged - reality you can begin to see how the manufactured existence of an Obama or Palin or Bush jr can happen .
They ’re 100 % fake in their presented personalities and qualities but they ’re more “ realistically ” rendered in their presentation via media .
More than that , they are caricatures of types we ’ve seen in media for the past thirty years .
But they ’re “ more real ” .
Most people know details about them , but nothing of substance .
And if they learn the substance they quickly over look it when a new detail is presented .
Bush , the upper class cheerleader from New England , is presented as the country - bumpkin from Texas , complete with a bible , large belt buckle , plaid shirts , scenes of him cutting up trees with a chainsaw , and an inexplicable southwestern twang in some of his speech .
Palin , the former beauty pageant contestant turned politician , is presented as the embodiment of the “ soccer mom ” despite the obvious fact that her career would naturally diminish her role as a mother .
But we ’ve all seen the “ moose picture ” and know about her down ’s syndrome child .
And Obama .
We ’ve all seen him many times before in movies and tv shows .
He ’s the bad black actor who thinks , clearly enunciating his words while speaking in a monotone voice equates to sounding intelligent .
The one critical detail about him is , of course , that he ’s black .
The tragic part is , for many Americans ( and Westerners in general ) , these glaringly obvious straight - out - of - central - casting archetypes work .
How ?
Most Americans , sadly , do not set down to a movie or any other media and ponder its message .
In fact they see no message , only plot .
Good guys .
Bad Guys .
Cool Guys .
Hot Chicks .
Cool Special Effects .
Good Soundtrack , etc .
That is what American audiences are conscience of when it comes to media .
Unless it is something overt , such as a Michael Moore documentary , most Americans simply do n’t believe propaganda plays much of a part in the sounds and images that are constantly fed to them through music , news , TV , movies and so on .
The notion that writers , producers and directors have an agenda or even specific message that they ’re trying to get across seems downright conspiratorial to most Americans .
In truth , Americans completely lack healthy cynicism .
When Homo americanus looks at art or media he simply sees it as something that is .
Why does Homo americanus believe a particular piece of art or media was created ?
Money , boredom or that somebody just had a talent and expressed it are the three reasons Homo americanus concludes motivates the existence of any given drawing , painting , musical piece , movie , TV show , news program , etc ...
And here is the critical point , without ever pausing and pondering the why ; these Americans will never think to ask about the who that is behind it .
They make no conscience effort to absorb anything other than the surface sheen , or the details .
So if that is sufficiently rendered gloriously “ real ” in CGI , all else is superfluous .
Thus you might hear praise for the accurate ( “ real ” ) rendering of a villain ’s costume in a period film set in 1345 yet the fact that he is speaking modern English , complete with 21st century attitude and vernacular , is irrelevant .
“ Real ” today is a surface quality reflecting whichever face is staring into it .
Which means “ real ” is always present tense .
As such , the past is never authentic unless filtered through the present conception ( sheen ) of “ real ” .
Along with this comes the adjoining recent trend in media of questioning identity as it relates to memory .
From ‘ Blade Runner ’ to ‘ Total Recall ’ , from ‘ Fight Club ’ to ‘ Memento ’ identity and memory ( and how they are interconnected ) are recurring themes in modern cinema .
And in all of such examples the hero must finally , in the story ’s climax , make a choice in what he accepts as real .
Inevitably he chooses what he thinks will make him happy in the present .
“ Real ” for this modern hero is always and only the now , as the past is uncertain , unknowable and ultimately insignificant .
Needless to say ( for the modern hero ) , so is the future .
With that in mind , topics such as national / ethnic identity , racial reality , the holocaust , third world immigration , non-White crime rates , quality of life , education and so on have no relation to facts .
If the holocaust is “ real ” now , that ’s all that matters .
If the details ( even if they are 100 % engineered and fake ) have a sharp , clear resolution in the imagery they present , they are approvingly accepted as “ real ” .
In fact the holocaust fits the example of ‘ details ’ over facts quite nicely .
Most people who unquestionably believe in it know very little of the facts .
But the artificial , media generated , details ; piles of cloths , cattle cars , ominous smoke rising from chimneys and so on are embedded in their thoughts without context or the potential to examine their genuineness .
Or , how many people look past the unprecedented damage done by Third World migration because they are immersed in media created ‘ details ’ .
“ Good ol ’ Pedro walks around his quaint little abode where he collects elephant statues , listens to instrumental guitar records on an old player he rescued from a junk yard and keeps the letter his wife sent him three days before the car accident tucked in his tattered shirt pocket next to his heart . ”
You ask , “ How did Pedro get here ?
What effect has his presence had on the community ?
And what will be the long term consequences ? ”
Mr. Detail ’s answers , “ Who knows , who cares ?
The guy collects elephant statues for crying out loud !
He ’s a ‘ real ’ person ! ”
These “ it looks real ” people are in a house that is on fire .
Yet they set undisturbed in front of their televisions , enraptured at images of fake fire - fighters fighting fake fires .
For them , the authentic world has ceased to exist .
In their minds , when they reach the pearly gates , St. Peter will greet them with the question , “ Was it real for you ? ”
Perhaps , in the end , media is more like a hallucinogenic drug then some believe .
The desire to escape into an ever more “ realistic ” looking fantasy world can be very addictive .
And , like all unhealthy addictions , ultimately destructive .
Both to the addicts and to those around them .
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a draft plan last April to halt all exports of heavy rare earths , partly on environmental grounds and partly to force other countries to buy manufactured products from China .
When the plan was reported on Sept. 1 , Western governments and companies strongly objected and Ms. Wang announced on Sept. 3 that China would not halt exports and would revise its overall plan .
But the ministry subsequently cut the annual export quota for all rare earths by 12 percent , the fourth steep cut in as many years .
Congress responded to the Chinese moves by ordering the Defense Department to conduct a comprehensive review , by April 1 , of the American military ’s dependence on imported rare earths for devices like night - vision gear and rangefinders .
Western users of heavy rare earths say that they have no way of figuring out what proportion of the minerals they buy from China comes from responsibly operated mines .
Licensed and illegal mines alike sell to itinerant traders .
They buy the valuable material with sacks of cash , then sell it to processing centers in and around Guangzhou that separate the rare earths from each other .
Companies that buy these rare earths , including a few in Japan and the West , turn them into refined metal powders .
“ I do n’t know if part of that feed , internal in China , came from an illegal mine and went in a legal separator , ” said David Kennedy , the president of Great Western Technologies in Troy , Mich. , which imports Chinese rare earths and turns them into powders that are sold worldwide .
Smuggling is another issue .
Mr. Kennedy said that he bought only rare earths covered by Chinese export licenses .
But up to half of China ’s exports of heavy rare earths leave the country illegally , other industry executives said .
Zhang Peichen , deputy director of the government - backed Baotou Rare Earth Research Institute , said that smugglers mix rare earths with steel and then export the steel composites , making the smuggling hard to detect .
The process is eventually reversed , frequently in Japan , and the rare earths are recovered .
Chinese customs officials have stepped up their scrutiny of steel exports to try to stop this trick , one trader said .

Special By By Carol Forsloff Feb 19 , 2010 in Politics Michael Steele says $ 1 million is n't much money for Republicans .
But is that statement true for most middle - class Americans ?
While Joe the Plumber has second thoughts about his support of John McCain , Scott Lumry is concerned about the Republican 's lack of understanding about state of the middle class .
Scott Lumry , age 52 , is a businessman / carpenter in Natchitoches , Louisiana .
He owns a modest bed and breakfast and is a construction worker who works as an independent contractor , helping to renovate homes in the region around Natchitoches .
He said to Digital Journal in response to Steel 's remarks , " I have calculated it would take me 502 years to save $ 1 million at the current rate of discretionary income I have after expenses . "
These are hard times for Lumry , as he mentioned they are for other business owners in Natchitoches .
He said , " Hard times are coming to this town .
Last year I made probably about $ 8000 , and my expenses consisted of utilities specifically for that portion of the income for bed and breafast guests and my work as a contract laborer , renovating houses .
My bottom line last year was $ 2000 .
I am able to eat because I can write off meals against the bed and breakfast costs , since I help cook and serve the meals and interact with guests .
I have looked at the want ads for jobs and see there are n't any .
I can't teach part - time at the University anymore because their budget has been cut by 40 % .
They have had to significantly reduce staff .
I do n't know what I would do without a partner . "
Lumry 's significant other is nearly 80 and retired with a modest income .
Lumry went on to explain how he is seeing signs of hard times in Natchitoches .
For awhile , people thought they would escape the worst of the recession because the town has a diversified economy with tourism , several large businesses and tourism , according to Lumry .
Natchitoches is the town where the movie " Steel Magnolias " was filmed , and folks come from all over the country to visit the town and the beautiful homes along the river and on the streets of Natchitoches that represent scenes in the film .
In addition , Natchitoches is a historic town , as it is the oldest town in the Louisiana Purchase .
So people interested in history visit Natchitoches for research and to see the great historical artifacts and architecture that can be found in the area .
Natchitoches is also a town known the world over for its Christmas lights , so the entire month of December , and part of November and January , are devoted to Christmas offerings .
Add to this the fact Natchitoches is called by some folks " Little New Orleans " because of its Creole people , its river - lake that runs through town , and its great food and jazz , and you have a place with lots of appeal .
But with all of that , there are signs of trouble ahead , according to Lumry , who knows about that because of his dedicated interest in tourism and the economy , having been on a number of boards and committees in Natchitoches over the ten years he has lived in the town .
According to Lumry , the signs of economic difficulty in Natchitoches started in 2009 .
Lumry noticed " guests were dropping off and tourism was down . "
He also interacts with landlords who are renovating properties and hears from tenants who are concerned about jobs .
People , he said , are worried .
Lumry struggles these days to stay ahead and reminds folks who think $ 1 million is n't a lot of money , that ordinary Americans do n't have that type of income or savings and with the present problems may never be able to save even close to that amount .
As a diabetic who does n't qualify for Medicare since he is only 52 years of age , Lumry has to pay the costs of insulin out of his pocket , which is $ 126 / month at the cheapest pharmacy in Natchitoches .
He faces additional costs of doctor visits and other supplementary aids .
Furthermore he has construction overhead , taxes , vehicle expenses , cost of tools and miscellaneous other costs that leave him with virtually nothing at the end of the year .
Digital Journal asked Lumry what he would do if the government gave 3 % like Dr. Tom Loudatt , an economist interviewed by Digital Journal earlier this month had advised .
Lumry is one of those middle Americans who declares he is worried about the future and reminds people he is one among many with similar problems , if not far worse right now .
He laughs at the idea that $ 1 million is n't much money at the end of the interview and said , " $ 1 million may not be a lot for some people but not for guys like me and middle class business owners with expenses . "
If things economically get much worse , as Loudatt declared they might become , what will happen to Lumry and the ordinary folks in small towns across the country who have little money in reserve for hard times , especially if those hard times come sooner than government leaders are willing to admit .
It 's certainly true , according to facts on CNN and the interview with Lumry , that $ 1 million is a great deal of money for the average American these days .
Steele , the Republican Party Chairman , was quoted by CBS news declaring recently that $ 1 million was n't much money to Republicans .
Steele made the comment during a debate in Little Rock with Democrat Harold Ford Jr. , who is potentially a Senate candidate for New York .
At the time , Steele and Ford were talking about President Obama 's plan to let tax cuts lapse for families making more than $ 250,000 .
But for folks like middle class Scott Lumry in Natchitoches , Louisiana $ 1 million is is a lot of money .
While Joe the Plumber has second thoughts about his support of John McCain , Scott Lumry is concerned about the Republican 's lack of understanding about state of the middle class .
Scott Lumry , age 52 , is a businessman / carpenter in Natchitoches , Louisiana .
He owns a modest bed and breakfast and is a construction worker who works as an independent contractor , helping to renovate homes in the region around Natchitoches .
He said to Digital Journal in response to Steel 's remarks , " I have calculated it would take me 502 years to save $ 1 million at the current rate of discretionary income I have after expenses . "
The facts are , according to CNN Money , that the average 52 - year - old man has a net worth of about $ 98,350 .
At Lumry 's income post expenses his net worth would be under $ 2000 .
The total net worth of the average America at age 65 is less than what the level of income Obama wants to tax for a single year .
In other words , it takes a lifetime of work for most Americans to earn $ 250,000 .
These are hard times for Lumry , as he mentioned they are for other business owners in Natchitoches .
He said , " Hard times are coming to this town .
Last year I made probably about $ 8000 , and my expenses consisted of utilities specifically for that portion of the income for bed and breafast guests and my work as a contract laborer , renovating houses .
My bottom line last year was $ 2000 .

Add to this the fact Natchitoches is called by some folks " Little New Orleans " because of its Creole people , its river - lake that runs through town , and its great food and jazz , and you have a place with lots of appeal .
But with all of that , there are signs of trouble ahead , according to Lumry , who knows about that because of his dedicated interest in tourism and the economy , having been on a number of boards and committees in Natchitoches over the ten years he has lived in the town .
According to Lumry , the signs of economic difficulty in Natchitoches started in 2009 .
Lumry noticed " guests were dropping off and tourism was down . "
He also interacts with landlords who are renovating properties and hears from tenants who are concerned about jobs .
People , he said , are worried .
Lumry struggles these days to stay ahead and reminds folks who think $ 1 million is n't a lot of money , that ordinary Americans do n't have that type of income or savings and with the present problems may never be able to save even close to that amount .
As a diabetic who does n't qualify for Medicare since he is only 52 years of age , Lumry has to pay the costs of insulin out of his pocket , which is $ 126 / month at the cheapest pharmacy in Natchitoches .
He faces additional costs of doctor visits and other supplementary aids .
Furthermore he has construction overhead , taxes , vehicle expenses , cost of tools and miscellaneous other costs that leave him with virtually nothing at the end of the year .
Digital Journal asked Lumry what he would do if the government gave 3 % like Dr. Tom Loudatt , an economist interviewed by Digital Journal earlier this month had advised .
headed for trouble .
During a follow - up interview , Loudatt recommended everyone be given 3 % interest , which would allow ordinary people like Lumry to survive .
Lumry agreed it would help a great deal .
He said , " This is what I would do with 3 % interest .
I would buy more tools I need and things for the van I use to drive to jobs .
I would use my credit cards more because I would n't be afraid of the interest being so high that I could n't pay them off .
I would buy more and save some .
It would help me a lot .
" Lumry is one of those middle Americans who declares he is worried about the future and reminds people he is one among many with similar problems , if not far worse right now .
He laughs at the idea that $ 1 million is n't much money at the end of the interview and said , " $ 1 million may not be a lot for some people but not for guys like me and middle class business owners with expenses .
"
If things economically get much worse , as Loudatt declared they might become , what will happen to Lumry and the ordinary folks in small towns across the country who have little money in reserve for hard times , especially if those hard times come sooner than government leaders are willing to admit .
It 's certainly true , according to facts on CNN and the interview with Lumry , that $ 1 million is a great deal of money for the average American these days .

The FBI has opened a criminal investigation into the case of Lower Merion school officials spying its on students at home via notebook webcams , an FBI source said .
The source says the investigation will probe whether the school officials broke federal wiretap or computer - intrusion laws .
A class action lawsuit filed on Feb. 11 claims a teen was confronted with photographic evidence of him engaging in " improper behavior " at home by a school official .
Blake Robbins , a Harriton High School sophomore , says Assistant Principal Lindy Matsko spied on him using the webcam in his school - issued notebook computer , according to the suit .
The district claims they do have to right to access the webcams at any time , but say they only use the feature to locate lost computer .
Students and parents , who 've dubbed the case WebcamGate , say they were never told about the webcam activation feature , a claim the district admits .
The feature has since been disabled .
The webcams were activated 42 times in the past 14 months to find lost or stolen computers , officials said .
The district says it never used the cameras to spy on its students , but a new statement by a district spokesperson is raising questions .
Only two IT department employees were authorized to turn the cameras on , spokesperson Doug Young told the AP .
So now , many are wondering how Matsko allegedly got access .
As many as 1,800 Lower Merion School District students from Lower Merion and Harriton High Schools were given the MacBook notebooks as part of a school program .
The suit was filed on behalf of all of the students participating in the program in addition to Robbins .
Other students claim they 've seen their webcam go live while off school grounds and worry they 've been spied on too .
“ Occasionally a green light would go on , on your computer which would kind of give you the feeling that somebody ’s watching you , ” Harriton High School student Drew Scheier told NBC Philadelphia Thursday .
In addition to the FBI , the Montgomery County district attorney is also looking into whether evidence warrants an investigation .

I do n’t know what my butcher ’s political beliefs are , and I do n’t want to know .
I pay him for his services and we are both happy .
I want the same arrangement with my entertainers .
If my butcher constantly mocked my values , I ’d soon take my business elsewhere .
Yet Hollywood regularly mocks conservative values .
Me – and a lot of other conservatives in America – are ready to take our business elsewhere .
The entertainment industry ’s depictions of various characters and values add up to one message : Conservatives are bad for our country .
What does that teach our children about respecting the right to hold dissenting opinions ?
When I watch TV , I often cringe at the thought of how many people do n’t know they ’re being sold a philosophy under the guise of entertainment .
Some of it is subtle , such as the passing comment on “ Lie to Me ” about torture at Guantanámo .
Some is blatant , like the pro-liberal values on “ Boston Legal , ” or when “ Saturday Night Live ” or another comedy show makes below - the - belt fun of a conservative one time too many .
Look at the way business is portrayed : Hollywood would have us believe that all big businesses are run by heartless men who would kill us with their dangerous products and pollution if they had a chance , all for the sake of earning money .
Drug companies selling overpriced and dangerous drugs , oil companies destroying the environment , banks ripping us off , and manufacturers exploiting workers , all hiding behind high - priced lawyers have become clichés on modern dramas .
When was the last time TV showed big businesses doing what they normally do : give millions to charity , invent groundbreaking products , and create thousands of new jobs ?
Hollywood behaves as if we need television characters to protect us from the very businesses that employ us .
Consider TV comedies .
How often do you see liberals being made fun of , as opposed to conservatives ?
Think about what you have heard recently on Jay Leno , David Letterman , Conan O’ Brien , and Jimmy Kimmel about Sarah Palin .
Mainstream comedians attack her incessantly .
Notice that their jokes are not usually about her positions , but rather they are personal – meant to make a laughingstock out of her .
These comedians are molding a public opinion of Palin that insists she is stupid , ignorant , unsophisticated , and dangerous .
Try to recall a comparable barrage of spiteful jokes at the expense of other vice - presidential candidates like Joe Lieberman or Joe Biden – it ’s not as easy .
It was n’t always this way .
Comedians of old , such as Bob Hope , made fun of politicians , but he included both sides .
Dick Van
Dyke also stayed light - hearted .
It ’s become normal for conservatives to be portrayed poorly : On “ Boston Legal ” the main character , Denny Crane , was a composite of just about every negative stereotype of a conservative : he sexually harassed women , carried a gun , and was oblivious to his ignorance .
Alec Baldwin ’s conservative character on “ 30 Rock ” has similar undesirable qualities .
Furthermore , Hollywood has taken to developing and lauding bad characters with “ good ” qualities , like the meth - dealing father on “ Breaking Bad , ” the likable mob boss on the “ Sopranos , ” or the pot - selling mother on “ Weeds . ”
That is essentially an open attack on the conservative belief that there is right and wrong , because it promotes relativism .
Does n’t Hollywood realize that a chunk of their customers are conservatives ?
Do n’t get me wrong , there is balanced entertainment out there : A good example is “ 24 . ”
Even though the series is often caricatured as a conservative show , it ’s actually quite balanced .
The hero , Jack Bauer , seems to be conservative , though thankfully you ca n’t be too sure who he would vote for because his politics are not discussed .
The writers use his character to point out the failings of the liberal characters but they also use it to point out the failings of conservatives .
The producers seem to understand that while viewers enjoy edgy , they do n’t necessarily need or want to see lopsided jabs at liberals and conservatives , they simply want unbiased entertainment .
Unfortunately more and more entertainment is offensive .
Bias , no matter which way it is directed , harms both liberals and conservatives and anyone in between .
Just as we would stop doing business with a butcher who consistently and purposely offended us , we must likewise stop doing business with networks that do the same .
Before boycotting TV , which might not be all that practical , viewers should pay attention to the types of messages that get pushed through seemingly innocuous channels and vote with our clicker .
Another practical step we can take is to send e-mails to the networks and express dissatisfaction when you see bias .
Until we let them know that we want and value balance in entertainment , it will be more of the same .
We have to let Hollywood know that by moving from entertaining to promoting a political philosophy , it has forsaken its customers .
We can help change that .

Caponizing Set

C A P O N S BEST AGE FOR CAPONIZING
Birds are just right for caponizing , as a rule , from six weeks to three months old .
LEGHORNS , ANCONAS , and MEDITERRANEANS , should weigh about one pound .
ROCKS , WYANDOTTES , REDS , and other AMERICANS , are right when they weigh one pound and a half to two pounds .
BRAHMAS , COCHINS , ORPINGTONS , and all ASIATICS , should be caponized when they weigh from one and a half pounds to three pounds .
Fig. 1
Shows the bird with the wings and the legs tied .
The hooks on the weights attached and so stretched out ready for the cut .
The clear area and the line shows the proper location for the cut between the last two ribs as shown in Figure ( A ) .
PREPARATION
Confine the birds for two nights and a day in cool dark quarters , giving NO FOOD OR WATER during this time .
Arrange A BARREL OR SMALL BOX at the right height for easy working , out in the open where it is in the DIRECT SUNLIGHT .
If you wish to work indoors a lamp with a reflector , an ELECTRIC LIGHT OR SMALL DRY - CELL SPOT LIGHT IS EXCELLENT , as the light can be thrown right down into the cut .
If you have a light of this sort you can work anywhere , any time .
PRACTICE ON A DEAD BIRD FIRST .
Kill a fryer , then carry out all the steps of caponizing just the same as if the bird were alive .
This will give you the hang of the work better than all the reading you can do .
Fig. 2
Shows the cut opened up by means of the spreader and the membrane over the bowels is now in view .
Stab this membrane close up to the chick 's back with the tissue forceps closed and tightly pressed together .
CATCH THE BIRD
TIE ITS TWO WINGS TOGETHER over its back passing the cord around the first joint of the wing .
TIE THE LEGS TOGETHER then place the chick on its side with its BREAST TOWARD YOU , on the barrel top where you wish to work .
Slip ONE HOOK , with its attached brick , over the tie of the wings , slip THE OTHER HOOK , with its brick , over the tie on the legs .
From a half to a whole brick is the right weight , depending upon the size of the bird .
Be sure that the bird is well stretched out .
Pull out the feathers from the chick 's side just in front of the thigh and below the back ( see Fig. 1 ) .
Wipe off this spot with a little clean water , Lysol , carbolic acid , or any weak antiseptic solution .
NOW FEEL WITH THE RING OR INDEX FINGER OF THE LEFT HAND AND LOCATE THE SPACE between the LAST TWO RIBS ; then with the fingers pull the skin down from the head over the flesh as far as possible toward the tail of the chicken when the skin is pulled down as far as possible .
Fig. 3
Shows the opening in the membrane enlarged by allowing the tissue - forceps to spring apart , note the testicle showing in the opening .
Be gentle , slow and firm in all movements .
Place the knife on the skin over the space between the last two ribs .
BEAR DOWN and make a cut between the last two ribs about an inch long , going down between the ribs .
Hold the skin back and INSERT THE SPREADER CLOSED , between the cut edges of the skin and ribs .
Open the spreader so that the ends are from a half to three - quarters of an inch apart .
Slide the hook on the spreader up so that it holds the spreader open at just the distance you wish .
Now the membrane covering the bowels appears in the cut as shown in Fig.
2 .
Now take the TISSUE FORCEPS , with the two prongs tight together push it through the membrane in the upper part of the cut ( Fig. 2 ) .
Allow the two prongs to separate by the natural spring of the instrument , thus enlarging the hole in the membrane ( Fig. 3 ) .
If the opening is not large enough now tear it larger if necessary , by catching the edge of the opening in the membrane with the Tissue Forceps and tearing it as much as needed .
The testicle now shows in the upper part of the cut , right on the chick 's back with the red kidney behind it and the darker yellow adrenal gland at the upper point of the testicle .
Fig. 4
Shows the membrane all torn away and the bowel pushed down out of the way .
The testicle shows plainly now on the chick 's back and is ready to be threaded through the eye of the elevator .
The testicle itself is a long , yellow , bean - like body of a very light color .
TAKE THE ELEVATOR INSTRUMENT in hand .
Hold it lightly like a pen , put it down into the cut pointing it toward the chick 's head .
Be gentle , slow and firm in all movements .
THREAD THE TESTICLE ( Fig. 5 ) through the eye of the elevator from the head of the bird towards the tail - no force is necessary to do this .
If any force is necessary the testicle is not going on properly and the direction should be changed .
After , at most , one or two trys the testicle slips on .
The testicle should be threaded on the elevator from the tail of the bird to the head on the right side .
When the testicle is completely threaded onto the elevator and the butt of the elevator is visible at the end of the testicle ( Fig. 5 - B ) the elevator should be pulled toward you and twisted .
CONTINUE TWISTING AND ELEVATING at the same time that you twist , never let up elevating keep
Fig. 5
Shows the elevator being slipped on to the testicle , from the head of the chick to the tail usually , but from tail to head will work , by threading it through the eye of the instrument .
( Patent Pending )
pulling ALL the TIME .
This will gradually bring the testicle up out of the cut and also twists the blood vessels attaching it to the back into a cord which can now be cut with the scissors or knife as shown in Fig.
6 .
If , when the testicle is partly elevated , it seems to be coming sort if hard with the TISSUE FORCEPS , you can grasp the membranes immediately below the elevator and then pull up on them with this direct grasp .
This trick gives you a better grip on the membranes .
Once in a while the testicle will be pulled off of its cord and will drop back among the bowels .
If this happens the testicle should be picked up by using the Tissue Forceps .
If the birds are a trifle old and the testicles larger it is best to thread the testicle on from
Fig. 5 - A Shows in diagram the testicle being threaded into the elevator .
Usually you begin at the head of the chick and thread from head to tail , elevate and loosen up the head of the testicle .
Remove the elevator and then thread from the tail to the head and complete the elevation in this way .
( Patent Pending )
head to tail ; elevate enough to loosen up the head end of the testicle , then remove the elevator and thread it onto the testicle again from the tail to the head this time and complete the removal .
Now remove the spreader and allow the cut to close up .
You can take one or two stitches to close the cut if you wish to , using an ordinary large sewing needle and black thread .
These threads do not need to be removed .
TO REMOVE THE OTHER TESTICLE turn the chick over on the other side and proceed exactly as you did on the first side .
AFTER CARE
Confine the chicks and feed soft light food for two days and then they can be allowed to run .
Occasionally the region of the cut puffs out , a so - called WIND - PUFF .
The thin skin covering the puff should be stuck with a
Fig. 5 - B Shows in diagram the testicle completely threaded into the elevator ready to be twisted , elevated and removed .
Note that you can see the butt of the elevator beyond the end of the testicle .
Conditions are now right to pull up and turn .
You can make from one to three or four complete turns pulling up steadily all the time .
( Patent Pending )
sharp - pointed knife or a thread on a large cambric needle may be passed through the skin covering the puff and the thread tied tightly .
It is not necessary to remove the thread .
If the puff comes back repeat .
CARE OF TOOLS
When through using the instruments soak them in cold water till all blood and dirt is removed .
Wipe them dry and then coat them with a little vaseline , and they will keep bright indefinitely .
Fig. 6
Shows the testicle after it has been threaded , twisted and elevated out of the chick 's body .
The attachments of the testicle to the body have been twisted into a cord and are now ready to be cut by knife or scissors .

NAIROBI , Kenya —
A radical Muslim cleric jailed in Britain for inciting racial hatred and soliciting murder was deported by Kenya Thursday .
The action is part of the Kenyan government 's effort to prevent Al Qaeda or other extremist Muslim groups from operating in this country .
Kenya ’s Anti-Terrorist Police Unit arrested Sheikh Abdullah al - Faisal as he left evening prayers at a mosque close to Mombasa last Thursday .
He was held by authorities and was been in legal limbo as Kenya has sought to act on its own deportation order .
“ He is persona non grata here in Kenya , ” said government spokesman Alfred Mutua .
Because there are no direct flights to al - Faisal ’s home country of Jamaica he would have to transit through a European country , but none were willing to have him , even in transit .
The solution was found when Gambia agreed to have al - Faisal in transit enroute to Jamaica .
On Thursday al - Faisal left Jomo Kenyatta International Airport outside Nairobi on a flight to Gambia .
Sheikh Abdullah al - Faisal , Feb. 24 , 2003 .
( Ian Waldie / Reuters )
Al - Faisal entered Kenya overland from Tanzania on Dec. 24 to continue a lecture tour that had already taken him to Nigeria , Angola , Swaziland , Mozambique , Malawi and Tanzania .
His firebrand speeches inciting violence against non-believers had already gotten him locked up and then deported from Britain , his adopted home .
In 2003 al - Faisal was jailed by British authorities for seven years after being convicted of inciting his followers to kill Christians , Hindus , Jews and Westerners and for encouraging them to use chemical weapons against their enemies .
One of the suicide bombers who detonated devices in London in July 2007 had attended the south London mosque where al - Faisal was imam , as had Richard Reid , the " shoe bomber " who botched an attempt to blow up a trans -Atlantic flight .
Al - Faisal was released early from jail in 2007 and subsequently deported to his home country of Jamaica .
The 45 - year old father of four was born Trevor William Forest in St James , Jamaica .
He was nicknamed " Dictionary " because of his learned vocabulary .
His parents were Salvation Army officers and he was raised as a Christian , but when he was 16 he went to Saudi Arabia where is believed to have spent eight years and became a Muslim .
He took a degree in Islamic studies in Riyadh before moving to Britain in the early 1980s .
Al - Faisal 's arrest in Kenya has been seen by some Islamic leaders as another example of anti-Muslim discrimination in the name of fighting terrorism .
Immigration minister Gerald Kajwang denied targeting Muslims saying this was “ not a religious matter ” and referring to al - Faisal ’s “ history of criminality ” and alleged terrorist links .
“ We are not deporting him because he is a Muslim .
We are deporting him because of his terrorist history and the fact that he is on the international watch - list , ” Kajwang told the Daily Nation newspaper .
Al - Amin Kimathi , executive coordinator of Kenya ’s Muslim Human Rights Forum condemned the arrest , detention and deportation of al - Faisal .
“ The whole process infringes his human rights .
There are charges that he has links to terrorism but no evidence .
There is no proven crime committed in Kenya , ” he said .
Kimathi drew parallels with documented cases of " rendition " in early 2007 .
In December 2006 the U.S. backed an Ethiopian invasion of Somalia in order to oust a home - grown Islamist regime that had taken charge there .
Immediately after the invasion at least 90 individuals were transported from Kenya to Ethiopian authorities in Somalia , according to reports by Human Rights Watch and Kimathi ’s own organization .
All were accused of having terrorist links .
“ Al - Faisal ’s arrest is part of the Kenyan government ’s paranoia and its desire to please the U.S. and Britain , ” said Kimathi .
America and Britain are Kenya ’s two biggest foreign donors .
“ The government of Kenya is very over - zealous in carrying out the wishes of America , ” he charged .
On - message actions such as swiftly deporting those seen as undesirable by Washington or allowing the U.S. to base special forces in Kenya ( for example , at Manda Bay close to the resort island of Lamu ) helps curry favor and , Kenya ’s government may calculate , could help dampen America ’s outspoken criticism of the Kenyan government ’s own problems with corruption , human rights and rule of law .
The threat of Muslim extremism in Kenya is nevertheless very real .
Two hundred and twenty five people were killed and hundreds more injured in the August 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Nairobi and neighboring Tanzania by Al Qaeda .
In November 2002 a suicide bombing destroyed part of an Israeli - owned hotel in Mombasa killing 13 people .
At the same time there was a failed attempt to shoot down a Tel Aviv - bound plane with surface - to - air missiles .
The man allegedly behind the Mombasa attacks and linked to the embassy bombings , 30 - year old Kenyan citizen Saleh Ali Saleh Naban , was assassinated in September by U.S. Special Forces during a helicopter raid into southern Somalia .
The threat is not over .
Last month Kenyan police , backed by the paramilitary General Service Unit , made a rare appearance in the Nairobi suburb of Eastleigh , nicknamed Little Mogadishu .
They rounded up 300 Somalis acting on intelligence reports that Islamist fighters from Somalia were taking refuge in the enclave .
It is thought some of those arrested were fleeing members of the Hisbul Islam opposition group that has lost a number of recent battles in southern Somalia against its on / off Islamist ally Al Shabaab , believed to have links to Al Qaeda .
For the most part Kenyan security is invisible in Eastleigh which , with its radical madrasas and mosques , its thriving business community and growing refugee population , is becoming a fertile recruiting ground for Al Shabaab as well as a valuable source of funding .
Analysts say that were a group such as Al Shabaab to carry out a terrorist attack in Kenya it would backfire .
“ Al Shabaab recognises Kenya as strategic , ” explained Rashid Abdi , Somalia analyst at the International Crisis Group in Nairobi .
“ There are funds here and they recruit here , recruits from London , Denmark , the U.S. pass through here , so Nairobi is a rear base for them . ”
Abdi said that an attack would result in a backlash that might shut down all of the existing networks .
In the meantime al - Faisal ’s fate remains uncertain with Kenya ’s twitchy government keen to have him off its hands but no country seemingly willing to help out .
Editor 's note :
This piece was updated to show that al - Faisal was deported from Kenya on Thursday , January 7 .
A. Getting good people is 100 times more difficult than conventional wisdom says .
The fact is , you ’re going to deal with a lot of mediocre people , no matter how hard you try .
You have got to have a system in place to check on how they ’re doing .
If someone says , “ I ’m going to deliver $ 2 million in sales in the first six months , ” you have to follow that every day .
Like Ronald Reagan said , trust but verify .
We actually have a button that ’s says .
“ I ’m a control freak and proud of it . ”
Q. Tell me about being a control freak .
A. I have an extensive control system .
I can tell you right now how many sales have been made today with new clients .
I can tell you what our bank balances were this morning , how much line of credit I ’ve used , how many people were in the recruiting class we ’re having two weeks from now .
I have a very strong view that you should be carefully monitoring  and intervene early rather than late when you see something going off track .
Q . You tell business owners to forget about being likable .
Is there something wrong with employees liking you ?
A . You have to treat your people with respect .
If they have a personal problem , you have to help them through it .
You have to follow the law .
But we also need to get things done as asked .
The abandonment of that principle is a large factor in the failure of small businesses to achieve real profitability .
Q . Do business owners coddle their people too much ?
A . The concept that if you love your employees they ’ll perform is on the edge of insanity .
It ’s not that you want to hurt your employees , but you have a mission .
You ’re paid to produce results .
Q. Can your employees talk back to you or say , “ Sorry , boss , but that ’s a stupid idea ? ”
A . We actually did a survey around Christmas of their attitudes toward the company .
Two - thirds of them thought the company was changing for the better .
We let them write any comments they had .
One guy that worked for me for 10 years wrote , “ If I fell dead at my desk , George would n’t notice for two days . ”
Sure , we let them talk back .
We like to listen , but you can only listen so much and then you have to make a choice .
Q . What ’s your view of fear as a management tool ?
A. Fear is the best motivator .
Q. Are you a tyrant ?
A. I ’m sure many people would view me as difficult .
If I ask you to do something and you say , “ Geez , I do n’t have enough time to do that . ”
Well , maybe I do n’t have enough time to sign your check this week .
Only a few hours left to Double your gift
Transcript of Sen. Lindsey Graham ’s ( R - S.C. ) remarks today at the “ Business Advocacy Day for Jobs , Climate & New Energy Leadership ” in Washington D.C .
Thanks y’all .
Thank you .
Hey everybody .
It ’s always good to be introduced by someone that can vote for you — just sounds better .
Joe comes to every event I ’ve ever had in South Carolina and he is on message with intellectual property and energy .
But to the South Carolina folks — thanks for coming up .
Appreciate all the taxes you pay .
Sorry about how we ’re spending it .
That ’s applies to everybody by the way .
I am here from the federal government and I ’m here to help you .
You ’re supposed to laugh .
Well anyway , I do n’t where we are going as a nation on a lot of issues .
I know where we should be going , and that ’s why we ’re here right ?
We seem to be going at a snail ’s pace on all the things that really matter .
And finding common ground on hard big issues is not unknown to business , to families or to politicians .
But eventually you have got to do something , because time is not on your side .
When it comes to social security and medicare reform , and the big entitlement programs , the baby boomers are retiring in droves .
When I was born in 1955 there were 16 workers for every Social Security retiree .
How many are there today ?
Three right ?
Two in 20 years .
You know guys like me are the problem — I do n’t have any kids .
We have to come to grips with the fact that the demographic changes in America are real and Medicare , Social Security , and Medicaid are $ 51 trillion underfunded when you add them all up .
That ’s not going to get solved just by arguing with each other .
We ’ve got to find a pathway forward on entitlement reform .
I just mention that as one issue on the economic side — long - term indebtedness that has to be addressed — only going to be solved when Democrats and Republicans come together we all say it , all 100 of us , we never seem to be able to accomplish much beyond saying it .
On the jobs side , we ’re at 12 percent unemployment in South Carolina hardest hit that I can remember in my lifetime .
Manufacturing in our state has really been hit hard .
The textile industry that I grew up knowing and being around my whole life has really been hit .
I ca n’t promise South Carolinians or people from Michigan or any other place that we can build a wall around America and that these jobs are not going to leave .
But I can promise you there is a way to create jobs back here at home .
One of the ways to create jobs back here at home is to become energy independent and clean up the environment .
That is the best way .
[ Applause ]
This is so logical it is scary .
[ Laughter ]
Maybe that ’s the biggest flaw with it , it just makes too much sense .
It sounds too good to be true .
We send $ 1 billion a day overseas to buy oil , sometimes from countries that do not like us very much .
We are in the middle of two wars .
The war on terror has many tentacles to it , and what to do and how to do it is a reasoned debate I suppose , but eventually the way to win this war is to try to get to root cause of problem .
The root cause of the problem is that there is a small minority of people out there who have a way of doing business , a religious view , that does n’t accept moderate Muslims , Jews , Christians , anybody else and they are a minority within the world ’s population but they have to be confronted on a multi - level approach , sometimes military action , sometimes economic aid .
But this country would be in a better position to deal with that problem and other problems if we could go to Middle East and say we ’d like to help you with your problems but we do n’t need your oil .
That would really be a game changer in terms of our domestic national security concerns .
[ Applause ]
Now , I ’m speaking the day after the president spoke in New Hampshire .
I like the president .
I ’m having a hard time finding common ground but we ’re trying .
One of the issues that I think we have some common ground on is trying to come up with a rational energy independence policy married up with climate change policy that will clean up the air but make money doing it and create jobs in the process and looking at old problems anew .
There was this idea floating around yesterday — do n’t know how serious it is — that somehow it would be wise for Congress to do an energy bill only .
I do n’t think that ’s wise .
[ Applause ]
The reason I do n’t think that ’s wise is that “ it is a kick the can down the road approach . ”
It ’s putting off to another Congress what really needs to be done comprehensively .
I do n’t think you ’ll ever have energy independence the way I want it until you start dealing with carbon pollution and pricing carbon .
The two are connected in my view — very much connected .
The money to be made in solving the carbon pollution problem can only happen when you price carbon in my view .
So if the approach is to try to pass some half - assed energy bill and say that is moving the ball down the road , forget it with me .
[ Applause ]
If my Democratic and Republican colleagues — but the Democratic leadership — brings an energy bill to the floor , and that ’s the only way we ’re going to do things , you better get ready to vote for an amendment that allows offshore drilling with revenue sharing .
Because you ’ll never become energy independent in my view unless we start exploring for resources that we own in America in an
aggressive and environmentally - sensitive way .
So this idea that the energy bill makes us energy independent does n’t cut it with me because the bill that came out committee does n’t have any revenue sharing for state of South Carolina or any other state who would agree to offshore exploration .
So you ’re not going to be to pass this bill and tell me we ’ve done anything about energy independence .
On nuclear power side , the nuclear title in this bill is woefully inadequate to create renaissance in nuclear power .
82 percent of power in France comes from where ?
Nuclear .
Surely we can be as bold as the French .
French have found a way to produce nuclear safely , efficiently .
It is cleaning up their environment , it ’s creating jobs .
If you want a job renaissance in America then you need a renaissance in nuclear power , that ’s where jobs are going to come from .
Trust me , you can not be serious about cleaning up the environment unless you are serious about nuclear power .
You cannot replace coal - fired plants with wind and solar — it ’s 15 percent of the grid at most .
I ’m a serious guy .
Honest to God ’s truth is that nuclear power has been put in the backseat in this country in an irrational way .
But nuclear is just one part of the solution Wind and solar does matter .
We have 250 years of coal — we should use it , but it just should be cleaner
At the end of the day we need a comprehensive approach that would allow this country to jump start its economy and lead the world to a cleaner environment
Every day we wait in this nation China is going to eat our lunch .
The Chinese do n’t need 60 votes .
I guess they just need 1 guys vote over there — and that guy ’s voted .
[ Laughter ]
He has decided to do two things :
First , kind of play footsie with us on emissions control stuff but go like gangbusters when it comes to producing alternative energy .
The solar and wind and battery - powered cars is an amazing thing to watch .
And we ’re stuck in neutral here .
So my message to you — you ’re up here to advocate — advocate .
Let the Congress know that you want a comprehensive approach to two serious problems .
You do n’t have to believe that Iowa is going to become beachfront property to want to clean up carbon .
It is not about polar bears to me , it ’s about jobs .
I like the polar bears as much as anyone else but I want to create jobs .
If just a fraction of what is being predicted about global warming is true , that ’s enough to motivate us all .
But if worse thing you did — as Tony Blair would say — is you provided a cleaner environment , I do n’t think you ’d go down in history in a bad way .
The key in my view to those who believe we should address carbon pollution is to make sure that the energy initiatives that will get us there are done in a package .
If you break this apart you ’ll have a watered down solution on both fronts .
Health care was big , it was controversial — I did n’t like the bill — but that does n’t mean you ca n’t do other hard problems .
If the lesson from health care is let ’s not do anything hard , then why do n’t we all go home , which might be good for the country by the way .
But if we go home , China wo n’t .
The world is moving , pollution is growing , we ’ve got a chance to get ahead and lead .
If we wait too long and if we try to take half measures as the preferred route on all these hard problems they just get worse .
My challenge to you and to myself is to not let this moment pass .
This is the best opportunity I ’ve seen in my political lifetime for a Republican and Democrat to do something bold and meaningful .
Why did I get involved in this ?
I ask myself that a lot .
I saw an opportunity .
I ’ve become convinced that carbon pollution is a bad thing , not a good thing , and it can be dealt with , and we can create jobs .
This is the time , this is the Congress , and this is the moment .
So if we retreat and try to just go to the energy - only approach — which will never yield the legislative results that I want on energy independence — then we just made the problem worse .
What Congress is going to come up here and do all these hard things ?
Who are these people in the future ?
Because we constantly count on them .
I do n’t know who they are .
I ’ve yet to find them .
So I guess it falls to me and you .
So let ’s do it .
Thanks .

Since the issue of Steve Wozniak 's Prius arose yesterday , Toyota has been anxious to get in touch with the Apple co-founder to diagnose the problem and , according to his assistant , will take the car for testing .

At a speech on Monday Wozniak claimed his new 2010 Toyota Prius , which is n't under the current Toyota recall , randomly accelerated while in cruise control mode and that he could duplicate the event .
After reading a similar story on Gizmodo Wozniak commented that he was having difficulty reaching the manufacturer to tackle his issue .

We called Toyota and they were clearly anxious to speak with Wozniak and so was he according to his assistant .
" That 's exactly what we were hoping would happen , " she told Jalopnik .
After passing on the contact info for a Toyota technical expert the company called us and asked us if we could actually send him Toyota U.S. President Jim Lentz 's personal number .

Wozniak is on the road and , as of this evening , has n't spoken directly with Toyota , but his dealer is going to take the car for a week to test it and will give him a loaner in the meantime .
We 're anxious to hear how it turns out .

Functionality from Structure with Dependent Types Dr. Conor McBride
Abstract
This short course will introduce dependently typed programming , with a particular focus on expressing high - level structure in data , programming and reasoning .
Dependent types provide powerful ways to improve the precision at which programmers work , but crucially also the level of abstraction .
They give us the power to make things terribly difficult for ourselves , or remarkably easy , depending on how we use them .
In this course , we 'll look beyond the chocolate box of sweet examples in search of the structuring principles which help us get it right more often .
Whenever we see patterns emerging , we 'll look at how to express them directly in our programs .
This course will have a strong hands - on component , mediated in the Agda language : see http://appserv.cs.chalmers.se/users/ulfn/wiki/agda.php for further information and installation instructions .
Course material
Just a week at high altitudes can cause sustained weight loss , suggesting that a mountain retreat could be a viable strategy for slimming down .
Overweight , sedentary people who spent a week at an elevation of 8,700 feet lost weight while eating as much as they wanted and doing no exercise .
A month after they came back down , they had kept two - thirds of those pounds off .
The results appear in the Feb . 4 Obesity .
" What is nice about this paper , is that it clearly demonstrates that there ’s a lasting effect of decreased caloric intake , that people eat less even a month after they come out of high altitude , " said Massachusetts General Hospital anesthesiologist Kay Leissner , who studies high altitude physiology , but was not involved in the study .
Since a 1957 study , scientists have known that animals lose weight at high altitudes .
Mountaineers also shed pounds during expeditions to 12,000 feet or more , though the exertion of climbing a mountain clearly played a role .
But the obese are more likely to suffer severe altitude sickness , in which low oxygen pressure causes dizziness , nausea and more serious problems like edema or heart attacks , Leissner said .
So a team at Ludwig - Maximilians University in Munich wanted to see if the pounds also melted away with a safer , sedentary stay at somewhat lower altitude .
The scientists ferried 20 overweight , middle - aged men by train and cable car to a research station perched 1,000 feet below the peak of Germany 's highest mountain , Zugspitze .
During the week - long stay , the men could eat and drink as much as they liked and were forbidden from any exercise other than leisurely strolls .
The team measured the men's weight , metabolic rate , levels of hunger and satiety hormones before , during , and after their mountain retreat .
After a week up high , the subjects lost an average of 3 pounds .
A month later , they were still 2 pounds lighter .
The sceintists ' data showed this was likely because they ate about 730 calories less at high altitudes than they did at normal elevations .
They may have felt less hungry , in part , because levels of leptin , the satiety hormone , surged during the stay , while grehlin , the hunger hormone , remained unchanged .
Their metabolic rate also spiked , meaning they burned more calories than they usually did .
A high - altitude weight loss strategy could be viable , though studies have shown peoples ' appetites bounce back after about six months at high elevation , Leissner said .
" If you could do intermittent periods for one week , then go down , and then go back up , this might actually be helpful . "
One limitation of the study , however , is that it did n't show whether the men lost mostly muscle mass , fat , or water weight , Leissner said .
And the study did n't show that the stay at 8,700 feet was actually safe for the participants , University of Geneva exercise physiologist Bengt Kayser said in an e-mail .
New research into why the overweight are prone to heart attacks , diabetes , and other inflammatory diseases , suggest it could be some fat cells grow so rapidly that blood vessel growth can't keep up , and that leads to pockets of oxygen - starved fatty tissue , Kayser said . "
This causes local inflammation because immune cells get activated . "
If that 's the case , then shuttling the overweight to even a moderate altitude may worsen inflammation and increase their chances of heart attack or other serious problems .
" So for the moment one has to remain very careful , " Kayser said , " and evaluate the question a few more times before migrating all obese Americans to Colorado ! "

( Mental Floss ) --
Earlier this month , it was revealed that the New England Patriots had attempted to trademark the phrases " 19 - 0 Perfect Season " and " 19 - 0 " .
Oops .
There are still phrases to slap on T - shirts and hats that adequately reflect the Patriots ' season : attempts have been made to trademark the phrases " The Perfect Season Oops " and " 18 - 1 . "
( The latter was filed by the New York Post . )
Trademarks are words , symbols , or phrases used to identify particular products .
Think of Nike and their swoosh .
They can be trademarked by companies or individuals if the entity submitting the request can prove that the meaning of the phrase has a distinctive second meaning .
Here are seven examples of individuals who were more successful in turning their catchphrase into a trademark -- and in some cases , a hefty profit .
" Three - peat "
In 1988 , Pat Riley and his Los Angeles Lakers were headed for a third consecutive NBA championship .
The team started to use the term " three - peat " to describe their ultimate goal .
Coach Riley claims the term originated from player Byron Scott .
During the season , Riley registered the phrase as a trademark for use on merchandise .
The Lakers ' third championship attempt was thwarted by the Pistons in 1989 , but the Chicago Bulls accomplished the feat in 1993 .
Riley was able to slam - dunk all the way to the bank when the Bulls opted to use the phrase for championship merchandise .
In 2005 , a group of USC students were anticipating a third consecutive BCS championship and attempted to trademark the phrase " Three - Pete . "
The misspelling was created not only to avoid paying Riley for use of the phrase , but also to pay homage to coach Pete Carroll .
The federal trademark board ruled that the spelling difference was not enough to differentiate it from Riley 's three - peat .
When a student started to sell his own " Three - Pete " shirts he was served with copyright infringement notification .
And , just like Riley , USC did not succeed in reaching a three - peat .
" Let 's Get Ready to Rumble ! "
Michael Buffer , the boxing and wrestling announcer well - known for his booming voice and classic catchphrase , holds the trademark to this phrase , which he started using in the 1980s .
By 1992 he had a federally registered trademark for it .
The move turned out to be profitable , as Buffer has used the phrase for songs , video games , and lottery commercials .
Always the entrepreneur , Buffer licensed the phrase to New York City taxicabs in the late 1990s for use in a welcome message , voiced by Buffer himself , encouraging riders to buckle their seatbelt before exclaiming " Let 's get ready to rumble .... for SAFETY ! "
Buffer even appeared in a commercial for Kraft cheese and oh - so - cleverly changed the phrase to " Lets get ready to crumble ! " for the company 's pre-packaged cheese crumbles .
Surprisingly , Buffer has spared incarnations of the phrase involving many rhyming words .
Look out fumble , bumble , stumble , humble , et. al .
" Let 's Roll "
There have been at least 17 approved applications to trademark the phrase " Let 's roll " since September 11 , 2001 .
Heroic Choices , the charitable organization formerly known as the Todd M. Beamer Foundation , trademarked the phrase in order to sell merchandise with proceeds going to the charity .
But 16 additional claims were granted to other companies , for use on other types of merchandise including rolling back packs , roller sports , soft pretzels , paint rollers , metal building materials and tapes .
Even Rolling
Rock beer offers you to " Let 's roll ... and rock with Rolling Rock . "
An applicant using the name " Let 's Roll Freedom Fighters " trademarked the phrase for use on just about anything you can buy in a gift shop ; mouse pads , lighters , key chains and gun cases .
" That 's Hot "
Heiress Paris Hilton popularized her catchphrase " that 's hot " on her hit reality show The Simple Life .
She was the subject of media scrutiny when she applied for a trademark for the simple and relatively common phrase .
She was granted three trademarks in 2007 : one for use in men and women 's clothing , another for electronic devices and a third for alcoholic beverages .
She has used the phrase to promote a canned version of an Italian sparkling wine called Rich Prosecco .
Later in 2007 , Hilton announced plans to sue Hallmark for using her image and trademarked phrase on a greeting card .
Hallmark claims that the card is fair game because it is parody ; Hilton feels her rights have been violated .
Currently , it is unclear if the case will go to court .
" Bam ! "
Emeril Lagasse's " Emeril 's Food of Love " company owns the right to the phrase " Bam ! " for its use on just about anything you can find in a drawer or cabinet in your kitchen : pans , pots , spatulas and tongs .
There are numerous other claims to the phrase , including one by Jackass star Bam Margera and one by the EasyOff company for their cleaning products of the same name , but only Emeril 's uses an exclamation point .
" Goodnight my sweet Anna baby "
Larry Birkhead , the father of the late Anna Nicole Smith 's daughter Dannielynn , trademarked this phrase for its use in movies , books , television programs and stage plays .
The phrase was used heavily by the media during coverage of Smith 's death .
Birkhead claims the phrase is what the late Smith wanted to hear every night before she went to sleep , and Birkhead included the line in a poem on his Web site following her passing .
While Birkhead claims he never filed for the trademark , it is registered in his name .
His former attorney , Debra Opri , claims that she advised him to trademark the phrase to " protect himself " because " You do n't want someone else to take advantage of something he said internationally -- after he said it in court and then on one of the TV shows , it became famous . "
Given all of the people who have tried to earn a profit from Smith 's death , it was probably a smart move .
" They are who we thought they were "
Normally quiet Arizona Cardinals coach Dennis Green first uttered this trademarked phrase during a swear - filled , post - game tirade in 2006 .
When he was asked what he thought of the Chicago Bears after his team dropped a 20 - point lead during a Monday Night Football game , Green responded " they are who we thought they were . "
There is another part to the quote " and we let 'em off the hook ! " that is not part of the trademark .
Green exclusively owns the right to use the phrase for sports merchandise , but the clip is a sports media standard that is used when teams fail to take advantage of their opponent 's obvious flaws .

Rep . Ron Paul suddenly finds himself dealing with the blowback : a handful of Tea Party - inspired candidates are seeking to dislodge him in the Texas Republican primary .
Paul burned by tea party blowback
Rep. Ron Paul , the libertarian - oriented Republican whose 2008 presidential run provided kindling for the Tea Party movement , suddenly finds himself dealing with the blowback : a handful of tea party - inspired candidates are seeking to dislodge him in Tuesday ’s Texas Republican primary .
It ’s an unusual turn of events for a veteran congressman who has reached stardom in conservative populist circles and who just last week emerged as the victor of the presidential straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference .
Advertisement
Yet despite his solid anti-establishment credentials and non-conformist views , Paul finds himself under siege from three Republicans who are embracing many of the themes that have defined Paul ’s career .
At the heart of the resistance is the notion that the 10 - term Paul has gone Washington , abandoning his constituents as he pursues his white whale — the presidency .
“ To be honest , I was surprised when these guys started coming out of the woodwork , ” said Fort Bend County GOP Chairman Rick Miller .
“ They ’re trying to tap into the idea that it ’s time for a new face .
It ’s a sign of the times .
It ’s what ’s happening in our country . ”
Paul remains the favorite in the race but the opposition clearly has him looking over his shoulder .
In a January email alert titled “ They ’ve Turned Their Attack Dogs Loose On Me ! ” , Paul warns that both parties are “ doing everything they can to make sure I am defeated . ”
“ These candidates include three Republicans in my own primary on March 2 , ” he wrote , “ and they will stop at nothing to tear down and destroy all we have worked for . ”
Richard Murray , a University of Houston political scientist , said strong anti-incumbent winds are buffeting even members like Paul who have never been embraced by the political establishment .
“ You ’ve got this throw the bums out factor , and it does n’t matter if they have an R , a D , or an L next to their name , ” he said .
As they crisscross the small towns that encompass outer edge of Houston and the Gulf Coast , Paul ’s foes are also branding him as more interested in running for president than serving the residents of the 14th Congressional District .
“ Where are you Congressman Paul ? ” reads the website of Tim Graney , a small business owner who is one of the Republicans running against Paul .
At a debate last week , John Gay , another Paul challenger , took a shot at the congressman ’s national political organization , Campaign for Liberty : “ I applaud Dr. Paul for what he ’s done and I want him to retire and do the things that he likes to do and run the foundations that he ’s started . ”
“ He ’s not doing the job of the U.S. House .
He should be here in the district listening to us , ” Graney said in an interview this week .
“ At the end of the day , his Campaign for Liberty is a good cause , but he should n’t be doing that on our time . ”
Gerald Wall , a chemical worker who is also challenging Paul , echoed their criticisms .
“ The problem with Ron Paul is that he does n’t spend any time representing his people , ” he said .
“ Everyone knows that if we elect him to Congress he will spend one month in Congress and 18 months running for president . ”
Jim Webb , a Texas GOP precinct chair in Brazoria County , said the idea of Paul as an absentee landlord was gaining resonance in the district .
“ I think there ’s a lot of people in the district who feel like they are not well represented .
He ’s a popular guy nationally , but when it comes to being in the district with his constituents he ’s hardly ever seen , ” said Webb .
“ I think it changed after his first presidential run .
It just seemed that he catered more to his national constituency than his local constituency . ”
Jesse Benton , a Paul campaign spokesman , rejected the idea that Paul had been absent from the district , insisting that the congressman had only spent two days traveling in other states this year .
“ Charges that he ’s gallivanting around the country are silly , ” said Benton .
“ Rep .
Paul has not made any decision on whether he ’s running for president .
He ’s very focused on his district , and he ’s very involved in his district . ”
Paul , who refuses to support any legislation unless it strictly adheres to the Constitution , is also coming under fire for allegedly failing to follow a House member ’s credo — district first .
His opponents claim that his dogged pursuit of an ideological agenda raises his national profile but does little to address the true needs of his district .
Graney has attacked Paul for voting against a bill that would fund the Coast Guard and a bill that funded relief efforts for Hurricane Ike .
“ In not working with others and voting no on everything , he ’s done nothing to bring himself to represent taxpayers , ” said Graney .
Bob Sipple , the mayor of Lake Jackson , a town of 31,000 where Paul lives with his wife and who said he personally holds
Paul in high regard , acknowledged hearing some of the criticism .
“ I think there is some thought that he is set and uncompromising in some areas and certain things that could get done with some consideration are n’t getting done , ” said Sipple .
“ I think there are people who think , ‘ Maybe we ought to take a look at someone who takes a more compromising attitude on issues . ’”
Paul — who has earned the nickname “ Dr. No ” on Capitol Hill — appeared to acknowledge the criticism during last week ’s debate .
“ Obviously , there must be some disagreement in order for us to have a contest to challenge me in a race and I think I understand that because I am a stickler — I am a stickler for the Constitution — I vote ‘ No ’ a lot , ” Paul said in his closing remarks .
“ I am not ashamed of this . ”
Complicating the landscape is that fact that some local Republican Party officials are lashing out against Paul because some of the congressman ’s supporters are challenging them on Tuesday ’s primary ballot .
They argue that Paul is trying to stack the deck in his favor in order to have a stronger hand ahead of the 2012 state convention .
In Brazoria County , which serves as Paul ’s political base , Paul supporters are challenging Chairwoman Yvonne Dewey and a host of local precinct chairs .
This week , several local party leaders published letters in a local newspaper , The Facts , expressing dismay at the takeover attempt .
“ They think that if they control the party , they can control the convention .
And if they control the convention , then they can get some votes , ” Dewey complained in an interview .
“ They do n’t come in and work with you .
They come in and try to send you home . ”
For all the grumbling back home , however , there is little question that Paul , armed with a $ 2.5 million war chest , still leads the field .
And there appears to be widespread belief that he will finish on top , with the only question being whether he will win enough votes to cross the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff .
“ I personally think he ’ll win that primary with 60 - plus percent of the vote , even with three opponents , so I find it kind of interesting , ” said Mary Anne Wyatt , chairwoman of the Victoria County Republican Party .
“ There ’s no question that Rep .
Paul is very popular in his district and has been for some time .
It has n’t been an enigma — it ’s been a fact . ”
“ I do n’t think he views any of us as a threat , ” conceded Graney , who says he has spent $ 80,000 on his campaign .
A Moore Information survey conducted for Paul ’s campaign showed Paul picking up 74 percent of the vote in a primary contest .
Seventy - nine percent said they had a favorable impression of Paul , with 84 percent approving of his job performance .
Paul ’s campaign has purchased $ 50,000 of airtime on local radio stations running an ad highlighting his conservative accomplishments and his role in helping to inspire the tea party movement .
“ One leader is different : Congressman Ron Paul , who has been named the champion of the Constitution and the taxpayer ’s best friend , ” says the one - minute ad .
“ Let ’s keep him fighting for us . ”
Benton , the Paul spokesman , was beyond confident about Tuesday ’s outcome .
“ Victory is a foregone conclusion , ” said Benton .
“ It ’s a very positive thing that there is an anti-incumbent sentiment and that there is Tea Party involvement .
It gives him a chance to communicate to his constituents , that ’s he ’s voting their values , their interests , and is working hard for them .
And the people are overwhelmingly supportive of him . ”
Correction :
An earlier version of this article listed incorrect favorable and job approval ratings in Paul 's internal polling .

I read websites and newspapers that I trust and are willing to challenge the readers with stories not commonly reported , but I guess there is a healthy percentage of the US population who choose their news source based on emotional comfort , traditional ( outdated ) reputation and political afiliation .
The demise of the MSM is self inflicted , NYT especially .

You know , I sent an email to the Times ' public editor a week or two ago , followed up a day or two ago specifically requesting a response from a human being rather than an auto - responder .
Nothing , nada , zip .
Arrogance , then the fall .
We all have this regrettable tendency to think that an organization can stand on its past .
But the people in the organization change .
I 've seen it happen at computer companies : the company is launched by a brilliant set of people , succeeds wildly , goes on a hiring spree that introduces layer after layer of new and incompetent management .
The new management hires run the company into the ground because ( a ) they think by virtue of being a manager at Megacorp , they are hot stuff , and ( b ) because they know Megacorp is destined to succeed .
Well , The New York Times Corporation is Megacorp .
It once had a good name , and it only took Clark Hoyt to pound the final nail into the coffin .
I 'll be glad when the corpse stops moving .

It seems that this issue has evolved beyond the question of accuracy and into the realm of culpability .
That is , the New York Times is refusing to issue a retraction not because they stand by their story , but because they do n't want to confess their malicious role in attacking ACORN under the direction of a small faction racist activists .

I also think the NYT is refusing to issue a retraction because that 's just not what you do these days .
Never admit wrongdoing .
Never apologize .
Therefore there IS nothing to correct .
I 'm not sure when or what group in this country started this trend , but it is n't just the NYT .
I 'm not saying this to excuse them in any way , just pointing out that the country seems a sadder , meaner place because of it these days .
Sure , we 've gotten some very public and essentially meaningless apologies from some very public figures who 've admitted wrongdoing in their private lives .
But in general , in areas that actually matter to the public , the policy seems to be never admit to anything .
The NYT is right in style .

Is n't there someone at the NYTimes watching all of this and thinking he has to get rid of Hoyt and Brock because they 're making a laughingstock out of the NYTimes ?
I laughed out loud with this one ( seriously , I laughed out loud ) :
The story says O'Keefe dressed up as a pimp and trained his hidden camera on Acorn counselors .
It does not say he did those two things at the same time These guys STINK !
And they represent the NYTimes ?
What a joke !
This is getting embarrassing for them .
Hoyt and Brock are just getting silly with their responses ... OR they 're idiots who should n't have the positions they have .

This is excellent reporting on an issue which could not be more important for our country .
Of all the reasons we are in such a political black hole , the problem of right - wing media dominance is the most devastating .
Without some way to lessen the influence of right - wing propagandists , there is no evident way to reverse the economic disparity between the super - wealthy and ordinary people , which in turn causes so many of our other social and economic problems .

Lora and Ernest - great observation .
It was this attitude that scared me the most about the Bush administration .
Aside from their generally batshit crazy policies , it was an uncanny singularly unnerving fact that any number of them ( and especially their press secretaries - Fleischer , McClellan , Perino ) would flat - out lie on camera , with the full knowledge that anyone with half a brain knew they were lying and could likely prove it with an 8th - grade research capacity .
It was unmitigated gall , a coded " Fuck You " to all of who cared but were essentially powerless .
And the media rarely , if ever called any of them on it .
And if they did , the exchange went soething like this :
But you said we 'll get him dead or alive .
I do n't think I said that .
No , I have it right here .
I never said that .
Well , if you 'll just watch this short clip .
That was n't me .
But that is , in fact , you at the Press Conference .
It seems like some people are just interested in finger - pointing , rather than how to best protect the American people .
And so those of us here love the rare bird like Grayson , or more recently Anthony Wiener - if for nothing more than their rare willingness to call the bastards liars in public .

Read Soul Rebel @ 12 and thought , " Hear .
Hear . "
Then immediately Jeannie Dean @ 13 hear hearing as if for me and throwing in additional points about Lora and Ernest that I hear hear , too .
There was an additional point of explanation on one of these recent Brad postings ( maybe from Boehlert or Foser ) worth repeating .
It 's what appears to be an extreme reluctance / sensitivity to being perceived as having made a mistake or being unreliable .
Because the world will end for them in some way ( they seem to believe ) if they 've fucked up , a common response is simply deny / ignore that they have .
For many this immediately compounds the original mistake and intensifies in us the feelings of distrust the miscreant is desperately hoping to assuage .
But astonishingly , as a tactic , this sort of denial of reality ( as Ernest points out with the Hitler quote ) is all too effective .
What I am beside myself with curiosity is -- what is the consciousness of the people doing the dodging / denying / distorting / lying ?
For these guys at the Times , for all those Republicans at the health care " summit " , for Obama when he does the exact opposite of what he promised -- what is their consciousness during these episodes of complete self - contradiction ?
How do they resolve in their own minds the complete contradiction of their own words ?
Why does n't it torment them ?
Or does it ?
How can their bodies / minds / beings live in such obvious contradiction with itself ?
Now that I ask these questions I 'm remembering there is some school of thought out of Chicago I think , can't remember the guy 's name right now , that could help explain maybe some of it .
The premise is that there is an elite who should run things .
Since the common people do n't know what 's right or good and since you can't just say that to them because they 're too stupid to understand and will only make a ruckus , it 's perfectly fine to lie and manipulate .
Because only this select group really gets it .
And it 's their responsibity to lead the rabble , even against their will , to the better life .
And I think I read that there were a lot of Republicans ( from Bush administrations ) who subscribed to this guy 's teachings .
What 's his name ?
Schwartz ?
Something like that ?

Detroit Lions : I remember Greg Landry at QB years ago .

The thing with how the right has taken over the " liberal media " , is that they LIE .
People say MSNBC is the FOX " news " of the left .
MSNBC is just pointing out the right 's lies on a corporate owned channel .
That 's propaganda from the left ?
Pointing out their lies and how they do it ?
That 's EDUCATIONAL !
Look at that Rachel clip I posted above .
The problem is : the right LIES .
LIES work on idiots and people who do n't have the time to research .

I would say that maybe the left should start a LIE MACHINE like the right , but the left does n't do that .

Re David Lasagna # 18 .
Soul Rebel is correct .
It is Leo Strauss , who is considered the father of neoconservatism .
There is an excellent book by Shadia Drury , Leo Strauss & the American Right , which I would highly recommend if you have the time and the interest to read and fully appreciate just how dangerously authoritarian neoconservatives are .
As explained by Prof .
Drury , Strauss believed that a religion is necessary to provide a society with a single public orthodoxy which defines what is true and false , right and wrong , noble and base .
( Compare that to the tenets of right - wing fundamentalist Christian theology ) .
Strauss objects to secularism not because he is Pius but because it erodes community .
For Strauss religion may be an opiate of the masses , but the masses need to be drugged .
In Strauss ’s view , truth is to be savored by the few , but is dangerous for the consumption of the many .
" Liberal education succeeds only in cultivating a dangerous open - mindedness that erodes wholehearted attachment to ‘ one ’s own ’ traditions and prejudices .
A true education must inculcate the values of society as absolute and inviolable , while teaching the truth to a small elite intended to govern society indirectly through the influence it exerts on the powerful . "
This is why Strauss cultivates an elite which makes a virtue of lying and dissembling .
Prof .
Drury responds to the Straussian message by noting : " Strauss espouses ... blind and thoughtless adherence to a doctrine whose secrecy shields it from scrutiny and criticism .
[ Its ] pernicious influence [ lies ] in the kind of elites he cultivates --- an elite that is not fit for power because it is neither wise nor good .
It is not wise because it cannot defend its beliefs before the tribunal of reason ; it preaches only to the converted . "
Think back to the band of neoconservatives who led us into the war in Iraq and you get the picture .
Responding to Strauss 's elitist view of philosopher - prophets controlling society , Drury adds : " Strauss ’s philosopher - prophet falls pray to his own bodyguard of lies ; he begins to believe that he is in truth the humanly perfect manifestation of the divine mind , in fact , the only divinity available .
After all , he is the author of the law … .
The philosopher - prophet runs the risk of self delusion on a grand scale . "
Drury also makes an interesting reference to Hanna Arendt and the use of propaganda : “ Hanna Arendt described totalitarianism as the triumph of politics over truth . ”
Arendt believed that “ propaganda or the systematic attempt to conceal the truth was the fundamental ploy of totalitarian politics . ”
If you look at the history of the American hard - right of the past decade , especially as embodied in Fox " New " you can see Arendt 's " totalitarian politics " in full swing .

The NYTs credibility was shot long before this , this is just the icing on the cake .
But to answer your question - this blog you can trust .
It is honest - to - nonexistent - god the only source that I can be 100 % sure that if BF posts it , it is true .
Why ?
Because BF backs everything up like he was Carbonite .
If there is n't a credible source , you wo n't see it here .
Having read the above Edmonds article on Flynt 's site , I was thrilled to see BradBlog listed as the second recommended site in the upper right corner .
That is a " witness " , IMHO .
Beyond the man himself , BFs regular readers and commenters are generally a credible source of information - and Brad takes on disinformation with a vengeance if it is posted here by a commenter .
So bottom line is that you 've found a good comfy chair to hand out in and watch the madness .
Stay a while .

Propaganda and suppression of anti-state ideas is of course very old .
What is new in this country ( or seems relatively new , especially in the last decade ) , is the particular set of right - wingnut tactics used to promote their party line and suppress any other truth or ideas .
Allow me to re-quote Hitler ( from Ernest 's # 10 comment ) :
" All effective propaganda must be limited to a very few points and must harp on these slogans until the last member of the public understands what you want him to understand ... Propaganda [ has ] to be continuous and unvarying in its message .
It should never admit a glimmer of doubt in its own claims , or concede the tiniest element of right in the claims of the other side . " -- Adolf Hitler , Mein Kampf
We really saw this in the simplification of Bush 's messages to the public .
Maybe he was dumb like a fox .
More like , he was dumbing down what he wanted to get across to the public , as in " [ limiting ] to a very few points . "
Then take all the pundits who would then " harp on these slogans . "
They still do .
They take a phrase like " The liberal media " and repeat it endlessly .
How can the " last member of the public " avoid understanding it ?
They are " continuous and unvarying in their message , " as in " the war on terror . "
Most particularly , as in any Republican member of Congress , or any right - wing blogger , or any right - wing pundit , speaker , tea BAGGER ( Hey , they used the term first --- it was THEIR mistake and I 'm lovin ' it ! ) , or any wingnut commenter on any blog anywhere :
They " never admit a glimmer of doubt in its own claims , or concede the tiniest element of right in the claims of the other side . "
This last tactic , when I finally realized what was going on , led me to realize , more than anything else , that we are being manipulated and brainwashed on a grand , organized scale .
Now I know where these tactics originated ( or at least were consolidated into an organized method ) .
How ironic that the very people who love to compare our president to Hitler are following a script from Hitler 's playbook .

Smack dead on , Lora @ 35 .

Greenwald follows up with a segment in which you see one
Fox anchor after another spew out the words , " flip - flopper , " with respect to John Kerry .
The segment is hilarious until you stop to realize that this method of simplistic messages , repeated over and over again " until the last member of the public understands what you want him to understand " comes straight out of Mein Kampf .
And then there 's dyslexic idiot , George W. Bush , who on May 24 , 2005 told assembled middle - school students what he was really up to .

We have an army of angry brainwashed , violent , zombie Tea -tards on our hands .

They have been franchised and branded to fight for the wrong side as Hitler - lite .
And they , unlike the majority of the American modest middle being held captive in the backseat while they drive , they sure do LOVE their guns ...
So , why are n't we talking about how to " deprogram " them , like we would any group of citizens whose minds had been effectively co-opted by a cult of destructive personality ?

Seems there 's a point I did n't make above that 's nagging at me , wo n't let me get back to what I was doing before ... ... and I think it is this : until we start using the appropriate terms , ( ie brainwashing , information wars , de- programming ) we can't begin to articulate a formal strategy to counter .
I mean no disrespect , but the longer we endlessly banter benign about how to " reach out " to them , or how to " love them into better behavior " , the more we will be force - punting this country into an historical defeat .
The more we expend tons of time and energy here patiently explaining to the trolling , flaming flamer - babies why they 're so wrong they should be embarrassed when they clearly do n't care if they 're wrong - being wrong suits them just fine as their repeated pattern of boasting behavior proves beyond a shadow of a doubt - clearly they are here just to hurl the blog equivalents of molotov cocktails at the rest of us in a well coordinated ( and effective ) attempt to keep us from discussing and / or furthering our own line of defense and / or attack .
Sorry about that crazy run-on .
Clearly , it had been building up for quite awhile and the appropriate punctuation just would n't cooperate with the fomenting angst .
( I bet THAT was the culprit behind the aforementioned nagging !
So glad I extricated it .
Thanks , Dr. Bradblog ! )
Let me add that I get why this is so hard .
I do ( as chronicled in my " Teabagging with Aunt Sue and other Adverse Adventures " posted here in comment threads at Bradblog and ... beyond . )
It involves , or at least it feels like it involves giving up on the potential decency of fellow human beings , in some cases loved ones - who most of us ( being decent ourselves ) are inclined to give the benefit of the doubt .
We assume they do n't want to do us harm at the expense of their own deeply held , strangely prized misinformation .
Or , as in my case , my decency combined with my super - ego belief in myself as some kind of great communicator , thinking I could save my Aunt Sue 's brain from the terminal , malignant mental illness of willful ignorance that comes from watching too much FOX NEWS .
Long story short : I could n't .
Because my Aunt Sue is brainwashed .
Denying the proper context of this massive brainwashing phenom puts us at a huge tactical disadvantage ( especially as it relates to high technology as resource , which we now have available for a limited time only ) .
There have to be more effective means of refuting / dissembling lies , re-enforcing fact based root assumptions , deprogramming without diffusing our own majority momentum .
It 's sad to me that so long after Greenwald 's mortifying doc OUTFOXED , we still have n't come up with much as antidote .
(... Ernest ?
Any reading you can suggest on how Germany was effectively " deprogrammed " post WW2 before we co-opted all their top - crazed NAZI thinkers and put them to work for the U.S. ?

New York Time veers Neo-con ...
It 's regarding a different issue ... but the Times has fully been turned into a right wing , neo -con propaganda tool .
Quote from the article ...
Many American progressives do n’t want to recognize how bad the U.S. mainstream news media has become .
It ’s easier to praise a few exceptions to the rule and to hope that some pendulum will swing than to undertake the challenging task of building a new and honest media infrastructure .
But the hard reality is that the U.S. news media is getting worse , with now both premier national newspapers – the New York Times and the Washington Post – decidedly sliding into the neocon camp , where the likes of the Wall Street Journal have long resided .

WWwoow , BlueHawk .
Did I hear on CNN last night as I was nodding off something about Iran leaving their nukes out in the open for everyone to see and how that 's being perceived as some kind of " invitation " to attack ?
Or was that another one of my annoying but highly accurate 3:00 am premonitory visions ?...
In case anyone missed it , last week Glenn Greewald also piled on the NYT for their mysterious , jaw dropping editorial decisions .
This one re : their recent op - ed that actually argued for the killing of MORE Muslim civilians in Afghanistan (?!)...

Dear Jeannie Dean re : brainwashing Yes , Project for the New American De-Programming is exactly what I 'm working on .
You know I will keep you posted .
Related -- Have n't read this for a long time , but some time after I was kicked out of my cult I came across a book called " Snapping : America 's Epidemic of Sudden Personality Change " .
Interesting stuff about going in and out of belief systems .
Sometimes people doing this on their own .
Sometimes through intervention .
Also an interesting chapter on brain information theory .
I read it too long ago to remember well enough to be able to give a wholehearted recommendation today .
If I get to it after all the other shit I have to read , I 'll let you know .
Oh yeah , I 'm thinking that on this particular subject , for this particular problem we 're the ones who probably will be writing the book .
I 'm guessing we may need to be coming up with some solutions that have n't been worked out yet .

The NYT Veers Neocon By Robert Parry
February 28 , 2010 Many American progressives do n’t want to recognize how bad the U.S. mainstream news media has become .
It ’s easier to praise a few exceptions to the rule and to hope that some pendulum will swing than to undertake the challenging task of building a new and honest media infrastructure .
That the New York Times has now embraced these neocon biases , almost with the ardor of the Washington Post , is a serious development for the U.S. news media and for the nation .

Is there anything more brilliant than for the ones who usurped the liberal media to continue calling it the liberal media ?
The entire sham would n't work unless they endlessly call it the liberal media every day , every hour , every chance they get .
That is essential to do that or the whole thing would n't work .
Who is still calling it the liberal media ?
We hear it everyday .
It 's the ones who took it over !
Rush Limbaugh , Charles Krauthammer , Breitbart , the whole gang and those they represent .
Why do they keep calling it liberal ?

It 's like a new version of , " The Night of the Living Dead . "
In this version , every mainstream media outlet and every politician ( except maybe Dennis Kucinich and one or two others ) , and massive numbers of voters become brain - dead zombies .
Only it 's not fiction .
It 's real .
Maybe it is The Emperor 's New Clothes meets The Night Of The Living Dead .
It is scary how stupid the media takes American citizens to be , how nakedly the facist ( aka liberal ) media disseminates lies not even bothering to even put on a veneer of objectivity .
Clark Hoyt 's responses --- those naked lies --- to Brad Friedman 's questions just shows how mean - spirited and cynical the mainstream " liberal " ( that is , neo - con ) media is .
Not even bothering to issue a token retraction after being caught in a bare - faced lie .
The New York Times was attacking the very basis of the United States as a country --- democracy --- and broadcasting lies to help destroy it .
It influenced politicians to cut funding for ACORN .
ACORN'S crime ?
It registered voters , many of them in difficult economic circumstances .
That is , voters who might not relate well to the neo-con agenda and vote fascist .
I guess the mainstream corporate media is confident it can take over the Internet as well ( It probably can , invisible bit by invisible bit , Supreme - Court - Supported corporate lobbyists pushing politicians to water down of little legal detail by little legal detail ) .

That whole subject of brainwashing - aka mind control - is exactly what I was researching all day yesterday .
I have found some freaky web sites , but unfortunately , after 10 years of trying to understand WHY , I have been forced to come to the conclusion that the ANSWER _IS_ FREAKY .
Here 's a link .
Read it or not .
The reports of the crowd control devices that pop your eardrums and make your skin feel like its burning are NOT far - fetched - mainstream media is telling us what we 're in for .
Pittsburgh G20 gathering with jackboot adornment was simply advance warning of what will happen when people start standing up .
Which they probably wo n't because the electronic mind control , the chronic illness , the obesity , and the fear will have us seriouslu slowed down to begin with .

@ #49 How ironic that the Pimpostor and Ho roadshow was n't even ABOUT voting registration , now WAS it ?
Was there anything on those pimped up , tricked out Ho and Show tapes that was even about voting , whatsoever ?
ACORN was a resource to recruit census workers .
The NeoCorporatist agenda does not want blacks and browns registered - that could alter voting demographics and make Neo conservative gerrymandering less easy .
A perfect example is the birthplace of ACORN , that is New Orleans , Louisiana .
Think back to Hurricane Katrina , and all the African American citizens that were stranded without food or water at the Superdome for days .. then disbursed to various cities across the continent .
An American diaspora .
Think that did n't change the voting demographic ?
And what was the original home to many of these displaced citizens ?
The storm ravaged Ninth Ward .
Today , it remains in ruins , five years later , remaining much as it did immediately after Katrina ... except with a whole lot fewer residents .
Remember the Blackwater troops that were dispatched there , after the storm ?
Just so happens that Erik Prince 's family is a big contributor to the Leadership Institute , the Morton Blackwell group that served as a training ground for the Pimpostor and his possee .
The Prince family also gave seed money to Gary Bauer to found the Family Research Council , now headed by Tony Perkins .
The Family Research Council is an offshoot of James Dobson 's Focus on the Family .
It is reported that O'Keefe is being represented by counsel with ties to Dobson 's Focus on the Family .
There is an undeniable and untenable racial , eugenicist mindset with this entire coterie of conservatives - and has nothing to do with democracy and everything to do with disempowerment and discrimination .

Re : Tony Perkins Perkins , from Baton Rouge , Louisiana - and presently head of Family Research Council , demonstrated in front of Mary Landrieu 's office there ( BR ) , about one month prior to the Pimpostor and the tele - pnony 's aborted attempt to compromise Landrieu 's communications system in her office in a New Orleans Federal building .
Perkins was protesting that Landrieu was allegedly not answering constituents ' phone calls about health care .
Maybe that is because he was protesting on Christmas Eve-and the office was CLOSED ?
But it 's the same ruse that O'Keefe used in his failed and foiled New Orleans caper .
Perkins and David Vitter are both affilated with Morton Blackwell , they all hail from Baton Rouge .
Vitter is on the Borad of the Leadership Institute .
It is also signicant that Perkins and Vitter were a recipients of Abramoff money , stemming from Louisiana Indian casinos , along with Ralph Reed .

In addition , should anyone think the mention of Blackwater is merely tangential , I suggest that you read the Wikipedia entry for Woody Jenkins , most especially , the section that starts with the " US Senate Campaign of 1996 " - relating to Woody 's failed election loss to Mary Landrieu and his accusations of vote fraud in New Orleans .
In addition to being a longtime friend of Morton Blackwell , Jenkins was one of the founders of CNP - Council for National Policy - and was instrumental in( Louisiana ) Senator David Vitter 's and Governor Bobby Jindal 's political campaigns , recently .
THEN , when you finish THAT , Google up Woody Jenkins and Amway .
Yes , Amway , you know , the company owned Eric Prince 's inlaws - his sister is married to a DeVos .
Jenkins is a long time Amway distributor and has given speeches to their conventions .

Dope Sick
Love is a really remarkable documentary made for HBO about two pairs of heroin addicted lovers roaming the streets of NYC .
There is no narration and we never see any interviews with the subjects , the camera just follows them around , like a third eye , completely detached .
The people being followed do n’t even seem aware that they ’re being filmed !
( or , at least , they do n’t seem to care ) .
The footage is amazingly candid .
This is as real as it gets .
The nuts and bolts of what its like to be on the street and addicted to heroin .
We watch them score dope , shoot it , make up , hustle , and even impersonate cops to rob people , and about a million other tiny details that less observant documentary filmmakers would leave out .
Some of the footage is truly horrifying .
Like watching one guy frantically searching for the fix he lost .
And when he does find it , the guy literally dances in the street .
The cyclical nature of drug addiction becomes very apparent while watching this .
EVERYTHING is about getting the next score to these folks , yet the next score seems to be well worth the immense trouble they go through .
This is a long post , but likely about the last one for several days , so it all evens out ...
I am trying to avoid gratuitous NYT / WaPo comparisons , because like all publications they are trying their best in difficult conditions .
I subscribe to both and wish them both well .
But their respective front - page stories on the same subject -- two days ago in the Post , and this morning in the NYT -- present a very interesting contrast .
Both stories are about the leaked / stolen emails from the University of East Anglia and what they may say about the basic science of climate change .
Let 's start with the story in today 's NYT story .
The added emphasis is from me :
In Face of Skeptics , Experts Affirm Climate Peril
Just two years ago , a United Nations panel that synthesizes the work of hundreds of climatologists around the world called the evidence for global warming " unequivocal . "
But as representatives of about 200 nations converge in Copenhagen on Monday to begin talks on a new international climate accord , they do so against a background of renewed attacks on the basic science of climate change .
The debate , set off by the circulation of several thousand files and e-mail messages stolen from one of the world 's foremost climate research institutes , has led some who oppose limits on greenhouse gas emissions , and at least one influential country , Saudi Arabia , to question the scientific basis for the Copenhagen talks .
The uproar has threatened to complicate a multiyear diplomatic effort already ensnared in difficult political , technical and financial disputes that have caused leaders to abandon hopes of hammering out a binding international climate treaty this year .
In recent days , an array of scientists and policy makers have said that nothing so far disclosed -- the correspondence and documents include references by prominent climate scientists to deleting potentially embarrassing e-mail messages , keeping papers by competing scientists from publication and making adjustments in research data -- undercuts decades of peer - reviewed science .
On Saturday , also on its front page , the Washington Post reported the same story this way :
--
In e-mails , science of warming is hot debate
Stolen files of ' Climate - gate ' suggest some viewpoints on change are disregarded
By David A. Fahrenthold and Juliet Eilperin Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday , December 5 , 2009
It began with an anonymous Internet posting , and a link to a wonky set of e-mails and files .
Stolen , apparently , from a research center in Britain , the files showed the leaders of climate - change science discussing flaws in their own data , and seemingly scheming to muzzle their critics .
Now it has mushroomed into what is being called " Climate - gate , " a scandal that has done what many slide shows and public - service ads could not : focus public attention on the science of a warming planet .
Except now , much of that attention is focused on the science 's flaws .
Leaked just before international climate talks begin in Copenhagen -- the culmination of years of work by scientists to raise alarms about greenhouse - gas emissions -- the e-mails have cast those scientists in a political light and given new energy to others who think the issue of climate change is all overblown .
The e-mails do n't say that :
They do n't provide proof that human - caused climate change is a lie or a swindle .
But they do raise hard questions .
In an effort to control what the public hears , did prominent scientists who link climate change to human behavior try to squelch a back - and - forth that is central to the scientific method ?
Is the science of global warming messier than they have admitted ?
The two stories are worth reading in full , and side - by - side .
I wo n't belabor all the contrasts and implications but will make this point :
A very frequent criticism of the mainstream press is that reporters are hesitant to say , " This is true , and that is false . "
Instead , they usually feel safest in the " critics contend " zone , " neutrally " reporting what each side says .
Eg , " Critics contend that the health - care reform bill will require the elderly to face ' death panels ' ; Administration officials disagree . "
2001 's Anthrax mailer , Dr. Bruce Ivins , killed five people and then himself .
The FBI 's closing the case file on him today .
Interestingly , the guy hated New York .
Sometimes , it sucks !
But there are ways around this problem .
6 . Stop taking the subway .
Self - explanatory , but in the event that you do derive some pleasure out of being transported by a never - timely rat - infested sweatbox staffed by people so angry you have to communicate with them in their native grumbles in order to negotiate the kind of situation that would require you to talk to them — like an unannounced service change , or your MetroCard not working , or some kind of emergency they should be attending to — which is often , go right ahead .
But this is a nice place to walk .
You should try walking , sometime .
5 . Stop grocery shopping .
Grocery shopping in this town is the goddamn worst .
Whole Foods is essentially the sixth circle of the Inferno .
The Park Slope Co-Op is basically an oppressive Communist hierarchy of people who will make you feel bad for eating everything but AssOats and Dayboat Bananas and Dirt - Strewn Organic Free - Trade Hormone - Free Tomatillos .
Trader Joe 's teases you with really great looking food that 's cheap but as it turns out mostly tastes like shit .
Also , more lines .
Gristedes or Grosstedes or whatever you call it , it 's an exercise in the restraint of your gag reflex , because they all smell like someone just barfed an entire bender of Pineapple Rum all over the front door .
Same with Key Foods , because they 're basically the same , but Key Foods is just out of reach of where you live , making schlepping your groceries a giant pain in the ass .
And Fresh Direct is cool if you enjoy the routine of having to break down the 40 cardboard boxes that were required to deliver you a bottle of seltzer and a T - Bone you 're not going to cook anyway .
Just eat out .
All the time .
For every meal .
Life will get better .
4 . Stop reading the newspaper .
If you have any common sense about you , the Sunday Styles routinely does bad things to your blood pressure , and you know , Thomas L. Friedman and Maureen Dowd and all the other absurd shit at the New York Times .
The New York Post is meant to make you angry no matter who you are , and the New York Daily Snooze is just kind of there .
The Wall Street Journal 's now owned by Rupert Murdoch so you might as well just read the New York Post from five feet away and save yourself like what a buck ?
Whatever .
And unless you already read The New York Observer you 'll probably find something mean to say about it , starting with it 's pink hue .
3 . Avoid our sports teams .
Ivins actually expressed his hatred for the Yankees in writing .
Hating the Yankees is no reason to go postal , because everyone else in America hates the Yankees without freaking the fuck out , no ?
That said , New York 's sports teams are the absolute worst .
The Mets are patently depressing .
The Yankees have the highest payroll in baseball , finally win their first championship in ten years , and then let their MVP get snapped up by the Angels .
Also , they 're owned by the Steinbrenners , who are assholes .
Also , A - Rod thinks he 's a centaur .
The Knicks are n't going to not suck for another five years , at least , and also , they 're owned by Jimmy Dolan , who 's an asshole .
Our hockey teams might be good but nobody really cares about hockey enough to know if this is true or not .
The Jets and the Giants are kinda okay but you have to go to New Jersey to see them play , but nobody wants a stadium in Manhattan , with good reason .
But also , Jets fans are total goons .
You 're probably just better foregoing professional sports altogether in this town .
2 . Sell out .
This is a pretty decent place to live no matter what , because everything 's pretty neat and we have some pretty neat stuff , but you know what makes New York even better ?
Money .
Lots of money .
Money is awesome in this town .
You know what 's cool ?
An apartment that 's kinda close to Manhattan that is n't a shoebox and does n't try to routinely kill you via electric fire or rodents serving as inspirations for supporting roles in Korean monster movies .
You know what 's cooler ?
A townhouse in the West Village that 's so whimsical if you look at it too long your face will collapse .
Hate the press ?
Just buy a newspaper ; they 're basically all for sale right now on the cheap , anyway .
Money solves lots of problems , and it solves a lot more problems in New York than anywhere else , because this city is basically nothing but problems .
1. Fuckoff .
If you hate it so much here , why do n't you just move ?
Move to Berlin !
Lots of ex-pats still think Berlin is great .
Or find the next Berlin !
Or go to LA !
Or Jersey !
You can find yourself somewhere .
But the last thing New Yorkers need are people who constantly complain about how much this city sucks .
Because we have enough shit to deal with , thanks .
We are often accused of being paranoid here at Zero Hedge , generally by our many detractors .
Occupational hazard , we suppose .
So when we pen missives wondering about the use of " National Security " exceptions to SEC disclosure and filing requirements for public companies , we tend to get a lot of smug " you 're crazy " correspondence .
Then a little time passes , and someone like Reuters writes an article :
U.S. securities regulators originally treated the New York Federal Reserve 's bid to keep secret many of the details of the American International Group bailout like a request to protect matters of national security , according to emails obtained by Reuters .
We are shocked , shocked .
Would anyone like to wager on the chance of more documents coming out with a lot more specificity about the import of a National Security interest here ?
We take no pride in being both paranoid and right here .
It is simply the fact that no well - reasoned suspicion seems that outlandish to us anymore when it comes to predicting what crony capitalists might do / have already done .
" This was one of those moments where I could n't believe something that looked this professional came from my stove . "
A month into Cathy Erway 's eating - in experiment she decided to learn how to make her own bread .
While Cathy was no slouch in the kitchen , she had never baked with yeast .
With a successful first batch of squash rolls under her belt , another recipe caught her eye : Jim Lahey 's No-Knead Bread featured in the New York Times .
This revolutionary technique required a little planning ahead but barely any hands - on time , and no strenuous kneading .
Around the same time , Cathy 's friends over at The Brooklyn Kitchen were hosting a no - knead bread competition .
She decided to enter with her take on the recipe , a version that substituted potato cooking water for plain water and added spicy cracked black peppercorns to the mix .
Although it was the first loaf of no -knead bread that Cathy had attempted , her loaf tied for first place and ended up in food writer Jeffrey Steingarten 's no-knead bread feature for Vogue magazine .
After reading about Cathy 's winning loaf in The Art of Eating In I tried it myself .
The first order of business : boil potatoes and reserve the cooking water to make the dough .
With sufficiently starchy water ( and potatoes for dinner ) I set about mixing the yeast , flour , salt , and cracked pepper into a dough .
The dough was just as shaggy and sticky as Cathy had promised .
I set it aside for the rest of the evening .
The next morning it looked like a sticky mess .
I dusted it with Parmesan and left it to rise for an additional two hours .
When it came time for baking , I placed the ball into a preheated Dutch oven .
Fifteen minutes later , a distinctly bready aroma began to emanate from my oven .
A mix of yeast and cheese , it almost smelled like pizza baking .
Exactly 35 minutes later , I pulled a perfectly golden brown loaf of crisp - crusted bread .
Once it cooled down , I started slicing .
It was truly amazing — the hard crust and chewy interior were no different from the fanciest loaves of artisan bread that I have a habit of buying .
And the first taste was a revelation : spicy , yeasty , and insanely delicious .
This was one of those moments where I could n't believe something that looked this professional came from my stove
Win The Art Of Eating In
As always with our Cook the Book feature , we have five ( 5 ) copies of The Art of Eating In to give away this week .
The last papal visit to the UK was in May 1982 Pope Benedict XVI has confirmed he will this year make the first papal visit to the UK since John Paul II 's of 1982 .
He is expected to visit Birmingham - as part of the planned beatification of Cardinal John Newman - and Scotland .
Dates for the trip have not been set .
The Pope spoke of the UK's " commitment to equality of opportunity " for all .
But he criticised equality legislation which imposed " unjust limitations on the freedom of religious communities to act in accordance with their beliefs " .
No official itinerary has yet been drawn up but officials at the Vatican and in the UK told the BBC the visit was likely to take place in September .
Further details are expected early in March , a spokesman for the Catholic Communications Network said .
The Pope was formally invited to visit the UK by Prime Minister Gordon Brown last February .
Scottish Secretary Jim Murphy also invited him to visit Scotland .
Your country is well - known for its firm commitment to equality of opportunity for all members of society
Pope Benedict XVI
Delivering a speech to Roman Catholic bishops from England and Wales who had made a pilgrimage to Rome , the pontiff asked that they ensure their faithful knew he " holds them in his heart " .
Pope Benedict offered his " warmest good wishes and prayers " for the bishops and all the faithful entrusted to their care .
He urged them warmly to welcome disaffected Anglicans who wanted to join the Catholic Church .
It has offered Anglicans the prospect of their own hierarchies - ordinariates - within the Catholic system , leading to predictions that whole congregations opposed to plans for women bishops may transfer from the Church of England .
Despite this , Anglican Archbishop of York John Sentamu said the Pope would be " very welcome " .
He told BBC News : " I 've met him in Rome .
We had wonderful conversations and whatever people may think about the ordinariate , they should n't use that as a reason for not accepting one of our great Christian leaders . "
Protest petition
The Pope 's remarks about equality legislation in the UK have been interpreted as a reference to legislation forcing religious adoption agencies to accept gay clients .
Religious leaders have also voiced concern about the government 's flagship Equality Bill , saying it may force churches to employ sexually active gay people and transsexuals when hiring staff other than priests or ministers .
During his address , the Pope urged the bishops to ensure the Church 's moral teaching was always presented in its " entirety " and " convincingly defended " .
He said : " Your country is well - known for its firm commitment to equality of opportunity for all members of society .
" Yet , as you have rightly pointed out , the effect of some of the legislation designed to achieve this goal has been to impose unjust limitations on the freedom of religious communities to act in accordance with their beliefs .
The taxpayer in this country is going to be faced with a bill of some £ 20 m for the visit of the Pope .
A visit in which he has already indicated , he will attack equal rights and promote discrimination
Terry Sanderson
National Secular Society
" In some respects it actually violates the natural law upon which the equality of all human beings is grounded and by which it is guaranteed . "
He also urged the bishops to continue to insist upon their right to participate in national debate through " respectful dialogue with other elements in society " .
By doing so , the Pope said , they would be " maintaining long - standing British traditions of freedom of expression and honest exchange of opinion " as well as " giving voice to the convictions of many people who lack the means to express them " .
A spokesperson from the Government Equalities Office said the Pope had acknowledged the UK's " firm commitment to equality for all members of society " .
" We believe everyone should have a fair chance in life and not be discriminated against .
The Equality Bill will make Britain a fairer and more equal place , " the spokesperson added .
The National Secular Society ( NSS ) said it would mount a protest campaign made up of gay groups , victims of clerical abuse , feminists , family planning organisations and pro-abortion groups , among others .
President Terry Sanderson said : " The taxpayer in this country is going to be faced with a bill of some £ 20 m for the visit of the Pope .
" A visit in which he has already indicated , he will attack equal rights and promote discrimination .
" We have a petition online where people can make clear their opposition to the state funding of this visit .
If the Catholic Church wishes its leader to come here , it should pay for the visit itself . "

At BIG we practice knowledge driven design .
To stretch the boundaries of the physical , financial , regulatory and environmental limits of design , we need to surround ourselves with the best experts in the fields outside our own expertise in architecture .
With an in - house team of engineers , we have learned how much more impactful our design thinking gets – having this expertise internally is the inevitable step towards the silo shattering interdisciplinary design innovation that we want to bring to the world .
BIG E covers a wide range of disciplines including structural and MEP engineering as well as indoor climate , daylight and energy analysis .
We work closely with our architects and designers from conception to completion and focus on creating an engineering story which compliments and reinforces the architectural narrative .
BIG E not only considers what structural solutions are economic and buildable but , more importantly , how our knowledge of forces and materials can support our investigations and architecture .
Statical studies show how the flow of force may shape the building form , how the disposition of columns may help to delineate between different functions or how the arrangement of roof beams may modify natural light .
Our solutions are often developed from the bottom - up as a direct consequence of site - specific environmental conditions .
Technical simulations are used to understand the complex interaction between the built environment and the natural environment , such as daylight , acoustic comfort , shadow casting , solar radiation to inform a wide variety of architectural concerns ranging from the overall massing and orientation of the building to the specification of the ventilation system and facade .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Virginia finally is poised to repeal its unusual law that prohibits law - abiding citizens from buying more than one gun per month .
It ’s about time , because the red tape has not had the desired effect in lowering crime .
There is no academic research by criminologists or economists that shows that one - gun - a - month regulations reduce crime in either the states that pass them or their neighbors .
The laws have merely inconvenienced honest Americans who want to buy guns .
Besides Virginia , only Maryland , California and New Jersey still have these laws .
South Carolina was the first state to adopt the restrictions in 1976 but repealed the limit in 2004 .
New Jersey has had the law on the books for less than two months now .
Contrary to the nanny - state notion that gun control is good , gun limitations are actually harmful .
The book “ The Bias Against Guns ” shows that one - gun - a - month rules significantly reduce the number of gun shows , because they reduce the number of sales that can occur .
For the same reason , it ’s likely the regulation reduces the number of gun dealers .
The reduction in legal sources to buy guns can raise the cost of law - abiding citizens buying guns relative to criminals , and thus disarm good people relative to criminals .
The book “ More Guns , Less Crime , ” the only peer - reviewed research on one - gun - a - month restrictions , from the University of Chicago Press , shows the laws either have no effect or a detrimental effect on violent crime .
The Brady Campaign claims that Virginia ’s one - gun - a - month law reduced the number of crime guns traced to Virginia dealers , but it provides no link to crime rates , which is ultimately the bottom line .
If people around the nation ’s capital should understand anything , it is how hard it is to keep criminals from getting guns .
The District of Columbia banned handguns entirely , and murder rates still soared .
Criminals got ahold of guns despite the law , because by nature they do n’t care about breaking laws , and they ca n’t buy guns legally anyway .
The question ought to be focused on whom these laws prevent from getting guns , and the evidence is that law - abiding citizens are the ones who are stopped .
One - gun - a - month rules are similar to gun bans and waiting periods , which tend to disarm victims relative to criminals , and therefore , increase crime .
If possible , it ’s a good idea to keep guns from criminals , but laws that make it more difficult for law - abiding citizens to get guns relative to criminals cause more harm than good .
In the case of the right to keep and bear arms , safety and freedom go together .

Mike Woodson took a charge from Jason Kidd that ended up costing Atlanta .
ATLANTA -- Jason Kidd may be an old dog , but he still has some new tricks up his sleeve .
With 1:36 left in regulation in the Mavs ’ 111-103 overtime win over the Hawks , Kidd made a move he said he ’d never tried at any level .
It was the veteran move to end all veteran moves -- a player drawing contact from an opposing coach .
“ That play just presented itself , ” said Kidd .
“ It ’s just something that ’s reaction and understanding what the team needs . ”
Atlanta led 97-95 at the time as Kidd dribbled down the left sideline and saw Hawks coach Mike Woodson a full step into the court directing his players where to be on defense .
Woodson did n’t see Kidd barreling toward him , but Kidd knew exactly how to take advantage .
The 36 - year - old vet dribbled even further left than normal , straight toward Woodson , and made sure he drew contact .
Woodson leaped away at the last minute , but he ’s been retired for 20 years now and his instincts are n’t quite as sharp as when he was starring for the Kansas City Kings .
The result ?
Contact between Kidd ’s extended forearm and Woodson ’s chest , and an automatic technical foul on Atlanta .
Dirk Nowitzki ’s free throw gave Dallas a key point that cut the Hawks ’ lead in half -- one that proved crucial since the game eventually went to overtime .
“ I went in a straight line , ” said Kidd .
“ If I ca n’t beat him [ to the spot ] , I ’m in trouble . ”
“ [ The official ] said I was on the floor , ” said Woodson .
“ I tried to move back and I was moving back and [ Kidd ] reached over the line and grabbed me . ”
As near as anyone can tell , this was one of the few instances of such a play ever happening -- one coming when Milwaukee coach Del Harris collided with Denver guard Michael Adams in 1991 .
That play , however , happened because Harris walked on to the court to protest a call ; Adams never intended to cross paths with him .
Then Sonics coach Bob Hill " fouled " Rip Hamilton in 2006 .
This play , on the other hand , happened because Kidd forced it to happen .
Teammate Jason
Terry called it the smartest play he ’d ever seen .
“ I saw him on the court , and we needed to get us a point somehow , ” said Kidd .
“ I made the officials make something happen .
He ’s not supposed to be on the floor but for some reason it ’s a fashion thing for coaches to be out on the floor …
I ’m surprised it has n’t happened more . ”
Kidd and Woodson shared some words immediately afterward , but it was n’t bad blood as much as immediate lobbying to the refs for what to call .
“ He was talking like I tried to take him out , ” said Kidd .
“ I was saying you ca n’t be on the floor , you ’re a coach , you ’ve got no uniform on . ”
As both Carlisle and Mavs owner Mark Cuban pointed out afteward , it should have been a technical foul on Woodson regardless since he was well out of the coaching box .
But it likely would have slid had Kidd not forced the officials to make the call -- Woodson is n’t the first coach to wander on the court while giving defensive instructions .
“ Sometimes you take a step or two [ out ] , ” said Mavs coach Rick Carlisle .
“ It ’s very rare to see a coach out as far as he was , but it does happen . ”
Kidd ’s veteran move was one of two rare plays he contributed to in the fourth to help rally Dallas from a 13 - point deficit in the last five and a half minutes of regulation .
The other was a five - point play with 4:50 to go that cut Atlanta ’s lead from 11 to six .
First , Dallas got a foul and basket from Brendan Haywood .
When he missed the subsequent free throw , Kidd grabbed the offensive rebound and quickly pitched it out to an open Jason Terry , who sank a 3 .
That sequence was part of a lightning fast 12 - 0 Dallas run that took just 1:39 .
Kidd ’s fingerprints were all over it -- after the five - point play , he stole a pass to Joe Johnson and threw ahead to J.J. Barea for a run-out lay - up , then found Dirk Nowitzki for a wide - open 3 on the next trip .
Kidd , who finished with 19 points , 17 assists and 16 rebounds in what Carlisle termed “ an all - time great performance , ” then teamed with Nowitzki ( 37 points ) to finish off the Hawks in OT .
Kidd posted Mike Bibby with the Mavs up by four and 1:06 left and , when Atlanta ’s Josh Smith inexplicably doubled him , kicked to an open Nowitzki for a 3 - pointer that all but sealed it .
Nonetheless , it was a play Kidd made that did nothing for his own stat line that everyone in both locker rooms talked about afterward .
“ He did what he had to do , ” said Woodson .
“ I ’ve got to take the hit for that . ”
New research suggests that evolutionary changes in cognitive development underlie the extensive social and behavioral differences that exist between two closely related species of great apes .
The study , published online on January 28th in Current Biology , a Cell Press publication , enhances our understanding of our two closest living relatives , chimpanzees and the lesser - known bonobos , and may provide key insight into human evolution .
Although chimpanzees and bonobos have a very close genetic relationship with each other , the two species display major differences in their physical appearance , behavior , and cognition .
For example , when compared to chimpanzees , bonobos seem to be much more peaceful and easygoing , retaining juvenile levels of play as adults , exhibiting low levels of aggression towards one another , and being much more likely than adult chimpanzees to share resources .
It has been suggested that these differences might be a result of species - specific shifts in the developmental pathways that link infancy with adulthood .
" Thus far , there has been no direct test of the hypothesis that certain aspects of behavior or cognition in adult bonobos represent developmentally delayed forms of the traits found in chimpanzees , " explains the lead study author , Victoria Wobber of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University .
" We tested this hypothesis by comparing skills of semi - free - ranging infant , juvenile , and adult bonobos and chimpanzees in three feeding competition tasks , given the prediction that this area in particular differs between the two species . "
Wobber and colleagues observed that as chimpanzees reached adulthood , they became more and more intolerant of sharing food , whereas bonobos retained juvenile levels of food - related tolerance .
Furthermore , chimpanzees consistently outperformed bonobos of the same age in tests where the subjects had to out which experimenters held a food reward .
" Bonobos took longer to develop the same skill level shown even among the youngest of the chimpanzees that were tested , " says Wobber .
" It seemed as if adult chimpanzees were able to exhibit more social restraint than adult bonobos . "
The findings support the hypothesis that developmental delays play a role in shaping differences in the social psychology and behavior of chimpanzees and bonobos .
" Taken together , our results indicate that these social and cognitive differences between these two closely related species result from evolutionary changes in brain development , " says Wobber .
" Intriguingly , it has been suggested that the crucial cognitive adaptation of humans relative to other apes may be the accelerated development of social skills in infants .
If we can understand the evolutionary processes by which developmental changes occurred in bonobos , perhaps inferences can be made about our own species ' evolution . "
IED student Basil Kurkova figures , like the rest of Chrysler , Jeep 's going to need to adopt some Fiat platforms .
Before you grab your pitchforks know this : the Panda 4x4 is unbelievably capable on the dirty stuff .

The Fiat Panda 4x4 features a viscous differential that engages the rear wheels when front wheel slip causes the oil to heat up .
It 's an amazingly simple and reliable system and it's also ideal for hoons , the best way to make progress off road in the little Panda is to floor the throttle and keep it there , no matter what the obstacle .
The small size ( it 's only 62 inches wide and weighs just 2,150 Lbs ) also helps , meaning you can go around rather an over obstacles .

Those characteristics sound great for a small off - roader that sits under the Wrangler in the Jeep lineup .
It 'd be cheap , it'd be fuel efficient , it'd be fun and , according to these drawings , it 'd look awesome .
Let 's just hope the idea makes it out of this student designer 's mind and into reality .

LONDON -- Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair will give his highly anticipated testimony to an inquiry into the Iraq war next week , the panel said Monday .
When he goes before the inquiry , Mr. Blair is likely to be questioned about accusations that he offered President George W. Bush support for an invasion as early as April 2002 -- a year before legislators approved Britain 's involvement .

The elegant 101 - story skyscraper will be ( for a moment , at least ) the world ’s tallest when completed in early 2008
Bibliotheca Alexandrina ( Egypt ) – Because of its proximity to the sea , the architects and engineers had to deal with saline - infused ground which called for sophisticated geotechnical analyses and an intricately designed foundation and structural design .
Four levels of the building are below ground , while the remaining seven floors of the disk - shaped building soar into the air .
The exterior wall is clad in 4,000 granite blocks , carved with text and letters , and the roof is topped with solar sails that can be adjusted to allow sunlight inside .
Seattle Public Library ( USA ) – The resulting 11 - floor , 362,987 - sq.- ft. library is a dazzling display of glass and steel .
In all , 4,644 tons of steel were used in the building , the equivalent of 20 Statues of Liberty , while the outstanding engineering of the building ’s grid system is designed to withstand high winds or earthquakes .
Inside , the building houses a 275 - seat auditorium , a 50 - foot living room , and an instantly legendary Book Spiral in a continuous run of books , organized by Dewey decimal number , that has room for the collection to expand .
Central Chinese Television ( China ) – The design of the new Central Chinese Television ( CCTV ) headquarters defies the popular conception of a skyscraper — and it broke Beijing ’s building codes and required approval by a special review panel .
The standard systems for engineering gravity and lateral loads in buildings did n’t apply to the CCTV building , which is formed by two leaning towers , each bent 90 degrees at the top and bottom to form a continuous loop .

Two feet of snow , topped with a daily layer of fresh powder , to be exact — thanks to the system of 23 blast coolers and snow guns inside Ski Dubai .
It might be 135 degrees Fahrenheit outdoors , but inside the 32,290 square - foot , $ 275 million structure , visitors ski and snowboard .
The heavily insulated facility also includes the world ’s largest indoor snow park , offering 9,842 square feet for sledding or bobsledding .
Fiera de Milano ( Italy ) – An international consortium of marquee - name architects — London ’s Hadid , Tokyo ’s Isozaki , New York and Zurich - based Libeskind , and Torino ’s Maggiora — was chosen to redesign the trade - fair district of Milan .
The quartet ’s joint concept for updating the area of the gritty Northern Italian city centers around an “ archipelago ” - style layout that the architects say does n’t duplicate any existing urban plans .
The collaboration promises to produce an intentionally varied set of neighborhoods - within - a- neighborhood .
The plan calls for a central park area , and clusters of commercial high - rises that are designed not only to reflect the signature styles of the four architects involved , but carefully proportioned and positioned to provide shade for pedestrians .
A discovery by Babraham scientists brings new insight into how cells are reprogrammed and a greater understanding of how the environment , or factors like nutritional signals , can interact with our genes to affect health .
As an embryo develops , cells acquire a particular fate , for example becoming a nerve or skin cell .
The findings , reported online in the journal Nature , pinpoint a protein called AID as being important for complete cellular reprogramming in mammals .
In addition , these findings may advance the field of regenerative medicine , by potentially enhancing our ability to guide the reversal of cell fate , and pave the way for novel therapeutics .
Cell fate is governed not only by the genome , but also by chemical changes to DNA and its associated proteins , a research field called epigenetics .
Modifying DNA by methylation for example , alters the DNA structure but not its sequence .
These ' epigenetic ' tags are one of the ways that genes get switched on or off in different places at different times , enabling different tissues and organs to arise from a single fertilised egg .
When epigenetic processes go awry , diseases may occur .
Epigenetics is therefore emerging as an important research area with relevance to understanding many adult conditions like heart disease , diabetes , obesity , cancer and autoimmune disorders .
Professor Wolf Reik , Associate Director at the Babraham Institute and Professor of Epigenetics at the University of Cambridge who led the research said , " With numerous human , animal and plant genomes now sequenced a key question is how genomes are regulated in normal development , health and disease .
Altered regulation of the epigenome is likely to underlie many human diseases so unlocking the principles of reprogramming can be harnessed to benefit regenerative medicine and stem cell therapy . "
This research at Babraham , an institute of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) , reveals that AID plays an intriguing role in erasing the chemical marks that appear on the genome as an embryo develops and determine what a cell 's identity will be .
AID appears to be involved in removing the epigenetic tags from DNA by a process called demethylation , which has long been known to be a critical component of cellular reprogramming .
A study published recently in Nature from Helen Blau 's lab in Stanford backs up the findings that AID is important for reprogramming .
While it has been known that epigenetic modifications to the genome get erased and re-established in the early embryo , precisely how and the extent to which this occurs had remained elusive .
This collaboration between scientists at Babraham , the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and University of California at Los Angeles ( UCLA ) reveals for the first time the massive extent to which erasure of epigenetic tags occurs in mammals , erasing the epigenome between generations .
They discovered that methylation levels drop from 80 % to a staggering 7 % before being re-established again .
This defines the level of epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation patterns between generations and is identifying parts of the genome apparently more resistant to reprogramming than others .
Reik explained , " Whole epigenomes can now be unravelled and understood thanks to Next Generation Sequencing technology which we used in collaboration with the UCLA team , and which we also have at the Babraham , a partner in the East Anglia Sequencing and Informatics Hub . "
The Aid gene is normally switched on early as the embryo develops , however , the Babraham team found that if the AID protein is missing in cells , the methylation patterns are not thoroughly wiped clean and an epigenetic ' memory ' is inherited .
Commenting on the discovery Reik said , " Clear mechanisms for DNA demethylation have been elusive for some time .
The body of evidence is now pointing to indirect demethylation through the action of key enzymes such as AID . "
Environmental factors can also affect the genome , producing epigenetic changes that influence cell behaviour .
Reik added , " It is now well established that epigenetics is the ' integrator ' between the environment and the genome and that external factors like nutritional signals may have consequences later in life or on future generations .
There is also the possibility that epigenetic information could be inherited across generations , providing a shorter term and flexible type of inheritance in response to environmental signals .
The ability to unravel whole epigenomes during normal development and healthy ageing , and to understand how epigenomes are modified by the environment is extremely exciting . "
It is known that removing epigenetic information from the genome can induce adult cells to regain stem - cell like properties ( induced pluripotent stem cells , iPS cells ) .
Inducing ' pluripotency ' is of direct relevance to regenerative medicine as it enables specific cell populations and tissues to be generated from and for patients .
Currently reprogramming is inefficient because of the memory imparted by DNA methylation tags .
These new findings pinpointing how DNA demethylation can be driven , may overcome a significant barrier in producing iPS cells .
The identification of proteins like AID , that drive epigenetic signalling , is an important advance in basic biomedical research , which may help define new targets and therapeutics for diseases including cancer .
The Babraham team are pursuing commercial applications in collaboration with the company CellCentric .
" Epigenetics is a growing area of academic research and commercial development .
By understanding what proteins cause cell fate change , new tools and methods can be designed for both regenerative medicine and the treatment of intractable diseases .
Specifically , the identification of AID and its activity may offer the ability to test the importance of gene - specifc demethylation , as well as the potential to overcome a pivotal epigenetic barrier in reprogramming cells for induced pluripotent cell production , " explained Dr Will West , CEO of CellCentric .
No side effects ( Image : Dave Stock )
No ill effects were reported by hundreds of volunteers who took part in a mass - overdose stunt around the world to demonstrate that homeopathic remedies are nothing more than sugar pills .
“ There were no casualties at all , as far as I know , ” says Martin Robbins , spokesman for the “ 10:23 ” campaign , created to highlight the alleged ineffectiveness of homeopathic remedies .
“ No one was cured of anything either , ” says Robbins .
Like an estimated 300 volunteers in several cities in the UK , Australia , New Zealand , Canada and the US , he swallowed a bottleful of around 80 homeopathic “ pillules ” at exactly 10.23 am on Saturday .
Each pillule is a tiny sugar pill dabbed with a drop of a homeopathic remedy , produced through “ infinite ” dilution – the process whereby a solution is diluted to the point where no molecules of an active component are likely to remain .

They want to believe
Robbins says that the aim of the stunt was to draw attention to homeopathic medicine ’s lack of scientific foundation and to embarrass the British high - street pharmacist Boots into withdrawing its treatments from sale .
Responding to the stunt , Boots said : “ We know that many people believe in the benefits of complementary medicines and we aim to offer the products we know our customers want . ”
Robbins said that the campaign , conceived and orchestrated by the Merseyside Skeptics Society , would be a success if it prompted the public to ask more questions about what homeopathy actually is .
Jayney Goddard of the UK ’s Complementary Medical Association condemned the action .
“ The stunt was just that – a simple , rather silly and irresponsible stunt , ” she told New Scientist . ” There was no real understanding if the principles of homeopathy
WASHINGTON ( Army News Service , Feb. 19 , 2010 ) -- Starting this summer , Soldiers sent to fight in Afghanistan will wear an Army Combat Uniform with the " MultiCam " pattern instead of the standard - issue universal camouflage pattern .
Secretary of the Army John McHugh made that announcement Feb. 19 , after the service conducted a rigorous four - month evaluation of various uniform patterns to determine what could best protect Soldiers in Afghanistan .
The new uniforms are of the same material and cut that Soldiers are already wearing in the Army Combat Uniform or ACU .
It is the camouflage printed on the fabric that will be different .
The change allows commanders in Afghanistan to have more options in deciding how best to equip their Soldiers .
" As a material provider , I want to be responsive to the Soldiers I support , " said Col. William E. Cole , project manager for Soldier Protection and Individual Equipment .
" I want to give commanders options , I want to be responsive to Soldiers .
That is what we were trying to do -- we 're working to give ( them ) more options .
"
The uniforms bearing the new pattern , like the latest ACUs , are fire resistant .
They are officially called the Fire Resistant Army Combat Uniform .
The decision to use the MultiCam pattern came after the Army evaluated its effectiveness at providing camouflage protection in Iraq .
That was done , in part , by consulting with nearly 750 Soldiers who had deployed to Afghanistan .
Those Soldiers participated in a " photo simulation " study administered by the Army .
Additionally , feedback from Soldiers who have already worn the uniform in Afghanistan was used to make the final decision .
About 2,000 Soldiers were involved in tests to see how effective patterns such as MultiCam and UCP - Delta were at providing concealment in the varying terrain of Afghanistan .

AVENGING ANGELS Ad Policy Countdown .
The slideshow featured lobbyists who appeared on TV news as analysts without disclosing their corporate affiliations , and in that context it may have created the false impression that Dean is a lobbyist or that he used his Countdown appearance to promote his law firm 's clients .
Neither is true in Dean 's case .
The article included only one sentence about Dean , whose law firm consults for pharmaceutical companies , and did not suggest that Dean had done anything unethical .
But MSNBC , by having him host Countdown without disclosing his firm 's consultancy , created a potential conflict of interest of which viewers were unaware .
As the article points out , the practice is commonplace at all TV news networks , which bear the ultimate journalistic responsibility .
Editor 's Note :
The online slideshow Faces of the Media - Lobbying Complex , which accompanied this March 1 cover story ( Sebastian Jones , " The Media - Lobbying Complex " ) , initially began with an image of Governor Howard Dean from his appearance as a guest host on MSNBC's .

President Obama spent most of December 4 touring Allentown , Pennsylvania , meeting with local workers and discussing the economic crisis .
A few hours later , the state ’s former governor , Tom Ridge , was on MSNBC ’s Hardball With Chris Matthews , offering up his own recovery plan .
There were “ modest things ” the White House might try , like cutting taxes or opening up credit for small businesses , but the real answer was for the president to “ take his green agenda and blow it out of the box . ”
The first step , Ridge explained , was to “ create nuclear power plants . ”
Combined with some waste coal and natural gas extraction , you would have an “ innovation setter ” that would “ create jobs , create exports . ”
As Ridge counseled the administration to “ put that package together , ” he sure seemed like an objective commentator .
But what viewers were n’t told was that since 2005 , Ridge has pocketed $ 530,659 in executive compensation for serving on the board of Exelon , the nation ’s largest nuclear power company .
As of March 2009 , he also held an estimated $ 248,299 in Exelon stock , according to SEC filings .
Moments earlier , retired general and “ NBC Military Analyst ” Barry McCaffrey told viewers that the war in Afghanistan would require an additional “ three - to ten - year effort ” and “ a lot of money . ”
Unmentioned was the fact that DynCorp paid McCaffrey $ 182,309 in 2009 alone .
The government had just granted DynCorp a five - year deal worth an estimated $ 5.9 billion to aid American forces in Afghanistan .
The first year is locked in at $ 644 million , but the additional four options are subject to renewal , contingent on military needs and political realities .
In a single hour , two men with blatant , undisclosed conflicts of interest had appeared on MSNBC .
The question is , was this an isolated oversight or business as usual ?
Evidence points to the latter .
In 2003 The Nation exposed McCaffrey ’s financial ties to military contractors he had promoted on - air on several cable networks ; in 2008 David Barstow wrote a Pulitzer Prize - winning series for the New York Times about the Pentagon ’s use of former military officers–many lobbying or consulting for military contractors –to get their talking points on television in exchange for access to decision - makers ; and in 2009 bloggers uncovered how ex-Newsweek writer Richard Wolffe had guest - hosted Countdown With Keith Olbermann while working at a large PR firm specializing in “ strategies for managing corporate reputation . ”
These incidents represent only a fraction of the covert corporate influence peddling on cable news , a four - month investigation by The Nation has found .
Since 2007 at least seventy - five registered lobbyists , public relations representatives and corporate officials –people paid by companies and trade groups to manage their public image and promote their financial and political interests –have appeared on MSNBC , Fox News , CNN , CNBC and Fox Business Network with no disclosure of the corporate interests that had paid them .
Many have been regulars on more than one of the cable networks , turning in dozens–and in some cases hundreds –of appearances .
For lobbyists , PR firms and corporate officials , going on cable television is a chance to promote clients and their interests on the most widely cited source of news in the United States .
These appearances also generate good will and access to major players inside the Democratic and Republican parties .
For their part , the cable networks , eager to fill time and afraid of upsetting the political elite , have often looked the other way .
At times , the networks have even disregarded their own written ethics guidelines .
Just about everyone involved is heavily invested in maintaining the current system , with the exception of the viewer .
While lobbyists and PR flacks have long tried to spin the press , the launch of Fox News and MSNBC in 1996 and the Clinton impeachment saga that followed helped create the caldron of twenty - four - hour political analysis that so many influence peddlers call home .
Since then , guests with serious conflicts of interest have popped up with alarming regularity on every network .
Just examine their presence in coverage of the economic crash and the healthcare reform debate , two recent issues that have engendered massive cable coverage .
As the recession slammed the country in late 2008 and government bailouts followed , lobbyists and PR flacks took to the air with troubling regularity , advocating on behalf of clients and their interests while masquerading as neutral analysts .
One was Bernard Whitman , president of Whitman Insight Strategies , a communications firm that specializes in helping “ guide successful lobbying , communications and information campaigns through targeted research . ”
Whitman ’s clients have included lobbying firms like BGR Group and marketing / PR firms like Ogilvy & Mather , which in turn have numerous corporate clients with a vested interest in shaping federal policies .
Whitman is a veteran of the Clinton era and when making television appearances continues to be identified for work he did almost a decade earlier .
According to its website , Whitman Insight Strategies has worked for AIG to “ develop , test , launch , and enhance their consumer brand , ” and continues to assist the insurance giant “ as it responds to ongoing marketplace developments . ”
Whitman Strategies has also posted more than 100 clips of Bernard Whitman ’s television appearances on a YouTube account .
During a September 18 , 2008 , Fox News appearance to discuss Sarah Palin , Whitman proceeded to lambaste John McCain for proposing to “ let AIG fail , ” saying that this demonstrated “ just how little he understands the global economy today . ”
On March 25 , 2009 , in the midst of a scandal over AIG ’s executive bonuses , Whitman appeared on Fox News again .
“ The American people were understandably outraged about AIG , ” he began .
“ Having said that , we need to move beyond anger , frustration and hysteria to really get down to the brass tacks of solving this economy , ” he advised the public .
In neither instance was Whitman ’s ongoing work for AIG mentioned .
Another person with AIG ties is Ron Christie , now at the helm of his own consultancy .
While working at Republican - leaning firm DC Navigators , now Navigators Global , from 2006 through September 2008 , Christie was registered to lobby on behalf of the insurance giant , lobbying filings show .
During that period , AIG shelled out $ 590,000 to DC Navigators .
On September 18 , 2008 , Christie went on Hardball to discuss the government ’s response to AIG ’s near implosion days earlier .
He was introduced only as a Republican strategist .
As Chris Matthews mocked a presidential press conference on the financial crisis held earlier that day , Christie interrupted to say President Bush was “ smart to have gotten a former person from Goldman Sachs who is a very bright man , who understands the markets and liquidity . ”
Christie was referring to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , who had once been the chair and CEO of Goldman Sachs and who played a pivotal role in the AIG bailout .
“ This is not a political sideshow .
This is putting the right person in his administration to deal with this crisis , ” Christie said .
Bigger players were on AIG ’s payroll , too : shortly after receiving its first bailout , in 2008 , AIG hired PR mega - firm Burson - Marsteller to handle “ controversial issues . ”
In April 2009 , B - M hired former White House press secretary Dana Perino , already an established TV pundit .
A month later she was picked up as a contributor to Fox News , where she has had occasion to discuss the economic meltdown .
This past July , for example , Perino joined a roundtable on Fox Business Network ’s Money for Breakfast , which briefly noted her affiliation with B - M but neglected to mention its link to AIG .
When a fellow guest commented that AIG had been “ highly regulated ” before the crash , Perino pounced , suggesting that current financial reform efforts demonstrate how “ Washington has a tendency to overreact in a crisis . ”
When Gary Kalman of USPIRG suggested that regulations had , in fact , been rolled back for decades , Perino scoffed , “ I do n’t think there are many business people who would actually agree with that . ”
( Whitman , Christie and Perino did not return requests for comment . )
Another conflict of interest plagued the televised debate over how to reform healthcare .
Terry Holt , once a spokesman for the Republican National Committee and for House minority leader John Boehner , has also been , on and off since 2003 , a lobbyist for the health insurance trade group America ’s Health Insurance Plans .
When he and three other Republican operatives formed communications and lobbying firm HDMK in 2007 , one of their first clients was AHIP .
On March 5 , 2009 , Holt , introduced simply as a Republican , told MSNBC anchor David Shuster that the Obama administration was “ going to , you know , cut Medicare benefits for something like 11 million seniors to start this big healthcare reform project . ”
By October AHIP was running ads in several states against the health reform bill that asked , “ Is it right to ask 10 million seniors on Medicare Advantage for more than their fair share ? ”
Holt also made several appearances to discuss healthcare policy on CNN , where his affiliation with insurers was cited on several occasions , starting in September , though not during a September 14 appearance on The Situation Room , when Holt discussed healthcare reform efforts .
The network subsequently experienced a small scandal in October when blogger Greg Sargent revealed that political analyst Alex Castellanos , a frequent commentator on CNN , had been helping craft attack ads for AHIP –including the one that referred to the “ 10 million seniors ” losing Medicare benefits –while discussing healthcare policy on air , identified only as a Republican strategist .
When I interviewed Holt recently , he told me that there was one occasion when his work for AHIP was not mentioned on CNN , and that afterward , a producer contacted him to discuss his work for the trade group .
Holt said that he believes that cable appearances “ operate best with maximum transparency . ”
“ When you ’re addressing the public , it ’s a reasonable expectation that they be fully aware of your perspective–where you ’re coming from–and I see my obligation as informing the news organization that ’s asking me to appear or to comment about my standing and letting them be the judge , ” he said .
Democratic lobbyists and corporate consultants have also made appearances to discuss health reform with no reference to their pharmaceutical or insurance company clients .
On September 24 , 2009 , Dick Gephardt appeared on MSNBC ’s Morning Meeting , where he labeled the public option “ not essential . ”
Gephardt was asked by host Dylan Ratigan to discuss healthcare reform in light of his experience as a Congressman during the Clinton effort in 1993 and now simply as “ an observer through this process . ”
There was no mention of his work advising insurance and pharmaceutical interests through his lobbying firm Gephardt Government Affairs , nor any mention that Gephardt is a lobbyist for NBC / Universal .
Likewise , Tom Daschle dropped by MSNBC on May 12 and July 2 , 2009 , and NBC’s Meet the Press on August 16 , 2009 .
At each appearance he discussed healthcare reform with no mention of his work on behalf of lobbying firm Alston & Bird , which advises insurer UnitedHealth Group .
Only during a December 8 appearance on MSNBC’s Dr. Nancy was Daschle finally confronted , albeit with kid gloves , about how his simultaneous work for lobbying firms on behalf of health insurers and meetings with administration officials on healthcare reform appeared to be at odds .
“ I certainly want to be appreciative of perception , so we ’re going to take great care in how we go forward , ” Daschle promised .
A month later , on January 11 , the former Senate majority leader returned to MSNBC to discuss healthcare with Andrea Mitchell .
In the nearly ten - minute interview , his insurance work went unmentioned .
As of this writing , healthcare and financial reform legislation have largely stalled .
And although it would be foolish to argue that Daschle ’s TV appearances sank the public option or that Dana Perino ’s punditry fatally wounded a proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency , there can be no doubt that there is a cumulative effect from hundreds of appearances by dozens of unidentified lobbyists and influence peddlers that helps to drive press coverage and public opinion .
Janine Wedel , an anthropologist in the School of Public Policy at George Mason University and author of the new book Shadow Elite , told me in a recent interview that while these influence peddlers are not necessarily unethical , they “ elude accountability to governments , shareholders and voters–and threaten democracy . ”
“ When there ’s a whole host of pundits on the airwaves touting the same agenda at the same time , you get a cumulative effect that shapes public opinion toward their agenda , ” she said .
Frequent television news commentators are also often given access to policy - makers , who may find that they are meeting with not just a TV pundit but also a paid lobbyist .
This past March , for example , the White House held an exclusive “ communications message meeting ” for high - profile Democratic strategists with top presidential aide David Axelrod .
Of the eighteen attendees , almost all television regulars , a third were lobbyists or public relations flacks , such as Kelly Bingel , a lobbyist for AHIP and a partner at mega - firm Mehlman Vogel Castagnetti , and Rich Masters , a partner at PR / lobbying outfit Qorvis Communications , where he works on behalf of trade group Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers of America ( PhRMA ) .
Ultimately , no matter how often or how cleverly lobbyists and PR operatives have used cable news appearances to their business advantage , it is hard to fault them for the practice .
In many cases , they have made no attempt to hide their work for corporate clients ; some , like Terry Holt , have gone out of their way to inform producers and bookers of the work they ’re doing on behalf of clients .
This leaves final responsibility in the hands of the cable news networks that invite lobbyists and corporate flacks on the air and fail to identify their affiliations .
This past fall Aaron Brown , host of CNN ’s NewsNight from 2001 until 2005 , when the network pushed him out , and currently a professor of journalism at Arizona State University , told me that he did n’t think the problem was a lack of standards but a lack of enforcement .
Bookers – “ young , inexperienced people under a lot of pressure ” –are unlikely to ask guests about potential conflicts of interest .
“ I think they ’re often derelict in vetting , ” says Brown .
For Brown , though , the lack of disclosure is symptomatic of larger problems in cable journalism , rooted in the shift to putting numerous analysts and strategists on television as an easy , inexpensive way to fill time .
It ’s “ a lot cheaper than sending a correspondent to Afghanistan , ” he says .
“ What I find unconscionable about this is that it ’s not like a struggling newspaper is looking for an inexpensive way to do journalism because they have no money .
These are highly successful profit centers for the corporations that they ’re spawned from , ” Brown said .
Jeff Cohen , who helped found the nonprofit group Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) , echoes some of Brown ’s critiques .
Cohen worked for MSNBC for several months in 2002 and published a book in 2006 , Cable News Confidential , about the experience .
When I asked him why men like Gephardt and McCaffrey could go on television with no reference to their consulting and lobbying , Cohen explained that , based on his experience at MSNBC , “ these regulars get introduced the way they want to be introduced .
“ This is the key : Gephardt will always be the former majority leader of the House .
Period … .
These guys know they wo n’t be identified by what they do now but instead by what their position was years or decades ago , ” Cohen said .
Some of this has changed in recent months , with CNN starting to identify the industries some analysts work for .
For its part , Fox News has long identified the lobbying or PR firms of some–though not all–guests , but the network does not give viewers any information about the kinds of clients these firms represent .
( CNN would not return calls , and Fox News did not provide comment . )
Then there ’s MSNBC , the cable network with the most egregious instances of airing guests with conflicts of interest .
Only on MSNBC did Todd Boulanger , a Jack Abramoff - connected lobbyist working for Cassidy and Associates , go on a TV rehabilitation tour with no identification of his work , all while he was under investigation for corruption ( he pleaded guilty in January 2009 ) .
Only on MSNBC was a prime - time program , Countdown , hosted by public relations operative Richard Wolffe and later by a pharmaceutical company consultant , former Governor Howard Dean , with no mention of the outside work either man was engaged in .
And MSNBC has yet to introduce DynCorp ’s Barry McCaffrey as anything but a “ military analyst . ”
When I spoke with MSNBC in mid-January , the network seemed eager to prove it is fixing the problem .
David McCormick , the ombudsman for NBC News , deals with questions about standards and practices at MSNBC .
( Both organizations use the same policies - and - guidelines booklet , which McCormick helped develop ; CNBC has more stringent disclosure requirements as a result of SEC rules . )
McCormick told me that the issue of conflict of interest has been on his mind of late .
He said that MSNBC intended to contact its guests and brief them on its disclosure policies , adding that “ trust is a huge part of the business ” and that the network relies on guests “ to let us know of any potential conflicts . ”
“ We ’ve been talking to our folks for a number of years about the importance of transparency and letting the viewers in on where folks–it could be contributors , analysts or experts that we do n’t pay–fit into the mosaic of a story , ” said McCormick .
“ Are we perfect about it ?
No . ”
In fact , potential conflicts of interest have been a topic of concern for more than a decade .
An October 1998 copy of the “ NBC News Policies and Guidelines ” devotes an entire chapter to “ Guests / Analysts / Experts / Advocates . ”
It states :
It is essential that our viewers understand the particular perspective of all guests , analysts and experts ( whether paid or not ) who appear on our programs … .
Our viewers need all relevant information so they can come to their own conclusions regarding the topic at hand .
It is not enough to say : “ John Doe of XYZ Foundation . ” … Likewise , it may not be enough to say Jane Doe , NBC consultant or analyst … .
Disclosure may be made in copy or visually .
But it must be done in a clear manner .
McCormick told me that financial conflicts of interest were “ in the same category as ideological or political interests , ” but also suggested that MSNBC ’s practice of posting information about guests on its website was an adequate way to air potential conflicts of interest .
McCormick emphasized that this reform was “ a work in progress . ”
A few days later , on January 22 , I happened to catch MSNBC ’s Morning Joe.
Mark Penn , identified only as a Clinton administration pollster and Democratic strategist , was suggesting that the Obama administration put healthcare reform on ice .
Unmentioned : Penn ’s role as worldwide CEO of Burson - Marsteller , which has an entire healthcare division devoted to helping clients like Eli Lilly and Pfizer “ create and manage perceptions that deliver positive business results . ”
At times , it begins to seem as though the problem is beyond fixing , an unfortunate but unavoidable reality of our media and political landscape , in which the lines between public service and corporate advancement are so blurred .
It is clear that the pressure applied on the networks so far has not resulted in systemic change .
Even in the aftermath of increasing scrutiny –particularly after David Barstow ’s Pulitzer Prize - winning exposés in the Times–General McCaffrey continues to appear on television without any caveats about his work for military contractors .
As Salon blogger Glenn Greenwald has observed , none of the networks involved in the scandal have ever bothered to address Barstow ’s findings on air , and they noticeably omitted Barstow ’s name from coverage of the 2009 Pulitzers .
“ It ’s almost like a mysterious black hole that this issue , which is enormous , is getting no attention from the offenders themselves , ” the Society for Professional Journalists ’ ethics committee chair Andy Schotz told me recently .
Jay Rosen , a media critic and journalism professor at New York University , has a different take .
“ More disclosure is good –I ’m certainly in favor of that –but why are these people on at all ? ” asks Rosen .
“ They have views and can manufacture opinions around any event at any time . ”
Rosen echoes something Brown mentioned to me .
Watching cable news cover the 2008 election with more analysts crammed at one table than ever before–as if to ask , “ How many people can we put on the set at one time ? ” – Brown said he was “ amazed how little they had to offer . ”
He went on , “ We live in a time where there are no shortages of opinions and an incredible deficit of facts . ”

So , when it finally does see the light of day it appears that John Malkovich will be bringing his own brand of avian malevolence to Sam Raimi ’s recently delayed Spider - Man 4 .
According to Comingsoon .net a translation from an Italian interview Malkovich confirms that not only is he playing the villain , he is still waiting for a final script to read .
The Italian website BadTaste.it did the translation and you can read the whole transcript on their site if you can read Italian , but the confirmation of Malkovich as Vulture is a good thing .
Always capable of imbuing a film with a steely - eyed gravitas he seems a natural successor to step in the trousers of moral turpitude , recently relinquished by Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe .
If Raimi has learned the lesson of the third film in the Spider - Man series then we wo n’t be seeing a flock of villain lining up to take out our friendly neighbourhood Spidey ; there is the possibility as Raimi has hinted in the past that Vulture would be accompanied by his fellow super villain Electro but with all the speculation as to roster of evil - doers it is probably best to wait for an official word .
With the Green Lantern movie joining
Thor in competing with the electric Kick - Ass on the superhero front , will Spider - Man 4 still ruffle feathers on release ?

The hirsuta crab was so unusual it warranted a whole new family designation
A preview of the Census of Marine Life has revealed that the project has discovered over 5,000 new species .
These include bizarre and colourful creatures , as well as many organisms that produce therapeutic chemicals .
A panel of scientists presented these early insights at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in San Diego .
The final report from the decade - long census will be released in October 2010 .
The project has involved more than 2,000 scientists from 80 countries , and the researchers involved believe the census will lay the scientific foundations for marine policies to protect vulnerable habitats .
Bottom trawling bulldozes through reef habitats that are thousands of years old
Jason Hall - Spencer
University of Plymouth
The researchers presented images of some of the most striking species discovered in the last decade , including a crab so unusual it warranted a whole new family designation .
This member of the new Kiwaidae family of crabs , discovered near Easter Island , was named Kiwa hirsuta because of its furry appearance .
One member of the panel , Shirley Pomponi , a scientist from Florida Atlantic University , highlighted a new species of sponge .
This was found in the Florida Keys in August of 1999 .
Further investigation revealed that it produced a chemical with anti-cancer properties , which is now being investigated as a potential therapeutic .
Dr Pomponi said : " Adaptation to life in the sea has resulted in the production of chemicals that not even the most advanced computer program could produce .
" Mother nature still makes the best chemicals . "
Bulldozing reefs
A major aim of the census is to provide the scientific support for the establishment of a global network of marine protected areas to prevent damage from fishing and other human activity .
This new sponge produces a chemical with anti-cancer properties Dr Jason Hall - Spencer , a marine biologist from the UK's University of Plymouth , said that delicate coral reefs were under threat from deep - sea trawling .
" All but one of the reefs I 've looked at has been very badly damaged by bottom trawling - where a fishing net is dragged along the sea floor , " he said .
" Bottom trawling bulldozes through reef habitats that are thousands of years old .
" But the good news is that we now have the data to change policy and work with fishermen to say where marine protected areas should be . "

Dear Google ,
With your purchase of On2 , you now own both the world 's largest video site ( YouTube ) and all the patents behind a new high performance video codec -- VP8 .
Just think what you can achieve by releasing the VP8 codec under an irrevocable royalty - free license and pushing it out to users on YouTube ?
You can end the web 's dependence on patent - encumbered video formats and proprietary software ( Flash ) .
To sit on this technology or merely use it as a bargaining chip would be a disservice to the free world , while bringing at best limited short - term benefits to your company .
To free VP8 without recommending it to YouTube users would be a wasted opportunity and damaging to free software browsers like Firefox .
We all want you to do the right thing .
Free VP8 , and use it on YouTube !
Why this would be amazing
The world would have a new free format unencumbered by software patents .
Viewers , video creators , free software developers , hardware makers -- everyone -- would have another way to distribute video without patents , fees , and restrictions .
The free video format Ogg Theora was already at least as good for web video ( see a comparison ) as its nonfree competitor H.264 , and we never did agree with your objections to using it .
But since you made the decision to purchase VP8 , presumably you 're confident it can meet even those objections , and using it on YouTube is a no-brainer .
You have the leverage to make such free formats a global standard .
YouTube is the world 's largest video site , home to nearly every digital video ever made .
If YouTube merely offered a free format as an option , that alone would bring support from a slew of device makers and applications .
This ability to offer a free format on YouTube , however , is only a tiny fraction of your real leverage .
The real party starts when you begin to encourage users ' browsers to support free formats .
There are lots of ways to do this .
Our favorite would be for YouTube to switch from Flash to free formats and HTML , offering users with obsolete browsers a plugin or a new browser ( free software , of course ) .
Apple has had the mettle to ditch Flash on the iPhone and the iPad -- albeit for suspect reasons and using abhorrent methods ( DRM ) -- and this has pushed web developers to make Flash - free alternatives of their pages .
You could do the same with YouTube , for better reasons , and it would be a death - blow to Flash 's dominance in web video .
But even some smaller actions would also have an impact .
You could interest users with HD videos in free formats , for example , or aggressively invite users to upgrade their browsers ( instead of upgrading Flash ) .
Steps like these on YouTube would quickly push browser support for free formats to 50 % and beyond , and they would slowly increase the number of people who never bother installing Flash .
If you care about free software and the free web ( a movement and medium to which you owe your success ) you must take bold action to replace Flash with free standards and free formats .
Patented video codecs have already done untold harm to the web and its users , and this will continue until we stop it .
Because patent - encumbered formats were costly to incorporate into browsers , a bloated , ill - suited piece of proprietary software ( Flash ) became the de facto standard for online video .
Until we move to free formats , the threat of patent lawsuits and licensing fees hangs over every software developer , video creator , hardware maker , web site and corporation -- including you .
You can use your purchase of On2 merely as a bargaining chip to achieve your own private solution to the problem , but that 's both a cop-out and a strategic mistake .
Without making VP8 a free format , it 's just another video codec .
And what use is another video format with patent - limited browser support ?
You owe it to the public and to the medium that made you successful to solve this problem , for all of us , forever .
Organizations like Xiph , Mozilla , Wikimedia , the FSF , and even On2 itself have recognized the need for free formats and fought hard to make it happen .
Now it 's your turn .
We 'll know if you do otherwise that your interest is not user freedom on the web , but Google 's dominance .
We all want you to do the right thing .
Free VP8 , and use it on YouTube !

The clean - up is continuing after a fuel spill at a refinery in Melbourne 's west .
An eight million litre tank began leaking unleaded petrol at the Mobil refinery in Altona , just before midnight .
The tank held 3.5 million litres of fuel and 16,000 litres leaked from the tank .
More than 50 fire fighters poured foam on the spill to stop the fumes from igniting , and the remaining fuel has been drained from the tank .
Bruce Dawson from the Environment Protection Agency ( EPA ) says there is no risk to the public , or the surrounding wetlands .
" The petrol that has leaked has been contained within a bund , " he said .
The Victorian Greens MP , Colleen Hartland , says the spill should not have happened at all .
She says the tanks at the Altona refinery are old , and poorly maintained .
" Every two years we have an accident like this , " she said .
" Every few years the Government says it wo n't happen again and it happens again . "
" So as a resident , you really start to lose faith in the prevention strategy , " she said .
Glen Henson , from Mobil has rejected the claims .
" We 've done a lot of work on tank maintenance and our objective is to get to these issues ahead of time , " he said .
The EPA will investigate what caused the spill .
Minnesota lawmakers plan to go after the pharmaceutical industry 's relationship with doctors again this year .
MPR Photo / Tom Scheck
A coalition of consumers , labor groups , doctors and insurers are asking Minnesota lawmakers to pass legislation that would make it harder for pharmaceutical companies to influence doctors .
When doctors prescribe medications to their patients , pharmacies track details of the prescriptions and sell that information to data - mining organizations .
Those data miners then buy another list of all the nation 's physicians and essentially match every doctor with every drug he or she has ever prescribed .
Researchers buy the information to study trends in prescribing practices , but pharmaceutical companies can buy the data too .
" They actually know exactly what your doctor is prescribing , " said Pete Wyckoff , the man leading the Minnesota coalition 's efforts at the Capitol .
Wyckoff said in 2008 , drug companies spent nearly $ 15 billion on direct physician marketing in the hopes of influencing their prescribing behavior .
" Pharmaceutical detail people have one major objective and that is to press and to sell the drugs of the manufacturer that they represent , " he said .
Your support matters .

A gift of $ 17 makes a difference .
Wyckoff said the influence of drug companies can lead to doctors over - prescribing newer , more - expensive drugs that may have riskier side - effects than older drugs .
He said one of the three bills the coalition is backing for the coming Legislature would prohibit pharmaceutical companies from buying a physician 's prescribing records .

Some physicians agree that the arrangement does present a conflict of interest .
Dr. Chris McCoy with the National Physicians Alliance said many doctors have become way too dependent on the information given to them by drug companies because they 're too busy to do their own drug research .
He said there 's also a sense of entitlement among physicians that is sometimes at odds with what 's best for patients .
" We , as physicians , should n't expect that out education is going to come free of charge and with a lunch that comes with it , " McCoy said .
" We need to recognize that if we want to have the best , unbiased information we are going to have to go out there and seek that . "
Following on that proposal , a second bill would try to replace the information doctors get from drug companies with unbiased drug data .
The bill would create a panel of independent medical experts to advise doctors .
But some physicians are deeply skeptical of that approach and believe it could end up harming patients .
The Association of Clinical Researchers and Educators , which has many physician members , says some states have used this approach to push generic medications .
The group also worries that if pharmaceutical companies and doctors do n't work collaboratively to share information , clinical research projects may not get off the ground .
Marjorie Powell predicts that may happen .
She 's senior assistant general counsel for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , the drug industry trade group also known as PhRMA .
Powell said limiting the exchange of information between doctors and drug companies may hurt research projects .
" I may need that to develop or do a clinic trial or I may need it to be able to tell them that I have a new medicine that might treat that patient , " Powell said .
A third bill that would tighten Minnesota 's existing ban on gifts to health providers is also unpopular with the drug industry .
The legislation would apply the same standard to doctors that 's currently used for legislators .
It would also expand the list of businesses that must report physician payments to include medical device manufactures , distributors and medical supply companies .
PhRMA 's Powell said the legislation would prevent pharmaceutical companies from paying doctors for the real value of their work .
She said it also discourages doctors from sharing their expertise because they have to report their consulting fees .
" A number of doctors have said that they 're uncomfortable having their name in a publicly accessible Web site that says they received a gift for what they consider is a reasonable consulting activity , " she said .
Proponents of the bills say they are not trying to attack the pharmaceutical industry .
Rather , they say the legislation is intended to re-direct the money that 's being poured into drug marketing , into research that can actually improve the lives of patients .
This high - concept action comedy follows Chuck Bartowski ( Zachary Levi , " Tangled " ) as the Buy More computer geek turned secret agent .
When Chuck unwittingly downloads a database of government information and deadly fighting skills into his head , he becomes the CIA 's most vital secret .
This sets
Chuck on a path to become a full - fledged spy , assisted by the stoic Colonel John Casey ( Adam Baldwin , " Serenity " ) , Chuck 's best friend , Morgan Grimes ( Joshua Gomez , " Without a Trace " ) , and the CIA 's top agent - and now Chuck 's wife - Sarah Walker ( Yvonne Strahovski , " Killer Elite " ) .
With the help of this unlikely team and his unorthodox techniques , Chuck is ready to take Operation Bartowski freelance .
Chuck 's spy abilities will be put to a new test when he and his team - now a private security company known as Carmichael Industries - must save mankind without the help of the CIA .
Instead , they 'll use the cover of the Buy More electronics store to fund their own operations , leading to new missions , new stakes and new obstacles .
With Chuck and Sarah as newlyweds and his family in on his secret , it has never been harder for Chuck to separate his spy life from his personal life .
Featuring an amazing ensemble cast and action unlike anything else on television , there is no mission too impossible for " Chuck . "

A quick post extracted from some code I was writing at the weekend .
Monad transformers can get a little ugly .
Here 's a toy example that looks pretty bad :
There are obvious ways to make it prettier , like the suggestions in RWH .
But despite what it says there , the monad " layout " is still " hardwired " and the code is fragile if you decide to insert more layers into your transformer stack .
It 's no way to program .
So here 's an alternative I came up with .
First we make a bunch of tags :
We can now label each of the monad transformers with a tag :
And now we can have everything lifted to the appropriate layer automatically : Much more readable and much more robust .
Change the order of the layers , or insert new ones , and the code still works .
I 've tried to make this minimally invasive .
It just introduces one new monad transformer that can be used to tag any other .
The definitions likeandare just trivial wrapped versions of their originals .
Anyway , this is just the first thing that came to mind and I threw it together quickly .
Surely nobody else likes all thoses .
So what other solutions already exist ?
I 'd rather use someone else 's well tested library than my hastily erected solution :
PROVIDENCE , R.I. — " Terminal Illness ?
$ 2,000 in CASH , Immediately Available . "
That was the promise of an advertisement that appeared regularly in 2007 and 2008 in the Rhode Island Catholic , the official newspaper of the local diocese .

Go here for more information on the dog breed of Shiba Inu :
About the Shiba Inu
We recommend that you do NOT get your puppies from a Pet Store as their pups generally come from puppy mill farms .
The main focus of the Pet Store / Puppy Mill is on the bottom dollar ( i.e. , money ) and they do not properly test the parents of the pups for potential genetic defects nor for temperament .
You are likely to get a sick puppy or one that will require extensive and expensive visits to the vet over the course of their lifetime due to careless breeding .
Do your research to locate reputable breeders in your area who health test their sires and dams prior to breeding a litter !
Do NOT buy puppies solely over the internet !
You should be able to visit the breeder to view the conditions of the pups / dogs in their care .
Visiting the breeder will also allow you a chance to bond with the pups before you decide whether or not they are a right fit for you .
If the breeder does n’t allow you to visit then beware … it ’s likely a puppy mill .
To find a reputable breeder contact your local Shiba club or , if there are no clubs in your area , the National Shiba Club of America .
Do note that most reputable breeders have a waiting list prior to a litter being born .
Once you have located a breeder you like you should ask to be put onto their waiting list for a future litter .
Another option if looking for a pup / dog would be to consider fostering or adopting a rescue Shiba .
Go to this link to view Shiba Rescue organizations throughout the country ( or to make a donation ) :

It ’s not rare to hear middle - aged people go on about the technology we have now ; the cell phones , and the video games , and everybody ’s busy lives .
But for all the talk about how advanced we are and how everything ’s getting so uncontrollably complicated , there ’s not enough talk about the truth of the situation .
The fact is , as a country , America is pretty advanced , but in the age of the world wide web , there ’s a lot of that web still missing from the picture .
The internet has the ability to transform commerce , transform communication , and transcend boundaries .
It could be argued that it ’s the most important thing missing throughout the world .
The internet has means of education , means of trade , and opportunity .
Food and water sent from a rich country can save a life , but it cannot sustain it .
For all the talk about how advanced we are , I think it ’s time we start realizing that the rest of the world is still very far behind .
When we think about “ our ” situation , we need to think about it from the perspective of the world as a community , because in reality , and even more so in the future , we are all connected .
I am undoubtedly a huge advocate for more innovation and more technology , but in these circumstances , I would readily support a stand still of all progress in developed countries , in order to catch under - developed countries up at least to America ’s standards , which are certainly not the highest , but would still be great for the world .
This stand still would never happen , but I am hoping that with the coming technologies to emerge out of the developed countries in the years to come , a solution to this problem can be found that brings , if nothing else , widespread internet access and computers to the world .
America , Europe , and parts of Asia may be relatively advanced , but in many parts of the world , there ’s still not much difference between now and 200 years ago .
We tend to make a huge separation between us and ancient people , or even the victorians , but as a whole , we are not much different , and as a world community , we still have a long ways to go .

Call me cynical , and I can't imagine I 'm the first to point this out , but have n't the folks at ManCrunch done a wonderful job at advertising their site without having to , you know , pay to advertise their site ?
They created an ad that was almost certainly going to be rejected by the CBS brass .
Think of the firestorm after Janet Jackson 's tit popped out for a millisecond at the Super Bowl half time show in 2004 .
Now imagine how those same people - and more - would react two gay men making out in front of their children .
It 's not hard .
You can practically hear Bill O'Reilly 's " Memo " on it already - secular progressives , overriding the values of millions of Americans , blah , blah .
In fact , I 'm almost glad CBS has saved us from the inevitable Fox News / Drudge backlash , however hypocritical Drudge 's protestations might be .
As for ManCrunch , they 're getting the type of publicity you get from a Super Bowl without having to fork over the $ 2.6 million they 'd need to run that ad during the Super Bowl .
So is this a victory for common sense or equal treatment ?
No. Does ManCrunch win anyway ?
Yes .
And are we all spared the usual rants from the usual ranters ?
God , let 's hope so .
Shaquille O’Neal is a true Renaissance man .
The 15 - time NBA All - Star has long led a varied life off the hardwood as an actor , rapper , US deputy marshal , comedian — and now he ’s ready to take on the art world by curating an exhibition he expects to be a slam dunk .
The 7 - foot - 1 O’Neal ’s first show is set to tip off on Friday at the FLAG Art Foundation on West 25th Street in Chelsea , and it is fittingly titled “ Size DOES Matter . ”
It runs through May 27 and features 66 works selected by Shaq .
They range from Robert Therrien ’s colossal sculpture of a table and six chairs that dwarf even the Cleveland Cavalier center to a portrait of O’Neal by Willard Wigan that ’s so tiny it can sit in the eye of a needle .
“ Funny how it took an exhibit about size to get a 7 - foot , 1 - inch man like me on board , ” O’Neal told The Post .
“ Size matters when it comes to me playing basketball or participating in law enforcement .
Other than that , size can be an illusion . ”
Stephanie Roach , director of FLAG , said the foundation specializes in “ outside the box ” exhibitions , so a show illustrating how scale affects perception seemed like a perfect fit .
O’Neal was “ undoubtedly No. 1 on our wish list , ” she said .
“ Aside from Shaq ’s unbelievable stature , he also has a larger - than - life persona off the court and a desire to take risks . ”
Roach and FLAG founder Glenn Fuhrman flew to Cleveland in October and showed O’Neal hundreds of images to choose from over dinner after a preseason Cavalier game .
“ I got really excited about the concept and the opportunity to work with such amazing art , ” Shaq said .
He was especially drawn to Ron Mueck ’s “ Untitled ( Big Man ) , ” a nearly 7 - foot - tall sculpture of a naked , bald man curled up awkwardly , elbows resting on his knees .
The renowned piece is being lent to FLAG by the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington , DC .
Besides Wigan ’s microscopic masterpiece , several other pieces commissioned for the show also feature O’Neal as their subject .
A collage by Mark Wagner , for example , is made up of dollar bills cut and glued together to create four portraits of the basketball great .
O’Neal has long been an art admirer .
“ I have art of all kinds — some purchased , some gifts : African , modern , abstract , American .
Also because of my kids , I have some of their art hanging , ” said O’Neal , who is expected to make at least one appearance at a private FLAG event .

Buzz használati alapok
eszpee cikke a Torokgeek rovatból , 2010 .
február 11 .
csütörtök , 11:51 | 7 hozzászólás
A napokban megjelent , és a legtöbb GMail felhasználónak be is frissült a Google új terméke , amivel a mikroblogok és a közösségi siteok területére próbál betörni a cég .
A megszokott hosszú bétázásokkal , korlátozott meghívóosztogatásokkal járó indítás helyett ezúttal meglepően gyorsan megkapta mindenki a Buzzt - magyarul Zümmöt , ami sokaknak nem tetszik , de szerintem jópofa fordítás .
Még én is csak ismerkedek a rendszerrel , de a leggyakrabban felmerülő kérdésekre , problémákra megpróbálok válaszolni .
Hogyan lehet a Buzzt kikapcsolni ?
Ha kipróbáltad , de megszabadulnál inkább az egésztől , az összes GMail oldal legalján az apró betűs linkek között ott egy " Turn off Buzz " is .
Ha meggondolnád magad , ugyanitt tudod majd visszakapcsolni .
Mit kössek be ?
Én a twitter / tumblr ész nélküli mindenhova bekötögetését máshol sem szeretem , szerintem itt a szűkebb közönség még inkább azt sugallja , hogy válogassuk csak meg a forrásainkat , amiket követőink arcába tolunk .
A magyar mikroblogokon egyébként is gyakori az egymással beszélgetős tartalom , ezek kontextusból kiragadva csak idegesítik azokat , akik egyébként kíváncsiak lennének ránk .
Hogyan adjam hozzá a saját blogom ?
A Buzz azokat az oldalakat kínálja fel , amik szerepelnek a Google profilodban .
Ha itt felvettél egy oldalt , a Buzzban a connected siteok linkjére kattintva már ott lesz ez a lap is , ha van rendes feedje .
Fejleszt őknek ezt érdemes átfutni , van API is .
Többezer kontaktom van GMailben , mit csináljak velük ?
Előbb - utóbb érdemes rászánni 1 - 2 órát , és rendbe rakni itt a káoszt .
A Contacts alatt van már egy jópofa eszköz erre , a Google meg tudja keresni és összevonja a redundáns bejegyzéseket , ezután már " csak " a kézi takarítás és a csoportok létrehozása marad .
Járulékos haszon , hogy ezután így lehet értelme asztali levelezővel , mobillal szinkronizálni a kontaktlistát .
Kit kövessek ?
Érdemes szerintem minden tartalmat a megfelelő helyen kezelni , aki csak twitterezik itt is , azt majd csiripen követjük , és azt se biztos , hogy kétszer szeretnénk olvasni , aki kizárólag a Google Reader megosztásait köti be .
Tartalmilag a Buzz szerintem inkább a Facebookhoz lesz közelebb és nem a mikroblogokhoz , így értelmes gondolatnak tűnik közelebbi ismerőseinkre szorítkozni a követésekkel .
Teleszemeteli a Buzz az Inboxomat , mit csináljak vele ?
A Buzz azokról az üzenetekről , amikben te is megnyilvánultál , " leveleket " küld , amik hamar felgy űlnek az Inboxban .
Ezek bár nem teljesen ugyanolyan levelek , mint a többi , a GMail szűrőinek azért engedelmeskednek .
Ha létrehozol egy szabályt , ami a label : buzz kifejezésre keres , majd a találatot rögtön kiviszi az Inboxból ( " Skip the Inbox " ) és beteszi egy mondjuk " buzz válaszok " label alá , akkor meg is oldottad ezt a problémát .
A GMail a filter létrehozásakor feldob egy figyelmeztetést , hogy nem fog működni ez a szabály , de ne törődj vele , nincs igaza .
Ha a Google Labs alatt bekapcsoltad a " Hide read labels " kiegészítést , és lehúztad a " more " alá ezt a " buzz válaszok " labelt , akkor olyankor sem fog zavarni az olvasatlan buzzok száma amikor máson dolgoznál .
Ugyanezt érdemes megcsinálni magával a Buzz címkével is , így " munkaidőben " nincsenek szem előtt ezek , csak ha kinyitod a more alatti labeleket .
Hogyan tudok csak pár embernek üzenni ?
Hát leginkább Wave -vel .
A Buzzban csak a kontaktlista meglevő csoportjaira tudsz szűkíteni egy üzenetet , nem tudsz adhoc egy tartalomhoz címzetteket összeválogatni .
Sajnos .
Hogyan tudok mobilról üzenni ?
Teljeskörű támogatást egyelőre csak az iPhone és a legalább 2.0-s Androidok élveznek , a többi telefon leginkább " coming soon " állapotban van .
Létezik viszont megoldás minden olyan telefonra , ami legalább emailt tud küldeni : ha olyan GMailes feladóval írsz a buzz@gmail.com címre levelet , ami már használja a Buzzt , akkor az üzeneted megjelenik a követőidnek .
Képet is szépen lehet küldeni így , viszont úgy tűnik nekem , hogy hiába geotaggelt a fotó , ezt az információt nem szedi ki a Google a Buzzhoz .
Nem érdekel egy konkrét buzz post , mit lehet vele csinálni ?
Ha meguntál egy a csevegés miatt folyton feljövő üzenetet , akkor elnémíthatod az adott postot jobbra fent a comment link melletti lenyíló menüben levő
Mute this post linkkel - így az adott témát már soha nem fogja olvasatlanként jelezni neked .
Ha engedélyezve vannak a billenty űzet - shortcutok , elég egy M-et nyomni az aktuális üzeneten .
Ezek a buzzok tovább foglalják a GMailes tárhelyem ?
A rövid válasz az az , hogy igen .
Bővebben nézve azért nem olyan rossz a helyzet , az üzenetek nagy része rövid , szöveges , egy videóhoz vagy akár csak egy képhez képest ez szinte semmit nem jelent .
Arra érdemes lehet figyelni , hogy a buzzokban küldött saját fotók a Picasa - ra kerülnek feltöltésre , és foglalják az ottani tárhelyet .
Induláskor a gyakori levelez őpartnereimet követi a rendszer .
Ez az információ nyilvános .
Nem gáz ez ?
Ez személyfüggő , de abszolút lehet gáz , a követők és követettek listája induláskor tényleg nyilvános , így ha a barátnőd azt látja , hogy ott van a leggyakoribb levelez őpartnereid között az exed ; vagy a főnököd , hogy a konkurencia személyzetise , az eredményezhet kínos kérdéseket .
Ha úgy érzed , téged zavar ez , a profilszerkesztőben kikapcsolhatod a " Display the list of people I 'm following and people following me " pontot .
A Google a nagy testvér , most már a kapcsolataimat is látni akarja !?
Előre szólok , emiatt kár kommentezni .
Egyszerűen ne használj Google termékeket .
Ez a cikk nem neked szólt .

According to Dealreporter , via The Fly On The Wall , the White House 's plan to limit banks prop trading , better known as the " Volcker Rule , " will either be dropped in the Senate or significantly modified .
This is according to lawmakers sources .
There 's no independent confirmation of this yet , and there might not be for awhile since this does n't sound " official . "

For author Peter Watts , life can be stranger than science fiction .
Watts – who has written six books in the genre – was on his way back to Toronto Tuesday after helping a friend move to the U.S.
Before he crossed the border into Sarnia , American customs officers pulled him over .
When they began rifling through his car , he got out to ask what was going on .
They ordered him back into the car ; he asked again .
What happened next has become the talk of the blogosphere .
Watts , too , has waded in , posting on the Internet that he was assaulted , punched in the face , pepper - sprayed and thrown in jail for the night , only to find himself facing charges of assaulting a customs officer .
Port Huron police told the local newspaper Watts was angry when he got out of the car and when he refused to get back in , customs officers tried to cuff him and he was " aggressive . "
In the melee , police said , Watts " choked " an officer .
Ronald Smith , chief customs and border protection officer at Blue Water Bridge , told the Star Watts " became non-compliant ... and a physical altercation " ensued .
" As a result of that , he was detained and turned over to local authorities , " said Smith .
Watts denies any wrongdoing .
" I can state categorically that I did not choke anybody .
I did not use profanity and did not raise my voice .
I did not initiate any physical contact , " said Watts , who has a PhD in zoology .
" All I basically did was use words to ask what was going on . "
Friends are raising funds to help Watts cover his legal costs , which are overwhelming for someone who makes a living as an author .
Sci -fi writer Cory Doctorow , who blogged about it at boingboing .
net , chipped in $ 1,000 .
More donations have since come in .
Watts has enough to get through his Dec. 22 court appearance but should the case go to trial , a fundraiser will be arranged , friend David Nickle said .
If convicted of the felony charge , Watts could be imprisoned for two years and face a fine of up to $ 2,000 .
Watts had driven to Nebraska with a friend to help a University of Toronto professor move .
The two were driving a replacement rental car after the original broke down .

MIAMI  A South Florida teenager who sued her former principal after she was suspended for creating a Facebook page criticizing a teacher can proceed with her lawsuit , a federal judge has ruled .
The student , Katherine Evans , is seeking to have her suspension expunged from her disciplinary record .
School officials suspended her for three days , saying she had been “ cyberbullying ” the teacher , Sarah Phelps .
Ms. Evans is also seeking a “ nominal fee ” for what she argues was a violation of her First Amendment rights , her lawyers said , and payment of her legal fees .
The former principal , Peter Bayer , who worked at the Pembroke Pines Charter High School , had asked that the case be dismissed .
But Magistrate Judge Barry L. Garber denied Mr. Bayer ’s petition and rejected his claims of qualified immunity .
Lawyers for Ms. Evans , 19 , now a sophomore at the University of Florida , said that they were pleased by the ruling and that they hoped to bring the case to trial in the spring .
There 's a world of worry out there , fed by self - interested speculators , which is proving hard to counter .
Yet things rarely work out as predicted , and though nobody should be in any doubt about the scale of the economic adjustment still to be made in Western economies , more benign outcomes are still possible .

Top Intel Officer : U.S. May Kill Americans Abroad
By John Byrne , Raw Story
Posted on February 4 , 2010 , Printed on February 4 , 2010
http://www.alternet.org/story/145543/
In a striking admission from the Obama Administration 's top intelligence officer , Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair announced Wednesday that the United States may target its own citizens abroad for death if it believes they are associated with terrorist groups .
" We take direct action against terrorists in the intelligence community , " Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told the House Intelligence Committee .
He said US counter - terrorism officials may try to kill American citizens embroiled in extremist groups overseas with " specific permission " from higher up .
If " we think that direct action will involve killing an American , we get specific permission to do that , " Blair said in response to questions from the panel 's top Republican , Representative Pete Hoekstra .
Blair 's comments came after The Washington Post reported that US President Barack Obama had embraced predecessor George W. Bush 's policy of authorizing the killing of US citizens involved in terrorist activities overseas .
If a United States citizen was determined to have joined a foreign terrorist group , that person could be legally murdered under orders given by President George W. Bush after the 9/11 attacks .
" After the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , Bush gave the CIA , and later the military , authority to kill U.S. citizens abroad if strong evidence existed that an American was involved in organizing or carrying out terrorist actions against the United States or U.S. interests , military and intelligence officials said , " the Post reported .
" The evidence has to meet a certain , defined threshold .
The person , for instance , has to pose ' a continuing and imminent threat to U.S. persons and interests , ' said one former intelligence official .
" The Obama administration has adopted the same stance .
If a U.S. citizen joins al - Qaeda , 'it does n't really change anything from the standpoint of whether we can target them , ' said a senior administration official .
' They are then part of the enemy . ' "
The Post , citing anonymous US officials , said the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and Joint Special Operations Command have three Americans on their lists of specific people targeted for killing or capture .
Blair said weighing whether to target a US national required determining " whether that American is involved in a group that is trying to attack us , whether that American is a threat to other Americans . "
The intelligence chief said he was offering such unusually detailed information in public because " I just do n't want other Americans who are watching to think that we are careless . "
" In fact , we 're not careless about endangering lives at all , but we especially are not careless about endangering American lives as we try to carry out the policies to protect most of the country , " he said .
Hoekstra , the ranking Republican , asked what the standards were for targeting American citizens abroad .
Blair did n't specifically articulate them .
" We do n't target people for free speech , " he said .
" We target them for taking action that threatens Americans . "
Hoekstra pressed him , citing a 2001 incident in which Peru's air force shot down a plane carrying US missionaries , killing a woman and her seven - month - old daughter , after the aircraft was misidentified as a drug - smuggler .
" We were careless and we were reckless , " Blair replied .
" I want to make sure that this committee does everything that it can and within its power that it does not allow the community to be reckless and careless again . "
" While I 'm in charge , we will not be careless and reckless , " he pledged .

The transition within the book publishing industry from physical inventory stored in a warehouse and trucked to retailers to digital files stored in cyberspace and delivered almost anywhere on earth as quickly and cheaply as e-mail is now underway and irreversible .
This historic shift will radically transform worldwide book publishing , the cultures it affects and on which it depends .
Meanwhile , for quite different reasons , the genteel book business that I joined more than a half - century ago is already on edge , suffering from a gambler ’s unbreakable addiction to risky , seasonal best sellers , many of which do n’t recoup their costs , and the simultaneous deterioration of backlist , the vital annuity on which book publishers had in better days relied for year - to - year stability through bad times and good .
The crisis of confidence reflects these intersecting shocks , an overspecialized marketplace dominated by high - risk ephemera and a technological shift orders of magnitude greater than the momentous evolution from monkish scriptoria to movable type launched in Gutenberg ’s German city of Mainz six centuries ago .
Though Gutenberg ’s invention made possible our modern world with all its wonders and woes , no one , much less Gutenberg himself , could have foreseen that his press would have this effect .
And no one today can foresee except in broad and sketchy outline the far greater impact that digitization will have on our own future .
With the earth trembling beneath them , it is no wonder that publishers with one foot in the crumbling past and the other seeking solid ground in an uncertain future hesitate to seize the opportunity that digitization offers them to restore , expand , and promote their backlists to a decentralized , worldwide marketplace .
New technologies , however , do not await permission .
They are , to use Schumpeter ’s overused term , disruptive , as nonnegotiable as earthquakes .
Gutenberg ’s technology was the sine qua non for the rebirth of the West , as if literacy , scientific method , and constitutional government had been implicit all along , awaiting only Gutenberg to throw the switch .
Within fifty years presses were operating from one end of Europe to the other , halting only at the borders of Islam , which shunned the press .
Perhaps from the same fear of disruptive literacy that alarmed Islam , China ignored a phonetic transcription of its ideographs , attributed to a Korean emperor , that might have permitted the use of movable type .
The resistance today by publishers to the onrushing digital future does not arise from fear of disruptive literacy , but from the understandable fear of their own obsolescence and the complexity of the digital transformation that awaits them , one in which much of their traditional infrastructure and perhaps they too will be redundant .
Karl Marx wrote of the revolutions of 1848 in his Communist Manifesto that all that is solid melts into air .

MONTERREY , NL . —
Mauricio Fernández Garza , alcalde de San Pedro Garza García , presentó ayer al Congreso de Nuevo León una iniciativa de reforma a la Ley de Prevención y Combate al Abuso del Alcohol , con la que pretende se atribuyan facultades al ayuntamiento para definir el horario de cierre de establecimientos que expendan bebidas embriagantes .
Informó que tendrá además un cuerpo especial de agentes encubiertos para detectar la venta de droga en los antros , bares y discotecas del municipio : “ Ya les avisé , vamos a tener gente encubierta dentro de los antros y les voy a partir el hocico al que se le ocurra vender drogas ; ya lo saben , yo soy frontal y soy fuertecito en este sentido ” .
La reglamentación permite a bares , antros y cantinas ofrecer servicio hasta las 2:00 horas , aunque “ amparados están cerrando a las 8:00 de la mañana ” .
Desde el fin de semana pasado , el alcalde acordó con los dueños de estos negocios cerrar a las 4:30 horas , como parte de un programa piloto .
Dijo que así como los municipios rurales tienen la facultad de establecer los horarios de cierre de los negocios que venden bebidas alcohólicas , la medida debe ser homologada para todos los ayuntamientos , de acuerdo con las circunstancias de cada uno .
Con la adición al artículo 15 de la ley estatal , “ los ayuntamientos de los municipios metropolitanos , por acuerdo de dos terceras partes de sus integrantes , podrán modificar los horarios establecidos .
Yo sí espero el apoyo del Congreso , veo muy cuesta arriba que la gente me esté bloqueando cuando vean el desmadre que tenemos en toda la zona metropolitana , por supuesto que hay un desmadre , nada más échese una vuelta a los antros , o a qué horas se duerme usted el fin de semana ” .
Ante los señalamientos de diputados locales de que viola la ley al permitir el horario hasta las 4:30 horas , dijo que “ los antros están amparados ... están cerrando a las siete , ocho de la mañana y yo los convencí que cerraran a las cuatro de la mañana ” .
En la iniciativa de reforma , el alcalde panista Mauricio Fernández también solicita otorgar al municipio la facultad de permitir elementos policiacos en los accesos a centros nocturnos y tener alcoholímetros para determinar quién puede conducir su automóvil ; a las personas que resulten con algún grado de ebriedad se les pida un taxi especial para el traslado .
Astronomers have found the first clear evidence of a binary quasar within a pair of actively merging galaxies .
Quasars are the extremely bright centers of galaxies surrounding super - massive black holes , and binary quasars are pairs of quasars bound together by gravity .
Binary quasars , like other quasars , are thought to be the product of galaxy mergers .
Until now , however , binary quasars have not been seen in galaxies that are unambiguously in the act of merging .
But images of a new binary quasar from the Carnegie Institution 's Magellan telescope in Chile show two distinct galaxies with " tails " produced by tidal forces from their mutual gravitational attraction .
" This is really the first case in which you see two separate galaxies , both with quasars , that are clearly interacting , " says Carnegie astronomer John Mulchaey who made observations crucial to understanding the galaxy merger .
Most , if not all , large galaxies , such as our galaxy the Milky Way , host super - massive black holes at their centers .
Because galaxies regularly interact and merge , astronomers have assumed that binary super - massive black holes have been common in the Universe , especially during its early history .
Black holes can only be detected as quasars when they are actively accreting matter , a process that releases vast amounts of energy .
A leading theory is that galaxy mergers trigger accretion , creating quasars in both galaxies .
Because most of such mergers would have happened in the distant past , binary quasars and their associated galaxies are very far away and therefore difficult for most telescopes to resolve .
The binary quasar , labeled SDSS J1254+0846 , was initially detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , a large scale astronomical survey of galaxies and over 120,000 quasars .
Further observations by Paul Green of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and colleagues * using NASA 's Chandra 's X-ray Observatory and telescopes at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and Palomar Observatory in California indicated that the object was likely a binary quasar in the midst of a galaxy merger .
Carnegie 's Mulchaey then used the 6.5 meter Baade - Magellan telescope at the Las Campanas observatory in Chile to obtain deeper images and more detailed spectroscopy of the merging galaxies .
" Just because you see two galaxies that are close to each other in the sky does n't mean they are merging , " says Mulchaey .
" But from the Magellan images we can actually see tidal tails , one from each galaxy , which suggests that the galaxies are in fact interacting and are in the process of merging . "
Thomas Cox , now a fellow at the Carnegie Observatories , corroborated this conclusion using computer simulations of the merging galaxies .
When Cox 's model galaxies merged , they showed features remarkably similar to what Mulchaey observed in the Magellan images .
" The model verifies the merger origin for this binary quasar system , " he says .
" It also hints that this kind of galaxy interaction is a key component of the growth of black holes and production of quasars throughout our universe . "

When it comes to preparing garlic are you part of the press gang or do you prefer to wield the knife ?
And how do you deal with the smell ?
Sometimes it takes a true friend to show you the error of your ways .
In my case , reality bit last Sunday when fellow food - geek Ali and I were preparing a smug , post - jog brunch together in her flat .
She was scrambling eggs , I was in charge of sautéed spinach .
Pan on , butter beginning to yield gently to the heat , I made an innocent request for a garlic press .
There was a sharp intake of breath from behind me , followed by a brief and painful lecture on my folly .
Garlic presses ( the very words slid quickly from her tongue , as if tainted ) were well up there with boiled egg slicers , I discovered – not something any real cook would allow into their kitchen .
Thus rumbled , I was forced to admit , while accepting a knife and chopping board , that not only did I own a garlic press – I used it on a regular basis .
And , until that moment , I had n't realised that this was something to be ashamed of .
I pride myself on being up there with every food snobbery going , but somehow , this one had passed me by .
OK , so I 'd read Anthony Bourdain 's thoughts on the subject ( " Treat your garlic with respect .
Sliver it for pasta , like you saw in Goodfellas , do n't burn it .
Smash it , with the flat of your knife blade if you like , but do n't put it through a press .
I do n't know what that junk is that squeezes out the end of those things , but it ai n't garlic " ) , but since Bourdain compared Alice Waters to the Khmer Rouge , I 've stopped taking him seriously .
Yet thinking about it , I could n't recall ever seeing Hugh , or Heston or even a mere Master Chef contestant with a garlic press .
My first thought was that such an implement would rob them of the chance to show off their whizzy knife skills , but I began to wonder whether there might be more to it .
Online , the garlic press deniers seem to fall into three main camps .
First of all , there are the people , like Bourdain , who reckon it somehow spoils the flavour of the garlic : the most extreme claim they can even detect a ' metallic ' tang to crushed cloves .
Many of these self - appointed supertasters wheel out our old friend Harold McGee to back them up :
" According to On Food and Cooking " one explains , " garlic contains odourless ( under normal conditions ) compounds derived from the sulphur - containing amino acid cysteine .
When the garlic tissue 's cells are disrupted ( cut , smashed … ) , this amino acid compound is brought into contact with an enzyme which converts it into molecules of ammonia , pyruvic acid and a mildly garlicky but unstable compound .
This in turn breaks down into diallyl sulfide , the major and powerful constituent of garlic odour .
So garlic wo n't smell like ( or taste like ) garlic until the cells are disrupted and this chemical process takes place .
Mincing with a knife will disrupt some cells , but leave others intact .
Crushing … would disrupt a higher percentage of the cells , causing more of a reaction . "
In layman 's terms , then , the more you mess about with the garlic , the stronger the results .
I think .
More comprehensible on the subject is Elizabeth David , in characteristic no -nonsense mood in this invective for the Tatler :
" I regard garlic presses as both ridiculous and pathetic , their effect being precisely the reverse of what people who buy them believe will be the case .
Squeezing the juice out of garlic does n't reduce its potency , it concentrates it , and intensifies the smell .
I have often wondered how it is that people who have once used one of these diabolical instruments do n't notice this and forthwith throw the thing into the dustbin . "
Then there are those , like Martha Stewart , who denounce presses as wasteful :
" some of the clove is always trapped inside " the former jailbird complains , " it does n't save much time .
And you end up with another gadget to clean and store . "
Her case has something in common with those who claim they do n't have room in their kitchens for implements with just one function ( my , they must have a hard time opening tins ) .
But what all the above arguments have in common is the – ever so slightly boastful – assumption that really , it 's just as quick and easy to mince garlic by hand .
Which , in fact , it is n't .
Not for most people .
Raymond Blanc , who I imagine probably does n't use one himself , at least acknowledges this : " A press is still the best and easiest way to crush your garlic , " he counsels kindly , while the great Madhur Jaffrey is happy to out herself as a devoted press - head in her Ultimate Curry Bible .
I feel honour bound to protect her good name .
I go out and buy five heads of garlic .
After several instructional videos on how to mince , chop and slice garlic like a pro I put my shaky technique to use in recipes which would usually see me reaching for my trusty press .
First of all , I reason , I have to work out whether it 's the method , or the tool , which is at fault .
In other words , does crushing garlic release unpleasantly harsh flavours , however it 's done ?
To find out , I crush one clove with a press and mince one with a knife , adding coarse salt as an abrasive and squishing it all with the blade to give a puréed effect – in fact , this method gives an even finer result than the press , which ejects tiny bullets of garlic .
I then mix the two into an equal amount of mayonnaise .
( Fortunately , eating garlic mayo from the spoon does n't faze my unwitting guinea pigs , who only popped in for a cup of tea . )
Three of us find the stuff containing the pressed garlic slightly stronger – ' tangier ' , one says – while the fourth claims they 're exactly the same , and the rest of us are just showing off ( I might add that I served the two in unmarked bowls , without telling anyone the difference between them ) .
So the press really does seem to produce harsher - tasting results : I conclude that crushing garlic with a knife and some salt is preferable – if , for me at least , far more time - consuming .
However , I do n't just use my garlic press for things which call for a garlic purée .
I also deploy it when the recipe demands finely chopped garlic – it's a mite more liquid , and presumably slightly stronger tasting but how much difference does this really make to the finished dish ?
To find out , I chop a clove as small as I can with a knife , and stir it into some softened butter – in the interests of science , I reluctantly leave out the parsley and Parmesan .
I dispatch another clove rather more quickly using the press , and then fill two half baguettes and bake them .
Contrary to my expectations , the garlic bread I made using the press has a milder flavour than that containing the finely chopped garlic .
After stuffing our faces with both , we conclude this can only be because biting down on solid pieces of garlic , however tiny , gives a more intense flavour hit .
I prefer the finely chopped version , but then , I like my garlic bread fierce .
Next , I test out a salad dressing using both pressed and very finely chopped garlic – one I make regularly , with anchovies , lemon juice and herbs .
( By this point , my kitchen is filling up with discarded spoons and boards – cross-contamination is not generally something I give much thought to . )
The dressing which contains the pressed garlic is , in my opinion , undoubtedly superior to the finely chopped one – more garlicky in general , but without the slightly jarring experience of occasionally finding a morsel of the raw stuff .
The Garlic Cookbook I 've obtained from the library assures me that I must always use crushed garlic , however , for stir - fries , so I decide to give one a whirl – well , two in fact : one using garlic squeezed through a press , and one containing garlic I 've chopped finely with a knife .
However furiously I stir my smoking wok , the pressed garlic still burns far more easily than the finely chopped batch , giving the results an unpleasant bitterness I blame on myself , rather than the press .
I resolve to stick to chopped garlic in future when cooking at high temperatures – and possibly experiment with leaving it in slightly larger pieces .
Finally , I make three very simple tomato sauces with pressed , finely chopped and very thinly sliced garlic .
The last , although clearly palatable to mobsters , has too faint a hint of garlic for my taste , although the delicate slices do look quite decorative .
The pressed garlic has a strong , almost overwhelming garlickyness to it , whereas my favourite , the finely chopped garlic , is more subtly flavoured , and seems slightly sweeter as a result .
Fine chopping , a halfway house between crushing and slicing which releases some , but not all of the clove 's juices , is clearly the way forward here .

So , what have I learnt ?
Firstly , that presses are more wasteful than I 'd imagined – there was always noticeably less in the pressed pile .
Secondly , that whatever people say about the green shoots in elderly garlic being bitter , or indigestible , removing them is a waste of time as far as I 'm concerned .
If they make a difference to the flavour , I certainly can't detect it ( looking this up online , I find claims they 're a stand - alone delicacy in parts of Italy , India and the Far East , although I 'm unable to find a recipe , so if anyone has one , please do share it ! ) .
And thirdly , that the subtler flavour of finely chopped garlic is probably better suited to cooking , but the crushed stuff wins hands down when you 're putting it raw into a salad dressing , mayonnaise or similar , where the juice is the important bit .
In future , however , I think I 'll use a knife , rather than a press to crush it – practice makes perfect , after all .
( As an aside , all this gave me the perfect opportunity to test out the various ways of removing that alluring garlic scent from my hands .
Lemon juice left them smelling rather tastily of a Mediterranean salad , but only added to my problems .
Baking soda had no discernible effect .
Rubbing them on a stainless steel spoon under cold running water seemed to help though – and , combined with a hefty dose of perfumed soap , left them smelling only faintly like a vampire 's nightmare .
But hey , there are worse things to reek of . )
Where do you stand on garlic presses – are they tools of Satan or the victims of ignorant snobbery ?
Does the way you prep your garlic depend on what you 're cooking , and where do you stand on those little green sprouts ?
And how on earth do you deal with the smell ?

My grandma used to maintain corncobs were n't all that bad .
She said they used well dried cobs , and you " rubbed it soft " while you were sitting there doing your business .
I say that by the time she was telling me this , she was decades past using an outhouse , and time dims all memory .
Another bit of outhouse lore :
They used to keep a sack of lime in the outhouse and you would toss in a scoop of lime afterwards to keep down the smell .
( Outhouses + summer temps over 100 = mega - gross . )
Leading to an old saying my grandma was always using , especially about politicians , " He 's so sweet on himself , you 'd think he does n't have to lime the outhouse when he goes . "

Heeeeee !
The cob itself , of course , is hard like a stick but the stuff that holds the corn kernels in place is fibrousy and just , over time or with a little rubbing , is just soft .
It 's weird , i guess , but it 's like any fiber - enough manipulation makes it pliable .

Here at TCC , we spend a lot of time reading and writing about roadway safety .
In recent years , we 've provided extensive coverage of distracted driving issues -- especially texting behind the wheel and more recently , in - car internet .
Both are serious concerns ( phone - related distractions caused 6,000 deaths and 500,000 injuries on U.S. roadways in 2008 alone ) , but it 's become clear that banning the technology is n't the best solution to the problem .
Instead , individuals and automakers have to adapt to this new , internet - everywhere environment through ( a ) driver education and ( b ) tech developments to minimize distractions .
We 're happy to report that progress is being made on at least one of those fronts .
Curtailed functionality , voice interaction
Ford 's Sync system is n't perfect , but it does represent some of the smartest in - car technology we 've seen to date .
Not only does Sync offer a range of functions to drivers , but later versions also have built - in safety features that disable some of those functions ( like playing videos ) when the car is in gear .
Those safeguards did n't stem from the request of some regulatory agency ; they came from within the Sync team itself .
That confirms what we 'd already suspected : that companies can occasionally opt to curtail their offerings in the interest of consumer safety .
Sync and other telematics systems also offer voice interaction , which limits the amount of time that drivers have to take their eyes off the road when answering calls and changing the music on their MP3 players .
Take a look at this chart ( from Ford , via Mashable ) that demonstrates how much more time voice - enabled systems allow drivers to focus on driving .
Distraction time of Ford Sync vs. handheld devices
As software evolves and telematics systems become commonplace in automobiles of all types , we hope to see these statistics improve .
Apart from Ford , many other automakers like Jaguar and Volvo offer in - dash systems that integrate with cell phones and MP3 players -- and that 's to say nothing of the countless aftermarket devices lining the shelves .
Even better ( for Ford 's competitors anyway ) : Ford 's exclusive development contract with Microsoft ended at the close of 2008 , and competing Sync systems will soon be available in Kia , Hyundai , and other models .
Caveats
However , as much as we like features like self - limiting telematics systems and voice control , there are a couple of safety - related caveats :
1. Voice interaction is still dangerous .
Studies have shown that talking on the phone while driving is n't any safer when the driver uses a hands - free system .
The problem with taking a call at the wheel is n't the physical act of holding the phone to your ear ; its the fact that your focus shifts to the person on the other end of the line -- even when your eyes are glued to the road .
Voice control may look safer , but looks can be deceiving .
2 . Some applications just do n't belong behind the wheel .
Take a look at this terrible / terrifying video of Ford 's attempt to wrap Twitter functionality into Sync .
For starters , the integration between phone and Twitter app and Sync and Bluetooth seems really iffy .
( We 've had more than a few problems just pairing our handhelds , so this demo seems like crazy talk . )
Furthermore , the Sync window is lousy for Twitter management , and the voice readout of tweets is flat - out creepy .
Ford should probably ditch this approach altogether and develop an app comparable to the one for Pandora .
But more to the point , if drivers are so addicted to Twitter that they have to tweet behind the wheel , they probably should n't be behind the wheel in the first place .
Is there a Twitter - addiction camp like that sex-addiction place Tiger Woods went to in Mississippi ?
If not , we smell a big business opportunity .
In sum
Drivers have always had to deal with one sort of distraction or another .
Not so long ago , we were concerned with eating and / or drinking and driving ( which are both stills problems , obviously ) .
Today , it 's cell phones , iPods , and satnavs .
We cringe at the thought of what 's next .
Although telematics technology is far from perfect , it 's encouraging to see that manufacturers are building in safety controls on their own , rather than being mandated to do so by government agencies .
We expect such oversight will eventually be legislated -- likely after a particularly grave incident -- but for now , developers seem to be on the right track .
How quickly drivers will adapt to this new , internet - immersed driving environment , however , remains to be seen .

( CNN ) -- Former 2004
Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards , who admitted last week that he fathered a child with a videographer who worked on his campaign , has legally separated from his wife , Elizabeth , a source close to her said Wednesday .
The source would not say when the separation occurred , only that it happened a while ago .
The source said he or she spoke to Elizabeth Edwards in recent days , and would not speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation .
John Edwards issued a statement Wednesday , calling it " an extraordinarily sad moment , but I love my children more than anything and still care deeply about Elizabeth . "
Elizabeth Edwards ' publisher , Random House , released a statement saying , " Elizabeth is moving on with her life and wants to put this difficult chapter behind her .
It was an excruciatingly painful period for her and she [ has ] no interest in rehashing the past . "
News of the separation comes a week before a tell - all book by Andrew Young , a one - time close confidante of John Edwards , is set to hit bookstores .
" Based on the limited portions of the book that have been made available , it is clear it contains many falsehoods and exaggerations , " the statement from Random House said .
" [ Elizabeth Edwards ] will not engage in a dialogue on each of the false charges , but would like to set the record straight on two key points .
" First , the allegation that she sought to politicize her cancer is unconscionable , hurtful and patently false .
Second , she believed Andrew Young to be the father of this child until her husband confessed his paternity to her this past summer .
She will have nothing further to say . "
Edwards , 56 , had denied he was the father of his mistress Rielle Hunter 's infant for more than a year , saying his self - admitted affair with her was over before she became pregnant .
People magazine , a CNN sister organization , first reported the story .
Elizabeth Edwards ' sister , Nancy Anania , told People magazine in an article dated Wednesday that Elizabeth Edwards told her , " I 've had it .
I can't do this .
I want my life back . "
The sister told the magazine , " She 's got cancer and has young children and totally believes in marriage ... but she can only do so much . "
Read the People story
John Edwards , a former U.S. senator from North Carolina , sought his party 's presidential nomination in 2004 and 2008 .
On November 3 , 2004 , the day her husband and Sen. John Kerry , D - Massachusetts , conceded the presidential race , Elizabeth Edwards revealed she had been diagnosed with breast cancer .
She discovered a lump in her right breast the last week of the campaign , but said she withheld the diagnosis from her husband to spare him the distraction during the campaign .
She announced in 2007 that the cancer had recurred .
Last year , she told CNN's Larry King that the medicine she was taking seemed to be working .
However , she said the situation was " up and down . "
Elizabeth Edwards , 60 , and her husband have been married for 32 years .
They had four children together .
The oldest , Wade , died in a car accident in 1996 .
Spokesmen for both of the Edwardses did not return CNN calls seeking comment .
CNN 's Deb Krajnak contributed to this report .
I ’m clearly some sort of grinch , because when I think of flourless chocolate cakes I imagine giant discs of truffle so dense and overly rich that even a sliver of somehow feels excessive , the kind of throwaway dessert restaurants bust out when they ’ve got no better ideas .
“ Add a couple out - of - season , eerily red raspberries and a tuft of whipped cream from a can and it will , without fail , sell , ” I imagine sinister managers instructing kitchen staff .
Like I said , I ’m a total pill .
However , when the same flourless chocolate cake is treated like a soufflé — eggs separated , yolks beaten until ribbony and whites whipped until weightless , then gently folded in — and then placed anywhere in my proximity , all bets are off .
Because what it does is magical ; what was once weighted is lifted off the plate .
The top puffs and shatters a little , like a meringue , a meringue with butter .
It manages to be both the lightest , barely - there wisp of cake and the most unabashedly rich chocolate fix .
Yes , at once .
But we should really talk about this thing nested in the fallen center of the cakes : white chocolate mint whipped cream .
I know !
I do n’t know where it has been my whole life either .
It is the answer to every question worth asking , from “ How can I eat a puddle of melted mint ice cream without buying mint ice cream just to let it warm up ? ” to “ How can I make this snow day ’s cup of hot coca even more transcendent ? ” to “ When will my kid stop doing this ? ”
Okay , maybe not that .
But I swear , even a little 6 a.m. is easier to handle with a surplus of minty whipped cream in the fridge .

Chocolate Soufflé Cupcakes with White Chocolate Mint Cream
Cupcakes very generously adapted a Bon Appetit recipe ; whipped cream brilliance via a Claudia Fleming recipe
Be ye not intimidated by all of the fancy words floating around here : this recipe is approachable stuff : melted chocolate , separated eggs , things folded together and whipped again .
Your hand mixer does all of the work .
You , however , may have all of the glory when you surprise your lady - or ladfriend with these this weekend .
[ Updated to note : Many people who have made this say they ’re getting 12 ! cupcakes .
So you might have more chocolate awesomeness than you ’d intended .
If you end up with more cupcakes , go ahead and double the whipped cream recipe .
To be safe .
You will not regret it . ]
Makes 9 * cupcakes ( see Note above )
Chocolate Soufflé Cupcakes
6 ounces ( 170 grams ) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate , chopped ( I preferred this with bittersweet )
6 tablespoons ( 3/4 stick or 85 grams ) unsalted butter , cut into pieces
Heaping 1/4 teaspoon ( 1 gram ) espresso or instant coffee powder
3 large eggs , separated
6 tablespoons ( 75 grams ) sugar , divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
White Chocolate Mint Cream
2 ounces ( 55 grams ) white chocolate , finely chopped
3 ounces heavy whipping cream
1/8 teaspoon peppermint extract
Get the white chocolate mint cream ready for later :
Place the white chocolate in a small bowl .
Bring the cream to a simmer , pour it over the chocolate and let it sit for a minute to melt the chocolate .
Whisk well .
Add the peppermint extract and whisk again .
Lay a piece of plastic wrap on the surface of the cream .
Chill until very cold , about two hours .
Make cupcakes : Preheat oven to 350 °F .
Line 9 standard - size ( 3 - ounce ) muffin cups with paper liners .
Stir chocolate , butter and espresso powder together in heavy medium saucepan over low heat mostly melted , then remove from the heat and whisk until it is fully melted and smooth .
( I like to put the butter underneath the chocolate in the pan , so that it protects the chocolate from the direct heat . )
Cool to lukewarm , stirring occasionally .
Using electric mixer ( a hand mixer , rather than a stand mixer , actually works best here because the volumes are so small ) beat egg yolks and 3 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl until mixture is very thick and pale , about 2 minutes .
Briefly beat lukewarm chocolate mixture , then vanilla extract , into yolk mixture .
Using clean dry beaters , beat egg whites in another medium bowl until soft peaks form .
Gradually add remaining 3 tablespoons sugar and all of the salt , beating until medium - firm peaks form .
Fold whites into chocolate mixture in 3 additions .
Divide batter among prepared cups , filling each three - fourths of the way .
( You might find , as I did , that you had enough leftover for a extra half - cake .
That ’s your “ taste tester ” .
It ’s a , uh , very important part of the process . )
Bake cakes until tops are puffed and dry to the touch ( some may crack , embrace it ) and a tester inserted into the centers comes out with some moist crumbs attached , about 15 to 20 minutes .
Cool in pan on a cooling rack , where the cupcakes will almost immediately start to fall .
It will be all the better to put your mint cream on them .
Finish your masterpiece : Beat mint white chocolate cream with electric beaters until soft peaks form .
Remove cupcakes from pan , arrange on a platter .
Fill each sunken top with a healthy dollop of white chocolate mint cream .
Top with shaved dark chocolate , if you ’re feeling fancy .
I ’d say “ eat at once ” but I suspect that you already have .
* Yes , nine .
I honestly wanted it to make a neat , normal number like a half dozen so badly that in my first flop , I attempted to shove all the batter into six cups .
Do n’t do this .
** I also tried to make this without the cupcake liners , by just buttering the cupcake molds .
Do n’t do this either , unless you want you end result to look like this .

Can the Government Keep Us Safe ?
by Andrew P. Napolitano by Andrew P. Napolitano Recently by Andrew P. Napolitano : What Is a Right ?
What a week we have all just endured !
While the Democrats were re-writing the federal takeover of healthcare behind closed doors , the public face of the federal government was fixated on denying and then explaining all the gaps in its intelligence gathering .
The Obama administration has been finger - pointing over who in the government let a murderous thug on a plane in Amsterdam that he tried to explode over Detroit .
First , the government said that the system worked .
Then the President said it did n’t .
Then he announced that the intelligence communities and security people would start to talk to each other so the bad guys could be kept out .
Were n’t they supposed to be doing this all along ?
At Newark Liberty Airport last Sunday , a TSA agent left his post , and a young man walked past it to kiss his girlfriend good - bye .
Then the young man turned and left the secured area and left the airport .
So far no harm , no foul .
But because the government ’s surveillance cameras in the airport did n’t work , the feds panicked and ordered over 10,000 passengers to leave the terminal , go out into the 15 - degree Newark , NJ cold at night , and then re-enter the airport .
Flights were delayed and missed , kids did not get to school on Monday morning , and soldiers were listed as AWOL .
All because the government overreacted to a kiss .
This humiliated the feds : New Jersey ’s 86 - year - old senior Senator Frank Lautenberg demanded that the guy who kissed his gal be hunted down and prosecuted because of the chaos he caused .
He caused ?
Let ’s see ; the government has cameras that watch us every time we scratch our noses , and when those cameras do n’t work , the government blames the person whose picture it was supposed to be taking ?
Come on .
All this , of course , brings out the false argument of liberty versus security .
And we hear it from the Progressives that the government must take our freedoms in order to keep us safe .
That ’s hogwash .
Freedom is our birthright .
It does n’t come from the government ; it is part of our humanity .
America is the only country in the history of the world dedicated to the truism that we are endowed by our Creator , as Jefferson wrote , with certain inalienable rights , and among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
The government has forgotten basic civics : “ Endowed by our Creator ” means that our rights come from God and not from the feds .
“ Inalienable ” means that we and our freedoms cannot be separated , unless and until we are convicted by a jury of violating someone else ’s rights .
What is the value of being safe if we are not free ?
Did our forefathers flee the kings and despots of Europe and come here to be safe ?
Did Patrick
Henry say " Give me safety or give me death ? "
Here is the mistake that the Big Government crowd wants to thrust upon us :
They want to balance liberty and safety .
There is no such thing as balance when it comes to freedom .
We will not trade freedom for anything , or balance it against anything , and we certainly wo n’t give it up to the TSA .
Can the government keep us safe ?
I do n’t think so .
Airline travel is safer today because pilots have guns , cockpit doors are like bank vaults , and the passengers have become courageous .
All this was done by individuals in the private sector , not by the government .
I ’ve said it before and I ’ll say it again , if the feds had not stripped us of our natural rights to keep ourselves safe — by keeping and bearing arms — 9/11 would never have happened .
How about letting the airlines decide who gets on the planes , rather than a TSA worker who leaves his post ?
When industry competes for your business , you fly where you want to go , you get there in comfort and safety , and you do all this at a competitive cost .
When the government runs the show , you stand in the cold night air for six hours because of a kiss .
The government ca n’t deliver the mail , it ca n’t operate surveillance cameras at an airport ; it ca n’t pay back its debts ; it ca n’t tell the truth .
That would be the same government that wants to manage your healthcare .
America , do you see what happens when we rely on the government too much ?
It gets authoritarian and we get weak .
Our children grow to expect from the government what we once did for ourselves .
Government is a fearful master .
It is not faithful to us ; it is not truthful to us ; it ca n’t produce for us .
It does n’t obey its own laws ; it does n’t keep us safe ; and it wo n’t leave us alone .
It is mortgaging our futures , raising our taxes , and treating us all like children .
What to do ?
Challenge it at every turn .
Expose it to friend and foe .
Educate all you know about what you see and hear every day on this show .
And return no one to the government who has stolen your freedom .

A company resident reviews a feasibility study for an environment protection project in a small community where the company ’s headquarters building is located .
A personnel manager discusses with union leaders the forthcoming collective bargaining agreement .
A marketing manager reviews videos of proposed media campaigns .
A group of employees discuss the latest changes in the top management over coffee at the cafeteria .
What do each of these activities share ?
They all involve corporate communication .
Some have this notion that corporate communication is the same as organizational communication .
Others think it is a mere “ rehash ” of public relations .
Still there are those who equate it with advertising , company publications , and management information systems .
If corporate communication is not generally well understood , it may be because corporate communication is still evolving .
The concept is an offshoot of the growing recognition by top management of communication as a strategic resource in achieving corporate goals and objectives .
As the term implies , corporate communication encompasses all the communication activities undertaken within the corporate context , whether formal or informal , regardless of direction or flow of information ( i.e. top - down , bottom - up , horizontal ) .
What corporate communication aims to achieve is to integrate the various communication activities within the corporate organization and recognize them as key management functions .
It seeks to upgrade public relations .
It seeks to upgrade public relations , organizational communication , and advertising into the level of scientific discipline quite removed from the level of gut feel .
As the International Management Magazine ( June 1985 ) noted , corporate communication - related activities a common direction or framework .
The growth of corporate communication can be attributed to the trend among progressive companies to appoint a communication man to top managerial positions ( and even in the executive board ) .
Corporate Executive Officers ( CEOs ) are beginning to realize that the success or failure of corporate strategies depends on how communication resources are harnessed .
Communication : The Nervous System of Organizations
A review of definitions of the term organization indicates how critical communication is the very existence of an organization .
Koontz and O’Donnel define organization as a communication decision - making network .
Peter Drucker states , “ The organization is above all , an information decision - making system . ”
Communication is not a secondary or derived aspect of an organization , but rather the essence of organized activity and is the basic process out of which all functions derive .
It is quite clear then that communication links the various parts of an organization ; it is the principal tool of managers .
Through communication , the manager receives the information needed in making the right decision , and once the decision is made , manager must communicate it to others .
Perhaps you often hear managers saying , “ Our problem is communication . ”
Indeed , many managers use communication as an excuse if they are not able to achieve their goal or objective .
While it is true that communication as an excuse if they are not able to achieve their goal or objective .
While it is true that communication is a vital skill of managers , it would be wrong to conclude that an effective communicator alone makes a good manager .
An effective communication for a wrong decision will not do any good to the company .
Conversely , for a manager to be an effective planner and decision - maker is not enough .
A good decision ( or action plan ) must be translated into action .
Affluent shoppers hit by the recession are fuelling a shoplifting crimewave , according to research published today .
Middle - class people reluctant to give up luxuries they can no longer afford are behind thefts of expensive foods , alcohol and cosmetics , it was claimed .
Hundreds of retailers said shoplifting surged as goods were taken for personal use and not for re-sale by organised criminal gangs .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Shoplifting shot up by a fifth in the 12 months to June , leaving shops to pick up a £ 4.88 billion bill for lost stock .
The data was compiled from 42,000 shops across Europe by the Centre for Retail Research on behalf of Checkpoint Systems , a retail security company .
Britain registered the highest rate of shoplifting in Europe and only the United States and Japan had higher levels worldwide .
Neil Matthews , of Checkpoint Systems , said the surge in shoplifting comes at a time when retailers can least afford it .
He said : " But what is perhaps as surprising as the figures themselves is that we are not simply looking at your traditional shoplifters here .
" We are seeing more instances of amateur thieves stealing goods for their own personal use rather than to sell on than before .
" This is epitomised in the recent uprising of the middle - class shoplifter , someone who has turned to theft to sustain their standard of living .

" This is driving theft of items such as cosmetics , perfumes and face creams , alcohol , fresh meat , mobile phones , computer games and DVDs as well as small electrical goods like cameras , iPods and personal care gadgets . "
The survey found that an average shoplifter takes goods worth £ 80.31 , with expensive branded goods at the top of their " shopping " lists .
Fashion clothing stores saw one of the highest increases in theft ( up 9 per cent ) , followed by speciality food and convenience stores ( up 8.4 per cent ) and DIY outlets ( up 4 per cent ) .
The report highlighted that , although shoplifters and organised gangs are the most common thieves , employee theft is also rising .
Branded " silent shoplifters " in the trade , employee thieves are more prolific and steal goods worth £ 1,585 .
Mr Matthews said British stores invested more than £ 926 million in measures to counter shoplifting over the last year .
He added : " Loss from retail crime is often viewed as simply a cost of doing business .
" But as the report clearly demonstrates the social and economic impact of turning a blind eye is immense , especially in these tough economic times .
" Retailers simply cannot afford to ignore this problem .
It is not going to go away and is the equivalent of criminals taxing every UK household £ 227 per year . "
Researchers questioned 1,069 large retailers with combined sales of £ 514 billion for the survey .
Faces play a very important role in our social life .
We make complex social decisions based on facial appearance .
Extensive research has been made to identify a set of facial features which make a face attractive .
Possibly no research is needed to predict which face a heterosexual male would prefer when asked to choose between Megan Fox ( voted as one of the sexiest celebrities ) and Jocelyn Wildenstein ( voted as one of the ugliest celebrities ) .
But we know little how we make a preference decision when the two faces are closely matched ( e.g. , age , race , gender , gaze , facial attributes , facial emotion ) .
Is there any specific brain activity pattern associated with our preference ( or non-preference ) ?
Can these patterns be identified before our conscious decision ?
These problems were addressed by a neuroimaging study led by Joydeep Bhattacharya at Goldsmiths , University of London , where human volunteers were asked to make a preference decision between two faces which are closely matched .
Faces were presented one after the other and volunteers were instructed to choose the face that they would most like to approach and to talk to .
Their brain waves ( electroencephalogram ) were continuously recorded .
" We found specific brain activity patterns which correlate to the decision making process , " said Bhattacharya , " one pattern is specific to the face currently being looked at , and the other is specific to the face previously shown which is only available through mental recall , and surprisingly , both patterns occur well before the moment of conscious decision on which face is preferred .
We also found some activity patterns which are possibly related to positive first impression effect . "
Does this mean that brain decides first and tells us later ?
Bhattacharya remarked , " This is a tricky question which troubles both neuroscientists and philosophers alike .
We cannot prove from the current study that this is indeed the case , but there is ample evidence that we are not fully aware of the constituent brain processes leading to a conscious decision .
The real challenge is to predict the final conscious decision based on these pre-conscious neural activity patterns on trial by trial basis and in real - time . "
Other researchers involved with the study , published in the journal NeuroImage , are Job Lindsen and Rhiannon Jones from Goldsmiths , University of London and Shinsuke Shimojo from California Institute of Technology , USA .

The IPCC has issued a statement about all of the criticism being heaped upon them by bloggers and journalists regarding poor sourcing of references .
Me thinks they are clueless about how to handle public relations .
Here ’s the release :
Recent media interest has drawn attention to two so - called errors in the Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 ) of the IPCC , the first dealing with losses from disasters and the second on the subject of Amazon forests .
The leadership of the IPCC has looked into both these instances and concluded that the challenges are without foundations .
In neither case , did we find any basis for making changes in the wording of the report .
We are convinced that there has been no error on those issues on the part of the IPCC .
We released a statement about the disaster issue .
As far as the second subject dealing with the Amazon is concerned , again , the IPCC has valid reasons for publishing the text as it stands in the report .
In response to these baseless charges , we have decided to provide details on the manner in which the IPCC has implemented its principles and procedures .
These are the foundations that provide assurance on the validity and accuracy of statements made in the AR4 .

The law , which was introduced by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan , Democrat of New York , was estimated to raise $ 60 million over five years , a figure based on a belief by a staff member of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation that employees cheat less on their taxes than independent contractors do .
That was enough money to pay for a tax break , approved with Mr. Moynihan 's support , that was sought by I.B.M. for its overseas operations .
Under the Gramm - Rudman deficit control act of the previous year , Congress was required to pay for any tax cuts with comparable revenue increases or spending cuts .
A year after the law regarding contractors was enacted , the Senator tried to repeal it , but his bill died .
In 1994 , Senator William V. Roth , Republican of Delaware , the sponsor of this week 's hearings , wrote Mr. Moynihan saying the programmers should get relief .
More than 60 other senators have written similar letters since 1994 , but they have not voted to change the law .
Ginny Flynn , a spokeswoman for Mr. Roth , said that while the Senator believed that the law was unfair , he was not currently moving to change it because '' despite the fact the programmers are treated differently from other people , this opens a Pandora 's box of other independent contractor issues . ''
Programmers and their lawyers say that as a result of inaction by Congress , many corporations have revised their policies to explicitly forbid the hiring of programmers who are independent contractors .
In response , some people , like Mrs. Johnson , incorporated .
They reasoned that if they were employees of their own corporations they would be treated by the I.R.S. the way that many doctors and others are and could expand their enterprises .
But internal I.R.S. documents show that in Alaska , California , Ohio , Minnesota , New York and New Jersey , I.R.S. auditors as recently as last year hunted for corporations created by computer programmers .
They found scores of such companies and then disallowed them for tax purposes .
The papers show that they were disallowed because they were less than a year old and had only one employee , the programmer who created the corporation .
Across the country , officials of high - technology temporary - help companies said the I.R.S. audit tactic had caused many corporations to refuse to hire programmers unless they become employees , like Mrs. Johnson , or were employees of such temporary - help agencies .
GUANGZHOU , China 
Just a year after laying off millions of factory workers , China is facing an increasingly acute labor shortage .
As American workers struggle with near double - digit unemployment , unskilled factory workers here in China ’s industrial heartland are being offered signing bonuses .
Factory wages have risen as much as 20 percent in recent months .
Telemarketers are turning away potential customers because recruiters have fully booked them to cold - call people and offer them jobs .
Some manufacturers , already weeks behind schedule because they can’t find enough workers , are closing down production lines and considering raising prices .
Such increases would most likely drive up the prices American consumers pay for all sorts of Chinese - made goods .
“ Intellectual Property ” is Not Progressive
There ’s an entire cottage industry of writers — Mark Helprin and Jaron Lanier among them — who attack “ the new collectivism ” of network culture based on its supposed violations of “ intellectual property ” rights and its destruction of “ authorial voice . ”
Chris Hedges , at Alternet ( “ Are Corporations Using the Internet to Accelerate Our Cultural , Political and Economic Decline ? ” ) , has the virtue of novelty in that he regurgitates every single one of Helprin ’s talking points — but does so under the pretense of defending “ progressive ” values against corporate power .
The Internet , Hedges argues , has been hijacked by corporate interests and become a tool of corporate power because it — get this — “ efficiently disseminates content , but … does not protect intellectual property rights . ”
“ Intellectual property ” is the enemy of corporate power , see , and it ’s those corporate fat cats who are undermining it !
In Hedges ’ jeremiad , this weakening of “ intellectual property ” rights is somehow identified with the “ new global serfdom , ” in which “ [ a ] nything that can be digitized can and is being outsourced to countries such as India and China where wages are miserable and benefits nonexistent , ” where “ the only professions that pay a living wage are propaganda and corporate management . ”
News flash :
We ’ve already had a century and a half of corporate serfdom , and people like Hedges are its useful idiots .
“ Intellectual property ” is the linchpin , the keystone in the arch , of global corporate power .
It ’s the primary means by which our global corporate masters are currently holding onto power .
Global corporate serfdom is only possible through corporate ownership of “ intellectual property , ” which permits them to maintain control of the outsourced production Hedges complains of .
Corporate ownership of patents and trademarks is absolutely essential to the Nike model of outsourced production .
Does Hedges really not know this ?
Hedges complains , in the same terms as Lanier and Helprin , that original work is copied and mashed up , and deprives content creators of a source of revenue .
Content aggregators ( he mentions Google specifically ) are especially blameworthy .
So Hedges takes his stand alongside “ progressives ” like Rupert Murdoch .
Golly , it ’s a good thing Newscorp is n’t one of those nasty old corporations , like Google !
Hedges displays some confusion in his critique of Internet culture , ironically echoing earlier leftist critiques of the mass culture associated with mass production industry and mass consumption at the height of twentieth century Consensus Capitalism .
But in fact networked culture is diametrically opposed to it .
It used to be said that the First Amendment guaranteed our right to a free press — so long as we were rich enough to own a printing press .
The desktop revolution and the Internet have brought the cost of a printing press down to a few hundred dollars at most .
Writers like Robert McChesney and Noam Chomsky once lamented the fact that the U.S. media was controlled by a handful of giant corporations .
It was the Internet that brought about an end run around this corporate control of the media .
If you doubt the political significance of this , just compare the size , level of organization , and public profile of the antiwar movement before the first Gulf War with its counterpart before Bush II ’s invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Compared the detailed , merciless dissection of mainstream corporate reporting , which liberal bloggers like Matt Yglesias and Ezra Klein do on a daily basis , to the world of twenty years ago where such analysis was only available to people with a subscription to The Nation .
Hedges quotes Lanier ’s Weimar America scenario ( apparently borrowed from Thomas Frank ) , in which a population of angry white men , impoverished by Internet - enabled outsourcing and downsizing , and manipulated by the Tea Party politics of some new Karl Rove , organize through the Internet to take over the legislatures and burn down abortion clinics .
Well , I have a scenario of my own .
When the world is on the threshold of abundance , and the capital outlays and work hours required to produce a comfortable standard of living are imploding , our corporate feudal lords snatch victory from the jaws of defeat by using totalitarian government controls — draconian digital copyright laws , industrial patents , ubiquitous Internet surveillance — to maintain the artificial scarcity rents on which their parasitic livelihoods depend .
And they do so with the help of “ progressive ” useful idiots like Hedges .
That ’s exactly what the “ progressive ” cognitive capitalism model of Bill Gates , Bono , Paul Romer and Richard Florida is all about : an attempt to capitalize improvements in productivity , through artificial scarcity and artificial property rights , as a source of rents for themselves .
It ’s what Tom Peters is talking about when he gushes that nine tenths of the price of his new Minolta comes from “ intellect ” rather than the actual labor and material costs of production .
They want a world in which nine tenths of the hours we work are to pay tribute to our corporate masters .
And if they succeed , it will be with the help of unwitting stooges like Hedges .
Fortunately , they wo n’t succeed .
The technologies of abundance are blasting the foundations of the old corporate order Hedges defends , and the legal framework it depends on are becoming utterly unenforceable .
A group of artist - activists is freezing a house in Detroit to bring attention not to the cold winter we 're having but to the ails of Detroit 's housing industry .
Our photographer , Marvin Shaouni , took photos for this week 's Model D masthead image .
You can read the Ice House Detroit team 's blog and follow their progress here Here 's a video on the deep freeze project :
It is now six weeks since I launched an investigation , with my colleague Richard North , into the affairs of Dr Rajendra Pachauri , chairman of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the hugely influential body which for 20 years has been the central driver of worldwide alarm about global warming .
Since then the story has grown almost daily , leading to worldwide calls for Dr Pachauri 's resignation .
But increasingly this has also widened out to question the authority of the IPCC itself .
Contrary to the tendentious claim that its reports represent a " consensus of the world 's top 2,500 climate scientists " ( most of its contributors are not climate experts at all ) , it has now emerged , for instance , that one of the more widely quoted scare stories from its 2007 report was drawn from the work of a British " green activist " who occasionally writes as a freelance for The Guardian and The Independent .
By By Andrew Moran Jan 2 , 2010 in Politics On " Larry King Live " this past week , Economist Ben Stein called Congressman Ron Paul 's foreign policy arguments " anti-Semitic " and now the Republican Representative is challenging Stein and others like him to a public foreign policy debate .
The former 2008 Republican Presidential candidate said that the United States foreign policy in the Middle East , including Yemen , was the contributing factor for 23 - year - old Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab ’s attempt to blow up the airplane and continues to be for terrorists around the world .
Stein disagreed with the notion and told viewers that Dr. Paul was actually instead stating that “ we are doing something wrong by defending ourselves .
Look , if these terrorists are trying to kill the government of Yemen , we 've got to help defend them .
They are our friends . ”
Paul continued to ask why are the terrorists targeting the US and its allies and Stein responded because “ they are psychos . ”
The OB / GYN said because the US is an occupying force and Stein immediately took offence to that and vehemently stated , “ No we ’re not occupies that ’s the same anti-Semitic argument we hear over and over again . ”
Both men were perturbed and called on each other for an apology .
Several days later , in an interview with Campaign for Liberty , Paul challenged Stein , and other neo-conservatives who believe in an interventionist foreign policy and pre-emptive war strategy , to a public debate , according to “ I like to see a real debate ; as a matter of fact I ’d be really pleased to debate Ben Stein .
I like to see if he really would .
That way we can have a good moderator and to seriously discuss the issue .
I think someone like Bob Schaeffer would be a real good moderator to do something like that or some school so somebody can do it . ”
Paul further stated it would be a great challenge to his ideas and also to the people like Stein who believe in a great US presence around the globe in the name of national defence .
Paul concluded , “ I hereby challenge Ben Stein .
Would you like to debate ?
If you do , I ’ll meet you . ” Digital Journal reported on Tuesday that Republican Congressman Ron Paul , Democratic Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee and Economist and former Presidential speechwriter Ben Stein were on “ Larry King Live ” to discuss the recent attempted terrorist attack on the Northwest Airlines flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit and the recent bombings in Yemen
The former 2008 Republican Presidential candidate said that the United States foreign policy in the Middle East , including Yemen , was the contributing factor for 23 - year - old Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab ’s attempt to blow up the airplane and continues to be for terrorists around the world .

While this all sounds good in theory , my eight years in public office tells me that one more group , no matter how it is constituted , issuing one more report , is not going to drive better public policy .
He suggests that government initiate a more “ open , transparent and systematic public - private policy process in each major area of sustainable development ” — high - level roundtable proceedings that are open to the public , web - based , and include representatives from private business , nongovernmental organizations , government officials , scientists , and engineers .
1. Inability to focus beyond the next election 2 .
Decisions are made through negotiations with those who will be funding the next election ( i.e. industry lobbyists )
3 . Technical expertise is ignored or bypassed 4 .
The public is largely excluded from the process
Jeffrey Sachs , economic advisor to the UN , in his recently published article , Fixing the Broken Government Policy Process , articulates four manifestations of the breakdown in Washington :
( Editor 's note : Below is an essay by new TheOilDrum contributor Debbie Cook .
Debbie was formerly Mayor and Councilmember of Huntington Beach , CA from 2000 - 2008 and a US Congressional Candidate , 46th District in 2008 .
She is also President of the Board at the Post Carbon Institute .
Long active in resource depletion related outreach with TOD , ASPO and PCI , she is also locally involved with energy / water and permaculture issues in southern CA . )
In my opinion the best way to influence policy is for the “ scientists and engineers ” to influence policy makers directly — and you do n’t do that in a report , in a letter , on a petition , or a blog .
It requires a commitment to face - to - face relationship building , nurturing , and maintenance — not the kind of activity typically selected by the pocket protector / lab coat types .
Rarely does a policy discussion center solely around facts .
Emotions like trust , loyalty , anger , contempt , and sympathy are often just below the surface of every discussion .
Facts become attached to emotions in large part because of the relationships that have developed between individuals , groups , and ideas .
Words like “ politician ” and “ government ” evoke strong emotions that may have very little to do with facts and everything to do with how we synthesize information .
Here is a real life example of policy making on the fly .
On the same day that Scientific American published Professor Sachs ’ article , the Southern California Association of Governments ( SCAG ) was taking up the issue of E85 ethanol fueling stations .
See here and here for the agenda items .
SCAG is the largest Metropolitan Planning Organization in the United States covering 6 counties and 19 million residents .
It is guided by an unwieldy 83 member governing board whose members are elected representatives of cities and counties within the region .
SCAG is mandated by the federal government to undertake planning and policy initiatives within the areas of transportation , growth management , hazardous waste management , and air quality .
This particular policy debate surrounding the E85 fueling stations serves as a good example of the fragmented decision - making process described by Sachs .
It is also an example of the cast of characters whose relationships will have influenced the issue prior to it reaching the policy making body : a lobbyist who had applied for and won a grant in the agency ’s name but without their knowledge ; a businessman who was the sole source recipient of the grant ; an Executive Director concerned over rejecting a DOE grant for fear it would affect future grant awards ; an elected official or two whose communities are being targeted for an ethanol plant ; air quality officials whose mandate is to reduce emissions ; and a former colleague ( myself ) who spent her years on the board introducing concepts like peak oil and energy return on investment .
Every member ’s vote represented a unique “ truth ” to that member based on facts filtered through their relationship matrix .
It was the interactions between and among the characters that influenced the range of expressions preceding the vote .
There were votes of loyalty for the Executive Director ; votes of trust for a former colleague ; votes of sympathy for the businessman who was losing out on an opportunity to build 55 fueling stations ; and votes of anger against a lobbyist who may or may not have obfuscated information from the agency .
For me , the result was both unexpected and unsatisfying — unexpected because the inertia behind the industry seemed insurmountable , and unsatisfying because many board members are still holding onto the belief that cellulosic ethanol will displace transportation fuels and bring the U.S. closer to “ energy independence . ”
Dissuading policy makers from these and other fantasies is going to require many more conversations .
The hope for cellulosic ethanol appeals to the same fantasy themes ascribed by Dr. Benjamin Sovacool , researcher on issues related to energy policy , to the hydrogen economy : independence , patriotism , progress , democratization , and inevitability .
As Savacool says , “ The desire to experience these sorts of fantasies will likely continue even if the hydrogen economy does not come to fruition . ”
Indeed , the ethanol fantasy continues even as targets come up 90 % short .
I have my own fantasy — to see CBS news journalist Dan Rather pay atonement to Robert Rapier for Rather ’s 60 Minutes piece .
Something akin to Mad Money ’s host Jim Cramer ’s repentance to Jon Stewart , host of the Daily Show :
Cramer : I always wish that people would come in and swear themselves in before they come on the show .
I had a lot of CEOs lie to me on the show .
It 's very painful .
I do n't have subpoena power … .
But Dick Fuld , who ran Lehman Brothers , called me in — he called me in when the stock was at 40 — because I was saying : " Look , I thought the stock was wrong , thought it was in the wrong place " — he brings me in and lies to me , lies to me , lies to me .
Stewart [ feigning shock ] :
The CEO of a company lied to you ?
Cramer : Shocking .
So returning to Sachs ’ idea that we can work together to fix government policy - making , here is my prescription for scientists , professors , and engineers :
1. Participate in the public discourse
2. Publicly challenge your peers who put forward junk science
3 . Be mindful of fallacies in your own assumptions
4. Relationships are primary and every policy is derived primarily from relationships , not facts .
To each critic sitting in their ivory tower , I challenge you to create the conditions for these relationships to flourish .
Apple said the child workers are now no longer being used , or are no longer underage .
" In each of the three facilities , we required a review of all employment records for the year as well as a complete analysis of the hiring process to clarify how underage people had been able to gain employment , " Apple said , in an annual report on its suppliers .
Barack Obama has admitted the need to break his most celebrated campaign promise .
Suddenly he is " agnostic " on increasing taxes for people earning less than $ 250,000 .
Nine years ago , as an Illinois state senator , Obama criticized the Supreme Court for not removing a roadblock that forbids Washington to redistribute income .
That roadblock is the United States Constitution .
Washington routinely redistributes income within American society .
When Joe Taxpayer receives government benefits that exceed what he pays in taxes , the effect is what the Heritage Foundation calls a " distributional deficit . "
Joe 's higher - earning fellow taxpayers must fill that deficit .
" Each year , government is involved in a large - scale transfer of resources between different social groups . "
The very idea that human nature or any natural law would be allowed to control humans or nature nauseates progressives .
For example , allowing markets to be free and the weather to do its thing are immoral .
So then , government must make people and science play fairly .
Steeply graduated taxation for financing that government constitutes noble robbery .
George Mason University economics professor Don Boudreaux , who is also a Café Hayek blogger , explains his acid test for determining the genuineness of someone 's nobility .
Desire to help others is noble .
It 's noble , though , not in and of itself .
It 's noble only if it 's likely to lead to helping others who truly need help .
A desire to help others that prompts well - meaning people to address nonexistent problems is n't so much noble as it is misguided and , possibly , dangerous .
Misguided nobility tends to focus people on intent , not results .
Forty years of Great Society - inspired welfarism has brought a 70 - percent illegitimate birthrate among blacks -- a 218 - percent explosion since the LBJ years .
The non-Hispanic white illegitimacy rate hovers below 12 percent .
Amid a finger - pointing blame - fest , " minority advocates " still supply the crutches on which minorities lean .
For instance , affirmative action strengthens the haplessness in " protected classes " that motivated liberals to " protect " those classes in the first place .
Interestingly , Johns Hopkins and Syracuse Universities researchers found that immigrant black children attend college at a 25 percent higher rate , and upper echelon schools at a four times higher rate , than multigenerational African - American children .
Princeton University and University of Pennsylvania sociologists determined that immigrants comprise 27 percent of blacks at " selective " colleges and a whopping 41 percent at Ivy League institutions despite immigrants comprising only 13 percent of early college - aged blacks in general .
A black person has to be born into the victimhood peddled by the American progressive in order to fall for that victimhood .
In order to be progressive , one must keep up the appearance of helping the " less fortunate , " pay no attention to the effects of said help , and soak up the feel - good one gets when the world praises the wonderfulness of one 's intentions .
Professor Boudreaux points out the absurdity of a Macy 's department store poster campaign which implies that 38 million Americans routinely go hungry .
... because feeding oneself and one 's family is perhaps the most fundamental of all human impulses , if so many Americans were truly " at risk of hunger " on a regular basis , then it is nearly impossible to explain why poor Americans are so richly endowed with goods and services far less necessary to survival than food .
The Heritage Foundation 's Ralph Rector observed that the " typical American categorized as ' poor ' by the government " owns a refrigerator , stove , washing machine , home air conditioning , microwave , color TV , VCR , stereo , at least one car , and 30 percent of the time , two cars .
Evidently , then , self - anointed noble watchdogs want us to believe that starving poor people in the throes of fighting off a survival impulse transmitted by their stomachs to their brains leave air - conditioned homes and drive air - conditioned cars to appliance stores , where they buy microwave ovens to reheat nonexistent food that they did n't buy because they could n't afford it .
Such rationale passes for clear thought among progressives , who push taxpayer funding for feel - good programs based on flawed science and economics .
If allowed to remain off - leash , where will noble progressives take America ?
The Tax Foundation found that President Obama 's policies would massively increase income redistribution .
Already , 60 percent of Americans are " net ' receivers ' of federal government benefits . "
Most families earning no more than $ 86,000 currently pay less federal tax than the dollar - value of government benefits that they collect .
The new threshold will grow to $ 109,000 if Obama gets his way on health care , carbon " cap - and - trade , " and new taxes on the wealthy .
The president 's plans would annually take almost $ 1 trillion from the top- earning 30 percent of families and hand it to the bottom 70 percent .
Essentially , three of ten families will pay all federal bills for the remaining seven .
Even before considering Obama 's hefty redistributionism , every federal tax dollar paid by America 's lowest earners garners for those earners $ 10.44 in federal benefits .
The president 's 2012 reelection campaign slogan will be , " Open a progressive savings account .
Hold out your hand and I 'll double your 1,000 - percent interest rate . "
Another Tax Foundation study puts a frightening perspective on Obama 's grotesque spending .
Eliminating the federal deficit could require a 95.2 - percent tax rate on the wealthiest Americans .
Beatle George Harrison captured his government 's arrogance back when he was enduring confiscatory taxation .
Harrison wrote , " Should five percent appear too small , be thankful I do n't take it all . "
One wonders who it is that the noble progressives think will create the jobs they keep promising when $ 952 of every $ 1,000 earned by small business owners is used to pay unemployment compensation for people who have no job and no intention of getting one as long as the noble progressives have their backs .
Reality - blind progressives like Barack Obama and the leftist ideologues who inhabit Capital Hill will spend and borrow and tax and spend even as prosperity evaporates .
They will " spread the wealth " so thinly that only the super - wealthy will have any wealth left to confiscate for spreading .
Progressives ' tax - the - rich agenda could have the insidious effect of encouraging the wealthy to work less in order to avoid being nobly robbed of more of their wealth .
If Barack Obama somehow rams through his prosperity - killing agenda , then John Galt will emerge from the mountains of Colorado to pluck the achievers from society once again .
IN GAL LAND CRIME IS THE DOMINANT FEATURE OF LIFE .
IN GUY LAND THE ONLY CRIME IS STUPIDITY .
Lifetime is big on original movies ( it recently started a separate , movies - only channel ) , but a large proportion of those films work one basic plotline : a woman ( sometimes with spouse and / or children ) is in danger ; is she intrepid enough to save herself ?
Description of “ The Accidental Witness ” : “ A murderer goes after a female attorney when he thinks that she has witnessed one of his killings . ”
And “ Break - In ” : “ What begins as a leisurely romantic honeymoon in a tropical paradise quickly turns into a tension - filled crisis as intruders break in during the middle of the night and take the honeymooners hostage . ”
You get the idea : In Gal Land you are never , ever safe .
You are never , ever safe in Guy Land either , but only because you ’re not very bright .
We learn this from one of Spike ’s original shows , “ 1,000 Ways to Die , ” which was introduced in spring 2008 and is still around .
The title says it all : Each episode features dramatizations of real - life fatalities that were odd almost beyond imagining .
A man driving drunk leans out the window to vomit just as the car is passing a mailbox ; head and mailbox collide ; head ends up on the ground .
A drunk man in Honolulu tries to join in one of those twirling torch dances staged for tourists ; he catches fire and burns to death as people applaud , thinking it ’s part of the show .
IN GAL LAND THINGS WEIGH MORE THAN THEY DO IN GUY LAND .
By “ things ” here we mean , basically , “ women . ”
Spike ’s shows are full of women who could easily be in Playboy and probably have been : gorgeous in that hourglass way , hair full and perfect .
On Lifetime there is “ Sherri , ” a sitcom introduced last fall starring Sherri Shepherd , who is what is generally called full - figured .
There is also “ Drop Dead Diva , ” in which a thin model who dies young gets sent back to earth but is placed in the body of a large - ish woman played by Brooke Elliott .
Plump women are almost never seen on Spike , and hotties are almost never seen on Lifetime .
It ’s a tough call as to which is the more cynical ploy : brazenly playing to a female audience that probably could stand to lose a few pounds or shamelessly playing to a male audience that likes to fantasize about women more gorgeous than actually exist in real life .
But if women weigh more on Lifetime , so do their brains .
The title character in “ Sherri , ” for instance , is smart , and the show is witty enough that it could play in network prime time .
The women on Spike are roughly as bright as the ones in “ Jersey Shore , ” and the shows are often written for men whose sense of humor never made it out of junior high .
Sir Paul McCartney wanted a place in Dave Grohl 's supergroup Them Crooked Vultures , but was turned down in favour of Led Zeppelin legend JOHN PAUL JONES .
The Beatles star teamed up with the Foo Fighters frontman onstage for a performance at the 2009 Grammy Awards , and when the pair went out for dinner afterwards Grohl revealed his plans for a new band with Queens of the Stone Age singer Josh Homme .
The veteran musician offered his services , but was disappointed when Grohl turned him down - because the rocker had already asked Jones to play bass .
MCCartney says , " We went out for a bite to eat afterwards and Dave told me he was starting this band with Josh .
I asked him who was playing bass and he rather sheepishly told me he 'd approached John .
So you read it here first - Paul MCCartney was nearly the bass player in Them Crooked Vultures . "
Find duplicate copies of files October 8 , 2005
Posted by Carthik in applications
fdupes is a command - line program for finding duplicate files within specified directories .
I have quite a few mp3s and ebooks and I suspected that at least a few of them were copies – you know – as your collection grows by leaps and bounds , thanks to friends , it becomes difficult to individually check each file to see if it is already there on your computer .
So I started looking for a script that checks for duplicate files in an intelligent fashion .
I did n’t find the script but I did find fdupes .
fdupes calculates the md5 hash of the files to compare them , and since each file will have a unique hash , the program identifies duplicates correctly .
I let it run in the directory which contains my files recursively ( which makes it check for duplicates across different directories within the specified directory , and saved the output to a file by doing :
$ fdupes -r ./ stuff > dupes.txt
Then , deleting the duplicates was as easy as checking dupes.txt and deleting the offending directories .
fdupes also can prompt you to delete the duplicates as you go along , but I had way too many files , and wanted to do the deleting at my own pace .
The deletion function is useful if you are only checking for duplicates in a given directory with a few files in it .
China built its famous Great Wall to keep out marauders .

The proposed wall of trees would stretch from Senegal to Djibouti as part of a plan to thwart the southward spread of the Sahara , Senegalese officials said earlier this month at the UN's Copenhagen climate conference .
The trees are meant " to stop the advancement of the desert , " Senegalese president and project leader Abdoulaye Wade told National Geographic News in Copenhagen .
In many central and West African countries surrounding the Sahara , climate change has slowed rainfall to a trickle , according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
Crops have died and soils have eroded — crippling local agriculture .
If the trend continues , the UN forecasts that two - thirds of Africa 's farmland may be swallowed by Saharan sands by 2025 ( explore an interactive Sahara map ) .
Trees are almost always formidable foes against encroaching deserts , said Patrick Gonzalez of the University of California , Berkeley 's Center for Forestry .
That 's because stands of trees act as natural windbreaks against sandstorms , and their roots improve soil health — especially by preventing erosion .
But choosing the right tree species to populate the wall will be crucial to the project 's success , Gonzalez said via email .
Similar tree - planting efforts by outside agencies have failed , he said , in part because they planted foreign species that soon perished in the harsh desert .
" We Have to Do What We Have to Do "
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo first proposed the idea of a desert - blocking wall in 2005 , and it was approved by the African Union in 2007 .
All 11 countries that would house the Great Green Wall have pledged to help fund the project .
But the wall has been slow to break ground :
Of the 4,350 miles ( 7,000 kilometers ) it needs to cover , only about 326 miles ( 525 kilometers ) have been planted so far , all within Senegal .
In Copenhagen , President Wade emphasized that he has made the wall a priority , and he has already asked scientists working on the project to choose species hardy enough to survive in arid conditions without maintenance .
" One thing the president has insisted is … we have to begin the work now , right now , " added Ndiawar Djeng , advisor to the Senegalese environment minister .
" If other international committees follow us , that 's OK .
If not , we have to do what we have to do , " Djeng told National Geographic News .
" It 's in the interest of our local people . "
Farming Boon
The lush channel through the desert would help farmers already displaced by drought — and may even stem the exodus of " environmental refugees , " organizers say .
More than 70 percent of Africa 's poor depends on farming , according to the IPCC .
But drought , desertification , and other climate - related disasters are forcing many farmers to abandon their lands , spurring a heavier flow of immigrants out of central and North Africa .
The 9.3 - mile - wide ( 15 - kilometer - wide ) wall of trees would improve the surrounding , now - degraded soils , allowing farmers to again grow crops and more easily raise livestock in the region .
Senegal also plans to dig rainwater reservoirs along its portion of the wall — virtual lifesavers in a region where rain falls only three months out of the year , supporters say .
" France is helping us by bringing its soldiers , who are working with us planting trees and building reservoirs , " President Wade added .
The gigantic tree barrier would also trap some atmospheric carbon dioxide , a potent greenhouse gas , and produce a refuge for native animals and plants .
Some of the trees themselves may become valuable crops .
The native acacia senegal tree , which is to be a staple plant in the Great Green Wall , produces gum arabic , a main ingredient in consumer products such as cosmetics and soft drinks .
Farmers could collect the sap and even sustainably harvest some of the wood to make tools or produce charcoal , Senegalese environment advisor Djeng said .
Local Know - How
But Senegal may do more for farmers by simply supporting age - old solutions to desertification , UC Berkeley 's Gonzalez noted .
For example the ethnic groups of the Sahel — a swath of semi-arid savanna on the Sahara 's southern border — have long been successful at reforesting their land using " natural regeneration . "
In this method , farmers plant small native trees from seeds found in the region and raise the trees in agricultural fields protected from nibbling livestock , Gonzalez said .
" The Great Green Wall is less feasible than supporting and reinforcing local farmers and the practice of natural regeneration , " he said .
What 's more , planting trees alone will not stop the Sahara 's spread , according to Matt Brown , senior conservation advisor for the Nature Conservancy 's Africa program .
Instead , African governments need to find ways to protect existing vegetation and water sources from overuse , Brown said by email .
An Idaho church associated with right - wing causes and politics was accused of child trafficking .
Ten Americans associated with Central Valley Baptist of Meridian , Idaho and the New Life Children ’s Refuge were caught trying to take 33 Haitian children across the border to the Dominican Republic without the proper authorization .
The BBC reports , “ Even before the earthquake , kidnap gangs were estimated to take thousands of children from the slums and streets of the Haitian capital every year .
“ But the quake has made the situation even worse .
Now there are thousands of new orphans , and thousands more children separated from their families .
“ For days rumors swirled of children being picked off the streets and whisked out of the country . ”
Some of the 33 children are not even orphans , the BBC reports .
One little girl said through tears she had parents and thought she was just going to summer camp .
The Idaho Baptist church is associated with many far - right causes including anti-abortion mobilizations .
One of the church ’s leaders , Randy Jackson , protested at the Salt Lake City Olympic Games , against the Red Cross and Planned Parenthood ’s condom distribution .
Jackson also traveled to Washington D.C. to protest the 2004 March For Women ’s Lives .
The U.S. State Department announced Jan. 26 that both the Haitian and U.S. governments must approve that children are ready to travel .
“ The decision to permit the departure of children before the full and final completion of adoptions is a serious matter .
Both the Haitian and U.S. governments must confirm that each child is appropriately authorized for travel .
“ In the aftermath of a crisis such as the Haiti earthquake , children are especially vulnerable ; and there is increased potential for abuse of , and trafficking in , children .
The United States remains committed to working with the Government of Haiti to implement safeguards to protect children and their families in Haiti . ”
According to a 2002 UNICEF , Haiti has been battling child trafficking , and the United States and Canada are the main receivers of trafficking from the Caribbean .
The United Nations Children and Education Fund also estimates 2.5 million children , a majority of them girls , are sexually exploited in the multi-billion dollar commercial sex industry .
NBC reported that an average predator in the U.S. can make more than $ 200,000 per year off of one young girl .
The church denies any wrong doing .
Central Valley Baptist Pastor Clint Henry told CBS , “ I know there has been illegal activity that ’s been going on down there .
It ’s unfortunate that we would be associated with that . ”

The Atlas V that carried the Solar Dynamics Observatory into orbit on 11 Feb. 2010 created shockwaves that rippled through a cloud layer .
I ’ve counted 11 distinct shockwaves , marked by arrows in this image .
Ok , this has little if anything to do with security or arms control ( well , perhaps a little ) but it is such fun that I could n’t resist writing about it .
And it is certainly very educational .
There is a very fun video of the Solar Dynamics Observatory launched on February 11 , 2010 .
In that video ( and in the image above ) you see the SDO ’s Atlas V launch vehicle passing through a cloud layer , with shockwaves radiating out .
Of course , the shockwaves are generated by the missile and the cloud layer is only providing a way of seeing them .
In fact , what is visible is not a single shockwave radiating through the cloud layer but rather multiple shockwaves passing through the layer .
As these shockwaves “ follow ” the missile , each point of intersection with the cloud layer moves outward .
I ’ve tried to indicate this with the cartoon below :
Shockwaves are formed at “ discontinuities ” along a rocket ’s airframe .
They radiate energy away from the point on the missile where they are created .
As the missile moves along , this constant creation of shocks form what appears to be a continuous “ cone ” that trails along the rocket .
The angle the cone makes with the rocket is therefore related to the rocket ’s speed .
Of course , the more discontinuities there are on the airframe , the more shockwaves are formed and the more energy is radiated away .
That , by the way , explains why the “ baby - bottle nose cone ” of the Ghadr ( also sometimes know as Shahab - 3B and various other names , I wish we could all agree on names ) has a higher drag coefficient than the simple cone on a Nodong or Shahab - 3 .
Of course , as my friend and fellow former UNMOVIC inspector , Mike Elleman points out , the baby bottle shape allows the weight to cross sectional area of the detached warhead to be increased .
This ratio is also know as the ballistic coefficient or Beta of the warhead and allows both a faster reentry and a more stable trajectory .
I ’ve been able to make a rough correspondence between the number of discontinuities on the Atlas V and the number of shockwaves visible in the cloud layer .
( See the image at the top of this post as well as the images to the left . )
Of course , not all discontinuities make shockwaves that are visible around the entire vehicle .
For instance , the vehicle ’s airframe shields a whole hemisphere from a shockwave caused by a pipe sticking out on one side .
But this correspondence is close enough to really illustrate this physical process .

WASHINGTON  The Transportation Security Administration has promised not to store or transmit nude images of airline passengers made by whole - body scanners , but when it asked manufacturers to submit bids for such machines , it required that the scanners have exactly those capabilities , according to agency documents obtained in a lawsuit .
The bid specifications , obtained by the Electronic Privacy Information Center , also show that companies wanting to sell such machines to the government were required to equip them with “ 10 selectable levels of privacy , ” although the document , which was partly censored before its release , does not specify what those are .
Some of the machines provide blurring , or the electronic equivalent of a G - string over the genitals .
The government required that the machines have a testing mode that would allow the “ exporting of image data ” and provide “ a secure means for high - speed transfer of image data , ” according to the documents .
The images to be stored and transmitted are supposed to be of test subjects , not passengers , for training purposes .
Reports released this week show that Republican claims that the stimulus was a failure are dead wrong and the labor movement is losing no time by demanding even more government spending on jobs to break the neck of the Great Recession .
“ The fact is that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is still working , ” the AFL - CIO said in a statement late yesterday , “ generating more than 2 million jobs and laying the foundation for future economic growth . ”
The federation said the positive results indicate that the government must continue spending heavily to create millions of additional jobs .
In a report also issued yesterday , Ross Eisenberry , vice president of the Economic Policy Institute , tracked monthly job losses before and after the Recovery Act .
“ With unemployment at 9.7 percent today , it ’s hard to appreciate how much more damage the stimulus investments prevented , ” he said , adding , “ Without the more than 2 million jobs generated by the Recovery Act , the unemployment rate would now exceed 11 percent . ”
Another indication that the recovery package is working , some economists say , is that the economy grew 5.7 percent last quarter – the largest gain in six years .
These economists are saying the growth is largely due to the Recovery Act and that those who say President Obama ’s stimulus plan did n’t work are just plain wrong .
“ The fact is that the Recovery Act did work , ” declared EPI President Lawrence Mishel , “ precisely as it was designed to work and it has helped to produce roughly 2 million jobs that would n’t exist if it had n’t become law . ”
The good news about the Recovery Act came on the heels of a campaign by Democrats , labor and progressives exposing Republicans who voted against the stimulus but then tried to take credit for Recovery Act projects in their districts .
Although the Recovery Act passed with not a single Republican vote in the House and only three in the Senate many GOP lawmakers went on to request stimulus funds for projects in their districts that they later credited to themselves .
Rep. Paul Ryan , a Wisconsin Republican who described the Recovery Act as a “ wasteful spending spree that misses the mark on all counts ” later lobbied with Labor Secretary Hilda Solis for stimulus funds to create 1,000 green jobs in his district .
Sen .
John Coryn , the Texas Republican , after opposing the stimulus , went home to lobby the Environmental Protection Administration for stimulus funds for clean diesel projects in San Antonio and Houston .
His requests were co-signed by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson , the other Republican senator from that state .
Both took credit for the millions of dollars in diesel funding that the stimulus program then provided for the city of Houston .
After describing the stimulus package as “ the socialist way , ” Republican Senator Richard Shelby went home to Alabama and pushed for $ 15 million in stimulus funds for a weed elimination program in his state .
He took the credit when Alabama ended up with $ 6.3 million in stimulus funds to eradicate cogongrass .
One union leader said the Recovery Act impacted on much more than just the critical area of job creation , as essential as that is to an economic recovery .
AFT President Randi Weingarten called the stimulus a “ life preserver . ”
“ Kids do n’t get a second chance to get a good education .
The Recovery Act was the help they needed , ensuring that schools continued to receive resources so that teachers could teach and students could learn . ”

The suicide bombing that killed seven CIA employees at a U.S. base will temporarily slow U.S. intelligence - gathering in eastern Afghanistan , but the agency will not retrench its ambitious buildup in the country while it conducts a security review , officials said Thursday .
Military and intelligence officials were scrambling to determine how the bomber penetrated a forbidding network of barriers , barbed wire and watchtowers at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khowst province near the Pakistani border , and made his way deep inside to set off a thunderous blast .
Western officials were deeply concerned that the assailant had insider ’s knowledge of the base layout and security practices , according to an official familiar with the investigation .
Some reports said that the attacker was wearing a uniform of the Afghan National Army and carried an identification card , and that officials were trying to determine whether the uniform was stolen or the ID card fake .
“ Does this mean we have a guy who went postal ? ” asked one U.S. official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ Or is there any element within the ANA that is extremist ? ”

Other reports suggested that the bomber may have been brought onto the base by CIA operatives who wanted to turn the Afghan into an informer .
U.S. officials said they believed a Taliban claim of responsibility for the attack was legitimate .
Afghanistan ’s Ministry of Defense vigorously denied that the suicide bomber was an Afghan soldier .
But the allegation clearly stung , because there have been several recent instances in which members of the Afghan security forces turned guns on their Western mentors .
Intelligence operations at the base target extremist groups , including Al Qaeda , the network of Jalaluddin Haqqani , and other militants aligned with the Taliban , officials said .
Both Afghan and Pakistani Taliban fighters find refuge in the adjacent tribal areas of Pakistan .

Officials declined to provide a more detailed account of the work , but one senior U.S. official said the attack would have a short - term effect on intelligence - gathering in eastern Afghanistan .
Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said the agency would conduct an assessment to determine how security procedures at the base broke down .
But officials said that the agency would not suspend operations in Afghanistan for the review .
“ There ’s no talk -- none -- of retrenching or slowing the pace of CIA activities , ” said a U.S. intelligence official .
“ There are plenty of people ready , able , and in place to pursue the fight .
The atmosphere at Langley is one of even greater focus and determination .
The place is galvanized . ”
The CIA has been building up its presence in far - flung parts of Afghanistan , particularly in areas such as Khowst , to gather intelligence as the military prepares to add 30,000 U.S. troops , bringing the total to about 100,000 .
Officials said in the fall that the CIA was deploying spies , analysts and paramilitary operatives , and that the agency ’s station in Afghanistan would become one of the largest in agency history .
Advertisement
Officials initially reported that eight CIA employees had been killed in the attack Wednesday .
But CIA Director Leon E. Panetta , in a note to the agency workforce Thursday , said seven had died and six were wounded .
“ Those who fell yesterday were far from home and close to the enemy , doing the hard work that must be done to protect our country from terrorism , ” he said .
The attack is the deadliest for the CIA since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 1983 , in which eight operatives reportedly were killed .
Current and former U.S. officials said that two or three were contractors working for the CIA , and that the rest were career agency employees .
Advertisement
Among those killed was a woman who served as chief of the CIA base near Khowst , and was a longtime officer in the CIA ’s Counter - Terrorism Center , according to agency veterans .
Her name was not disclosed .
Former CIA officials said that some of those killed worked for the CIA ’s paramilitary branch , known as the Special Activities Division .
One official said that by casting suspicion on the Afghan National Army , perpetrators were trying to drive a wedge between U.S. intelligence personnel and Afghans .
The director of military intelligence in Afghanistan , Army Maj. Gen. Michael T. Flynn , has been pushing for greater information sharing and cooperation .
Military officials said plans to hire Afghans to guard U.S. forward operating bases would not be canceled .
Under that program , which is beginning in eastern Afghanistan , Afghans will guard towers , patrol perimeter fences and man checkpoints .
Advertisement
Military officials say hiring Afghans wo n’t just allow coalition forces to put more troops in the field , it will also improve ties , provide jobs and build trust with local tribes , helping erode support for the Taliban .
The disclosure that the base was home to a major CIA presence was disconcerting to some Afghan officials who work closely with the civilian reconstruction and development officials also based at Chapman .
“ We were surprised to hear the CIA are there , ” said Gul Jamil , a member of Khowst ’s provincial council .
“ But the most important thing now is how this base was infiltrated despite tight security . ”
Afghans living and working near the base , which lies just outside Khowst city , the provincial capital , recounted hearing an extremely loud explosion about 4:30 p.m. , as winter darkness was falling .
Advertisement
“ We thought at first that it must have been a rocket attack , ” said Mohammad Yaqub , the acting provincial police chief .
“ It ’s hard to know how someone could have gotten inside to do this .
Even when I need to visit , I am not allowed to bring a car inside the gate . ”

The Apple iPad can reintroduce the serendipity of reading we know from print .
Will you pay for that ?
The Apple iPad – that tablet computer everyone was speculating about – is out , and publishers are hoping that Apple will can offer the same magic for the print world that it did for the music industry with iTunes .
So is digital journalism suddenly saleable ?
After remaking the business of the music industry and re-inventing the mobile phone , Steve Jobs obviously is up for something new , and journalism has got his attention .
The New York Times quoted an internal source : " Steve believes in old media companies and wants them to do well .
He believes democracy is hinged on a free press and that depends on there being a professional press . "
Sounds like he has a business model in mind .
Presenting the iPad yesterday , Jobs was joined by the New York Times 's Martin Nisenholtz , the senior vice - president overseeing the paper 's digital operations , to present a crisp Times app for the iPad .
Financially the New York Times has not struck any deals with Apple yet – as Nisenholtz said , it gave them only three weeks to develop the app .
However , this seems likely to be the device that will finally put a price on digital journalism , and not only because the Times is heading towards a metered pay model for its content .
So what does it look like ?
When Nisenholtz introduced the Times application , he said : " We 're incredibly psyched to pioneer the next generation of digital journalism .
We want to create the best of print and best of digital , all rolled up into one . "
Which is what they did .
Still there is something new that might be worth paying for : a much stronger focus on design via a 9.7 inch colour display .
This allows the iPad to reintroduce the serendipity and the browsing we know from print : several articles fit on one screen and the size of an article marks its importance .
As seen with some experiments before , video can play inline .
In addition , with Wi -Fi , 3G and the multitouch interface , it can offer readers more interaction than ebook readers such as Amazon 's Kindle .
The app developed within three weeks combines the visual design of print with new interactive features
Combining a new visual approach with the iTunes payment system , which reaches 100 m credit - card accounts , Apple could help create a way for media companies to change the consumer attitudes of the up till now free digital era .
The New York Times were the only publishing company that was approached by Apple .
However , Condé Nast is preparing for the iPad since quite a while .
Sarah Chubb , president of Condé Nast Digital , said the company plans to have some of their magazines ready when the iPad ships in March .
Stephanie Clifford of the always well informed Times ' Media Decoder blog is as specific as saying that Vanity Fair , Wired and GQ are likely candidatest to be the first .
Sports Illustrated of Time Warner is also ready for take off .
In December , they had their ideas presented by the Thing .
Next Issue Media , the digital initiative of Condé Nast , Hearst , Meredith , News Corporation and Time Inc. announced last month , declined to comment , saying : " We are certainly paying close attention to all developments in this area ( including today 's iPad announcement ) and are looking forward to seeing new products come to market that will support the kind of highly featured , immersive reading experience we intend to create . "
For that , the new device has to become popular – and the acceptance of the Kindle says it can .
While the Kindle 's exact sales numbers are not released , it is widely estimated that as of the last quarter 2009 there were about 1.5 million devices sold .
If Steve Jobs would save journalism , it might be possible that publishers would get him the Holy Grail .
If journalism reinvents itself in an extra crisp version for the iPad and other tablet devices , would you have a problem paying for it ?
As long as we are warmed up , let 's speculate a little further
Liz 's work in the Middle East may give Liz a personal stake in this also .
She sure seems motivated .
She handed out tens of millions of dollars , and she would have been one of the few people that Dick trusted .
The Cheney 's personal profit from Haliburton may have led them to do things for personal gain , not just God and country .
Would n't you ?
Seymour Hersh described Cheney running a covert " executive assassination ring . "
But Hersh 's evidence seemed as elusive as the Obama " Whitey " tape .
And now we have Erik Prince claiming that hit squads were being trained without the CIA 's knowledge , which was mentioned last week on the Rachel Maddow show .
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/...
It has also been said that these assassination squads were n't limited to Iraq , and they tried to make a " hit " in Germany on a German citizen .
Was this the operation Hersh referred to , and was Cheney in charge ?
Finally , every time Dick Cheny or Liz opens their pie hole , it becomes more and more clear that George Bush was not calling the shots .
You can hear W. say " I do n't want to know anything about it , just do what needs to be done , " while Cheney snarls " That 's what I do sir , " while muttering to himself " .... you worthless prat . "
Update
An Affirming Flame cites Glenn Greenwald as placing the number of people who died in custody at over 100 .
http://www.dailykos.com/...
Why does Dick Cheney get to be the point man in defending this ?
Is he the fall guy or the mastermind ?
It would be a powerful narrative to demand " an inverstigation into Dick Cheney 's role in as many as 100 torture related deaths . "
I have observed pattern of design emerging in various Haskell libraries , for example vty - ui , GlomeTrace , and XMonad .
Here is an excerpt from vty - ui ’s interface .
The snippet is long but simple , and I need all of it to demonstrate my point .
class Widget w where render :: DisplayRegion -> w -> Image growHorizontal :: w -> Bool growVertical :: w -> Bool primaryAttribute :: w -> Attr withAttribute :: w -> Attr -> w mkImage :: Widget a => Vty -> a -> IO Image data AnyWidget = forall w. Widget w =>
AnyWidget w data
Text data Box data Fill instance Widget AnyWidget instance Widget Text instance Widget Box instance Widget Fill text :: Attr -> String ->
Text hBox :: ( Widget a , Widget b ) => a -> b ->
Box vBox :: ( Widget a , Widget b ) => a -> b ->
Box hFill :: Attr -> Char ->
Int ->
Fill vFill :: Attr -> Char ->
Fill
This module models the concept of a GUI widget .
It defines a class with a basis of operations on Widgets , and then instantiates a few data types into the class .
To facilitate passing around arbitrary widgets instead of specific instances , it provides an AnyWidget class .
This Any * class is the tell - tale sign of this antipattern .
When I was using the above interface , I found myself immediately wrapping the results of text , hbox , and the other combinators in AnyWidget .
By throwing away the information of exactly what instance of Widget it was I lost nothing , all the same operations were available to me .
Astute readers might notice that withAttribute is an exception , because it has a w to the left and to the right of an arrow , so if I pass it a Box , I know I will get a Box back .
But I can not use that knowledge for anything else , so it does n’t buy me anything .
There is a simpler and more direct way to encode the same thing .
Here is the interface I would have written to this library :
data Widget = Widget { render :: DisplayRegion ->
Image , growHorizontal :: Bool , growVertical :: Bool , primary Attribute :: Attr , withAttribute :: Attr ->
Widget } mkImage :: Vty -> Widget -> IO Image text :: Attr -> String ->
Widget hBox :: Widget -> Widget -> Widget vBox :: Widget -> Widget ->
Box hFill :: Attr -> Char ->
Int ->
Widget vFill :: Attr -> Char ->
Widget
I know just from looking at the types that all the code in the module could be converted to this style .
Every operation has the exact same assumptions as in the old version , and all the extra guarantees that the old one provided were useless because they were never used as assumptions .
Plus , you do n’t have to wrap every call to a combinator with AnyWidget .
By exposing the constructor for the Widget type , it gives users the same opportunity to make custom Widgets as the class interface gave .
You might be thinking , “ but what if somebody else made a widget type which did use the additional assumptions that the separated data types provided , for example ,
data Window instance Widget Window window :: Widget w => ( Int , Int ) -> w -> Window windowSize :: Window -> ( Int , Int ) adjustSize :: ( Int , Int ) -> Window ->
Window
“ Have n’t we just excluded this possibility from the interface ? ”
Turns out that we have not ; just replace the instance with a function :
toWidget :: Window ->
Widget
See how this is going ?
Classes become data types , instances become functions .
I ’m just manually “ expanding ” what GHC does for you .
Of course , the expansion is smaller than the original .
I advocate a direct programming style in Haskell .
Advanced type system features have their place , but plain old functions go a long , long way .
Functions are the masters of reuse : when you use an advanced feature , you need a yet more advanced feature to abstract over it ( think : classes < existential types < universally quantified constraints < unknown ) .
But all you need to abstract over a function is another function .

Is Muhammad Yunis selling free - market neoliberalism under the guise of ending poverty ?
Muhammad Yunus , the Bangladeshi economist , godfather of microcredit and founder of the now - famous Grameen Bank , enchants many different types of people with his imaginings of a better future .
A popular public speaker , Yunus is a relatively short man with a silver mane , a round beaming face , and a perpetually optimistic demeanor .
At his talks , he regularly draws standing ovations from socially conscious progressives , business - oriented free - marketeers and numerous personalities in between .
What Yunus has to offer , his supporters would say , is a method for ending poverty .
These supporters include the Norwegian committee that awarded Yunus and his Grameen Bank the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize .
This makes things all the more frustrating for Yunus ’s detractors .
Those to the left would argue that the economist is selling “ free market ” neoliberalism in the guise of liberal do - gooderism .
Right - wing libertarians , in contrast , contend that he is peddling communitarian snake oil in a business - friendly container .
BANKER TO THE POOR
Although Yunus ’ Grameen
Bank is not the world ’s first micro-lender , it is the most famous .
Born in 1940 , Yunus spent his late 20s studying in the United States , earning a PhD from Vanderbilt University .
In June 1972 , shortly after Bangladesh won its independence , he returned to his home country to take a position as a professor of economics at Chittagong University .
He dreamed he would be part of building a resilient new nation .
Then , in 1974 , famine struck .
Yunus watched emaciated people use their last strength to travel to the cities in search of help , then slump in the streets , resigned to dying .
Yunus vowed to “ abandon classical book learning , ” as he writes in his memoir , Banker to the Poor , and instead apply his knowledge to addressing rural poverty .
Immersing himself in village life he met a woman who spent her days working in her mud-floored hut making intricate bamboo baskets .
They were beautiful , but because the woman had no savings , she had to turn to a moneylender in order to buy raw materials .
By the time she paid him off , she had only pennies to show for her efforts .
Yunus surveyed the village and found that 42 people were similarly trapped in a cycle of quasi - bonded labor even though they had collectively borrowed only $ 27 .
Seeing the amount of misery created by such paltry sums , he offered a loan out of pocket , with the idea that the poor could pay back in small installments .
The villagers were thrilled .
Inspired , Yunus tried to convince ma i n s t r e a m banks to step in on a larger scale to provide a humane alternative to the loan sharks , who exact interest rates of 200 to 300 percent .
When the banks refused , he devoted himself to creating institutions that could provide small loans to the very poor that would allow them to receive the just profits of their labors .
The Grameen Bank was born .
Over the next two decades it became a celebrated success .
By 2007 it had distributed $ 6 billion in loans in Bangladesh , expanding to serve some seven million people in 78,000 villages .
The basic idea that inspired the Grameen Bank now drives a worldwide microcredit movement .
At a 2006 summit , the movement claimed to have reached its goal of providing financial services to 100 million families to help them “ lift themselves … out of poverty . ”
Yunus posits that the poor have an entrepreneurial drive and well - honed survival skills that they can convert into household businesses if given the opportunity .
Lending a poor woman $ 50 or $ 100 to buy chickens for a small farm , to purchase yarn for a home weaving operation or to set up a taco stand outside a nearby factory can allow her to bring in enough income to make the difference between starvation and subsistence and , over time , between destitution and a dignified life .
The Grameen Bank is widely credited with two innovations : lending primarily to women and relying on support groups to ensure a high rate of loan repayment .
Yunus decided to break a significant cultural taboo and give money to poor women .
“ When men make money , they tend to spend it on themselves , ” he writes , “ but when women make money , they bring benefits to the whole family , particularly the children . ”
To facilitate repayment and heighten a sense of accountability , Grameen gives loans to women in groups of five , so that the groups can meet regularly and provide mutual support .
“ If an individual is unable or unwilling to pay back her loan , her group may become ineligible for larger loans in subsequent years until the repayment problem is brought under control , ” Yunus explains .
“ This creates a powerful incentive for borrowers to help each other solve problems and — even more important — to prevent problems . ”
Today , Grameen claims a remarkable repayment rate of 98.6 percent .
BOOTSTRAPS AND COLLECTIVISM
Yunus ’ social vision is a curious amalgam of left and right .
On the one hand , Yunus sounds like a Reaganite , in celebrating bottom - up entrepreneurialism and railing against “ handouts ” and denounces the dependency created by welfare systems in Europe and the United States .
Tellingly , a recent book on the movement , entitled A Billion Bootstraps , trumpets microcredit as “ The Business Solution for Ending Poverty . ”
On the other hand , Yunus is harshly critical of the global economy ’s insensitivity to the plight of the poorest and its erroneous assumption that “ all people are motivated purely by the desire to maximize profit . ”
Some right - wing think tanks , such as the Ludwig von Mises Institute , accuse Yunus of promoting a “ far - leftist social agenda . ”
One of their main objections is that , once borrowers enter into the Grameen system , they are encouraged to participate in social programs promoting literacy and good health .
All borrowers are made to learn the organization ’s “ Sixteen Decisions , ” among which are “ We shall always be ready to help each other , ” “ We shall grow vegetables all the year round ” and “ We shall take part in all social activities collectively . ”
According to the Mises Institute , these vows “ read like a party platform for collectivist regimentation . ”
THE LIMITS OF MICROCREDIT
A closer examination of microcredit shows that it may not , in the end , be an ideal solution .
First , the concept of microloans as a vehicle for women ’s empowerment appears to have been oversold .
Reporting on her field study of Bangladeshi borrowers , Lamia Karim of the University of Oregon wrote in 2008 that , although women were the formal recipients of microcredit , “ I found that men used 95 percent of the loans …
In my research area , rural men laughed when they were asked whether the money belonged to their wives .
They pointedly remarked that ‘ since their wives belong to them , the money rightfully belongs to them . ’ ”
Nor is the money always used for the purposes for which it is loaned .
An article in the Harvard Business Review stated in 2007 , “ Many heads of microfinance programs now privately acknowledge [ that ] 90 percent of micro-loans are used to finance current consumption rather than to fuel enterprise . ”
In 1989 , 60 Minutes profiled a borrower who had once been a beggar .
With the help of a series of micro-loans from the Grameen Bank , taken and paid back in good faith , she was able to afford a large plot of land , a herd of seven cows , a new house with proper sanitation , education for her kids , and a small taxi for her husband to use in his own income - generating enterprise .
By 1996 , however , her situation had reversed .
Her husband “ had contracted a stomach illness that was never properly diagnosed .
To pay for his medical treatment , the couple had sold off their taxi , their land , and their cattle .
She was so frail and tired , she did not trust herself to take a new loan .
All they had left were four chickens . ”
Critics point to such instances as examples of how microcredit for the poor makes little sense absent health care , job training , and other services .
In fact , Yunus , often candid , self - critical and pragmatic , was the one who followed up on the 60 Minutes profile and included the woman ’s full story in Banker to the Poor .
He admits , “ microcredit cannot solve society ’s every problem . ”
Then again , no social program can .
For its part , the Grameen Bank has gone far beyond just issuing loans .
It has endeavored to couple its microcredit with health insurance , pension accounts and emergency funds to provide relief in the event of natural disasters .
So what is the overall impact of microcredit ?
Economists who assess the available data tend to agree that it creates some genuine avenues for advancement by motivated individuals .
It fosters a measure of social mobility , which in itself is a good .
However , microcredit has not demonstrated an ability to reduce poverty levels on the whole .
Small loans are no substitute for the need to think big .
Those countries that have significantly bettered their lot in the past century , from South Korea to Chile , have usually relied on aggressive macro-economic policymaking : state - directed development banking , subsidies for strategic industries , and public initiatives consciously designed to create decent jobs .
As economist Robert Pollin notes , these policies “ have all been closely associated with what used to be termed the ‘ developmental state ’ economic model ” and have all been substantially dismantled through three decades of market fundamentalism .
Developmentalist strategies encountered problems of their own , but neither microcredit nor neoliberalism can claim anything close to their successes in terms of creating growing economies and healthy middle classes .
In the end , macro - decisions can make a huge impact on micro-businesses .
When millions of Mexican farmers are driven from their land in the wake of the North American Free Trade Agreement , loans for extra chickens appear futile .
When a state enterprise is privatized , its union busted , and half of its employees fired , the micro- borrowers ’ lunchtime taco stands no longer seem like such great investments .
MASS PROFIT
Today the real problem with micro-lending is that it has spawned a growing faction of practitioners who contend it must be profitable enough to attract private investment .
Seeking to tap mainstream capital markets for their work , the bankers in this school prefer to use the term “ microfinance ” to describe their efforts .
Some predict that the number of microfinance lenders will soon dwarf the number of institutions operating on some version of the Grameen model .
The Economist noted in 2005 that , “ some of the world ’s biggest and wealthiest banks , including Citigroup , Deutsche Bank , Commerzbank , HSBC , ING and ABN Amro , are dipping their toes into the water . ”
While microcredit is relatively new , usury is very old .
A legion of subprime mortgage brokers , credit card companies , payday lenders and pawnshops have made amply clear that there is nothing inherently beneficent about lending to those of limited means .
The Grameen Bank ’s core loans , according to Yunus , are made at a relatively modest interest rate of 20 percent .
Those who have looked critically at the issue argue that , after adding taxes , fees , and mandatory savings deductions and then measuring annual interest rates using the norms of U.S. banking , even Grameen and other socially driven microcredit bodies regularly deal in loans that charge between 30 and 50 percent interest .
With for - profit microfinance institutions , the rates can be much higher .
In recent years , reporters for Business Week and The New Yorker have pointed to microlenders in Mexico who charge interest rates between 110 and 120 percent .
When a borrower accumulates rapidly expanding debt , the threat of reprisal and repossession looms .
It turns out that the Grameen Bank ’s claim of having a 98.6 percent repayment rate is a bit of an overstatement .
Yunus freely admits that when borrowers fall on hard times , Grameen is often willing to provide new funds to get them back on their feet and to reschedule old debt obligations .
This makes Yunus ’ institution a less successful business but a far more compassionate social institution .
However , the micro-loaning world is rife with stories of banking officers using coercive means to keep loans on schedule .
Even within Grameen , women in a borrowing group who feel compelled to police one other can resort to extreme action .
Lamia Karim notes that in her research it was routine to see what Yunus calls “ positive social pressure ” turn ugly :
“ Women would march off together to scold the defaulting woman , shame her or her husband in a public place , and when she could not pay the full amount of the installment , go through her possessions and take away whatever they could sell off to recover the defaulted sum . …
This ranged from taking away her gold nose - ring ( a symbol of marital status for rural women … ) to cows and chicks to trees that had been planted to be sold as timber to collecting rice and grains that the family had accumulated as food , very often leaving the family with no food whatsoever . ”
‘ SOCIAL BUSINESS ’
Over the years , as the Grameen Bank expanded , Yunus launched several dozen sister organizations , each designed to provide additional services to the poor .
These included an effort to promote traditional handwoven Bangladeshi fabrics ; an initiative to develop abandoned fish farms ; and , most notably , a plan to provide villages with cell phone service .
Grameen Phone , founded in 1996 , ultimately grew to become the biggest company in Bangladesh .
Out of his experiences with these initiatives , Yunus formed his concept of “ social business . ”
In contrast to existing businesses , Yunus argues , “ [ e ] ntrepreneurs will set up social businesses not to achieve limited personal gain but to pursue specific social goals ” — such as creating sources of renewable energy for remote rural areas or recycling waste products .
The economy , Yunus writes , will be transformed by a “ new breed of businesspeople , empowered for the first time to express humanistic values through the companies they found . ”
Yunus explains that , “ when you are running a business , you think differently and work differently than when you are running a charity . ”
Social businesses make use of private sector know - how and values — except , of course , the paramount value : gleaning a profit for investors .
As a model of what a fully formed social business would look like , Yunus holds up a joint venture that he launched when the CE O of Groupe Danone ( maker of Dannon yogurt ) expressed a desire to collaborate .
They created a self - sustaining enterprise that would provide low - cost , nutritionally fortified yogurt for malnourished children in Bangladesh .
Their dream came to fruition .
In 2007 , the first Grameen Danone factory was scheduled to produce 6,600 pounds of yogurt a day — made in a new eco-friendly facility , using milk from local farmers and designed to sell for seven cents per container .
Yunus is insistent that he wants more “ business ” -— but he wants business that would produce no profit for investors , respect high environmental standards , pay living wages and produce quality goods at the lowest possible price to benefit the poor .
To many , all this will sound decidedly socialistic .
To Yunus , social business is the idea that will save capitalism , satisfying a deep human craving for “ meaning ” that is “ totally ignored in the existing business world . ”
Needless to say , there are significant barriers to making social business a reality .
Yunus notes that the initial funding for the joint Grameen Danone yogurt project totaled $ 1.1 million .
Meanwhile , in 2005 , Groupe Danone had approximately $ 16 billion in sales .
What would happen were the social business to ever grow large enough to truly affect the multinational corporation ’s balance sheets ?
Here , Karl Marx , who described the dynamics by which exploitative businesses are consistently able to pull ahead in acquiring new technology , and thus are empowered over time to drive their kindhearted competitors into the ground , would seem to have the less rose - tinted perspective on how the business world functions .
And yet , Yunus may deserve more than an eye - rolling dismissal .
Here is a person who speaks of building a world not based on greed and profit , a world where markets still function but do not control vital aspects of life , and where a different type of socially motivated , cooperatively minded enterprise flourishes .
Is this not something of which the more calloused and incredulous revolutionary should take note ?

Together , the arrests represent a significant blow to the Taliban ’s leadership in the American - backed war that began in 2001 .
They also demonstrate the extent to which the Taliban ’s senior leaders have been able to use Pakistan as a sanctuary to plan and mount attacks in Afghanistan .

A senior United States official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said that the arrest of the shadow governors was unrelated to Mullah Baradar ’s capture .
Even so , Muhammad Omar , the governor of Kunduz Province , said in an interview that the two Taliban shadow governors maintained a close working relationship with Mullah Baradar .
“ Mullah Salam and Mullah Mohammed were the most merciless individuals , ” said Gen. Razaq Yaqoobi , police chief of Kunduz Province .
“ Most of the terror , executions and other crimes committed in northern Afghanistan were on their orders . ”
The immediate impact of the arrests of the two Taliban governors was unclear .
In the short term , they could be expected to hurt the Taliban ’s operations somewhat and possibly demoralize their fighters , but probably not for long .
In the past , the Taliban have proved capable of quickly replacing their killed or captured leaders .
An orchid researcher based on the island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean and collaborating with researchers at the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew ( RBG Kew ) has used motion sensitive night cameras to capture the first known occurrence of a cricket functioning as a pollinator of flowering plants .
Not only is this the first time this behaviour has been documented in a member of the Orthoptera order of insects -- who are better known for eating plants -- but the ' raspy cricket ' is also entirely new to science .
The discovery is revealed in a paper published in Annals of Botany .
In 2008 Claire Micheneau , a RBG Kew - associated PhD student studying how the epiphytic orchid genus Angraecum has adapted to different pollinators on Reunion Island , and Jacques Fournel , her collaborator , shot the remarkable footage .
It shows a raspy cricket ( Glomeremus sp ) carrying pollen on its head as it retreats from the greenish - white flowers of Angraecum cadetii .
The genus Angraecum is best known for Darwin 's study of the comet orchid , Angraecum sesquipedale of Madagascar , and his hypothesis that it was pollinated by a bizarre , long - tongued moth pollinator -- a theory that was later proved to be true many years after his death .
Says Claire Micheneau , " We knew from monitoring pollen content in the flowers that pollination was taking place .
However , we did not observe it during the day .
That 's why we rigged up a night camera and caught this raspy cricket in action .
Watching the footage for the first time , and realising that we had filmed a truly surprising shift in the pollination of Angraecum , a genus that is mainly specialised for moth pollination , was thrilling .
" The moths that are the main Angraecum pollinators on Madagascar are not found on Reunion and until we started our research the pollination of this genus on Reunion had always been an open question . "
Micheneau 's research also revealed that two other species of Reunion Island Angraecum orchids ( A. bracteosum and A. striatum ) are pollinated by two species of small white eye songbirds ( Zosterops borbonicus and Zosterops olivaceus ) .
She continues , " My studies have shown that the raspy cricket is also a surprisingly efficient pollinator with higher rates of pollination and fruit set in Angraecum cadetii than those recorded in its bird - pollinated sister - species . " ( 1 )
There is a close match in size between the raspy cricket 's head and Angraecum cadetii's nectar - spur opening ( 2 ) .
These wingless raspy crickets reach the flowers by climbing up the leaves of the orchid or jumping across from neighbouring plants .
They use long very long antenna to explore their surroundings .
Just why the raspy cricket developed a taste for orchid nectar is still a key question for Micheneau .
" Although crickets are typically omnivorous and eat both plant material and other insects , we think the raspy cricket has evolved to eat nectar to compensate for the general scarcity of other insects on Reunion . "
Apple has banned sexy apps .

If you need another example of why the iTunes App Store 's walled garden is flawed , Apple has been only too happy to oblige , capriciously and arbitrarily removing an unknown number of " sexy " apps without warning .
All that 's missing to complete the metaphor is a flaming sword .
Some of those apps were certainly garbage , but it seems most were simply slideshows of women in various states of undress .

Jenna Wortham , writing for The Times , quotes Apple 's Phil Schiller : " It came to the point where we were getting customer complaints from women who found the content getting too degrading and objectionable , as well as parents who were upset with what their kids were able to see . "
By Apple 's own count , there are over 130,000 apps in the App Store .
With a selection that varied , I 'm sure there 's something to offend everyone .

How about an app that discusses abortion and birth control law ?
Maybe an app that helps you hook up with gay guys ?
How about an app that teaches you how to evangelize the fundamentalist Christian religion ?
Think about that last one for second and the furor that would erupt if Apple made a sweeping ban of religious apps from the App Store .
I am not a Christian .
I would be concerned if my child were discovering religion before I 'd gotten a chance to talk to them about it .
( Especially since that would mean I had given birth to a baby without a mother , completing — if adventitiously — my dream to be the Male Madonna . )

Yet I would n't blame Apple for letting the app be sold , just like I would n't complain that I found it morally offensive , its existence alone threatening and insulting .
And to be clear , I 've got absolutely no problem with the " Grindr " app pictured here being on the app store .
Smoke 'em if you 've got 'em .
It 's simply a great example to highlight how subjective Apple 's ban has been .
That image is right there on its App Store page .

The issue at hand is that Apple does n't have to abide by the laws we 've put in place in our society because the App Store is part of its business .
Often I feel like that 's a good thing — or at least fair dinkum .
They built it ; they get to run it .
With a closed ecosystem comes a lot of responsibility .
Apple has taken on the heavy mantle of arbiter , ostensibly to manage quality .
I can forgive them for that , even if I do n't like it .
But the only reason to ban blue apps is taste .
And if these apps were a matter of taste , why were they approved in the first place ?
What will the next set of apps be that Apple decides are inappropriate long after people have spent hundreds of hours creating and marketing them ?
Ban apps because they 're poorly designed — not because they 're simply sexual .

Apple is making a moral judgement , declaring that nudity and titillation is something that should made hidden and shameful .
It 's disappointing that a company so publicly supportive of progressive sexual rights would react so orthodoxly .
Actually , it 's worse than that .
Apple is trying to take the easy way out , talking about degradation of women and the innocence of children , but allowing content from established brands — brands that exhibit sexual material meant to arouse — simply because they 're well known and thus " safe " .
Apple is aping the sexual posturing of conservative American society , defining what expressions of sexuality are acceptable to even acknowledge .

Sure , there 's still plenty of smut out there on the internet , readily accessible through the iPhone 's Safari web browser .
That 's not the point .
Apple has made a declaration : that sex and sexuality are shameful , even for adults .
But only sometimes .
And only when people complain .

Unfortunately , they 've accomplished the opposite .

We noted with interest reports that subsidiaries of foreign corporations from across the globe have launched a lobbying campaign in Washington to protect their newfound power to influence American elections under the Citizens United case .
About 160 of these U.S. subsidiaries of foreign - owned or controlled corporations are involved in a lobbying group trying to stop President Obama and Congress from enacting limits on their spending in political campaigns .
Worse still , the lobbyist leading the effort refused to disclose all the companies involved in the lobbying campaign .
But it appears that the group of companies has the potential to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to influence American elections .
All of this demonstrates why the President was right to criticize the Supreme Court ’s recent decision in Citizens United – and why he is also right to call for reform of the lobbying laws , including tough new rules on lobbyist disclosure , that build on the dramatic steps he has already taken in his first year in office to change Washington .
In Citizens United , a narrow 5 - 4 majority of the Supreme Court overturned a century of law that had barred corporations from using their financial clout to directly interfere with elections .
As a result of this decision , American corporations owned in whole or in part by foreign companies — and even by foreign governments — are no longer restricted from making expenditures to elect or defeat federal candidates .
Some have argued that Citizens United will not increase foreign influence , but they are mistaken .
The four Justice dissent , authored by Justice Stevens , specifically pinpoints the fact that the majority opinion opens the door to foreign influence -- see page 33 and page 75 .
The majority openly acknowledged that foreign influence could pose a potential issue here , as did the lawyer for Citizens United .
And , a stream of independent , non-partisan experts have echoed the President ’s concerns :
Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21 stated that “ there is no statutory prohibition against foreign - controlled domestic corporations from making expenditures to influence federal elections , following the Citizens United decision . ”
Common Cause and Public Campaign issued a joint statement that the Court ’s opinion “ will allow corporations , including those owned by a majority of foreign entities , to spend without limit to influence US elections . ”
Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute stated that : “ Citizens United opens up opportunities for American subsidiaries of foreign companies , including those owned by foreign governments , to spend huge amounts to influence American elections . ”
Gerald Hebert of the Campaign Legal Center stated that “ With the corporate campaign expenditure ban now being declared unconstitutional , domestic corporations controlled by foreign governments or other foreign entities are free to spend money to elect or defeat federal candidates . ”
Others assert that subsidiaries of foreign companies already spend millions on independent expenditures and so the Citizens United decision will make no difference .
That misses the point .
The electioneering communications law that was struck down restricted corporate ads naming elected officials in the crucial 60 days before general elections and 30 days before primary elections .
Now those corporations can spend freely on those ads during the most critical periods in elections and the express message can be to vote for or against a named candidate .
That constitutes an enormous expansion of corporate power to influence elections .
Others claim existing law is sufficient to protect against foreign influence in our elections .
That too is wrong .
Although the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) restricts foreign nationals from spending or directing spending in American elections , it does not prohibit corporations in which foreign nationals are shareholders or hold significant sway or de facto control from making such expenditures .
For example , foreign - controlled corporations making independent expenditures cannot be relied upon to make decisions contrary to the political interests or preferences of their owners .
Before Citizens United , these problems did not exist at the federal level since the corporations themselves were limited in what they could do regardless of whose money or influence was behind them .
But now that restriction is no more .
Accordingly , because of these realities of how foreign control can operate , a stronger rule is needed to protect our domestic politics from foreign influence .
In the State of the Union , the President called for a series of steps to fix the problems caused by this case and also by the problem of special interests and their lobbyists having too much influence in Washington .
In addition to closing the loopholes opened by Citizens United , including the one that could allow foreign interests to influence our elections , the President also called on Congress to :
Establish carefully - tailored , low - dollar limits on the contributions lobbyists may bundle or make to candidates for federal office ;
Toughen lobbyist disclosure rules so that – like the voluntary step the President has taken to disclose visitors to the White House – lobbyists must disclose the details of every lobbying contact , including what the meeting was about ;
Close the loophole that allows foreign agent lobbyists to avoid full disclosure of their activities ;
Fully disclose all earmark requests on a comprehensive , bipartisan , state - of - the - art disclosure database that allows Americans to examine the details of every proposed request .
The proposals are detailed in this White House fact sheet .
For at least a century , it was considered perfectly legal to treat corporations differently than people in the context of political activity .
The Supreme Court ’s decision changes that century - old legal principle .
As Justice Stevens wrote in dissent , “ Congress has placed special limitations on campaign spending by corporations ever since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907 ...
The Court today rejects a century of history when it treats the distinction between corporate and individual campaign spending as an invidious novelty born of [ more recent Court decisions ] . ”
The American people have a compelling interest in preventing foreign interests from influencing our domestic political process .
A strong legislative response is required given the stakes : Americans ’ control over their own electoral process .
That is why the President is working with Congressional leadership to move rapidly to pass legislation that protects our politics from undue special interest influence .

SUPERMARKETS have begun filling shelves with chocolate eggs more than three months before Easter .
Tesco and Somerfield in the UK are accused of pressuring hard - up parents into spending more cash just days after splashing out for Christmas .
Customers furious at seeing egg promotions so far ahead of Easter Sunday on April 4 have launched a series of online attacks .
One raged : " We celebrated Jesus being born on December 25 and just days later we 're being sold chocolate to celebrate Easter . "
Another fumed : " If people have Easter eggs pushed into their face then they will believe they need them and will buy , buy , buy .
" I 'm sure no one is naive enough to believe that the supermarkets ' simply sell people what they want ' . "
A Tesco spokesman said : " A small selection of Easter eggs are on sale in response to customer demand . "
Religious leaders also attacked the move .
Bishop Jonathan Blake , who presided over Big Brother star Jade Goody 's wedding just weeks before she died , said : " It always seems strange when the public finds Easter being merchandised so soon after Christmas has passed .
" Perhaps it 's felt that given we 're in a recession , putting the eggs on offer earlier gives parents a chance to plan ahead and maybe buy an egg early and put it aside .
" But I still think people will find it strange . "
Scamming free parking at a meter or scoring a prime blue - zone space by displaying a fake , stolen or borrowed disabled parking tag could soon cost a lot more .
A state law that took effect Friday allows cities to charge anywhere from $ 250 to $ 1,000 for violating disabled parking laws .
And San Francisco , where finding a parking space can induce extreme behavior , is wasting no time .
On Tuesday , the Metropolitan Transportation Agency will consider raising its fines for fraudulent use of disabled plates , placards and tags to $ 825 , from $ 100 .
Fines for lesser offenses , such as parking in a disabled space without a disabled parking pass or blocking access to a blue zone , would rise by 10 percent to $ 330 .
The board will also consider allowing parking control officers to issue disabled citations , which , in the past , could only be written by police officers .
That change was also enabled by the new state law .
Abuse of disabled parking permits in San Francisco is a serious problem that steals money from the agency 's already lean budget and makes it difficult for those needing disabled parking to find available spaces .
The state Department of Motor Vehicles has issued 52,600 disabled plates and placards in San Francisco - 1 for about every 15 residents .
" Disabled placard abuse is one of the most significant challenges to parking management in San Francisco , " said Judson True , agency spokesman .
" It 's a fraudulent way of people being able to park free for an unlimited time .
It hurts all motorists , disabled or not . "
True had no estimate on how many fraudulent placards are on the streets , or how much revenue the increased citations would generate .
In the fiscal year that ended in June , police seized 2,099 fraudulent placards , and in the first quarter of the current budget year , which ended in September , 689 fake disabled tags were confiscated .
" If that pace continues , " True said , " we will see more than a 30 percent increase . "
Assemblywoman Fiona Ma , D - San Francisco , wrote the bill that allows the hefty fines out of concern that the city 's streets are filled with drivers abusing disabled parking tags .
" Go down any street that has parking meters , and more than half will have a disabled placard that means they do n't have to pay , " she said .
" A lot of people are misusing it to get free parking . "
While the bill was designed to benefit San Francisco , Ma said , she found that abuse of parking permits is a problem in other California cities , including Oakland and Los Angeles .
" Anywhere there are parking meters , " she said , " it 's a problem . "

Which means that plenty of Academy Members wo n't be seeing Moon and wo n't be able to vote on it .
Remember Moon had a very small " select cities " release .
And if you have n't seen it by now , tough shit .
This is why screeners need to be sent out to the proper people .
But , alas it does n't seem to be in the cards for Moon .
Times are hard , we understand , but it 's times like these when people should rally around something that is genuinely great .
So what can you do ?

Dieters in Hong Kong were Tuesday warned by government doctors against a craze for swallowing parasite worms as a means of losing weight .
The city 's Department of Health has been alarmed to see websites offering products containing potentially fatal parasites as a means of weight control .
The products are thought to use Ascaris worms : giant intestinal roundworms which grow up to 40 centimetres in length in a host 's intestine and lay up to 200,000 eggs a day .
A Department of Health spokesman warned that swallowing the parasites could cause abdominal pain and distention , vomiting , diarrhoea and malnutrition .
“ Parasite infestation may also be fatal if serious complications such as intestinal , biliary tract or pancreatic duct obstruction arise , ” the spokesman said .
“ The worms may even invade such organs as the lungs .
“ The infestation can be treated with medication that kills the parasite .
The worms may require surgical removal if there are obstructions . ”
He urged people to consult doctors before dieting and said the only natural , healthy and effective means of weight loss was through dietary regulation and regular exercise .
Dieting is big business in Hong Kong where obesity levels have soared because of sedentary lifestyles , fast - food diets and long office hours in the city of 7 million .
Clinics and websites offer a bizarre variety of questionable short - cut weight loss methods including hot wraps , fat - dissolving injections and even using controlled fire to literally burn off fat .
Four decades later , the Murchison meteorite is still full of surprises .
When this extraterrestrial hunk fell to Earth near its namesake town in Australia in 1969 , people managed to salvage more than 200 pounds of it .
And now a new analysis of the meteorite , published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , shows that it could hold millions of carbon - containing compounds .
Researchers say the findings provide insight into the complex chemistry present when the chunk of space - rock formed , back when our solar system was young .
Back in 1969 , researchers found amino acids and many other molecules in the carbon - rich rock .
Many researchers have analyzed the chondritic meteorite for amino acids and other possible precursors to life , because some theories hold that life on Earth began with the delivery of prebiotic organic compounds from space via asteroids or comets
[ Scientific American ]
.
But scanning techniques have advanced since then , so the new team used tools like ultra - high - resolution mass spectrometry to take a fresh look at the meteorite .
In the tiny sample they crushed to study , the team turned up at least 14,000 unique organic ( carbon - containing ) compounds .
They say that is actually conservative guess ; the somewhat limited scope of their tool could have missed some , and the true number could be as high as 50,000 .
And because each collection of atoms can be arranged in numerous ways , the authors estimate that there may be millions of distinct organic compounds in the meteorite [ Scientific American ]
.
Not only is Murchison rich in organic compounds , it 's old .
Scientists believe the Murchison meteorite could have originated before the Sun was formed , 4.65 billion years ago .
The researchers say it probably passed through primordial clouds in the early Solar System , picking up organic chemicals [ BBC News ]
.
As a result , the researchers say the meteorite could have something to say about the origin of life and our solar system as it continues to let go of its secrets .
It was only two years ago , after all , that scientists confirmed that the presence of subunits of DNA and RNA on Murchison were genuine , and not the result of soil contamination .

As Indiana Democratic leaders scramble to replace Evan Bayh in the US Senate race , one name is emerging from left field : rock musician John Mellencamp .
When questioned Wednesday , Mellencamp publicist Bob Merlis responded to the Monitor via e-mail this way : “ As of now , there is no response . ”
The lack of an answer — which was the same given to the Indianapolis Star Wednesday — is helping the Internet rumor mill churn even faster .
Grassroots efforts are urging Mr. Mellencamp to take the leap .
On MSNBC Tuesday , Katrina Van Heuvel , editor of The Nation , suggested that Mellencamp could be a “ populist candidate ” as someone “ who worked very hard for farmers who faced foreclosures ” and “ a Heartland son of Indiana . ”
Chicago film critic Roger Ebert suggested a Mellencamp candidacy via Twitter Monday .
A Facebook page dedicated to drafting Mellencamp as a candidate had 940 members by mid-Wednesday .
An online petition via CitizenSpeak calls the singer “ someone who can win this November ” and “ a staunch advocate for Hoosiers of all backgrounds . ”
Mellencamp is revered in his home state , where he continues to live , record music , and raise a family .
Best known for hits like “ Pink Houses , ” “ Jack and Diane , ” and “ R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A. , ” he is also a staunch Democrat who campaigned for Barack Obama .
Along with Neil Young and Willie Nelson , he is also one of the cofounders of Farm Aid , the annual music festival and organization that is in its 25th year of raising money for family - run farms .
Mellencamp 's music is known for its populist themes , which have roots in his upbringing in rural Indiana , where his grandparents were farmers .
In 2003 , he posted a letter to CommonDreams.org , which called the invasion of Iraq “ a political hijacking . ”
The letter – also credited to his wife , Elaine – defended his position with the following : “ Before a single bomb was ever dropped , some of us , formerly called the ' anti- American and unpatriotic , ' have questioned or opposed this war .
Now , each day , as the dust settles and the truth slowly surfaces , more and more people come to the inevitable conclusion of what a debacle this whole war was . ”
Despite a long career as a hitmaker , Mellencamp has kept a low profile in recent years .
He has not toured and is releasing albums that are more folk in tone and politically charged .
His stature in the state is formidable , but not enough for some experts to say that he has a chance if picked to run in the November midterm election .
“ I ’d be amazed , ” says Brian S. Vargus , who teaches political science at Indiana University .
“ That would almost be as shocking as Evan ’s timing ” not to run for his Senate seat again .
“ Indiana politics is a strange animal , ” Mr. Vargus admits , adding this about a possible Mellencamp run : “ If it could happen , anything could . ”

As the earth continues to shake along the Northern California coast , damage dollar numbers continue to stack up .
Another small aftershock hit Monday night , re-ruffling already ruffled nerves in Humboldt County .
This weekend 's earthquake is the strongest to hit California in six years .
The magnitude 6.5 shaker hit 26 miles off the Eureka coast Saturday at 4:27 p.m .
Damage was widespread across the region , but considered relatively minor for the size of the earthquake .
That " minor " damage is quickly adding up to the millions .
Officials in Eureka say the quake caused $ 22 million in damage in that city alone .
They say 175 buildings were damaged by the shaker .
One family who lived in a 100 year old home that dropped into its crawl space is now forced to find a new place to live .
Theresa Brady told the Associated Press her home is " a disaster . "
" When you go into my house , you feel you 're on acid or something because everything is crooked , " said Brady .
So far no Humboldt County - wide estimate is available .
A security camera caught the entire quake in Arcata .
The weekend quake followed a series of small quakes here in the Bay Area and had lots of people talking about " The Big One . "
Saturday 's quake was located within the interior of the so - called Gorda Plate .
Geologists say because it was shallow , only four miles deep , it was fairly gentle rolling quake .
Experts say there are no comparable stresses known off the Bay Area 's coast .
For us , the dangerous faults run under highly populated landmass .
And the really good news is that the movement off shore in Humboldt County does not increase risks of slips in the Hayward and San Andreas .

Two men were charged Sunday morning with setting fire to a church in east Texas and federal authorities said the men may face charges in nine other church fires .
The men , Jason Robert Bourque , 19 , of Lindale , Tex. , and Daniel George McAllister , 21 , of Ben Wheeler , Tex. , were arrested and charged with arson of a building in the Feb. 8 fire at Dover Baptist Church , located 15 miles northwest of Tyler , Tex .
Because the building was a church , the charges were elevated to a first - degree felony , said Thomas Crowley , a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
That felony carries a sentence ranging from probation to 99 years to life in prison , Mr. Crowley said .

“ We ’ve been looking at these guys for a while , ” said Mr. Crowley .
“ But we had to paste together information . ”
He said various techniques led members of a special task force to the men , including DNA evidence and phone tips .
A motive for the fires was still being investigated , federal authorities said .
Tattoos are becoming increasingly common today , with more and more people vying with each for creating the perfect design .
If you are a true tattoo lover , here is a tattoo that is both geeky as well as fashionable – the Jesus Spock Tattoo .
The religious reference could be quite sacrilegious to some but creators of this tattoo believe that as Dr. Spock died for our sins in the initial Star Trek movie and was resurrected in the third , namely Star Trek III , the name as well as the representation of Dr. Spock as Jesus is apt .
In continuation with the resurrection theory , this fashionable tattoo by Geek Parenting also has a Spanish message tattooed below the bust of Dr. Spock as Jesus , which can be translated as “ Live Long and Prosper ” .
So , what are you waiting for ?
If you are a true Star Trek lover and find tattoos irresistible , blend both with this tattoo that ’s sure to stand apart from the run -of - the - mills stuff .
For some other innovative design ideas , take a look at this huge Mona Lisa Tattoo or enjoy the cool Transformers tattoos .
Thanks Rob for the image !
You do n’t see many puzzle titles on the Gamecube platform , however there are quite a few that are emerging lately .
A puzzle title has been recently released from Ubi Soft called Worms Blast .
Worms
Blast consist of everything a puzzle game is expected of any puzzle genre fan .
Here are some key features in Worms Blast :
Wacky Weaponry : Unleash a firing frenzy using Shotguns , Bazookas , Mines , Laser Beams , and Sea Monsters

Unlockable Modes : Play through puzzle mode and unlock even more game modes .
Gameplay
Worms
Blast takes place above water .
Colored blacks gradually move closer to your character from above , threatening it crush everything in its path .
Players must pilot their boat and shoot the blocks to destroy them in order to survive .
However , the weapon is color - coded and players must hit blocks of the same color of their weapon to destroy them .
Players must destroy all blocks in a time limit in order to progress .
The description of Worms Blast may sound like an easy game to play but it ’s actually much more difficult .
The levels gradually become more harder with a mix of harder block pieces , more distractions , and enemies .
Worms
Blast goes deep into the puzzle gameplay very quickly .
I have never been a fan of the puzzle genre but Worms Blast has made puzzle titles more interesting and fun to play .
Worms
Blast offers tutorials before your match starts .
The tutorial teaches players the basics of playing Worms Blast and a variety of other key things you need to learn before starting .
A lot of puzzle games are usually addicting and Worms Blast can certainly be addicting .
It ’s very fun to play this game at long periods at a time and there is plenty of action in the title that keeps you stuck to the television screen .
Worms
Blast has eight available modes that are very similar to one another but have different rules and objectives .
The modes are Survival , Star Collection , Tide Trail , Death Match , and Do n’t Drop Them .
Most of these modes are self explanatory .
These modes are great for anyone tired of playing the main game and is looking for something different .
Probably one of the best features is multi-player .
This is almost the perfect title for several players to play against each other .
So it might not be anything like Super Smash Brothers Melee but this title offers some incredible multi-player fun .
The game supports up to two players at a time .
However the reason for this is because if four players were supported , there would n’t be any space on the screen to see the entire set of blocks .
You really just cant blame the lack of four - player support .
Four - player support is n’t really needed in Worms Blast .
You just have to play it to believe it .
The problem is that the appearance of Worms Blast is kiddy if is often ignored because of that .
It ’s a terrible thing to see some very well made games to go down under because of a kiddy image .
Recently , there have been kiddy like games for the Gamecube , and I really do n’t have a problem with most .
Some deliver some excellent gameplay that I never expected to see .
Worms
Blast may be designed for kids but I suggest to older gamers that are fans of the puzzle genre to look into this title .
The game mechanics have been created very well .
There is an huge array of weapons to choose from , allowing a character performance to increase .
While there are not as many characters as weapons , characters also contain certain game mechanics .
Each character performs differently based on health , accel , aiming , and turning .
The weapons and character you choose can sometimes have a big impact on how well you perform .
This is a great title for any puzzle game fan .
I have played a large portion of the title and I believe it should live up to any puzzle fans expectations .
However , if you do n’t like puzzle games this is truly not the right game for you .
Graphics
While the gameplay was excellent , there is no surprise that the graphics in Worms Blast are terrible , mostly because puzzle titles do not require creative 3D levels with great textures .
This game would probably run just fine on a Nintendo 64 .
The levels backgrounds are detailed , but not 3D .
The backgrounds are very colorful also , but look more like drawing because the background is flat .
The beautiful colors also apply to the entire title .
The water looks as if it ’s cell shaded , and this also goes with the characters .
It ’s very noticeable that the title has beautiful colors , but not good graphics .
However , the menu ’s are n’t half bad either .
The menu selections are made of wooden signs with a small icon with the name of the mode next to it .
Most gamers can agree that it ’s the gameplay that matters and because this title is a puzzle title , you really cannot blame it on the poor graphics .
Sound & Music
Sound effects can be heard when items drop into the water and you can hear background music of the level you are in .
I did come across a few tunes that you almost feel like humming , just like the music you find in a Mario title .
However , this is not a very impressive element in the game .
Puzzle games tend to focus on the gameplay , and make everything else poor .
Because of this , usually you hear simple music in the background or dull sound effects .
Nothing interesting here .
Controls
Worms
Blast is great under this category because you do n’t have to open the games instructions booklet just to finds out what all the controls are .
Fortunately , its very easy to pick up .
In fact , the only buttons you really use is A to shoot at the blocks and the joystick to move around .
Once you come across more weapons , you can use the B button to switch between them .
However , using the gun to aim at the puzzle blocks is completely inaccurate , the chance of hitting something is more of a 50/50 situation .
At times , the controls may cause frustration but eventually its easy to get used to the poor aiming .
Overall
This game was obviously created for fans of the puzzle genre .
If you do n’t like puzzle games , you might want to give it a try but if your sure you do n’t like puzzle games , this game will be a disaster for you .
However , if you enjoy puzzle titles , this should be the next game on your list .
The game is nothing but fun addicting puzzle action .
Worth your money puzzle fans !
More Women in Norway 's Boardrooms , but Limits Remain
Under Norwegian law , women hold about 40 percent of seats on corporate boards .
The law , which was passed in 2003 , has been hailed as a general success , though its full effects on performance have yet to be seen .
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York , then led by Timothy Geithner , told American International Group Inc. to withhold details from the public about the bailed - out insurer ’s payments to banks during the depths of the financial crisis , e-mails between the company and its regulator show .
AIG said in a draft of a regulatory filing that the insurer paid banks , which included Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Societe Generale SA , 100 cents on the dollar for credit - default swaps they bought from the firm .
The New York Fed crossed out the reference , according to the e-mails , and AIG excluded the language when the filing was made public on Dec. 24 , 2008 .
The e-mails were obtained by Representative Darrell Issa , ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
The New York Fed took over negotiations between AIG and the banks in November 2008 as losses on the swaps , which were contracts tied to subprime home loans , threatened to swamp the insurer weeks after its taxpayer - funded rescue .
The regulator decided that Goldman Sachs and more than a dozen banks would be fully repaid for $ 62.1 billion of the swaps , prompting lawmakers to call the AIG rescue a “ backdoor bailout ” of financial firms .
The worst of the die - hard reactionaries and racists who seem to find the GOP such a snugly place , did n't give Obama even one minute 's worth of honeymoon .
When did Limbaugh start screaming how he wanted the president to fail ?
Before the inauguration ?
And how soon after did the obstructionists and secessionists like Rick Perry , Jim DeMint , Richard Burr , Michele Bachmann and Mike Pence rush to find microphones to concur ?
Alan Grayson articulated the import of this for the nation : " If the president had a B - L - T tomorrow the Republicans will try to ban bacon .
" But now the honeymoon is certainly over for the whole nation , even for people of good will .
The president 's approval numbers have slumped and his party has lost a great deal of trust -- and even the Democratic candidate for Ted Kennedy 's oldSenate seat seems like she could lose .
People seem to be ready to forget that it was n't just Bush who brought on the recession but the conscious and articulated policies of the Republican Party .
Perhaps people would be more willing to keep that in mind if Obama had a team with more Hilda Solises and fewer Rahm Emanuels and Timothy Geithers .
Thursday the unraveling of Geithner -- which started when Obama made the terrible mistake of nominating him to be Treasury Secretary -- slipped into high gear .
Now it 's just a matter of time before Obama has no choice but to cut him lose ; the sooner the better , for everyone 's sake ( except , of course , for the reactionaries and racists who want to see Obama fail ) .
Now , you probably already know that Issa , a criminal type himself and the richest person in the House of Representatives , is hardly a good - faith player .
In fact , he 's one of the worst of the worst .
But sometimes even a rotten bastard like Issa hits on truth .
“ It appears , " he brayed , " that the New York Fed deliberately pressured AIG to restrict and delay the disclosure of important information .
[ Taxpayers ] “ deserve full and complete disclosure under our nation ’s securities laws , not the withholding of politically inconvenient information . ”
Barney Frank -- who 's no Darrell Issa -- also finds this " troubling " and wants to see congressional hearings .
Ditto for Edolphus Towns , chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
Labels : AIG , banksters , Ed Schultz , Tim Geithner
O.K. , the beast is starving .
Now what ?
That ’s the question confronting Republicans .
But they ’re refusing to answer , or even to engage in any serious discussion about what to do .
For readers who do n’t know what I ’m talking about : ever since Reagan , the G.O.P. has been run by people who want a much smaller government .
In the famous words of the activist Grover Norquist , conservatives want to get the government “ down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub . ”
But there has always been a political problem with this agenda .
Voters may say that they oppose big government , but the programs that actually dominate federal spending  Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security  are very popular .
So how can the public be persuaded to accept large spending cuts ?
The conservative answer , which evolved in the late 1970s , would be dubbed “ starving the beast ” during the Reagan years .
The idea  propounded by many members of the conservative intelligentsia , from Alan Greenspan to Irving Kristol  was basically that sympathetic politicians should engage in a game of bait and switch .
Rather than proposing unpopular spending cuts , Republicans would push through popular tax cuts , with the deliberate intention of worsening the government ’s fiscal position .
Spending cuts could then be sold as a necessity rather than a choice , the only way to eliminate an unsustainable budget deficit .
Il y a des fois où la caricature est en deçà de la réalité .
On connaissait les éco-autoroutes , l’inénarrable ministre de l’écologie et du développement durable Jean - Louis Borloo veut « aller plus loin » et vient de signer avec deux des principales sociétés d’autoroutes une convention destinée à « verdir les autoroutes » actuelles .
On ne se contente plus de « repeindre en vert » , maintenant on le dit !
C’est en effet l’AFP qui nous l’apprend , « les sociétés d’autoroutes filiales de Vinci et Sanef , qui exploitent plus de la moitié des tronçons concédés au secteur privé , se sont engagées lundi à investir plus d’1 milliard d’euros pour « verdir » ceux - ci , en échange d’un allongement d’un an de leurs concessions respectives . »
Et devinez comment s’appelle cette magnifique convention signée entre l’état français et ces deux sociétés d’autoroutes ?
Le « paquet vert »… Cela ne s’invente pas , probablement une nouvelle idée fumeuse de Borloo après les « emplois verts » et la « croissance verte »…
Ce « paquet vert » obligerait les deux groupes , qui gèrent à eux deux 5.947,5 kilomètres des 8.000 km du réseau autoroutier français concédé au secteur privé , à effectuer des travaux , dont le but est de « verdir ces autoroutes » , s’est félicité Jean - Louis Borloo lors de la signature de cette convention à Paris .
Et combien va coûter le coup de peinture verte ?
Un milliard d’euros pour 5.947,5 kilomètres d’autoroutes , cela fait environ 168.000 euros par kilomètre …
Cela paraît beaucoup , mais il faut quand même savoir que le coût de construction moyen d’un kilomètre d’autoroute tourne autour des 6 millions d’euros et peut monter parfois à 10 , 20 ou même 50 millions d’euros du kilomètre pour les cas les plus difficiles ( montagne , milieu urbain dense ) .
Même avec une moyenne de 6 millions d’euros par kilomètre , on obtient donc le coup de peinture verte à environ 2,8 % du coût total de construction …
Mais attention , le coup de peinture sera comme d’habitude financé par les contribuables , y compris ceux qui n’ont pas de voiture ou qui ne prennent jamais l’autoroute …
Car , un « allongement d’un an de leurs concessions respectives » en échange du verdissement apparaît comme un beau cadeau fait par l’état français aux sociétés d’autoroutes …
Le communiqué de l’AFP se garde bien de préciser quel est le bénéfice attendu par les sociétés d’autoroutes pour une année supplémentaire de racket autoroutier …
Et à ce prix -là , comment transforme - t - on une vieille autoroute polluante et destructrice de biodiversité en « autoroute verte » à la sauce Borloo ?
En changeant les fosses septiques des aires de repos !
Incroyable , non ?
On en voit parfois des vertes et des pas mûres …
« Nous allons remplacer les fosses septiques des aires , contre des toilettes plus économes « , a notamment déclaré à l’AFP Pierre Coppey , directeur de Vinci Autoroutes France qui regroupe les sociétés concessionnaires ASF ( autoroutes du sud de la France ) , Cofiroute , et ESCOTA ( Côte d’Azur ) .
Vinci et Sanef doivent également mener des travaux « préservant des zones hydrauliques sensibles , protégeant les riverains du bruit , sauvegardant la biodiversité et réduisant les émissions de CO2 « .
Juste une question : comment fait - on pour « sauvegarder la biodiversité » quand on a provoqué la disparition définitive d’espèces animales ou végétales ?
On utilise leur ADN conservé dans du bitume pour les ramener à la vie ?
Bienvenue à Autoroute Park !
Au passage , on apprend aussi que les deux groupes vont restaurer les aires de repos et entendent généraliser le télépéage .
On peut supposer qu’une partie du milliard vert ira donc à la construction de systèmes de télépéage et à la réfection des cafétérias , mais bon , si c’est pour le développement durable …
Et pour finir , laissons le dernier mot au toujours « vert » Jean - Louis Borloo qui réussit la performance d’utiliser deux fois le mot « vert » dans la même phrase : « Tout en rappelant que ces « engagements verts » s’inscrivent dans le cadre du plan de relance , M. Borloo a indiqué que ces investissements allaient « soutenir l’emploi dans les entreprises du bâtiment et de travaux publics et les PME des filières vertes « .
Il y en a qui devraient se mettre au vert avant de finir verts de rage après s’être pris une volée de bois vert …
" The Green Game " Help save the planet by being fat !
Whenever you see a fat person cheer for them because they are helping the planet by dying young !
So I hear there ’s this website called “ The Facebook ” that is really popular with the kids these days , and I decided to check it out …
Kidding , kidding .
Of course I know what Facebook is .
I ’ve just been choosing not to participate .
The whole “ social networking ” thing does n’t offer me anything I want that I can’t already do through e-mail or by building websites .
( I recognize that I am atypical in this regard ) .
I actually tried out Facebook back when it was university - students - only .
I built a profile , linked it to my friends , and then said “ Well , now what ?
I guess I ’m done . ”
And I never went back .
Eventually I deleted my profile , just to avoid spreading outdated information about myself .
Of course , Facebook now is not really the same application as Facebook in 2004 .
With over 350 million users ( as many as Firefox ) , it forms a significant part of how many people experience the Internet , and as such it shapes their expectations for how web interfaces should look and feel , as well as how their real - life relationships should be represented in software .
This was the argument given by many of my coworkers , who told me that I ought to at least try out the modern Facebook , so that I could better understand where many of our users are coming from .
So I went to Facebook and started creating an account .
I entered my first and last name and email address , and Facebook showed me a page saying “ We think these people might be your friends ” .
There were several dozen people there who I actually know , mixed in with several dozen who I do n’t .
Wait a minute , How does Facebook know who my friends are ??
Remember , I had n’t told them anything except an email address at this point .
I was disturbed by how much they knew about me .
More than disturbed .
I was freaked out .
Where did this information come from ?
From the old account that I deleted ?
Unlikely .
I believe it came from my friends importing their email contacts into Facebook .
My email address was in their contact lists , so Facebook looked it up in their database and , not finding me , stored a sort of “ dangling pointer ” .
This pointer laid dormant until I entered a matching email address , at which point it sprang into action .
The part that disturbs me about all this is that Facebook had my email address in their database , without my knowledge or consent , despite my decision not to use their service .
And they had a lot more than my email address .
They had pictures of me , uploaded by my friends and tagged with my name .
They knew who my friends were .
They knew what my friends liked .
They knew more or less how I would fit into their social network .
If they wanted to , they could deduce a lot of information about the person behind the email address .
It would have been fairly trivial for them to figure out what school I went to , about how old I am , what political activities I have been involved in , and what advertisers would be most interested in reaching my demographic .
My friends did not ask my permission before giving Facebook all this information about me .
Why would they ?
There is no UI warning , no legal terms , no moral or cultural expectation that they should do so .
They just typed in their own email password and clicked “ Find Friends ” .
Facebook makes money through targeted advertising .
They profit from the detailed information that they extract from their extensive social network database .
I was part of that database despite my choice not to participate .
It ’s not too much of a stretch to say that they have been profiting off of me , without my knowledge or consent , using information about me that was given away by my friends , again without my knowledge or consent .
I do n’t think that Facebook as a company is doing anything unusual or exceptionally bad .
This is pretty much standard practice in the industry .
Facebook is in this position simply because they ’re the social network with the biggest reach .
I ’d have the same concerns about any one company , no matter how seemingly benevolent , having this much information about people who chose not to participate ( or rather , who thought they were choosing not to participate ) .
I want to be able to choose what information about myself I make available on the Internet .
I want to be able to control how that information is used .
And if I make a choice not to participate in an organization or do business with a company , then I do n’t want that organization or company storing information about me .

Herders in northern Kenya who suffered large cattle losses during recent droughts are to be offered livestock insurance in a pioneering project that uses satellite imagery of available grazing to determine when payouts occur .
The scheme , billed as a world first by the International Livestock Research Institute , is being launched today in the arid Marsabit district .
Pastoralists in Marsabit keep more than 2 m cows , camels , goats and sheep , worth an estimated $ 67 m , but currently have no way of rebuilding herds decimated by starvation because of the lack of the grazing after rains fail with increasing frequency .
While there have been 28 droughts in the area over the past century , four have struck in the past decade alone , causing significant animal loss and pushing many families towards poverty .
Previously , insuring livestock for pastoralists has proved near impossible due to the difficulty of verifying the death of animals over a wide and remote area .
But ILRI said it has found a way around the problem with a scheme that pays out not on death but when satellite imagery shows that available forage is so scarce that animals are likely to starve .
Under the new scheme , which will be administered by local firms Equity Bank and UAP insurance , around a thousand farming households are expected to pay between 3.25 % and 5.5 % of the value of their herds to insure them for a year .
For a cow the cost would start at £ 3.25 an animal , for a goat or sheep 33 p .
Payouts will depend on the predicted mortality levels .
To build the insurance model , which was developed together with several US universities and local officials , ILRI researchers collected satellite images of plant growth in Marsabit since 1981 from the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index , a global database updated by Nasa and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
The information was combined with data on livestock deaths in Marsabit since 2000 to produce a programme that can reliably predict when a reduction in grazing will lead to animal deaths .
There will be two potential payouts each year based on satellite images at the end of the long dry season in September , and the short dry season in February .
ILRI said that the policies could also be used by herders as collateral to buy food or drugs to help their animals survive difficult periods .
" Insurance is something of a holy grail for those of us who work with African livestock , particularly for pastoralists who could use insurance both as a hedge against drought – a threat that will become more common in some regions as the climate changes – and to increase their earning potential , " said ILRI director general Carlos Seré .
If successful , the project is expected to be expanded to other parts of east Africa .
STEAMPUNK
Steampunk is a subgenre of fantasy and speculative fiction that came into prominence in the 1980s and early 1990s .
The term denotes works set in an era or world where steam power is still widely used — usually the 19th century , and often set in Victorian era England — but with prominent elements of either science fiction or fantasy , such as fictional technological inventions like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne , or real technological developments like the computer occurring at an earlier date .
Other examples of steampunk contain alternate history - style presentations of " the path not taken " of such technology as dirigibles or analog computers ; these frequently are presented in an idealized light , or a presumption of functionality .
Steampunk is often associated with cyberpunk and shares a similar fanbase and theme of rebellion , but developed as a separate movement ( though both have considerable influence on each other ) .
Apart from time period and level of technological development , the main difference between cyberpunk and steampunk is that steampunk settings usually tend to be less obviously dystopian than cyberpunk , or lack dystopian elements entirely .
Various modern utilitarian objects have been modded by individual craftpersons into a pseudo - Victorian mechanical " steampunk " style , and a number of visual and musical artists have been described as steampunk .
Steampunk is a relevant theme for the 2008 edition of GOGBOT because it is a challenging and upcoming item in subcultural streams and platforms , like Second Life or in the videoclip , short film , comix and pop-music .
In the US cultural heritage is unique and steampunk is a very popular theme .
Moreover , the city of Enschede developed a major textile industry in the late 1800s , as one of Europe 's booming industrial regions where the textile industry was based on steam energy .

* Okay , here is a little essay for you .

The User 's Guide to Steampunk
People like steampunk for two good reasons .
First , it ’s a great opportunity to dress up in a cool , weird way that baffles the straights .
Second , steampunk set design looks great .
The Industrial Revolution has grown old .
So machines that Romantics considered satanic now look romantic .
If you like to play dress - up , good for you .
You 're probably young , and , being young , you have some identity issues .
So while pretending to be a fireman , or a doctor , or a lawyer , or whatever your parents want you to be , you should be sure to try on a few identities that are totally impossible .
Steampunk will help you , because you cannot , ever , be an authentic denizen of the 19th century .
You will meet interesting people your own age who share your vague discontent with today 's status quo .
Clutch them to your velvet - frilled bosom , because you will learn more from them than you ever will from your teachers .
Stretching your self - definition will help you when , in later life , you are forced to become something your parents could not even imagine .
This is a likely fate for you .
Your parents were born in the 20th century .
Soon their 20th century world will seem even deader , weirder and more remote than the 19th .
The 19th - century world was crude , limited and clanky , but the 20th - century world is calamitously unsustainable .
I would advise you to get used to thinking of all your tools , toys and possessions as weird oddities destined for the recycle bin .
Imagine starting all over with radically different material surroundings .
Get used to that idea .
If you are European , you may further realize that you are surrounded by an ever - growing European " museum economy " that sells your heritage as a " heritage industry . "
Familiarity with steampunk will certainly help you here .
The heritage industry does not sell heritage , because heritage is inherently unsellable .
Instead , it sells the tourist - friendly , simplified , Photoshopped , price - tagged , Disneyized version of heritage .
Steampunk is great at mocking and parodizing this activity .
That 's what makes steampunk a thoroughly contemporary act .
This dress - up costume play and these subcultural frolics will amuse and content 90 percent of the people involved in steampunk .
However , you may possibly be one of those troublesome 10 percent guys , not just in the scene but creating a scene .
Frankly , the heaviest guys in the steampunk scene are not really all that into " steam . "
Instead , they are into punk .
Specifically , punk 's do - it - yourself aspects and its determination to take the means of production away from big , mind - deadening companies who want to package and sell shrink - wrapped cultural product .
Steampunks are modern crafts people who are very into spreading the means and methods of working in archaic technologies .
If you meet a steampunk craftsman and he or she does n't want to tell you how he or she creates her stuff , that 's a poseur who should be avoided .
Find the creative ones who want to help you , and who do n't leave you feeling hollow , drained and betrayed .
They exist .
You might be one .
Steampunk began as a literary movement -- for some reason no one understands , it started with young Californian fantasists writing about Victorian Great Britain , specifically James P. Blaylock , Tim Powers and K. W. Jeter .
This guy Jeter made up the term " steampunk . "
He made no money doing that , and you 've likely never heard of him before now .
I doubt this much bothers Jeter .
Jeter was a major disciple of Philip K. Dick , so he always understood the inherent limits of bourgeois mundane reality .
Nowadays steampunk is not about historical pastiche with a sci - fi twist , because , although that 's interesting , there 's not a whole lot of room for literary maneuver there .
Steampunk has become popular now because it is no longer just fiction .
It is an international design and technology effort .
Steampunk a counterculture arts and crafts movement in a 21st century guise .
If this idea makes your heart beat faster , I can save you a lot of trouble by recommending one brief essay called " On the Nature of the Gothic " by John Ruskin , the greatest design critic of the original steam era .
Go read it .
Read this manifesto with great care because it was the seed of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood , Jugendstil , Art Nouveau , William Morris wallpaper , Aubrey Beardsley Yellow Book decadence , romantic - nationalist architecture and about a thousand other things most steampunks would consider very cool .
Ruskin wrote an extremely influential and important essay which changed the world .
Everything Ruskin says in that essay is wrong .
The ideas in there do n't work , have never worked and are never going to work .
If you try to do the things Ruskin described in the spirit that Ruskin suggested , you are doomed .
However .
If you try to do those things in a steampunk spirit , you might get somewhere useful .
Steampunks are equipped with a number of creative tools and approaches that John Ruskin never imagined , such as design software , fabricators , Instructables videos , websites , wikis , cellphones , search engines and etsy.com .
Successful steampunks are not anti-industrial as Ruskin was .
They are digital natives and therefore post - industrial .
This means that they can make their own , brand - new , fresh mistakes -- if they understand the old mistakes well enough not to repeat them .
Steampunk 's key lessons are not about the past .
They are about the instability and obsolescence of our own times .
A host of objects and services that we see each day all around us are not sustainable .
They will surely vanish , just as " Gone With the Wind " like Scarlett O'Hara 's evil slave - based economy .
Once they 're gone , they 'll seem every bit as weird and archaic as top hats , crinolines , magic lanterns , clockwork automatons , absinthe , walking - sticks and paper - scrolled player pianos .
We are a technological society .
When we trifle , in our sly , Gothic , grave - robbing fashion , with archaic and eclipsed technologies , we are secretly preparing ourselves for the death of our own tech .
Steampunk is popular now because people are unconsciously realizing that the way that we live has already died .
We are sleepwalking .
We are ruled by rapacious , dogmatic , heavily - armed fossil - moguls who rob us and force us to live like corpses .
Steampunk is a pretty way of coping with this truth .
The hero of the funeral is already dead .
He has no idea what is happening .
A funeral is theater for the living .
Steampunk is funereal theater .
It 's a pageant .
A pageant selectively pumps some life into the parts of the past that can excite us , such as the dandified gear of aristocrats , peculiar brass gadgets , rather stilted personal relationships and elaborate and slightly kinky underwear .
Pageants repress the aspects of the past that are dark , gloomy , ugly , foul , shameful and catastrophic .
But when you raise the dead , they bring their baggage .
There 's not a lot we can do about the past ; but we should never despair of it , because , as Czeslaw Milosz wisely said , the past takes its meaning from whatever we do right now .
The past has a way of sticking to us , of sticking around , of just plain sticking .
Even if we wrap the past around us like a snow - globe , so as to obscure our many discontents with our dangerous present , that willful act will change our future .
Because that 's already been tried .
It was tried repeatedly .
Look deep enough , try not to flinch , and it's all in the record .
So : never mock those who went before you unless you have the courage to confront your own illusions .
The past is a kind of future that has already happened .
Abstract
Objective
To compare the early social - communicative development of younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) with that of younger siblings of children with typical development , using parental report and child - based measures .
Design Group comparison .
Setting Vanderbilt University , between July 1 , 2003 , and July 31 , 2006 .
Participants Younger siblings of children with ASD ( n = 64 ) and younger siblings of children with typical development ( n = 42 ) between the ages of 12 and 23 months ( mean , 16 months ) .
Main Exposure Having a sibling with an ASD .
Outcome Measures Child - based measures included a cognitive assessment ; an interactive screening tool assessing play , imitation , and communication ; and a rating of autism symptoms .
Parental report measures were an interview of social - communicative interactions and a questionnaire assessing language and communication skills .
Results
Younger siblings of children with ASD demonstrated weaker performance in nonverbal problem solving ( mean difference [ MD ] , 5.91 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 2.48 - 9.34 ) , directing attention ( MD , 0.52 ; 95 % CI , 0.07 - 0.97 ) , understanding words ( MD , 33.30 ; 95 % CI , 3.11-63.48 ) , understanding phrases ( MD , 4.56 ; 95 % CI , 1.85 - 7.27 ) , gesture use ( MD , 1.49 ; 95 % CI , 0.51 - 2.47 ) , and social - communicative interactions with parents ( MD , 1.32 ; 95 % CI , 0.27 -2.37 ) , and had increased autism symptoms ( MD , 2.54 ; 95 % CI , 1.05 - 4.03 ) , relative to control siblings .
A substantial minority of the ASD sibling group exhibited lower performance relative to controls .
Significant correlations between child - based measures and parental reports assessing similar constructs were found ( r = − 0.74 to 0.53 ; P range , .000-.002 ) .
Conclusion
The weaker performance found for children in the ASD sibling group may represent early - emerging features of the broader autism phenotype , thus highlighting the importance of developmental surveillance for younger siblings .
Twin and family studies support a strong genetic basis for autism .
1
The genetic risk to parents and siblings extends not only to diagnosed autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) but also to milder variants , often referred to as the “ broader autism phenotype . ”
The broader phenotype includes traits that are not necessarily associated with disability , but are conceptually similar to the core autism symptom domains .
2,3 Multiple studies4 - 8 have demonstrated elevated rates of impairments ( eg , social and communication impairments and language delays ) in relatives of children with autism .
Although these phenotypic features may be below the diagnostic threshold , they may still have an effect on early development and learning .
Estimates of the recurrence risk for ASD in younger siblings of children with ASD ( Sibs - ASD ) have ranged from 6 % to 9%,1,9,10 although rates as high as 29 % and 37 % have been reported recently .
11,12 In addition to those siblings who are diagnosed as having an ASD , others may demonstrate broader phenotypic features , particularly language delays .
12 - 14 These findings highlight the heterogeneity that characterizes Sibs - ASD and the unique opportunity they provide for studying the early development of autism and related disorders .
Much of our information about the early manifestations of autism derives from retrospective parental reports and home videotapes , 15 - 18 which may be limited by recall biases or unstandardized contexts .
19
The prospective study19 of infant Sibs - ASD allows for longitudinal investigation of development using direct observations and standard assessments .
This approach can provide information not only about the earliest signs of autism but also about the development , manifestation , and boundaries of specific behaviors that may represent the broader autism phenotype , such as social and communication skills .
Recent studies 13,14,20 - 22 have found that Sibs - ASD demonstrate differences in social and communicative development by the age of 14 to 18 months , such as less advanced levels of requesting , initiating and responding to joint attention , and language and gesture development , relative to siblings of typically developing children ( Sibs - TD ) .
Moreover , the latter differences exist even when children who are later diagnosed as having an ASD or language delays are excluded from analyses , suggesting the pervasiveness of early communicative differences in Sibs - ASD.13
Because children with autism often have learning delays compared with their low - risk peers , cognitive functioning is another area warranting investigation .
Information about early performance on standardized cognitive measures is available only for the subgroup of Sibs - ASD who are later diagnosed as having an ASD , or for language subscales only .
12,13
Thus , the extent to which differences in verbal and nonverbal cognitive abilities exist within the broader group of high - risk siblings , relative to control siblings , is not yet known .
The present study compares the early social - communicative and cognitive development of Sibs - ASD and Sibs - TD .
This study extends our knowledge by using a relatively large sample to examine group differences and within - group patterns of performance for child - based and parental report measures .
Methods
Participants
This study included 106 participants : 64 Sibs -ASD and 42 Sibs - TD .
Eligible participants had ( 1 ) a chronological age between 12 and 23 months , inclusive ; ( 2 ) no severe sensory or motor impairments that would impede completion of research assessments ; ( 3 ) no identified metabolic , genetic , or progressive neurological disorders ; ( 4 ) English as the primary language ; and ( 5 ) an older sibling .
Eligibility for the Sibs - ASD group required that the older sibling ( ie , proband ) be diagnosed as having autism , pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified , or Asperger disorder ; proband diagnoses and available supporting information were obtained from parents .
Eligibility for the Sibs - TD group required that the older sibling have no developmental disorders and that there be no family history of autism or mental retardation in first - degree relatives ; this information was obtained through a family history interview with parents .
Children were recruited between July 1 , 2003 , and July 31 , 2006 .
The Sibs - ASD were recruited from university - based autism ( n = 34 ) and speech - language ( n = 16 ) programs , and community agencies ( n = 14 ) .
The Sibs - TD were recruited through a birth record database ( n = 18 ) , university - based research programs ( n = 13 ) , and community agencies ( n = 11 ) .
The research protocol received approval from the Vanderbilt University institutional review board , and all parents signed informed consent forms before beginning any research procedures .
The sample was 87 % white and 57 % male .
Parental occupations ranged from semiskilled to professional ,23 and nearly all mothers ( 99 % ) completed high school ( Table 1 ) .
The groups differed significantly on maternal education ( mean difference [ MD ] , 0.42 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.08 - 0.76 ) , with mothers of Sibs - TD having a higher mean educational level than mothers of Sibs - ASD .
The number of older siblings was comparable in the Sibs - ASD ( mean , 1.8 ) and Sibs - TD ( mean , 1.6 ) groups ( MD , 0.23 ; 95 % CI , − 0.11 to 0.56 ) .
Of the probands , 40 ( 63 % ) had autism , 21 ( 33 % ) had pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified , and 2 ( 4 % ) had Asperger syndrome .
( Number of probands does not add to 64 because 2 Sibs - ASD came from the same family . )
Table 1 . Participant Characteristics *
Procedures
All assessments and interviews were conducted or supervised by experienced licensed psychologists , in collaboration with reliably trained graduate students ( C.R.M. and others ) or research assistants .
With the exception of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale ( CARS ) , each measure was administered by a different member of the research team in a single 3 - hour session .
In rare cases , families were rescheduled for a second session because of child fatigue .
Examiners were not blind to sibling group .
Measures
Mullen Scales of Early Learning
The Mullen Scales of Early Learning ( MSEL ) 24 is a measure of cognitive function designed for children from birth through the age of 68 months .
Cognitive subscales measure the domains of nonverbal problem solving ( visual reception ) , fine motor skills , receptive language , and expressive language .
The MSEL provides a t score ( mean , 50 ; SD , 10 ) for each domain and an overall early learning composite ( mean , 100 ; SD , 15 ) .
The MSEL has strong concurrent validity with other cognitive and language measures and is used commonly with young children with autism .
24
The 4 t scores and the early learning composite were used to measure cognitive development .
Childhood Autism Rating Scale
The CARS25 is a 15 - item scale used to assess autism symptoms ( eg , social relating , communication , and body use ) .
Items are rated on a 4 - point scale ( including midpoints ) according to degree of abnormality .
Total scores range from 15 to 60 , with scores 30 and higher suggesting the presence of autism .
The CARS has strong test - retest reliability and correlations with clinical ratings .
25
This measure was completed collaboratively by the research team after observing the child 's behaviors during the entire session .
The total CARS score was used as a continuous measure of autism symptoms , consistent with previous research .
26,27
Screening Tool for Autism in Two - Year - Olds
The Screening Tool for Autism in Two - Year - Olds ( STAT ) 28,29 is an interactive screening tool developed to identify autism risk in children between the ages of 24 and 36 months .
It consists of 12 activity - based items that are coded live and assess 4 social - communicative domains : play ( 2 items ) , requesting ( 2 items ) , directing attention ( 4 items ) , and motor imitation ( 4 items ) .
Within each domain , items are scored as pass or fail according to specific behavioral criteria , and domain scores reflect the number of items passed .
The total STAT score is calculated from the average number of failures across domains ; this score ranges from 0 to 4 ( in increments of 0.25 ) .
Higher total scores represent more impaired social - communicative performance , with scores of 2 or greater indicating autism risk .
The STAT has strong screening properties for those aged 24 to 36 months , including sensitivity and specificity , interobserver agreement , test - retest reliability , and concurrent validity with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and clinical diagnosis.29 Prior research30 has used the STAT in children younger than 24 months , and preliminary data have revealed strong psychometric properties for children as young as 14 months , using a higher cutoff score ( ie , 2.75 ) ( W.L.S. and L. Henderson , PhD , unpublished data , 2006 ) .
In the present study , the total STAT score was used as a measure of overall social - communicative functioning , and the 4 individual domain scores were used to measure specific social - communicative skills .
MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories
The MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories ( MCDI ) 30 is a parental report measure of child language and communication development commonly used with young children with ASD.31 Four scores from the Words and Gestures form were used : number of words understood , number of words used , number of phrases understood , and number of communicative gestures used .
Vocabulary scores were derived by summing the number of words on a 396 - item vocabulary checklist endorsed as understood ( vocabulary comprehension ) or understood and used ( vocabulary production ) .
The score for gestures used was derived from a 12 - item scale with a 3 - point response format ( ie , not yet , sometimes , or often ) ; the latter 2 responses were collapsed into a single category for analysis .
The score for phrases understood was derived by summing the number of items endorsed from a list of 28 phrases .
Detection of Autism by Infant Sociability Interview
The Detection of Autism by Infant Sociability Interview ( DAISI ) 32 is a semistructured parental interview developed to measure social engagement behaviors present before the age of 2 years .
Items assess early dyadic ( eg , turn taking ) and triadic ( eg , referential eye contact ) interactions .
Retrospective use of the DAISI with parents of undiagnosed 2 - to 4 - year - old children found that 15 key items differentiated children who were subsequently diagnosed as having autism from those diagnosed as having nonautistic developmental delay .
32
In the present study , the 15 - item version was used ; scores range from 0 to 15 , with higher scores reflecting more optimal social - communicative development .
Results
Preliminary analyses
Preliminary analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between maternal education and chronological age and the other variables of interest .
When appropriate , maternal education , chronological age , or both were entered as covariates in subsequent analyses .
Mean differences and 95 % CIs are reported for analyses of covariance and multivariate analyses of covariance .
Results from χ 2 analyses are presented as odds ratios ( ORs ) ( Sibs - ASD / Sibs - TD ) with 95 % CIs .
Child - based measures
Children in the Sibs - ASD group obtained significantly lower mean cognitive scores than those in the Sibs - TD group on the MSEL early learning composite ( MD , 6.95 ; 95 % CI , 1.45 -12.45 ) and the MSEL visual reception domain ( MD , 5.91 ; 95 % CI , 2.48 - 9.34 ) ( Table 2 ) .
Autism symptoms on the CARS were greater for Sibs - ASD than Sibs - TD ( MD , 2.54 ; 95 % CI , 1.05 - 4.03 ) .
In addition , social - communicative performance was lower for Sibs - ASD on the STAT total ( MD , 0.31 ; 95 % CI , 0.01 - 0.61 ) and the directing attention domain ( MD , 0.52 ; 95 % CI , 0.07-0.97 ) .
Table 2 . Data for Child - Based Measures
The pattern of scores within each group suggested that the lower performance of the Sibs - ASD characterized a substantial subgroup of this sample , rather than a few outlying low performers .
For example , 34 ( 53 % ) of Sibs - ASD ( vs 12 [ 29 % ] of Sibs - TD ) had 1 or more below - average MSEL domain scores ( ie , < 40 ) ( χ2 = 6.22 ; OR , 2.83 [ 95 % CI , 1.24-6.50 ] ) , and 23 ( 36 % ) Sibs - ASD ( vs 6 [ 14 % ]
Sibs - TD ) obtained total STAT scores in the at - risk range ( ie , ≥ 2.75 ) ( χ2 = 5.98 ; OR , 0.30 [ 95 % CI , 0.11 -0.81 ] ) .
Parental report measures
Significant group differences were found for the DAISI ( MD , 1.32 ; 95 % CI , 0.27 -2.37 ) , with parents of Sibs - ASD reporting fewer social - communicative behaviors .
On the MCDI , significant differences were found for vocabulary comprehension ( MD , 33.30 ; 95 % CI , 3.11-63.48 ) , phrases understood ( MD , 4.56 ; 95 % CI , 1.85 - 7.27 ) , and gestures used ( MD , 1.49 ; 95 % CI , 0.51 - 2.47 ) ( Table 3 ) .
Table 3 . Data for Parental Report Measures
Again , a substantial minority of Sibs - ASD were in the lower - performing subgroup .
For example , 19 ( 30 % ) Sibs - ASD ( vs 1 [ 2 % ]
Sibs - TD ) reportedly understood fewer than 10 phrases ( χ2 = 12.61 ; OR , 17.71 [ 95 % CI , 2.27-138.27 ] ) , 10 ( 16 % ) ( vs 0 ) used fewer than 5 gestures ( χ2 = 7.00 ; OR , undefined ) , 35 ( 55 % ) ( vs 14 [ 33 % ] ) understood fewer than 100 words ( χ2 = 5.00 ; OR , 2.50 [ 95 % CI , 1.11 - 5.63 ] ) , and 9 ( 14 % ) ( vs 0 ) obtained DAISI scores lower than those previously reported for children with developmental delay ( χ2 = 6.45 ; OR , undefined ) .
32
Correlations between child - based and parental report variables measuring similar constructs revealed significant agreement .
Parental report on the DAISI was correlated with children 's total STAT and CARS scores , and MSEL language scores were correlated with MCDI scores ( Table 4 ) .
Table 4 . Correlations Between Child - Based and Parental Report Measures
Distributions of scores
Scatterplots were used to examine patterns of scores within and between groups .
Figure 1 illustrates patterns of performance on the STAT and CARS , both of which measure autism symptoms .
For most Sibs - TD ( 36 [ 86 % ] of 42 children ) , scores clustered in the lower left quadrant , indicating few or no signs of autism symptoms .
Scores for the Sibs - ASD showed more variability ; whereas most ( 41 [ 64 % ] of 64 ) children demonstrated a pattern similar to the Sibs - TD , a substantial minority of the Sibs - ASD obtained scores in the at - risk range ( ie , ≥ 2.75 ) on the STAT ( 23 [ 36 % ] of 64 children ) , 3 of whom also had clinical scores ( ie , ≥ 30 ) on the CARS .
Six of the Sibs - TD also obtained scores in the at - risk range on the STAT ; however , 5 of these children were younger than 14 months , which is below the age for which it is recommended .
None of the Sibs - TD scored in the clinical range on the CARS .
Figure 1 . Distribution of scores on the Screening Tool for Autism in Two - Year - Olds ( STAT ) vs the Childhood Autism Rating Scale ( CARS ) .
The line at x = 2.75 indicates the autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) risk cutoff for children younger than 24 months on the STAT , and the line at y = 30.0 indicates the ASD cutoff on the CARS .
Higher scores on both scales indicate increased autism symptoms .
Sibs - ASD indicates siblings of children with ASD ; and Sibs - TD , siblings of typically developing children .
Figure 2 provides a comparison of patterns across parental report ( DAISI ) and child - based ( STAT ) measures of social - communicative behaviors .
Again , many of the Sibs - TD ( 36 [ 86 % ] of 42 children ) demonstrated well - developed social - communicative skills ( ie , higher DAISI scores and lower STAT scores ) .
The Sibs - ASD demonstrated more variable performance , with higher proportions obtaining suboptimal scores on 1 ( 16 [ 25 % ] of 64 children ) or both ( 8 [ 12 % ] of 64 children ) measures .
Figure 2 . Distribution of scores on the Screening Tool for Autism in Two - Year - Olds ( STAT ) vs the Detection of Autism by Infant Sociability Interview ( DAISI ) .
The line at x = 2.75 indicates the autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) risk cutoff for children younger than 24 months on the STAT , and the line at y = 10 indicates the point below which only children with autism scored in the original DAISI sample .
Higher scores on the STAT and lower scores on the DAISI indicate greater social - communicative impairment .
Sibs - ASD indicates siblings of children with an autism spectrum disorder ; and Sibs - TD , siblings of typically developing children .
Comment
The results of this study revealed that Sibs - ASD demonstrated significantly lower performance across measures of social - communicative development , cognitive functioning , and autism symptoms , relative to their low - risk peers .
Weaker social - communicative performance for Sibs - ASD was found on the STAT , an interactive measure assessing play , imitation , and communication ; the DAISI , a parent interview assessing early social , affective , and communication behaviors ; and the MCDI , a parental questionnaire assessing verbal and nonverbal understanding and expression .
The consistency of results obtained across different methods highlights the robustness of these findings .
Results of cognitive testing with the MSEL revealed group differences for the composite score and for the scale assessing nonverbal problem solving ( ie , visual reception ) .
However , mean scores for both groups were well within the average range .
The weaker performance on visual reception demonstrated by the Sibs - ASD was somewhat surprising , given that nonverbal ability is often described as a relative strength for young children with ASD.33
However , several items on this scale involve the presentation of verbal instructions and / or require a gestural response ( eg , pointing ) .
It is , thus , possible that these findings are related to the lower language understanding and gesture use demonstrated by Sibs - ASD .
Significant positive correlations between the MSEL and MCDI support this interpretation .
Our failure to find expressive language differences between the sibling groups , either for parental report or cognitive measures , was also unexpected .
Language impairments , including early delays in spoken language , are a prominent feature of autism and an important behavioral marker for early identification .
34,35
This finding may be explained by the young ages of the children in this study .
Similar results with young ASD group siblings were obtained by Mitchell et al,13 who concluded that gestural deficits may be apparent earlier than language deficits and may , therefore , represent more sensitive markers for early detection .
Group differences for directing attention ( ie , initiating joint attention ) , which represents a core feature of autism ,36 - 38 were found on the STAT .
This result is consistent with findings from other recent studies 14,21,39,40 demonstrating differences in initiating joint attention for Sibs - ASD on the Early Social Communication Scale .
Joint attention is a key developmental skill that has been associated with language acquisition in children with typical development and in those with autism .
41 - 46
The implications of early developmental differences in joint attention for subsequent language development in Sibs - ASD are not yet known , because normative data are not available for many social - communicative behaviors , including joint attention .
As a result , the point at which behavioral differences represent delayed or disordered development ( or risk for such ) is not known .
One important question regarding group comparisons between siblings of children with ASD and siblings of children with typical development is the extent to which group differences may be attributable to a few Sibs - ASD whose performance may be particularly impaired .
Our results suggest that a substantial proportion of Sibs - ASD — rather than a few “ outliers ” — demonstrated weaker performance relative to the Sibs - TD .
For example , more than half of the Sibs - ASD obtained 1 or more below - average MSEL subtest scores and more than one third obtained STAT scores in the “ at - risk ” range .
Moreover , scatterplots illustrated the clustering of scores within the optimal range for the Sibs - TD , whereas the Sibs - ASD demonstrated considerable variability in performance .
These results are consistent with those of Goldberg et al , 21 who found a wide distribution of Early Social Communication Scale scores in a young sample of Sibs - ASD .
Because the study of infant siblings is a fairly new area of research , follow - up diagnostic evaluations have extended only to the age of 24 months .
Thus , we have little information about long - term developmental pathways or trajectories .
It could be the case that mild behavioral differences in this group resolve on their own over time , without intervention and with no ill effects .
On the other hand , it is possible that slight differences in social - communicative behavior may limit a young child 's exposure to crucial social input and result in a cascade of developmental sequelae .
47 Conceptualizations of brain development suggest that atypical early experiences may have a significant effect on brain growth and later neuropsychological functioning .
47 - 50 Therefore , understanding the early development of these high - risk siblings may suggest treatment ( or prevention ) strategies for attenuating early developmental differences and optimizing outcomes .
Longitudinal follow - up of these high - risk siblings is under way , and will clarify the implications of early behavioral differences .
Meanwhile , however , developmental surveillance is important to ensure that any needed assessment or intervention referrals are made as early as possible .
In sum , the study of infant siblings of children with ASD offers an important opportunity to learn about the earliest signs of autism and / or broader phenotypic features , and to understand normative and disrupted patterns of early social - communicative development .
This research has the potential to increase our knowledge about the early development of autism and to develop tailored intervention and prevention strategies for promoting optimal outcomes in this group of at - risk children .

So far Nepomuk only handled annotations for local files and did not care about mount points and the like .
With KDE SC 4.4 that is about to change .
( What I present here today is the first step in supporting removable media like USB keys or external hard drives .
The next step will have to wait until 4.5 . )
As always my blog will have two parts : the user visible one and the technical one which discusses implementation details .
Imagine you had a USB key with a file on it which you annotated , say with a rating of 6 :
As long as the key is mounted searching for files with a rating of 6 will always return our image the way we know it :
But now we unmount the key .
Thus , the file will not be accessible anymore .
But the file still shows up in the search :
However , there is a slight change in the name : now it contains a hint to the USB key ( this hint did not make it into 4.4 ) .
Opening the file still works since the key is automatically mounted .
But what happens if we remove the key completely and thus , auto - mounting is not an option anymore ?
Well , the search does still return the file but trying to open it gives us an error .
Well , Gwenview does not handle KIO errors properly , thus we do not get an error message .
But in theory we would get the message “ Please insert the removable medium ‘ 1,9 GiB Removable Media ’ to access this file . ” .
Just to show that I am not lying let me present the Okular error dialog ( which could use some improvement , too ) :
Here you see the whole ugly Nepomuk query URL and all at the bottom the unformatted error message .
Hopefully in KDE SC 4.5 we will have worked out these problems .
So if we would see this error message we would know where to find the file if we want to access it ( well , giving proper names to USB keys would help , too ) .
This is already pretty nice .
Step 2 will then be to export the annotations to the removable storage and sync them again as soon as the medium is mounted ( remember how I blogged about my experiments with that already ?
Well , as you can see I did not get that finished , yet . )
The Technical Part
OK , now we know how it looks to the user ( or how it should look ) .
Let us have a look under the hood .
Basically three players are involved in this process :
The removable storage service
The removable storage service ( code in kdebase ) uses the great power of Solid to act on newly inserted , mounted , and unmounted removable storage devices .
The simple part is that it tells the Strigi service to index the files on the device on mount .
More interesting , however , is what happens on unmount .
The service converts all absolute URLs of files on the unmounted device to relative ones .
These relative URLs use the filex : / scheme I made up and consist of two part : the UUID of the storage device and the relative path .
In our example above the URL is filex :// fc30-3da9/thepic.JPG .
In addition a new nfo : Filesystem resource is created storing the description and the UUID of the unmounted device .
The files are then related to this new nfo :
Filesystem resource via nie:isPartOf .
Nepomuk :: Resource can now transparently handle relative filex :/ URLs .
Thus , annotating the file in the example after remounting will store the annotations with the same resource although that uses a filex :/ URL .
The nepomuk :/ KIO slave
The nepomuk :/ KIO slave ( code in kdebase ) does the rest of the work .
The nepomuksearch :/ KIO slave creates the virtual query folders but uses the nepomuk :/ KIO slave to stat all resources ( at least the ones with a nepomuk : / scheme URI ) .
So as soon as a relative filex : / URL is encountered it is converted to a local URL if possible :
Solid:: StorageAccess * storageFromUUID ( const QString& uuid ) { QString solidQuery = QString :: fromLatin1 ( " [ StorageVolume.usage=='FileSystem ' AND StorageVolume.uuid=='%1 ' ] " ) .arg ( uuid.toLower ( ) ) ; QList < Solid :: Device > devices = Solid : : Device::listFromQuery ( solidQuery ) ; if ( !devices.isEmpty ( ) ) return devices .
first ( ) . as< Solid:: StorageAccess >( ) ; else return 0 ; } KUrl convertRemovableMediaFileUrl( const KUrl& url , bool evenMountIfNecessary = false ) { Solid:: StorageAccess * storage = storageFromUUID ( url.host( ) ) ; if ( storage && ( storage -> isAccessible ( ) || ( evenMountIfNecessary && mountAndWait ( storage ) ) ) ) { return storage -> filePath ( ) + QLatin1String ( " / " ) + url.path ( ) ; } else { return KUrl ( ) ; } }
And here you can already see the auto - mounting code being called .
( I do not show it here since this is enough to read already .
If you are interested have a look at the full source code . )
The converted URL is then simply passed to KIO :: ForwardingSlaveBase which handles the rest .
In case the URL cannot be converted ( the medium is not mounted and auto - mounting is not used ) all information is read from the Nepomuk database to create a proper KIO :: UDSEntry .

Why is XHTML needed ?
Is n't HTML good enough ?
HTML is probably the most successful document markup language in the world .
But when XML was introduced , a two - day workshop was organised to discuss whether a new version of HTML in XML was needed .
The opinion at the workshop was a clear ' Yes ' : with an XML - based HTML other XML languages could include bits of XHTML , and XHTML documents could include bits of other markup languages .
We could also take advantage of the redesign to clean up some of the more untidy parts of HTML , and add some new needed functionality , like better forms .
What are the advantages of using XHTML rather than HTML ?
If your document is just pure XHTML 1.0 ( not including other markup languages ) then you will not yet notice much difference .
However as more and more XML tools become available , such as XSLT for tranforming documents , you will start noticing the advantages of using XHTML .
XForms for instance will allow you to edit XHTML documents ( or any other sort of XML document ) in simple controllable ways .
Semantic
Web applications will be able to take advantage of XHTML documents .
If your document is more than XHTML 1.0 , for instance including MathML , SMIL , or SVG , then the advantages are immediate : you can't do that sort of thing with HTML .
Can I just put the XML declaration on top of existing HTML documents ?
Can I intermix HTML 4.01 and XHTML documents ?
No .
HTML is not in XML format .
You have to make the changes necessary to make the document proper XML before you can get it accepted as XML .
What is the easiest way to convert my HTML documents to XHTML ?
HTML
Tidy gives you the option to transform any HTML document into an XHTML one .
Amaya is a browser / editor that will save HTML documents as XHTML .
Why are browsers so fussy about XML ?
They were more accepting with HTML .
This is deliberate .
HTML browsers accept any input , correct or incorrect , and try to make something sensible of it .
This error - correction makes browsers very hard to write , especially if all browsers are expected to do the same thing .
It has also meant that huge numbers of HTML documents are incorrect , because since they display OK in the browser , the author is n't aware of the errors .
This makes it incredibly difficult to write new web user agents since documents claiming to be HTML are often so poor .
Why should I care if my document is in correct HTML ?
It displays all right on my browser .
All browsers know how to deal with correct HTML .
However , if it is incorrect , the browser has to repair the document , and since not all browsers repair documents in the same way , this introduces differences , so that your document may look and work differently on different browsers .
Since there are hundreds of different browsers , and more coming all the time ( not only on PCs , but also on PDAs , mobile phones , televisions , printers , even refrigerators ) , it is impossible to test your document on every browser .
If you use incorrect HTML and your document does n't work on a particular browser , it is your fault ; if you use correct HTML and it does n't work , it is a bug in the browser .
Where can I go to verify my document uses correct markup ?
W3C offers a service at http://validator.w3.org/.
The Amaya browser / editor will also ensure that your markup is correct .
Why do you say " user agent " everywhere , instead of " browser " ?
Although browsers are indeed important users of HTML and XHTML , there are other programs and systems that read those documents .
Search engines for instance read documents , but are not browsers .
By using the term " user agent " we are trying to remind people of the difference .
For example , when you do a Google search often you will see under some of the search results something like " This web page uses frames , but your browser does n't support them . " therefore surely frightening off some people from clicking on that link .
The author of the website in question has n't realised that there are more than just browsers , and that they ought to include better text in their < noframes > section , so that they do n't appear so foolish when people search their site .
Why do I have to use these namespace things in XHTML ?
In the early days of HTML different groups and companies added new elements and attributes to HTML at will .
This threatened to cause a chaos of different non-interoperable versions of HTML .
XML ( the X stands for Extensible ) allows anyone to use elements and elements from different languages , but for a browser or other user agent to know which element belongs to which language , you have to tell it .
The namespace declarations do just that .
Why is it allowed to send XHTML 1.0 documents as text / html ?
XHTML is an XML format ; this means that strictly speaking it should be sent with an XML - related media type ( application / xhtml+xml , application / xml , or text / xml ) .
However XHTML 1.0 was carefully designed so that with care it would also work on legacy HTML user agents as well .
If you follow some simple guidelines , you can get many XHTML 1.0 documents to work in legacy browsers .
However , legacy browsers only understand the media type text / html , so you have to use that media type if you send XHTML 1.0 documents to them .
But be well aware , sending XHTML documents to browsers as text / html means that those browsers see the documents as HTML documents , not XHTML documents .
Which browsers accept the media type application / xhtml+xml ?
Browsers known to us include all Mozilla - based browsers , such as Mozilla , Netscape 5 and higher , Galeon and Firefox , as well as Opera , Amaya , Camino , Chimera , DocZilla , iCab , Safari , and all browsers on mobile phones that accept WAP2 .
In fact , any modern browser .
Most accept XHTML documents as application / xml as well .
See the XHTML Media - type test for details .
Does Microsoft Internet Explorer accept the media type application / xhtml+xml ?
No .
However , there is a trick that allows you to serve XHTML1.0 documents to Internet Explorer as application / xml .
Include at the top of your document the line in bold here :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " iso -8859 -1 " ?> <?xml-stylesheet type=" text/xsl " href= " copy.xsl " ?>
<!
DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd " > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " > < head >
where copy.xsl is a file that contains the following :
< stylesheet version = " 1.0 " xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform " > < template match= " / " > < copy - of select= " . " /> </template > </stylesheet >
Note that this file must be on the same site as the document referring to it .
Although you are serving the document as XML , and it gets parsed as XML , the browser thinks it has received text / html , and so your XHTML 1.0 document must follow many of the guidelines for serving to legacy browsers .
Your XHTML document will continue to work on browsers that accept XHTML 1.0 as application / xml .
CSS has a lot of special rules that only apply to HTML .
Do these also apply to XHTML ?
No .
CSS rules that apply only to HTML , apply only to documents that are delivered as text / html .
Does document . write work in XHTML ?
No .
Because of the way XML is defined , it is not possible to do tricks like this , where markup is generated by scripting while the parser is still parsing the markup .
You can still achieve the same effects , but you have to do it by using the DOM to add and delete elements .
Why is it disallowed to send XHTML 1.1 documents as text / html ?
XHTML 1.1 is pure XML , and only intended to be XML .
It can not reliably be sent to legacy browsers .
Therefore XHTML 1.1 documents must be sent with an XML - related media type , such as application / xhtml+xml .
Why was the target attribute removed from XHTML 1.1 ?
It was n't .
XHTML 1.0 comes in three versions : strict , transitional , and frameset .
All three of these were deliberately kept as close as possible to HTML 4.01 as XML would allow .
XHTML 1.1 is an updated version of XHTML 1.0 strict , and no version of HTML strict has ever included the target attribute .
The other two versions , transitional and frameset , were not updated , because there was nothing to update .
If you want to use the target attribute , use XHTML 1.0 transitional .
What is the use of XHTML Modularization ?
XHTML Modularization is not aimed at the regular users of XHTML , but at designers of XHTML - based languages .
It had been observed that companies and groups had the tendency to design their own versions of HTML and XHTML that were often not interoperable at basic levels .
XHTML Modularization splits XHTML into a number of modules that can be individually selected when defining a new language ; in this way any XHTML - based language that uses tables is guaranteed to use the same definition of tables , and not some divergent version .
Modularization also makes it clear where it is OK to add new elements , and where it is not .
Why is XHTML2 needed ?
Is n't XHTML 1 good enough ?
HTML and XHTML have done good service , but there are many things that can be improved .
Areas that have received particular attention include better structuring possibilities , removing features that are duplicated in XML , usability , accessibility , internationalization , device independence , better forms , and reducing the need for scripting .
Is < img > being replaced by < object > in XHTML2 ?
No. < img > is being replaced in XHTML2 , but by something else ( although you could use < object > if you wanted ) .
The design of < img > has many problems in HTML :
It has no fallback possibilities , so that if you use an image of type PNG for instance , and the browser can't handle that type , the only alternative is to use the alt text .
This fact has hampered the adoption of PNG images , which in many ways are better than GIF and JPG , since people have continued to use the lowest - common denominator format , to ensure that everyone can see the images .
text .
This fact has hampered the adoption of PNG images , which in many ways are better than GIF and JPG , since people have continued to use the lowest - common denominator format , to ensure that everyone can see the images .
The alt text cannot be marked up , so that if it gets used , you just get the plain text .
text cannot be marked up , so that if it gets used , you just get the plain text .
It is possible to include a longdesc link to a description of the image , to help people who cannot see , but it is seldom implemented .
What XHTML2 does is say that all images are equivalent to some piece of content ; it does this by allowing you to put a src attribute on any element at all .
What this says is : if the image is available , and the browser can process it , use it , otherwise use the content of the element .
For instance :
< p src= " map.png " >
Exit from the station , turn left , go straight on to < strong >
High Street </ strong > , and turn right </ p>
The advantage of this is that if the image is not available for some reason ( such as network failure ) or the browser can't render that sort of image , your document is still usable .
If you want to supply more than one sort of image , you can do :
< p src= " map.png " >< span src=" map.gif " >
Exit from station ...</ span></p>
although it is better to use content negotiation if your server supports it ( and most do ) :
< p src= " map " > Exit from station ...</ p>
which would negotiate with the browser which sort of image it accepts , and give the browser its preferred sort .
If there is no available image , then the content of the element would be used .
This has an added advantage that you can later add other image types on your server and you do n't have to change the page for it still to work .
Why does n't XHTML2 use XLink ?
XLink and XHTML had different requirements for linking that turned out not to be reconcilable .
Why is n't XHTML2 backwards compatible ?
It is , but in a different way to how previous versions of HTML were backwards compatible .
Because earlier versions of HTML were special - purpose languages , it was necessary to ensure a level of backwards compatibility with new versions so that new documents would still be usable in older browsers .
For instance , this is why the < meta > element has its content in an attribute rather than in the content of the element , since it would have shown up in older browsers .
However , thanks to XML and stylesheets , such strict element - wise backwards compatibility is no longer necessary , since an XML - based browser , of which at the time of writing means more than 95 % of browsers in use , can process new markup languages without having to be updated .
Much of XHTML 2 works already in existing browsers , browsers that are not pre-programmed to accept XHTML2 .
Much works , but not all : when forms and tables were added to HTML , people had to wait for new version of browsers ; similarly some parts of XHTML 2 , such as XForms and XML Events , still require user agents that understand that functionality .
Why is xml : space set to ' preserve ' on all elements of XHTML ?
I do n't want to see extra space in my output .
The attribute xml : space is about input : that is to say , it controls if the spaces will be present in the DOM ( i.e. in the internal version of the document inside the browser ) ; it says nothing about what will appear on your screen .
Output whitespace is controlled by the CSS property ' whitespace '.
Set it to ' pre ' and the spaces in the DOM will be preserved on output ; set it to ' normal ' and the whitespace will be collapsed ( CSS3 will have more properties to enable greater control ) .
This is the reason that all elements are set to xml : space= " preserve " in XHTML2 , otherwise the CSS ' whitespace ' property would have no effect , and you would have no control over visible whitespace .
The default stylesheet will set ' whitespace ' to ' normal ' for all elements except < pre > , but you will be free to change them .
The sad train of Miramax has reached its final station and awaiting a new owner for its name , and the considerable library .
Its death was foretold just last week and now as the vultures gather TheWrap have a breakdown of the interested parties , and among them are the previous owners , Bob and Harvey Weinstein .
Reclaiming the studio they named after their parents , and sold to Disney before an acrimonious divorce left the brothers to found the Weinstein Company whose track record thus far has fared better than a Disney - led Miramax , with Inglourious Basterds a particular highlight .
If they are to reclaim their company for the reported $ 700 million ( down from the , frankly optimistic , original asking price of $ 1.2 billion ) they will regain control over the considerable back catalogue and the name which made theirs .
Head over to TheWrap for a full financial summary .
When Eric Fehr scored his thirteenth goal of the season on Thursday night , it set a new single - season career high for the 24 - year - old winger ( who is still healthy and still scoring ) .
His next goal or assist will tie his one - year best in points with 25 , and he has n't yet played forty games on the campaign .
As Fehr 's breakout 2009 - 10 marches on , it 's worth noting that nearly all of what he 's been able to do scoring - wise has come at even strength ( he 's eighth among the team 's regular forwards in power play time ) and in limited minutes overall .
The result ?
Some pretty impressive scoring rates .
For example , here are the top - five players in the League in terms of goals scored per sixty minutes of five - on - five time ( minimum 30 games played ) :
The four players in that group that are n't the subject of this post are currently the top four goal scorers in the NHL .
As for total points per sixty minutes of five - on - five hockey , Fehr again finds himself among the elite :
Seven of the League 's top - ten scorers are in that group ... not bad , eh ?
Considering the ice time he has gotten and the quality of the teammates with whom he 's played ( Fehr has the lowest 5 - on - 5 QualTeam of any top - nine Cap forward ) , Eric Fehr 's season to date is fairly remarkable .
Hopefully , you 've noticed .
Amazon has launched a Kindle application for BlackBerry that lets customers purchase and read e-books .
Just like the company ’s application for iPhone and iPod touch , if you already have a Kindle , you ’re able to sync the BlackBerry app with it , meaning information like the last page you were on is consistent across devices .
The download is free , though only newer BlackBerry models are supported -– specifically Curve 8520 and 8900 , Tour 9630 , Bold 9000 and 9700 , and Storm 9500 , 9530 , and 9550 .
In a statement , Amazon notes that they ’re currently developing both a Mac and iPad version of Kindle .
The company launched a PC version back in November .
Do you currently use Kindle on any platforms besides the device itself ?
Let us know in the comments .
The laser that will ride aboard the HEMTT A4 is a solid - state bad boy capable of countering rocket , mortar and artillery projectiles with extreme precision .
The control system can acquire , track and select a vulnerable targeting area on a moving target in the amount of time it takes the laser device to send a beam to the targeting system , which aligns it for the kill .
In other words , really , really quickly .
So do n't let the lumbering HEMTT A4 fool you ; when it comes to warfighting capability , there 's nothing else like it .
A tricky social situation I ’d never thought of : what do you do when your identical twin dies ?
Well , you bury and mourn him or her , of course , and then go through their stuff .
( You know it will fit you ! )
But here ’s what I ’m getting at : when you show up at the funeral , many of the deceased ’s friends , co-workers , etc. will never have met you .
I ’d guess that somewhere around a third of them might not even know he or she was a twin .
In other words : there will be whispers , pointing , dropped drinks , maybe screams .
You will be widely assumed to be the dead , come back to life .
I ’d never considered this problem before ( believe it or not ! ) until last night , when I was talking to an eightysomething widow who lives in my neighborhood .
Her husband was an identical twin , and this very thing happened at this funeral .
His twin lived across the country , most of the mourners had no idea who he was , and the funeral was disrupted by mass confusion .
I do n’t know if there ’s an etiquette book to cover this scenario , but –to tide you over until Miss Manners weighs in–here are some Ken Jennings - approved suggestions on how to handle it .
If you are the twin , wear a disguise .
Not a costume , like a zombie version of your dead sibling .
That would be in poor taste .
Just something simple to reduce the resemblance : changing the color or style of your hair , for example , or adding a big port - wine birthmark to one side of your face .
Conversely , you could perform a similar operation on the twin in the open casket : a tasteful little fake mustache , for example .
This is a tempting option , since a dead body will obviously be less inconvenienced by cumbersome cosmetics than you will .
What will he or she care ?
Be warned , however : many attendees might remember what he or she looked like before the change .
Embrace the problem .
Attend the funeral as a walking piece of performance art : the deceased , as their loved ones would like to remember them .
Perhaps you could install yourself at the entrance to the church , performing one of the deceased ’s favorite hobbies ( juggling , yoga , playing a favorite song on the tuba , reciting all the words to Rex Harrison ’s patter songs in My Fair Lady ) in tribute to your late twin .
A small signboard ( or addendum in the invitation ) could warn attendees of this touching tribute , so they know not to be surprised .
Arrange to die together .
Twins are always doing nutty , parallel stuff like that , buying the same neckties and whatnot , so no one will think anything of it .
If anyone tries out any of my tips in real life , I would love to hear .
One in 285 U.S. births results in identical twins , which means that 1 in 143 American funerals will be for a twin .
And in ( almost ) every case , one twin will be the first to go , thoughtlessly leaving the other in an awkward social situation !
This is a real problem that happens thousands of times in this country every day .
Time we stopped talking about the problem and did something about it !
Edited to add : Ed Toutant , leveraging the kind of free time only available to game show zillionaires , actually did the math and discovered that this only happens 18 times a day in America , not “ thousands . ”
How dare he get in the way of my alarmism with mere statistics ?
WASHINGTON — After more than eight years , federal investigators on Friday closed their files on the 2001 anthrax attacks with the formal finding that the sole person responsible for killing five people and sickening 17 others was Bruce Ivins , the government scientist who was the focus of the investigation when he committed suicide in July 2008 .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department released more than 2,700 pages of investigative documentsand a 92 - page summary of the investigation that added new details to their probe of the 2001 attacks .
According to the summary , after years of investigation and some missteps , in the summer of 2008 , prosecutors in the District of Columbia U.S. attorney 's office were preparing to seek a grand - jury indictment charging Mr. Ivins with using a weapon of mass destruction .
" Aware of the FBI investigation and the prospect of being indicted , Dr. Ivins took an overdose of over - the - counter medications on or about July 26 , 2008 , and died on July 29 , 2008 .
Administrative and investigative steps taken in the past year toward closure of the investigation confirm the conclusion that Dr. Ivins perpetrated the anthrax letter attacks , " the investigative summary reads .
Dr. Ivins was a researcher at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick , Md .
Another week of the Proposition 8 gay marriage trial is over , and you know what that means !
Yes , that you got four more glorious recaps of the action .
BUT ALSO Jessica , your favorite lawyer ever , is back to explain everything to us laypeople !
Last time , Jessica told us about the equal protection clause .
Specifically , she explained how our side is trying to prove that Prop 8 violates that clause because it discriminates based on sexual orientation .
This time around , she ’ll explore Team Totally Right ’s other arguments — there are several !
So here we go , these are all the possible ways we could win this thing , it ’s like a choose your own adventure book but a judge gets to do the choosing :
If you support marriage equality , it ’s obvious to you that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution .
And even if you do n’t understand the legal rationale , that discrimination seems inherently wrong .
Conveniently , there ’s a good argument from a legal standpoint , too .
So with a strong legal argument and a convincing message , ca n’t we just focus all of our attention on equal protection ?
No .

Effective advocacy can’t stop with one convincing argument .
Our side wants to ensure they ’re providing the judge with multiple paths to rule in our favor .
For example , take the arguments regarding discrimination based on sexual orientation .
Obviously , our attorneys argue , discrimination based on sexual orientation warrants some form of heightened scrutiny — either intermediate or strict .
Proposition 8 is neither “ narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest ” nor “ substantially related to an important governmental interest , ” which means that regardless of which level of review the court selects , we win !
But , if through incomprehensible twists and turns of logic the court does n’t decide that classification based on sexual orientation warrants heightened scrutiny — well , we still win .
The government has no legitimate reason for denying marriage equality .
So using the rational basis test , Proposition 8 must be overturned .
But what if the court does n’t agree with us there , either ?
Then we need alternative arguments .
So , in addition to arguing that Proposition 8 violates the Equal Protection Clause because it discriminates based on sexual orientation , we ’re also arguing that this is blatant gender discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause .
And in case that ’s insufficient to persuade the court to strike down this ridiculous law , Proposition 8 is also unconstitutional because it violates the fundamental right to marry as established by the Due Process Clause .
For Proposition 8 to be declared unconstitutional , we only need the court to agree with us on one of these points .
The rationale matters because it will help to define how much this affects future issues pertaining to marriage equality .
But for this case , any will suffice .
Unconstitutional is unconstitutional ; you do n’t get extra bonus points because the law violates the Constitution in multiple ways .
II . Gender and the Equal Protection Clause
With that in mind , let ’s begin with gender discrimination .
Fortunately , the law here is well - established , and therefore much easier to follow .
We do n’t need to evaluate the four factors to determine whether gender is a suspect class .
Since Craig v. Boren in 1976 , a law that discriminates on the basis of gender has been subject to intermediate scrutiny .
Classifications based on gender are unconstitutional unless the government can demonstrate that the classification is substantially related to an important governmental interest .
We ca n’t simply jump into talking about what intermediate scrutiny would mean for us , though .
We first have to establish that the law classifies people based on gender .
This may seem obvious .
I mean , I cannot marry my girlfriend in California .
If either of us were male , we could marry in California .
Seems like a pretty clear classification based on gender , no ?
But it ’s not quite that simple , because it depends on how you frame the issue .
As H8ers ( and Mark Harris from the Log Cabin Republicans documentary ) are happy to remind us , even with Prop 8 , anyone is allowed to marry someone of the opposite gender .
Based on that logic , there is no classification ; everyone is treated the same .
So which interpretation is correct ?
Conveniently , this issue runs parallel to a case the Supreme Court has already considered .
Virginia maintained laws making interracial marriage illegal up until 1967 .
At the time , those supporting the law argued that it was perfectly constitutional because it treated everyone the same .
When declaring the law unconstitutional in Loving v. Virginia , the Supreme Court noted that the mere “ fact of application [ to both the white and African - American members of the couple did ] not immunize the statute from the very heavy burden which the Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state statutes drawn according to race . ”
By extension , our attorneys argue in their trial memorandum , the fact “ that both sexes — gays and lesbians — suffer from Prop.
8 ’s discriminatory classification does not render it constitutional . ”
To uphold the law , the government must meet the heavy burden reserved for these types of discriminatory classifications : intermediate scrutiny .
This does n’t mean we win , it just means that the court must examine the law and its purposes more carefully .
III .
Due Process & Fundamental Rights
And if none of these equal protection arguments persuade the court ?
We turn to the Due Process Clause .
In addition to offering one more reason for the court to invalidate Prop 8 , this clause offers one more opportunity for mental gymnastics ( just in case the gender discrimination arguments were too straightforward ) .
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment asserts that the government shall not deprive any person of “ life , liberty , or property without due process of law . ”
The Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean that there are certain individual liberties and freedoms that inherently restrict government power .
For example , in Lawrence v. Texas , the Supreme Court held that intimate , consensual sexual conduct is part of the liberty protected by substantive due process , thereby invalidating sodomy laws across the country .
In some cases , these liberties are so important as to be deemed “ fundamental rights . ”
When the government interferes with these fundamental rights , the action is subject to strict scrutiny review ; to withstand a constitutional challenge , the government must demonstrate that this interference is necessary to achieve a compelling governmental purpose .
But what is a fundamental right ?
Some things are clearly established as enumerated fundamental rights — the First Amendment guarantees free speech and religious freedom , and these rights are widely recognized as fundamental .
But the Court has also found several fundamental rights outside of the text of the Constitution .
For example , Loving v. Virginia provides that there is a fundamental right to marry a person of any race :
“ Marriage is one of the “ basic civil rights of man , ” fundamental to our very existence and survival … .
To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes , classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment , is surely to deprive all the State ’s citizens of liberty without due process of law . ”
When the fundamental rights are found outside of the text of the Constitution , though , legal scholars and Supreme Court Justices debate the nature and scope of these rights .
Some believe strongly in the existence of non-enumerated fundamental rights , while others allege that the court is usurping the political process by protecting these rights .
So how do our attorneys persuade the court that Proposition 8 interferes with a fundamental right ?
They begin with the words of the Supreme Court .
Without necessarily recognizing the long - term implications of their assertions , the Court has provided strong guidance .
According to Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur , the Court held that “ freedom of choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause . ”
In other cases , the Court has noted that “ marriage is the most important relationship in life ” and that “ choices about marriage ” are “ sheltered by the Fourteenth Amendment against the State ’s unwarranted usurpation , disregard , or disrespect . ”
This sounds like the language of fundamental rights to me .
But again , this is just one step in the process .
Establishing the violation of a fundamental right does not inherently mean we win — it just establishes the appropriate standard of review ( strict scrutiny ) , and the court will determine whether the infringing action is permissible .
So How Do We Win ?
Clearly , this is the question everyone cares about .
As much fun as tracing the legal analysis may be , the part that matters to everyone on both sides is how it ’s going to end .
So how does this end ?
It depends .

FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA
Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Limited ( No. 3 ) [ 2010 ] FCA 24
SUMMARY
Citation : Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Limited ( No. 3 ) [ 2010 ] FCA 24
Parties : Roadshow Films Pty Ltd ( ACN 100 746 870 ) and the parties in the attached Schedule I v iiNet Limited ( ACN 068 628 937 )
File number : NSD 1802 of 2008
Judge : COWDROY J
Date of judgment : 4 February 2010
Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Limited ( No. 3 ) [ 2010 ] FCA 24
SUMMARY
In accordance with the practice of the Federal Court in some cases of public interest , importance or complexity , the following summary has been prepared to accompany the orders made today .
This summary is intended to assist in understanding the outcome of this proceeding and is not a complete statement of the conclusions reached by the Court .
The only authoritative statement of the Court 's reasons is that contained in the published reasons for judgment which will be available on the internet at www.fedcourt.gov.au .
The judgment in this proceeding is necessarily complicated both as to fact and law .
It is also lengthy , running for 636 paragraphs and almost 200 pages .
I have decided to provide short oral reasons for the judgment which I am presently to hand down .
These reasons are not intended to be a substitute for reading the judgment itself which will be accessible online this morning .
This proceeding raises the question whether an internet service provider or ISP authorises the infringement of copyright of its users or subscribers when they download cinematograph films in a manner which infringes copyright .
In Australian copyright law , a person who authorises the infringement of copyright is treated as if they themselves infringed copyright directly .
This proceeding has attracted widespread interest both here in Australia and abroad , and both within the legal community and the general public .
So much so that I understand this is the first Australian trial to be twittered or tweeted .
I granted approval for this to occur in view of the public interest in the proceeding , and it seems rather fitting for a copyright trial involving the internet .
That this trial should have attracted such attention is unsurprising , given the subject matter .
As far as I am aware , this trial , involving suit against an ISP claiming copyright infringement on its part due to alleged authorisation of the copyright infringement of its users or subscribers , is the first trial of its kind in the world to proceed to hearing and judgment .
The 34 applicants who have instituted this claim represent the major motion picture studios both in Australia and the United States .
They have brought this proceeding against iiNet which is the third largest ISP in Australia .
An organisation known as the Australian Federation Against Copyright
Theft or AFACT has , on behalf of the applicants , been prominent in the conduct of the claim .
AFACT employed a company known as DtecNet to investigate copyright infringement occurring by means of a peer to peer system known as the BitTorrent protocol by subscribers and users of iiNet ’s services .
The information generated from these investigations was then sent to iiNet by AFACT , with a demand that iiNet take action to stop the infringements occurring .
The measures which AFACT requested iiNet perform were never precisely elucidated .
However , as the evidence at trial indicated , AFACT wanted iiNet to send a warning to the subscriber who was allegedly infringing .
If a warning was not sufficient to stop the infringement , AFACT intended that iiNet suspend the internet service of that subscriber .
If the subscriber remained unco-operative , termination of the internet service was sought as the ultimate sanction .
In addition , or in the alternative , the applicants suggested that iiNet should block certain websites .
The evidence of infringement gathered by AFACT utilised the BitTorrent protocol , a blueprint for a highly efficient and effective mechanism to distribute large quantities of data .
This protocol was created in 2001 .
It has been used , or more accurately , the constituent parts of the protocol ( such as the client , tracker and .torrent files ) have been used by those accessing the internet through iiNet ’s facilities ( the ‘ iiNet users ’ ) to download the applicants ’ films and television shows in a manner which infringes copyright .
I shall refer to the constituent parts of the BitTorrent protocol together as the BitTorrent system .
The critical issue in this proceeding was whether iiNet , by failing to take any steps to stop infringing conduct , authorised the copyright infringement of certain iiNet users .
The first step in making a finding of authorisation was to determine whether certain iiNet users infringed copyright .
I have found that they have .
However , in reaching that finding , I have found that the number of infringements that have occurred are significantly fewer than the number alleged by the applicants .
This follows from my finding that , on the evidence and on a proper interpretation of the law , a person makes each film available online only once through the BitTorrent system and electronically transmits each film only once through that system .
This excludes the possible case of a person who might repeatedly download the same file , but no evidence was presented of such unusual and unlikely circumstance .
Further , I have found , on the evidence before me , that the iiNet users have made one copy of each film and have not made further copies onto physical media such as DVDs .
The next question was whether iiNet authorised those infringements .
While I find that iiNet had knowledge of infringements occurring , and did not act to stop them , such findings do not necessitate a finding of authorisation .
I find that iiNet did not authorise the infringements of copyright of the iiNet users .
I have reached that conclusion for three primary reasons which I now refer to .
Firstly , in the law of authorisation , there is a distinction to be drawn between the provision of the ‘ means ’ of infringement compared to the provision of a precondition to infringement occurring .
The decisions in Moorhouse , Jain , Metro , Cooper and Kazaa are each examples of cases in which the authorisers provided the ‘ means ’ of infringement .
But , unlike those decisions , I find that the mere provision of access to the internet is not the ‘ means ’ of infringement .
There does not appear to be any way to infringe the applicants ’ copyright from the mere use of the internet .
Rather , the ‘ means ’ by which the applicants ’ copyright is infringed is an iiNet user ’s use of the constituent parts of the BitTorrent system .
iiNet has no control over the BitTorrent system and is not responsible for the operation of the BitTorrent system .
Secondly , I find that a scheme for notification , suspension and termination of customer accounts is not , in this instance , a relevant power to prevent copyright infringement pursuant to s 101 ( 1A ) ( a ) of the Copyright Act , nor in the circumstances of this case is it a reasonable step pursuant to s 101 ( 1A ) ( c ) of the Copyright Act .
The reason for this finding is complicated and lengthy , and is not suitable for reduction to a short summary for present purposes so I shall refrain from attempting to do so .
Thirdly , I find that iiNet simply cannot be seen as sanctioning , approving or countenancing copyright infringement .
The requisite element of favouring infringement on the evidence simply does not exist .
The evidence establishes that iiNet has done no more than to provide an internet service to its users .
This can be clearly contrasted with the respondents in the Cooper and Kazaa proceedings , in which the respondents intended copyright infringements to occur , and in circumstances where the website and software respectively were deliberately structured to achieve this result .
Consequently , I find that the applicants ’
Amended Application before me must fail .
However , for the sake of completeness , I have considered all the issues argued before me .
I find that the Telecommunications
Act would not have operated to prohibit iiNet from acting on the AFACT Notices of infringement .
However , as I have already found that iiNet did not authorise copyright infringement , such issue is irrelevant .
I find that s 112E of the Copyright Act would not have operated to prevent a finding of authorisation of copyright infringement against iiNet .
However , as I found on conventional principles of authorisation that the respondent did not authorise copyright infringement , such issue is irrelevant .
Finally , I find that iiNet did have a repeat infringer policy which was reasonably implemented and that iiNet would therefore have been entitled to take advantage of the safe harbour provisions in Division 2 AA of Part V of the Copyright Act if it needed to do so .
I have drawn assistance from United States authority dealing with similar statutory instruments in making the finding .
While iiNet did not have a policy of the kind that the applicants believed was required , it does not follow that iiNet did not have a policy which complied with the safe harbour provisions .
However , as I have not found that iiNet authorised copyright infringement , there is no need for iiNet to take advantage of the protection provided by such provisions .
The result of this proceeding will disappoint the applicants .
The evidence establishes that copyright infringement of the applicants ’ films is occurring on a large scale , and I infer that such infringements are occurring worldwide .
However , such fact does not necessitate or compel , and can never necessitate or compel , a finding of authorisation , merely because it is felt that ‘ something must be done ’ to stop the infringements .
An ISP such as iiNet provides a legitimate communication facility which is neither intended nor designed to infringe copyright .
It is only by means of the application of the BitTorrent system that copyright infringements are enabled , although it must be recognised that the BitTorrent system can be used for legitimate purposes as well .
iiNet is not responsible if an iiNet user chooses to make use of that system to bring about copyright infringement .
The law recognises no positive obligation on any person to protect the copyright of another .
The law only recognises a prohibition on the doing of copyright acts without the licence of the copyright owner or exclusive licensee , or the authorisation of those acts .
In the circumstances outlined above and discussed in greater detail in my judgment , it is impossible to conclude that iiNet has authorised copyright infringement .
In summary , in this proceeding , the key question is : Did iiNet authorise copyright infringement ?
The Court answers such question in the negative for three reasons : first because the copyright infringements occurred directly as a result of the use of the BitTorrent system , not the use of the internet , and the respondent did not create and does not control the BitTorrent system ; second because the respondent did not have a relevant power to prevent those infringements occurring ; and third because the respondent did not sanction , approve or countenance copyright infringement .
I will now make my formal orders .
For the reasons provided in the written judgment I make the following orders .
The Amended Application be dismissed .
Subject to Order 3 and 4 , the Applicants pay the costs of the Respondent , including costs thrown away as a result of the Applicants ’ abandoning the primary infringement claim against the Respondent .
Any party or person applying for an order for costs different to that provided by Order 2 is to notify the Court within 14 days in which event Order 2 will be vacated and in lieu costs will be reserved .
If any application for costs is made as provided in Order 3 the parties and / or persons are to consult and prepare consent directions for the filing of submissions and , if required , for a hearing on costs .
I publish my reasons .

SCHEDULE I – THE APPLICANTS
SCHEDULE II – THE IDENTIFIED FILMS
The parties
In these proceedings there are 34 applicants which comprise most of the major film studios and their exclusive licensees in Australia .
In these proceedings the applicants acted together as effectively one party .
Attached to this judgment as Schedule I is a list of the applicants .
Each of the applicants are the owners and exclusive licensees of copyright in a large number of cinematograph films in the form of films and television programs ( the Court will refer to both these television programs and films as ‘ films ’ ) .
A sample of 86 such films for which copyright ownership and subsistence has been proved and upon which the Court has heard evidence are identified in Schedule II of this judgment and these 86 films will be referred to as the ‘ identified films ’ .
When referring to the broader catalogue of films of the applicants , the term ‘ catalogue films ’ will be used .
For further discussion of this issue , see [ 252 ] below .
The respondent , iiNet , is an ISP .
Mr Malone , the CEO of the respondent and a witness in these proceedings , commenced the respondent ’s business operations in his parent ’s garage in Perth in October 1993 .
The business was incorporated in March 1995 .
In September 1999 the respondent became a public company and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange .
At the time of its public listing , the respondent had approximately 19,000 subscribers .
This has now risen to approximately 490,000 subscribers .
Following Telstra and Optus , the respondent is the third largest ISP in Australia .
The proceedings
The proceedings commenced on 20 November 2008 by way of Application and Statement of Claim .
Subsequently , following amendments to both documents , the litigation was conducted upon the basis of an Amended Application and a Further Amended Statement of Claim ( ‘ FASOC ’ ) filed in the Federal Court Registry on 11 May 2009 pursuant to leave granted by the Court .
The Court will now turn to these pleadings .
The Amended Application
The Amended Application seeks declarations that the respondent has infringed the copyright of films contained in each of the applicants ’ respective film catalogues by authorising the making in Australia of copies of , and by authorising the communication in Australia to the public of , the whole or a substantial part of those films without the licence of the applicants .
Further , a declaration is sought that the respondent carried out such infringing acts flagrantly and that such infringements , together with other likely infringements , were conducted on a commercial scale for the purpose of s 115 ( 5 ) ( d ) of the Copyright Act 1968 ( ‘ the Copyright Act ’ ) .
By way of further relief , the applicants seek injunctions permanently restraining the respondent from infringing the copyright in any of the films contained in the catalogue of the applicants , and an order requiring the respondent to take all reasonable steps to disable access to any online location outside Australia that has been used to infringe the applicants ’ copyright .
An order is also sought requiring the respondent to terminate specified accounts of the respondent ’s subscribers who have engaged in or who have continued to engage in acts of copyright infringement involving the applicants ’ films .
Lastly , an order is sought for damages or , alternatively ( at the election of the applicants ) , an account of profits pursuant to s 115 ( 2 ) of the Copyright Act ; additional damages pursuant to s 115 ( 4 ) of the Copyright Act ( applicable to conduct which is found to be flagrant ) ; relief under s 115 ( 6 ) of the Copyright Act which entitles the Court to have regard to the likelihood of other infringements ( as well as the proven infringement ) in determining what relief should be granted ; and costs and interest .
The FASOC
The Court will now summarise the FASOC and , for convenience , the paragraphs referred to hereunder are those set out in such pleading .
Paragraphs 1 - 13 recite the relevant details of incorporation of each of the applicants and paragraph 14 refers to the incorporation of the respondent .
Paragraphs 15 - 56 inclusive refer to the applicants ’ claim that they are the owners or exclusive licensees of the films contained in their respective catalogues , that such films are cinematograph films and that copyright subsists in such films .
Paragraphs 57 and 58 refer to the provision of internet services by the respondent to its subscribers .
The acts of ‘ primary ’ infringement ( see [ 256 ] below ) of copyright are alleged in paragraphs 59 - 62 .
In such paragraphs the applicants claim that from a date unknown to them , but at least since July 2008 , the respondent ’s subscribers and other persons accessing the internet by means of the respondent ’s internet service ( henceforth referred to together as the ‘ iiNet users ’ ) have , in Australia , whilst accessing the internet by means of the respondent ’s internet services , ‘ made available online ’ to other persons ; ‘ electronically transmitted ’ to other persons ; and made copies of , the whole or a substantial part of the identified films and the catalogue films without their licence .
Further , or alternatively , it is alleged that such iiNet users have copied such films and thereafter made further copies without licence on DVD or other physical storage media for the purpose of watching , storing or distributing those films .
Paragraphs 63 -67 allege that the respondent authorised the infringement of the iiNet users .
It is alleged that the respondent knew or had reason to suspect that the iiNet users were engaged in , and were likely to continue to engage in , such conduct ; took no action in response to notifications sent on behalf of the applicants which claimed that iiNet users were engaging in the conduct referred to above ; offered encouragement to iiNet users to engage in or to continue to engage in the conduct ; failed to enforce the terms and conditions of its Customer Relationship Agreement ( ‘ CRA ’ ) by which its internet services were provided ; continued to provide services to those subscribers who were engaging in the conduct complained of ; and through the respondent ’s inactivity and indifference , permitted a situation to develop and continue whereby iiNet users engaged in such conduct .
Paragraph 64 pleads in the alternative that the respondent had the power to prevent the infringements and continuing infringements from occurring ; had a direct and commercial relationship with its subscribers which enabled it to take action against those subscribers who engaged in the infringing conduct ; and yet took no steps or adequate steps to prevent or avoid infringement .
Paragraph 67A alleges that the respondent further , or in the alternative , has , in the course of providing its internet services , provided facilities for the intermediate and transient storage or , alternatively , caching of copyright material , namely the applicants ’ films .
Paragraph 67B claims that by reason thereof the respondent has made copies of the whole or a substantial part of the identified films and the catalogue films .
Paragraph 67D alleges that the copies were made without the licence of the applicants and therefore the respondent has infringed the copyright in the identified films and the catalogue films .
Such claim , being one of primary copyright infringement against the respondent , was abandoned by the applicants shortly before the hearing commenced on 6 October 2009 .
The applicants informed the Court of this fact in an email exchange on 30 September 2009 .
Loss , damage and profits are claimed in paragraphs 68 - 74 .
The applicants claim that they have suffered or are likely to suffer loss and damage on a commercial scale and that by reason of the infringements the respondent has accrued or is likely to accrue profits to itself and its business .
Injunctive relief is sought in paragraphs 76 - 77 to restrain the respondent from engaging in the infringing activities .
The Amended Defence of the respondent
Similarly to the applicants , the respondent was granted leave to file an Amended Defence on 8 May 2009 .
Such document was filed in the Federal Court Registry on 15 May 2009 .
The respondent largely admits all matters regarding copyright subsisting in , and the applicants owning the copyright in , the identified films .
The respondent acknowledges that it provided at all relevant times , and continues to provide , telecommunications services to persons in Australia which are listed carriage services within the meaning of ss 7 and 16 of Telecommunications
Act 1997 ( Cth ) ( the ‘ Telco Act ’ ) ; says that such services were provided under terms and conditions of supply published by the respondent from time to time in its CRA ; and that the provision of those services is subject to the statutory requirements of the Telco Act , the Telecommunications ( Interception and Access ) Act 1979 ( Cth ) ( the ‘ TIA Act ’ ) , the Telecommunications ( Consumer Protection and Service Standards )
Act 1999 ( Cth ) and the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 ( Cth ) .
The respondent pleads that at all material times the services used by its subscribers and other persons in obtaining access to , and exchanging of data on , the internet were facilities for making or facilitating the making of communications within the meaning of s 112E of the Copyright Act .
Further , the respondent pleads that at all material times such facilities or services were provided for transmitting , routing or providing connections for copyright material or for the intermediate and transient storage of copyright material in the course of transmission , routing or provision of connections within the meaning of s 116AC of the Copyright Act .
The respondent states that it provided its subscribers with access to the internet and that to enable access to the internet the respondent allocated IP addresses for use by those subscribers ; that as part of such services it charged its subscribers fees applicable to the relevant plan to which the subscriber subscribed ; and that it derived no commercial advantage from its subscribers over and above the payment for such services .
The respondent initially did not admit the allegations made in paragraphs 59 and 60 of the FASOC regarding the infringing conduct of the iiNet users .
However , by the ‘ Respondent ’s Statement of Nature of Case ’ filed by the respondent on 9 April 2009 , the respondent made clear that it conceded that , for the purposes of this hearing , the evidence filed by the applicants by that date showed that iiNet users infringed copyright by ‘ making the identified films available online ’ and making copies of those films .
The respondent maintained its non-admission in regards to further copying described in paragraph 60 of the FASOC and denied that the evidence proved that the iiNet users ‘ electronically transmitted ’ the identified films .
The respondent ’s defence also alleges that if the infringing acts were committed , to the extent that those acts involved the activities of employees , agents , or other representatives of AFACT and / or of any of the applicants , such acts were done with the licence of the relevant applicants or alternatively were done in circumstances which , by virtue of the application of s 104 of the Copyright Act , did not constitute infringement of copyright .
As to the alleged authorisation by the respondent of the acts of the iiNet users referred to in paragraphs 63 and 64 of the FASOC , if such alleged infringing acts occurred , the respondent replies :
In answer to paragraphs 63 and 64 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim , iiNet :
( a ) ...
( b ) says that it knew at all material times that a proportion of the internet traffic exchanged via its facilities comprised data exchanged via the BitTorrent protocol ;
( c ) says that is knew at all material times that copyright owners have alleged that a proportion of BitTorrent internet traffic exchanged over the internet generally included content which was likely to infringe copyright ;
( d ) says that the BitTorrent protocol has , and is known by the applicants to have , many non-infringing uses and facilities ;
The respondent pleads the following in further answer to paragraphs 63 and 64 : ( i ) It [ the respondent ] did not create the BitTorrent protocol or any BitTorrent software ;
( ii ) was , and is , not the operator of the BitTorrent protocol or any BitTorrent software ;
( iii ) has not , and does not , promote the BitTorrent protocol or any BitTorrent software other than for purposes that do not involve the infringement of the applicants ’ or any other party ’s copyright ;
( iv ) has not entered into any agreements with BitTorrent Inc. or any other BitTorrent related company ;
( v ) does not have a direct or commercial relationship with BitTorrent Inc. or any other BitTorrent related companies ;
( vi ) has not , and does not , encourage users to share files which infringe the applicants ’ or any other party ’s copyright ;
( vii ) did not , and does not , support the BitTorrent protocol or any BitTorrent software except for use in a non-infringing manner ;
The respondent says it knew from 2 July 2008 of the allegations of copyright infringement being made on behalf of the applicants and that it took action in relation to the allegations .
However , the respondent pleads that the allegations were ‘ mere allegations of copyright infringement ’ and that such allegations provided insufficient information to demonstrate the veracity of the allegations made and to allow the respondent to verify the allegations .
The respondent further pleads that it is a general purpose ISP and not a facility for ‘ making available ’ , ‘ electronically transmitting ’ or copying cinematograph films .
Further , the respondent pleads that it is required to comply with the legislation regulating communications passing over telecommunications networks and use of information relating to such communications as stipulated in Part 13 of the Telco Act and Chapter 2 of the TIA Act .
The respondent says it continued to provide its services to its subscribers subsequent to the allegations of copyright infringement being made against it and relies upon its contractual obligations with its subscribers .
The respondent pleads that it did not sanction , approve or countenance the conduct of any iiNet user which would result in the infringement of copyright as alleged .
Further , the respondent pleads that it did not have any relevant power within the meaning of s 101 ( 1A ) ( a ) of the Copyright Act or otherwise to prevent alleged infringing acts by iiNet users .
It states that it had no ‘ relationship ’ within the meaning of s 101 ( 1A ) ( b ) of the Copyright Act with the users of its services who are not subscribers ; pleads if it did have a relationship , such relationship was neither direct nor commercial ; and pleads it does not know the identity of those users .
Further , the respondent pleads that it took reasonable steps to prevent or avoid the alleged infringing acts .
Otherwise , the allegations against the respondent are denied .
The respondent also raises specific defences under the Copyright Act .
The respondent relies upon s 112E of the Copyright Act which provides :
Communication by use of certain facilities
A person ( including a carrier or carriage service provider ) who provides facilities for making , or facilitating the making of , a communication is not taken to have authorised any infringement of copyright in an audio- visual item merely because another person uses the facilities so provided to do something the right to do which is included in the copyright .
Further , or in the alternative , the respondent pleads that if copyright infringement against it is proved , the conduct relied upon by the applicants was category A activity within the meaning of s 116AC of the Copyright Act.
Section 116AC is contained in Division 2 AA of Part V of the Copyright Act ( ‘ safe harbour provisions ’ ) which limits the remedies available against carriage service providers for infringement of copyright if certain conditions are fulfilled by the carriage service provider .
The respondent pleads that it has complied with those conditions in that it has not initiated any transmission of the films nor made any substantive modifications to any films other than as part of a technical process .
Further , the respondent submits that it has adopted and reasonably implemented a policy that provides for termination in appropriate circumstances of repeat infringers ( as required by condition 1 of item 1 of s 116AH ( 1 ) of the Copyright Act ) and states that no relevant industry code exists ( as referred to in condition 2 of item 1 of s 116AH ( 1 ) of the Copyright Act ) to which the respondent can adhere .
In these circumstances , the respondent submits that even if the applicants were entitled to any relief ( which is denied ) , such relief is limited to an order requiring the respondent to take reasonable steps to disable access to an online location outside Australia or requiring the respondent to terminate specified subscribers ’ accounts .
The applicants ’
Reply
The Reply filed in answer to the respondent ’s Defence ( not the Amended Defence ) acknowledges the respondent ’s pleading which alleges that the respondent is a carriage service provider within the definition of that word in the Telco Act and that the respondent is engaged in the provision of telecommunications services , including internet services , to members of the public in Australia .
The applicants admit that the BitTorrent protocol exists and is capable of use in the manner described in the applicants ’ particulars .
The applicants also admit that there is no relevant industry code in force for the purpose of condition 2 of item 1 in the table in s 116AH ( 1 ) of the Copyright Act .
The applicants claim that if ( which is denied ) s 116AH ( 1 ) of the Copyright Act applies , the Court should make orders requiring the respondent to take all reasonable steps to disable access by iiNet users to online locations used to infringe copyright , and to require the respondent to terminate accounts of subscribers who have engaged in infringement or whose accounts have been used for infringement .
Otherwise the applicants join issue with the Defence .
It should be noted that the filing of the Amended Defence did not require the filing of an Amended Reply .
Structure of judgment
The Court is mindful of the substantial length of this judgment .
However , given the length of the trial ( some 20 days ) , the length and detail of the closing submissions ( over 800 pages , excluding hundreds of pages of tables , graphs and spreadsheets ) , and the obvious importance of these proceedings to the law of copyright both in this country and possibly overseas , the Court believes that all submissions made and arguments raised ought to be decided to give certainty and finality to the litigation ( pending any appeal ) .
To assist the consumption and comprehension of this lengthy judgment , it has been divided into a number of parts , each addressing specific issues .
To some extent there may be repetition , but this is unavoidable if the various parts of the judgment are to be readily comprehended .
Part A [ 1 ] - [ 42 ] is the current part , the introduction .
Part B [ 43 ] -[ 78 ] provides a succinct explanation of the operation of the internet and of the BitTorrent protocol .
A comprehension of both is necessary to understand the subsequent findings .
Part C [ 79 ] -[ 252 ] discusses important evidentiary issues in the proceedings .
In Part D [ 253 ] -[ 356 ] the Court discusses and makes findings on the issue of whether the applicants have been successful in proving that iiNet users infringed their copyright .
Part E1 [ 357 ] -[ 507 ] concerns the pivotal issue of these proceedings , namely whether the respondent can be said to have authorised any infringement by the iiNet users .
Part E2 [ 508 ] -[ 555 ] concerns the specific issue of whether the Telco Act prohibited the respondent from acting on the AFACT Notices .
Part E3 [ 556 ] -[ 579 ] concerns the issue of whether s 112E of the Copyright Act assists the respondent in these proceedings .
Part F [ 580 ] -[ 634 ] concerns the issue whether the respondent can take advantage of the safe harbour provisions in Division 2 AA of Part V of the Copyright Act.
Finally , in Part G [ 635 ] -[ 636 ] , the Court makes its conclusions .
Following the conclusion , there are two schedules attached to the judgment .
The first ( ‘ I ’ ) lists the second to thirty - fourth applicants in these proceedings and the second ( ‘ II ’ ) lists the identified films and their owners and / or exclusive licensees .
PART B : TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
This judgment proceeds into a significant amount of technical detail .
In order to better understand the reasons given , a brief technical interlude into the operation of both the internet and the BitTorrent protocol is necessary .
The Court will turn first to the internet and then to the BitTorrent protocol .
The information in this technical interlude is derived from both the evidence given at trial and certain notorious facts of which the Court takes judicial notice .
The internet
IP addresses and packets
The internet is , in summary , a network of networks of computers .
In order for those computers to be able to communicate with each other , they have to be speaking the same language .
Protocols facilitate this process .
Protocols could be described as languages or , alternatively , sets of rules for computers .
If two computers obey these rules , they will be able to understand each other and communicate .
The two primary protocols by which communication is effected between computers on the internet are the Internet Protocol ( ‘ IP ’ ) , and the Transmission Control Protocol ( ‘ TCP ’ ) .
TCP is not relevant for these proceedings and will not be discussed further .
Data that is sent by means of the IP is ‘ packetised ’ , that is , the data to be communicated is broken up into small packets and then sent by means of the IP .
Each packet contains a header ( akin to an envelope ) containing information identifying the address or location from which the packet is sent and to which the packet is to be sent and other information not presently relevant .
The packet itself contains the data which is akin to the letter within an envelope .
The IP protocol effects communication between computers by means allocating addresses to the sending and receiving computers and then sending the packets of data from one address to another , in many ways analogous to the mail .
Such IP addresses are sold in blocks to ISPs , who then individually allocate them to their subscribers to enable the subscribers to connect to the internet .
The body which allocates IP addresses to Australian ISPs is the Asia - Pacific Network Information Centre or APNIC .
The identity of the ISP to which certain IP addresses have been allocated is public information .
The addresses used by the IP are known as IP addresses .
They are a number rendered in binary code but , for the benefit of readability by persons , they are converted into a number of 4 groups of 3 digits separated by a full stop , for example , 192.168.111.123 .
The IP addresses in evidence in these proceedings are in this form .
In most situations , packets of data are not sent directly from one location to another , largely because each computer on the internet is not connected directly to every other computer on the internet .
Rather , each computer is linked to other computers which are then in turn connected to other computers and so on .
That is why the internet is not a network of computers ; it is a network of networks of computers .
Further , not all packets dispatched from one computer travel to the same destination by means of the same path .
NAT
A further important concept is Network Address Translation ( ‘ NAT ’ ) .
This allows a router ( which is essentially a device which can ‘ route ’ data between a network of computers ) to take one internet connection and split it between a number of computers .
Such routers also allow a number of computers to communicate with each other , creating a network .
In this scenario , one internet connection comes through a modem into a router .
That router then distributes the data to the computers which are connected to it via ethernet ( network ) cables , or , alternatively , wirelessly by means of Wi-Fi .
This internal network prevails in many households and most businesses .
Each computer connected to the router is assigned an IP address by the router in the same format as that used in the internet .
However such IP addresses are private , that is , they are known only to the computers on that network .
The IP address of a particular computer is not broadcast to the internet .
This allows the number of computers connected to the internet to be dramatically increased , because each computer does not need its own public IP address allocated by an ISP .
Rather , the computer is connected to the internet through a router , with the router being assigned the public IP address by the ISP .
This public IP address is the only address that is seen by other computers on the internet .
Therefore , one can know the location of a connection to the internet by means of a public IP address , but a public IP address does not necessarily relate to a specific person or specific computer .
There may only be one computer connected to the internet through a public IP address .
Equally , there may be hundreds .
One cannot know which is the case from outside that particular network .
For the balance of this judgment , unless otherwise indicated , the term IP address will refer to a public IP address .
Physical facilities
As mentioned , IP addresses are allocated to subscribers by ISPs .
ISPs also connect subscribers to the internet by means of physical infrastructure .
Such infrastructure may be owned by multiple ISPs .
For a subscriber of the respondent with an ADSL2 + ( a type of internet connection ) plan , that subscriber ’s connection to the internet outside Australia , generally speaking , occurs by the means discussed below .
The household computer sends data to the router , which then forwards the data to the ADSL2 + modem .
This ADSL2 + modem then transmits data down the copper phone lines to an exchange .
The copper phone lines and exchange are owned by Telstra .
Exchanges are local hubs of copper telephone wire connections .
At the exchange , the copper wire terminates into a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer ( ‘ DSLAM ’ ) , which is owned and provided by the respondent .
The DSLAMs allow many copper connections to be aggregated together .
The data is then sent from this exchange via the DSLAM to an iiNet data centre , which is a larger facility where connections from multiple exchanges are aggregated .
Where the sending computer is based outside Sydney , for example , in Western Australia , the data would need another leap from the city data centre in question ( for example , Perth ) to Sydney , Sydney being the location of the connection to the rest of the world .
This connection occurs from the Sydney data centre to the rest of the world by means of undersea optical fibre cables .
Dynamic IP addresses
For most of the respondent ’s subscribers , the IP address provided to them to access the internet is not fixed ; rather , it is dynamically assigned .
This means the IP address by which a computer is connected to the internet changes over time .
The respondent provides a fixed ( ‘ static ’ ) IP address for all subscribers on business plans .
As already discussed , protocols are the means by which computers communicate .
While TCP and IP have been mentioned , there are many others , for example , smtp ( email ) , ftp ( file transfer ) , http ( world wide web ) , VOIP ( voice ) and BitTorrent .
As already mentioned , the latter protocol is central to the current proceedings .
The BitTorrent protocol
The BitTorrent protocol is essentially a scheme for a highly efficient and decentralised means of distributing data across the internet .
The term ‘ decentralised ’ is used in this context in contradistinction to the traditional model of data distribution which is the client / server model .
In that model one computer which has the data ( the ‘ server ’ ) sends that data to another computer which requests it ( the ‘ client ’ ) , often by means of the http or ftp mentioned above .
The BitTorrent protocol operates on a different basis .
It operates on a ‘ peer to peer ’ ( ‘ p2 p ’ ) basis whereby all the computers seeking data participate in the distribution of it .
The BitTorrent protocol is a set of rules , or , in layman ’s terms , a blueprint .
It specifies what needs to be done to implement a system of data distribution .
It has a number of constituent parts which will be explained in more detail below .
BitTorrent client
The first part of the BitTorrent protocol is the BitTorrent client .
The BitTorrent client is a computer program or software which allows a person to access groups of computers sharing a particular . torrent ( explained below ) file .
These groups of computers are known as ‘ swarms ’ .
Each computer in a swarm is known as a ‘ peer ’ .
The BitTorrent client can have no operation by itself , as it needs to be provided with information in order to fulfil its role .
This information comes from a . torrent file .
There are a number of BitTorrent clients provided free of charge from a variety of different organisations .
The client referred to primarily in these proceedings was uTorrent ( pronounced ‘ you - torrent ’ ) which is the most popular BitTorrent client .
Other BitTorrent clients include Vuze , and , rather confusingly , the BitTorrent Client , which is the BitTorrent client of BitTorrent Inc , such company being founded by Bram Cohen who created the BitTorrent protocol in 2001 .
Each BitTorrent client operates in the same basic way , as it must comply with the requirements of the BitTorrent protocol in order to be able to function as a part of it .
However , as well as these basic functions , different clients may have different graphical user interfaces , a search function for . torrent files , more advanced features and so on .
. torrent file
The second part of the BitTorrent protocol is the .torrent file .
The term ‘. torrent ’ refers to a file extension .
File extensions , such as .doc , .avi , .mp3 , .pdf , .exe and so on do nothing more than associate a particular file with a particular purpose .
For example , a .doc file is a document , .avi is a film file ( the files in question in these proceedings were frequently .avi files ) , and .mp3 is a music file ( the subject of the proceedings in Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd and Others v Cooper and Others [ 2005 ] FCA 972 ; ( 2005 ) 150 FCR 1 ( ‘ Cooper [ 2005 ] FCA 972 ; 150 FCR 1 ’ ) and Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd and Others v Sharman License Holdings Ltd and Others [ 2005 ] FCA 1242 ; ( 2005 ) 65 IPR 289 ( ‘ Kazaa ’ ) ) .
This . torrent file contains the information necessary for the BitTorrent client to contact and participate in a swarm .
It is important to emphasise that the .torrent file does not contain the underlying data of a film or television program .
Rather , the .torrent file contains the name of the file sought , the size of the file , the hash value of the file , the hash value of the pieces of the file , and the location of the tracker .
Before moving on to explain the tracker , the third part of the BitTorrent protocol , an aside into hashes is necessary .
Hashes
The BitTorrent protocol operates by breaking up large files , such as film files ( which are usually many hundreds of megabytes or a few gigabytes ) into smaller parts ( ‘ pieces ’ ) .
This is similar in principle to the means by which data is transferred across the internet , as discussed at [ 45 ] above .
As an aside , a ‘ byte ’ is a term that refers to a certain amount of data , namely 8 ‘ bits ’ .
A bit is either a zero or a one , given that computers compute by means of binary code .
A ‘ kilobyte ’ is 1024 bytes , a ‘ megabyte ’ is 1024 kilobytes and a ‘ gigabyte ’ is 1024 megabytes .
The size of the pieces to which BitTorrent breaks a file into varies , but the evidence suggests that film files are often divided into pieces which are 512 kilobytes .
These pieces will usually be larger than packets , which , as mentioned , are the mechanism by which data is transferred across the internet .
Such pieces are shared between the individual peers in a swarm .
Over time , pieces are requested and received by the BitTorrent client from various other peers and are ultimately assembled together like a large jigsaw into the film file .
In order to ensure that each piece is received correctly , and that the data is not corrupted , the BitTorrent client consults hash values for each piece ( ‘ piece hashes ’ ) .
A hash value is a means of converting a large amount of data into a smaller value and it is a mathematical function of its input , that is , an identical input equals an identical hash .
This means a hash can fulfil the function of an identifier of data .
The input in this circumstance comes from the data of the file being shared as a whole or a piece of that file .
As mentioned , the .torrent file contains the details of the piece hashes of all the individual pieces of the file in question .
When the BitTorrent client receives a piece of the file from another peer in the swarm , it checks that the piece hash of the piece is identical to the piece hash for that piece in the .torrent file .
If it is , the BitTorrent client knows that the piece is the correct piece and was correctly received .
If it is not , it is discarded and the requested piece is sought again .
The ‘ file hash ’ is different from the piece hash .
While the piece hash is a mathematical function of the data of a particular piece , the file hash is the mathematical function of the data of the underlying file as a whole being shared in a swarm .
The term ‘ file ’ is being used in a general sense in this context .
A particular swarm may be sharing one file ( in the case of an .avi film ) or a number of files ( for example , the individual songs on a CD in .mp3 format ) .
The file hash applies to what is being shared as a whole , and serves as a mechanism of identifying what file is in each swarm .
For example , the film The Dark Knight might be available in many different digital versions ( and therefore in many different swarms ) .
One version may be high quality ( for example Blu - Ray quality ) , one lower quality ( for example , DVD quality ) .
Each version , and therefore each swarm , will have its own file hash , even though the underlying content , for example , The Dark Knight , is the same .
This results from the fact that while the film is the same in each example , the underlying data is different , and therefore the file hash ( which is a function of the data ) is different .
The file hash is used by the applicants to show that a particular swarm is sharing one of their films , because they can watch a copy of the film with that file hash , identify it as their own , and then know that any copy with that file hash would be the same , because if the underlying file were different it would have a different file hash .
Location of . torrent files
The .torrent files are made available for download from a litany of sources .
Some examples discussed in these proceedings include The Pirate Bay ( http://thepiratebay.org) and MiniNova ( http://www.mininova.org).
Such sites have a search function which enables a person to search for the file that they want , whether it be a film such as The Dark Knight , or a television program such as Lost .
There are also private sites like Demonoid ( http://www.demonoid.com) which provide a similar service , but only do so for registered members .
There are also a number of specialist sites that provide . torrent files for specific interests .
Not all . torrent files relate to copyright infringing material .
The tracker
The third part of the BitTorrent protocol is the tracker .
The tracker is a computer program on a server made available for contact by BitTorrent clients by means of a Universal Resource Locator ( ‘ URL ’ ) ( in layman ’s terms , a web address ) .
As mentioned , such URL is found in the .torrent file .
This tracker monitors the particular swarm to which it is attached and monitors the IP addresses of peers in the swarm .
The BitTorrent client , when provided with the location of the tracker by the .torrent file , contacts the tracker to request the IP addresses of peers in the swarm .
The tracker then provides that information to the BitTorrent client .
This allows the BitTorrent client to contact those peers directly ( by their IP address ) and request pieces of the file from them , and share pieces of the file with them .
Summary
To use the rather colourful imagery that internet piracy conjures up in a highly imperfect analogy , the file being shared in the swarm is the treasure , the BitTorrent client is the ship , the .torrent file is the treasure map , The Pirate Bay provides treasure maps free of charge and the tracker is the wise old man that needs to be consulted to understand the treasure map .
Whilst such an analogy grossly oversimplifies the situation it will suffice for present purposes .
It demonstrates that all of the constituent parts of the BitTorrent protocol must work together before a person can access the file sought .
In this judgment the Court will refer to all the constituent parts together as the ‘ BitTorrent system ’ .
Such analogy also demonstrates that a number of deliberate steps are required to be taken by a person to bring about the means to infringe the applicants ’ copyright .
The person must download a BitTorrent client like Vuze , seek out . torrent files related to copyright material from websites , and download those . torrent files and open them in their BitTorrent client .
Thereafter , the person must maintain connection to the internet for as long as is necessary to download all the pieces .
The length of this downloading process will depend on the size of the file , the number of peers in the swarm and the speed of those peers ’ internet connections .
The BitTorrent protocol is able to efficiently distribute data because each peer is connected to many other peers , the file is split into many small pieces , and peers download pieces from other peers as well as uploading pieces .
The BitTorrent logic operates so as to ensure that the rarest piece in a swarm is the first to be sought after , to average out the availability of pieces and minimise blockage or bottleneck which would occur if there were certain pieces of the file that many peers requested .
By this mechanism the traditional problem with the client / server model is obviated .
Under the client / server model , if there are many clients , the server has to provide the data to all of them which means that , given a fixed amount of capacity to provide data , that capacity has be shared amongst all the clients seeking that file .
In layman ’s terms , this means the more persons that seek a file , the slower each person receives it .
However , in the BitTorrent model , generally speaking , the more people wanting a file and therefore the bigger the swarm , the faster each individual peer receives the file .
It is a highly sophisticated and efficient means of distributing data .
How are pieces shared ?
For the purposes of these proceedings , a deeper understanding of the communication between the peers is required and such understanding will proceed by means of example .
In this example , the person has sought a . torrent file related to the film The Dark Knight : TheDarkKnight.avi .
Such . torrent file was found on The Pirate Bay , and has been downloaded .
The .torrent file has been opened in the BitTorrent client uTorrent .
Upon opening the file , uTorrent will contact the tracker , seeking details about the swarm sharing that file , particularly the IP addresses of peers in that swarm .
This initial contact is called ‘ scraping ’ .
Once uTorrent has the IP addresses it can contact those peers directly .
It does so in a process called handshaking .
Once this process is completed the peers can communicate directly .
The person in this scenario will not , initially , have any pieces of the TheDarkKnight.avi , but uTorrent will know because of the .torrent file all of the pieces it needs to obtain , and the piece hashes of those pieces .
uTorrent will query the peers to which it is connected , in order to ascertain which pieces of the TheDarkKnight .
avi those peers have .
Some peers will have the whole of the TheDarkKnight.avi , and therefore all pieces will be available .
These peers are known as ‘ seeders ’ .
Other peers may have less than the whole file because they are still in the process of downloading it , but they will still be able to share the pieces that they have .
Once the tracker is interrogated , uTorrent can determine which pieces are the rarest , and will therefore request those .
As stated above , pieces are not downloaded in sequence ; they are downloaded out of sequence , rarest first , and assembled together later .
uTorrent will request a particular piece from another peer who is known to have it .
This peer then decides whether or not to share it .
Generally speaking , the only reason why a peer would refuse to share a piece would be that it had too many other peers connected to it .
The assumption is in favour of sharing .
If the peer decides to share the piece it will transmit the piece to the requesting peer ’s computer .
uTorrent will check the piece by means of the piece hash and , if such check is positive , accept the piece .
Once this piece is received , uTorrent can then transmit that piece to other peers that request it .
This process obviously occurs rapidly , with multiple peers and multiple pieces , and it is entirely automatic .
From the point of view of the person , they simply see the file downloading , though they can , if desired , investigate in uTorrent the detail of the transmissions that are occurring .
Over time uTorrent will receive all the pieces and the TheDarkKnight .avi will be assembled together .
At this point in time the person will become a seeder , because they are sharing the whole file with the swarm .
The default , that is , standard setting of uTorrent will result in the person sharing the file with the swarm until uTorrent is closed , or the .torrent file is removed from uTorrent .
If the .torrent file is not removed and uTorrent is reopened , uTorrent will continue to share the file with the swarm .
Conclusion
The above explanation and examples are sufficient to enable an understanding of the internet and the BitTorrent protocol for the purpose of these proceedings .
With that understanding , the Court will now address the evidence .
PART C : THE EVIDENCE
There has been an extensive amount of evidence placed before the Court in these proceedings .
Evidence was given over ten days of the hearing .
There were 30 affidavits read during the proceedings and 151 exhibits were tendered .
It is impossible and unnecessary to refer to all the evidence that was placed before the Court .
Suffice to say the Court has read and considered all the evidence .
Each of the witnesses who have provided evidence will be discussed in the following part of the judgment , as well as the key evidentiary issues arising .
Role of AFACT
The Australian Federation Against Copyright
Theft ( ‘ AFACT ’ ) , though not actually an applicant in these proceedings , has nonetheless played a central role in the collection of evidence on behalf of the applicants for this trial .
AFACT is an organisation set up for the purposes of benefiting its members .
Those members apparently include all of the applicants ( or at least certain affiliate companies of each of the applicants ) and other companies engaged in the film production industry .
The exact nature of the relationship between the applicants and AFACT is not clear .
Mr Gane , the Executive Director of AFACT , suggested that there was no formal membership process by which one can become a member of AFACT , whether by application or agreement .
Village Roadshow was an exception .
What is clear is that the members of AFACT provide its budget and decide on its business plan , that is , what investigations and activities it will undertake .
The Motion Picture Association ( ‘ MPA ’ ) and the Motion Picture Association of America ( ‘ MPAA ’ ) have a membership of the major American film studios .
They are not associated with AFACT by any formal written agreement .
However , AFACT does report to the regional branch office of the MPA which is based in Singapore .
In respect of operations in the Asian region , the Singapore office of the MPA prepares a business plan or budget for AFACT which is approved by the Los Angeles head office of the MPA .
The Court considers that AFACT is , for relevant purposes , the local ‘ franchise ’ of the MPA , though with specific additional interaction with Australian entities that are not part of the MPA , such as Village Roadshow and related entities .
Nevertheless , it has not been established that AFACT is an agent of the applicants ; rather , its position vis-à - vis the applicants is a loose arrangement to provide certain services for the applicants .
AFACT witness – Aaron Guy Herps
Mr Herps is the Manager of Digital Affairs of AFACT .
Mr Herps has provided evidence of copyright infringing acts of iiNet users .
He has sworn four affidavits in these proceedings .
The Court accepts the evidence of Mr Herps and no challenge was made to any aspect of it by the respondent .
On 3 October 2007 Mr Herps signed up electronically for internet services from the respondent .
He selected a ‘ Home 7 ’ Plan at a cost of $ 129.95 per month .
That is , Mr Herps became a subscriber of the respondent .
To access the internet through his account Mr Herps purchased a computer which was connected to the internet via an ethernet cable and an ADSL modem .
As far as the Court is aware , Mr Herps continues to be a subscriber of the respondent .
Downloading films and television programs
On 27 June 2008 Mr Herps went to the MiniNova website and searched for . torrent files related to various films and television programs of the applicants .
He noted that multiple . torrent files often existed for each title that he searched .
It was his practice to select the specific . torrent file corresponding to the film which was identified as being the most popular ( having the largest number of peers ) .
Mr Herps then used uTorrent to participate in the swarms sharing these files , and by such means he downloaded the files to his computer .
When the download was complete he became a seeder and kept the computer operating in the same state and continued to share the files with the swarm .
Mr Herps observed that from time to time other peers were downloading pieces from one or more of the files he was sharing with swarms .
Such connections were visible to him in the uTorrent graphical user interface .
After completing such process over a period of some months Mr Herps made copies ( ‘ images ’ ) of his hard drive which were exhibited before the Court .
Mr Herps downloaded a total of six films .
Mr Herps swore a second affidavit involving a similar process to that described above , in respect of the period from 11 February 2009 until 20 February 2009 .
However , in this period his method had a crucial difference to the process described previously .
During this period , by means of an IP address filter , Mr Herps was able to program uTorrent such that it would only connect to iiNet users .
The filter was able to do so , given that , as already discussed , the IP addresses which had been allocated to the respondent ( and therefore its subscribers ) was publicly available information .
After taking this step , Mr Herps repeated the process above of downloading . torrent files from MiniNova which related to films to which the applicants own copyright .
The difference of the process enabled Mr Herps to be certain that he would only receive pieces of each film from iiNet users .
His affidavit provides evidence of his downloading and sharing of three films in that period .
Mr Herps swore a third affidavit in reply to the expert witness of the respondent , Dr Caloyannides .
Given that he was not called , no further reference need be made to that affidavit .
Mr Herps has also sworn a fourth affidavit in these proceedings which relates to issues of copyright substantiality .
As the discussion at [ 310 ] and following demonstrates , these issues are irrelevant .
Mr Herps ’ testimony is submitted to be evidence of copyright infringement of iiNet users on two grounds .
First , by his direct infringement of the applicants ’ copyright as a subscriber of the respondent ; and second because his evidence recorded connections from other iiNet users who themselves must have been infringing .
Whether Mr Herps ’ actions were infringing will be considered in Part D in relation to the issue of whether he was licensed by the applicants to carry out acts which were copyright in relation to the films .
AFACT witness – Gregory Donald Fraser
Mr Fraser is the Operations Manager of AFACT .
Mr Fraser undertook the same task referred to by Mr Herps in his second affidavit .
Mr Fraser became a subscriber of the respondent on a ‘ Home 5 ’ Plan , sought out . torrent files from MiniNova relating to the applicants ’ films and then proceeded to participate in swarms sharing those films .
Like Mr Herps in his second affidavit , Mr Fraser only downloaded pieces of files of the applicants ’ films from other iiNet users .
Mr Fraser was not cross-examined .
As with Mr Herps , the applicants rely on Mr Fraser ’s testimony as evidence of infringement by iiNet users both in the sense that he himself infringed and because he recorded connections from iiNet users who themselves were infringing .
Similarly to Mr Herps , whether Mr Fraser was licensed by the applicants will be examined in Part D of this judgment .
AFACT witness – Neil Kevin Gane
As mentioned , Mr Gane is the Executive Director of AFACT .
Mr Gane has had oversight of AFACT ’s actions in the gathering of evidence for these proceedings .
Mr Herps and Mr Fraser answer to Mr Gane .
Evidence of copyright infringement
Mr Gane testified that he was aware from his investigations and his own experience that the scale of copyright infringement of films and television programs taking place on the internet has increased substantially in recent years .
He has attached two reports confirming this trend .
The first is from a United Kingdom company , Envisional , and the second is from a German company , Ipoque .
A report entitled ‘ Internet Study 2007 ’ by Ipoque ( made between August and September 2007 ) revealed that in Australia approximately 57 % of internet traffic was p2p traffic and 73 % of such traffic was associated with the BitTorrent protocol .
Mr Gane has also exhibited confidential MPAA reports prepared by Envisional providing an analysis of overall developments related to digital film piracy worldwide .
The reports show that the number of persons using the BitTorrent protocol rose steadily over the period assessed and that the BitTorrent protocol remains the most popular p2 p file - sharing mechanism .
Investigations of online piracy in Australia
From August 2007 AFACT used the services of DtecNet Software APS ( ‘ DtecNet ’ ) to collect information concerning alleged copyright infringement by internet users in Australia .
The contractual arrangement concerning this investigation appears to have been between DtecNet and the Singapore branch of the MPA rather than between AFACT and DtecNet .
In June 2008 Mr Gane instructed DtecNet to prepare reports regarding the copyright infringing actions of iiNet users using the BitTorrent system .
It would appear that in the period between September 2007 and June 2008 , DtecNet investigated 190 Australian ISPs in relation to four different types of file - sharing protocols , including BitTorrent .
It then narrowed its investigations to the BitTorrent protocol and targeted four Australian ISPs ; namely Optus , Internode , Exetel and the respondent .
It was not explained why these particular four ISPs were selected .
By email dated 2 July 2008 Mr Gane wrote to the respondent in what would become the first of many ‘ AFACT Notices ’ .
The email attached a letter which was entitled ‘ Notice of Infringement of Copyright ’ .
The letter , addressed to Mr Malone as Managing Director of iiNet relevantly stated :
AFACT is associated with the Motion Picture Association ( MPA ) , whose members include Buena Vista International Inc , Paramount Picture Corporation , Sony Pictures Releasing International Corporation , Twentieth Century Fox International Corporation , Universal International Films Inc , and Warner Bros .
Pictures International ... and their affiliates .
AFACT represents Australian producers and / or distributors of cinematograph films and television shows , including affiliates of the member companies of the MPA .
AFACT ’s members and their affiliates are either the owners or exclusive licensees of copyright in Australia in the majority of commercially released motion pictures including movies and television shows .
AFACT undertakes investigations of infringements of copyright in these movies and television shows .
AFACT is currently investigating infringements of copyright in movies and television shows in Australia by customers of iiNet Limited ( iiNet ) through the use of the BitTorrent “ peer - to - peer ” protocol ( BitTorrent ) .
Information has been gathered about numerous infringements of copyright in motion pictures and television shows controlled by AFACT ’s members , or their affiliates , by customers of iiNet ( the Identified iiNet Customers ) .
These infringements involve the communication to the public of unauthorised copies of the motion pictures and television shows shared with other internet users via BitTorrent .
Attached is a spreadsheet containing the information relevant to infringing activities of the Identified iiNet Customers occurring between 23 June 2008 and 29 June 2008 , including :
The date and time infringements of copyright took place ;
The IP address used by the Identified iiNet Customers at the time of the infringements ;
The motion pictures and television shows in which copyright has been infringed ; and
The studio controlling the rights in the relevant motion pictures and television shows .
A CD containing an electronic copy of the spreadsheet is enclosed with the hard copy of this letter .
The letter alleged that the spreadsheet attached showed that individual subscribers of the respondent , who were referred to in the AFACT Notice as ‘ repeat infringers ’ , were involved in multiple infringements of copyright .
The letter stated that AFACT was ‘ unaware of any action taken by iiNet to prevent infringements of copyright in movies and television shows ’ .
The letter relevantly continued :
The failure to take any action to prevent infringements from occurring , in circumstances where iiNet knows that infringements of copyright are being committed by its customers , or would have reason to suspect that infringements are occurring from the volume and type of the activity involved , may constitute authorisation of copyright infringement by iiNet .
AFACT and its members require iiNet to take the following action :
Prevent the Identified iiNet Customers from continuing to infringe copyright in the motion pictures and television shows identified in the spreadsheet , or other motion pictures and television shows controlled in Australia by AFACT ’s members and their affiliates ; and Take any other action available under iiNet ’s * Customer Relationship Agreement against the Identified iiNet Customers which is appropriate having regard to their conduct to date .
Please acknowledge receipt of this letter and confirm when the above action has been taken .
The letter then attached extracts of the respondent ’s CRA which had been downloaded from the respondent ’s website and pursuant to which the respondent provided internet services to its subscribers .
The relevant provisions attached to the AFACT Notice were as follows : Customer Relationship Agreement ( CRA ) : USING THE SERVICE

iinet Website
“ Copyright Regulations and Illegal Content ” from the iinet website located at
( http://www.iinet.com.au/about/compliance/copyright.html), page 2 :
NOTE : The hosting or posting of illegal or copyright material using an iinet [ sic ] service constitutes a breach of iinet [ sic ] contractual obligation [ sic ] under the Customer Relationship Agreement Sec 4.1 & Sec 4.2 .
Such a breach of contract may result in the suspension or termination of service without notice to the subscriber .
The spreadsheet attached to the AFACT Notice of 2 July 2008 contained a summary of alleged actions of iiNet users in infringing the copyright of the applicants in the period of 23 June 2008 to 29 June 2008 via the BitTorrent system .
The spreadsheet extended over 13 pages of A4 sized paper .
It was divided into 11 columns headed ‘ Peer IP ’ , ‘ Date and Time UTC ’ , ‘ File Name Downloaded ’ , ‘ Hash ’ , ‘ Film / TV Title ’ , ‘ Studio ’ , ‘% of file Shared ’ , ‘ MB Downloaded ’ , ‘% of file Downloaded ’ , ‘ Peer Hostname ’ and ‘ Country ’ .
In addition to being forwarded by email to the respondent , the spreadsheet and letter were also served by hand on the offices of the respondent located in Perth .
Attached to the letter was a CD that contained an electronic version of the spreadsheet in the form of a Microsoft Excel file .
On 9 July 2008 a further AFACT Notice , in identical terms to that forwarded on 2 July 2008 , was sent by Mr Gane to the respondent together with the same attachments as previously , although the spreadsheet was compiled in respect of the period from 30 June 2008 to 6 July 2008 .
On 16 July 2008 a further letter was forwarded in similar terms .
However , this letter also incorporated three DVDs covering the period commencing 23 June 2008 and ending 13 July 2008 .
These DVDs contained the electronic spreadsheet found on the CD , as well as the underlying data gathered by DtecNet in its investigations .
That is , the DVDs contained the packets of data ( and therefore pieces of the file ) that the ‘ DtecNet Agent ’ ( see [ 113 ] below ) received from iiNet users .
The DVDs also contained a greater amount of information in relation to each act of infringement alleged .
Each included the information under the eleven columns at [ 100 ] as well as information entitled ‘ PeerID ’ , ‘ Peer client info ’ , ‘ Target Port ’ and ‘ Fingerprint ’ .
Thereafter AFACT
Notices were forwarded weekly to the respondent enclosing the same type of information in similar terms in respect of alleged copyright infringement in the respective week .
The respondent does not challenge that in the period of 59 weeks from 23 June 2008 to 9 August 2009 , the spreadsheets attached to the AFACT Notices recorded allegations of acts of infringement by the iiNet users .
These AFACT Notices , and underlying data attached to them , are the primary evidence before the Court of the actions of iiNet users who are alleged to have infringed the copyright of the applicants .
Expert witness – Nigel John Carson
Mr Carson is the Executive Manager of the Forensics Division at Ferrier Hodgson .
Mr Carson was engaged as an expert witness for the applicants .
His role was to provide two expert reports .
The first was a technical investigation and explanation of the BitTorrent protocol and the second analysed the data gathered by DtecNet to verify independently its veracity .
Both reports have been exhibited before the Court .
The Court found Mr Carson ’s first report to be of great assistance in developing an understanding of the BitTorrent protocol , and much of its content has been used for the purposes of the technical discussion in Part B of this judgment regarding the BitTorrent protocol .
The second report of Mr Carson provided evidence that the DtecNet evidence is reliable , that is , that the underlying data of the AFACT Notices does demonstrate that the packets of data received by the ‘ DtecNet Agent ’ ( discussed below at [ 113 ] ) constituted pieces of the films of the applicants downloaded from iiNet users .
Mr Carson was a fair - minded and excellent witness .
He provided full and forthright answers to all questions asked of him , including those that may not have provided evidence which favoured the applicants .
Therefore , the Court considers him to be an impartial witness .
The Court accepts the evidence he has provided in this hearing .
No challenge was made to his evidence by the respondent , and indeed the respondent actually relies on such evidence .
DtecNet witness – Thomas John Sehested
Mr Sehested is the Chief Executive Officer of DtecNet .
Mr Sehested gave evidence of the investigation of iiNet users by DtecNet and the collection of data by DtecNet regarding iiNet users which commenced in about June 2008 .
Mr Sehested confirmed that DtecNet supplied AFACT with Microsoft Excel spreadsheets summarising the data collected from the iiNet users and provided hyperlinks allowing AFACT employees to access a secure FTP server ( server allowing the downloading of material by means of the ftp discussed above at [ 55 ] ) operated by DtecNet which contained the data collected by the DtecNet Agent relating to iiNet users .
DtecNet witness – Kristian Lokkegaard
Mr Lokkegaard is the Chief Technology Officer of DtecNet and was responsible for the development of the proprietary software used by DtecNet to gather evidence for the current proceedings .
Such software is known as the ‘ DtecNet Agent ’ .
Mr Lokkegaard provided a confidential report to the Court which contained significant detail concerning the operation of the BitTorrent protocol and the operation of the DtecNet Agent .
The Court made an order for confidentiality regarding the report , as was requested .
However , a non-confidential version of the report was later exhibited ( exhibit SS ) .
The Court will rely on such non-confidential exhibit and Mr Lokkegaard ’s affidavit ( which was not confidential ) in explaining the operation of the DtecNet Agent .
Mr Lokkegaard swore a second affidavit in reply to Dr Caloyannides .
However , as with Mr Herps , as Dr Caloyannides was not called , there is no need to refer to such affidavit further .
Collection of data using DtecNet Agent
The DtecNet Agent , being the software used to provide the information underlying the allegations of copyright infringement in the AFACT Notices , is , in essence , a BitTorrent client .
However , it has been programmed to fulfil specific functions beyond that of a publicly available BitTorrent client , such as Vuze or uTorrent .
The process by which the DtecNet Agent operated was as follows :
An employee of DtecNet would identify . torrent files of interest based on content files which were supplied by the applicants / AFACT .
The DtecNet Agent would then open the .torrent file .
By opening the .torrent file the DtecNet Agent , like any BitTorrent client , was able to query the tracker ; connect to peers in the swarm ; and download pieces from those peers .
Given that DtecNet was gathering evidence of iiNet users infringing , the DtecNet Agent employed an IP filter similar to that used by Mr Herps and Mr Fraser to ensure that it only connected to iiNet users .
Initially , the DtecNet Agent downloaded one complete copy of the film sought to be investigated .
This copy was then viewed to ensure that the film corresponded with one that was owned by the applicants .
Given the information already discussed regarding hashes , this process established beyond doubt that a particular file hash corresponded with a film of the applicants .
The DtecNet Agent then reconnected to iiNet users who had a copy of the file or parts of the file of interest and downloaded a piece of that file from those users .
It then matched the piece downloaded with the piece hash through the hash checking process discussed in Part B . The DtecNet Agent then recorded information referrable to the peer from which it had downloaded that piece of the file .
The DtecNet Agent was calibrated to download only one piece from each IP address and then disconnect from that IP address .
It was set up to download a new piece from the same IP address every 24 hours .
The DtecNet Agent was designed to create a running log of every activity and this included every single request sent between computers and every packet of data exchanged between those computers .
Accordingly , every aspect of the connection and download was recorded and logged by the DtecNet Agent .
All the information received or logged by the DtecNet Agent was recorded and stored securely on DtecNet ’s servers .
The servers were located in Copenhagen under Mr Lokkegaard ’s supervision .
Once recorded in DtecNet ’s secure server , a DtecNet employee prepared a report containing some or all of the information recorded by the DtecNet Agent and incorporated that information into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet which was provided to AFACT .
Mr Lokkegaard stated that the data collection process carried out by the DtecNet Agent is highly accurate and reliable and is based on a confirmed connection and receipt of a piece of the file from a remote computer .
As mentioned , the second report of Mr Carson independently verified such method .
Michael John Williams
Mr Williams , solicitor for the applicants , provided numerous affidavits in these proceedings .
His primary role was to collate evidence before the Court by means of the AFACT Notices and also , following discovery from the respondent , to highlight particular aspects of the evidence of infringements as detailed hereunder .
‘ Repeat infringer bundles ’
Exhibits MJW - 1 and MJW - 8 are spreadsheets that collate data from the information attached to the AFACT Notices by means of the ‘ PeerID ’ .
The PeerID is a number generated by the BitTorrent client upon the program initiating and it remains until the BitTorrent client is closed .
As mentioned , the PeerID data was not included in the spreadsheets attached to the AFACT Notices .
Rather , it was to be found in the DVDs attached to the AFACT Notices .
This number is broadcast to the swarm , and thereby the PeerID of other peers in the swarm can be ascertained .
As will be explained in more detail in Part D at [ 277 ] -[ 278 ] , the PeerID is evidence of one computer involved in the infringement of a film or multiple films over a period of time .
There was some cross-examination of Mr Williams on the question of the factors necessary to constitute repeat infringement .
The Court finds that the definition of repeat infringement is a legal issue , and thus the opinions of any witnesses are irrelevant .
The Court ’s finding on such issue is found in Part D of this judgment .
Bundles involving the RC - 20 accounts
As will be explained in more detail at [ 122 ] and following below , during the process of discovery the respondent was ordered to provide data to the applicants in relation to 20 accounts of its subscribers ( as described hereunder , these are referred to as the ‘ RC - 20 accounts ’ ) .
Exhibits MJW - 10 , MJW - 13 , MJW - 15 are each bundles which contain this data .
MJW - 15 is the entire history of communications , whether by telephone or email , between the respondent and each subscriber account .
MJW - 13 is the login / logout history and history of allocation of IP addresses to those 20 accounts over a period of time commencing with the first AFACT Notice .
Finally , MJW - 10 uses the IP history in MJW - 13 , taken in conjunction with the DtecNet evidence in the AFACT Notices , to produce spreadsheets of the alleged infringements that have occurred in relation to each of the 20 subscriber accounts .
Mr Williams was cross-examined particularly in relation to MJW - 10 .
While the respondent was able to identify some anomalies in the generation of the spreadsheet , particularly in that some individual allegations of infringement appear to duplicate others in terms of time , as will become apparent from the Court ’s discussion of the primary infringement issue in Part D below , these issues are an irrelevancy .
Despite these anomalies , the Court finds that , on the whole , MJW - 10 is reliable .
DNS Lookups
Exhibit MJW - 17 was created using a similar process as MJW - 1 and MJW - 8 .
However , rather than arranging the DtecNet data by means of the PeerID , MJW - 17 organises the DtecNet data by means of the ‘ Peer Hostname ’ column .
This is used to demonstrate that one peer hostname was responsible for multiple infringements .
The purpose of the exhibit and affidavit which attached it appears to be to demonstrate that it is possible to gather details from publicly available sources of information in relation to a static IP address , such that it can be known who is using a particular IP address and therefore , who is potentially infringing copyright .
As mentioned , most accounts with the respondent have dynamic IP addresses allocated to them , but as already mentioned , it is possible to receive a static IP address for specific purposes , such as commercial enterprise .
The process by which this information is sought is by means of a reverse DNS lookup .
‘ DNS ’ stands for ‘ domain name service ’ .
Whenever one types a URL such as http://www.google.com into a web browser one is actually typing what is known as a ‘ domain name ’ .
As already explained , computers communicate in the IP protocol by means of IP addresses .
However , IP addresses are very difficult for people to remember .
Domain names essentially render IP addresses in a form that is easy to remember .
So , when one seeks out http://www.google.com, one is actually seeking out the IP address ( es ) associated with Google ’s website .
In order for a computer to actually connect to Google ’s servers the domain name must be converted into an IP address .
This occurs by means of a DNS lookup .
This information , linking domain name to IP address , is stored in various servers around the world .
The evidence of Mr Malone and Mr Carson establishes that this information is regularly updated , as it is crucial to communication over the internet .
However , the reverse is also possible , that is , it is possible to take an IP address and find a domain name .
This information is not as crucial to the operation of the internet and thus it is less regularly updated .
It was this information which was used to prepare the affidavit of Mr Williams and exhibit MJW - 17 .
An affidavit sworn by Mr Malone suggests that the information relied upon by Mr Williams in preparing his affidavit on this issue was unreliable , and both Mr Carson and Mr Lokkegaard independently confirmed that reverse DNS lookups were not always reliable .
Consequently , the Court finds that MJW - 17 , and the affidavit of Mr Williams attaching it , are unreliable and the Court will not rely on them .
It does not appear that the applicants chose to make any particular submissions in closing in relation to MJW - 17 and the corresponding affidavit .
The iiNet subscriber accounts
During the course of the discovery process the applicants sought information concerning some subscribers of the respondent to enable the information relating to those accounts to be matched with the DtecNet evidence .
On 15 June 2009 the Court made an order allowing the applicants to select a number of IP addresses and times as logged by the DtecNet Agent in its investigations , as well as some identified by Mr Herps and Mr Fraser from their investigations .
This data was then provided to the respondent who examined the IP addresses and times provided in order to identify from them 20 unique subscriber accounts .
This process of matching IP address and time to a subscriber account is one of the key evidentiary issues in these proceedings , and it is dealt with in relation to the Telco Act defence in Part E2 of this judgment .
ISPs generally keep records of those IP addresses that are associated with subscriber accounts at any given time .
Thus , by knowing an IP address and time , a link can be made to a subscriber account , thereby identifying the account subscriber .
As it transpired , 45 IP addresses and times were needed to generate 20 unique subscriber accounts .
This resulted from the fact that some IP addresses and times related to the same subscriber accounts ( remembering that as IP addresses are assigned dynamically it is possible for one subscriber account to have multiple IP addresses over time ) .
These subscriber accounts ( the ‘ RC - 20 accounts ’ ) are the most specific evidence of copyright infringement by iiNet users in these proceedings .
In relation to each account , for the period from 1 July 2008 , the respondent provided evidence of the allocation of IP addresses , login / logout details , time spent online and disconnection reasons .
The respondent also provided all correspondence between the respondent and those subscriber accounts from 1 July 2008 to August 2009 .
The Court ordered that any personal information related to these accounts be redacted , such that it was impossible to link the data to any particular persons during these proceedings .
The Court considered that it was appropriate for such information to remain confidential given that the subscribers of those accounts were not parties to these proceedings .
As already discussed , this evidence has been compared with the DtecNet evidence in MJW - 10 to create a list of alleged infringements occurring on those accounts .
Specific factual issues arising from such evidence will be addressed from time to time throughout the judgment .
Studio witnesses
Each of the applicants have called witnesses ( ‘ studio witnesses ’ ) to confirm matters such as their ownership or exclusive licence of the identified films , the subsistence of copyright in such films and the absence of licence to any iiNet users to do the acts comprised in the copyright of the films .
Mr Phillipson testified for Village Roadshow and its related companies .
Mr Wheeler testified for 20 th Century Fox and related companies .
Mr Perry provided evidence regarding Paramount and its associated or related companies .
Ms Solmon provided evidence regarding Columbia Pictures and related companies .
Ms Reed provided evidence regarding Disney and its affiliated companies .
Ms Garver testified on behalf of Universal and its numerous associated companies .
Mr Kaplan testified for Warner Bros and related entities .
The studio witnesses were forthright in their evidence , and the Court found them to be reliable witnesses .
The primary controversy arising during their cross-examination was their ability to provide evidence upon the question whether the AFACT investigators , Mr Herps and Mr Fraser , were licensed by the applicants to download the applicants ’ films using their iiNet accounts .
As will be apparent from the Court ’s discussion in Part D of this judgment , though the Court finds the studio witnesses to be reliable , their evidence is not necessarily conclusive on this issue .
Respondent ’s witness – Michael Martin Malone
Mr Malone is the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the respondent .
His key responsibilities are related to customer service ; the financial performance of the respondent ; business planning and strategy ; and corporate governance .
The undertaking of the respondent is substantial .
As indicated , there are approximately 490,000 subscribers subscribing to the respondent and related entities , making it the third largest ISP in Australia .
It operates call centres in Perth , Sydney , Auckland and Cape Town .
There are approximately 600 customer service representatives in the respondent ’s employ .
Mr Malone provided extensive evidence which will be referred to from time to time throughout the judgment .
A key issue for present purposes is his credit as a witness .
Findings as to the credit of Mr Malone
The applicants have mounted a vigorous challenge to the credibility of Mr Malone , asserting that he was neither a truthful nor reliable witness .
It has been submitted that the Court should not rely on his evidence except where it is against his interests or it is independently corroborated .
It is submitted that Mr Malone was determined to advocate the respondent ’s cause at every opportunity and where he sensed a conflict between that cause and the truth , he was prepared to subordinate the latter in favour of the former .
The Court rejects the attack on the credit of Mr Malone .
Mr Malone was an impressive witness who remained consistent ( for the most part ) in the evidence he gave during three days of gruelling and unnecessarily hostile cross-examination .
The specific submissions made by the applicants will be addressed below .
However , even in the circumstance that the Court finds against Mr Malone in relation to certain evidence he provided on specific issues , such findings do not lead the Court to make a generalised finding that he was an unreliable witness .
In so far as it is alleged that Mr Malone found it impossible to disassociate himself from the respondent ’s ‘ cause ’ , such a generalised allegation cannot be sustained .
Certainly Mr Malone gave evidence supportive of the respondent ’s position and this position was at odds with the applicants ’ position , but the Court is not able to infer that in providing those answers they were not provided honestly , nor that they were necessarily wrong .
Mr Malone ’s demeanour was of someone who believed what he was saying without reservation .
Whether Mr Malone ’s beliefs in relation to the law and the respondent ’s legal obligations were accurate is a distinct matter from whether he provided evidence of that which he honestly believed .
Mr Malone may not have been a helpful witness to the applicants ’ counsel , but that did not render Mr Malone an unhelpful witness to the Court .
Mr Malone was oc

AUSTRALIAN OPEN FINAL - Murray v Federer
Venue : Melbourne Park Date / time : 0830 GMT , Sun 31 January
BBC coverage : Live on BBC One , HD , BBC Sport website and BBC Radio 5 live Murray turned the match around with one inspirational winner
By Piers Newbery
Andy Murray reached the second Grand Slam final of his career after recovering from a slow start to beat Marin Cilic at the Australian Open .
The Briton , 22 , came through 3 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 4 6 - 2 in three hours and one minute .
And Murray , who reached the 2008 US Open final , is again just one victory from ending Britain 's 74 - year wait for a male Grand Slam singles champion .
In Sunday 's final he will play the winner of Friday 's second semi between Roger Federer and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga .
After the electric atmosphere of the Scot 's quarter - final win over defending champion Rafael Nadal on Tuesday , the semi-final began in an altogether more low - key mood .
But after dropping the first set Murray stopped Cilic in his tracks with an incredible winner to break in the second , before taking a grip on the match with his returns and dominating from the baseline .
He made it so tough for me and he was so clearly tired after his hard week .
After losing the first set I just went for my shots
Andy Murray Murray went into the match with the edge in experience , having already played major semi-finals in New York and at Wimbledon , while the 21 - year - old Cilic was making his debut on such a stage .
The Scot also had a 3 - 1 head - to - head record against the Croat , but their last meeting remained fresh in the memory as Cilic had swept to a straight - sets win at Flushing Meadows last year .
But Murray has been in spectacular form in Melbourne , making the last four without dropping a set , while Cilic had needed five sets to win three of his matches .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , the 6ft 6in number 14 seed made the slower start and did well to fend off two break points in his opening service game , the second with a deft lob volley , but there were to be plenty more chances for both men .
Cilic looked to have let a golden opportunity slip by when a 0 - 40 lead disappeared at 2 - 2 but Murray finally cracked in a lengthy game , sending a forehand long on the fifth break point .

Crucially , the Croat managed to hold on when he faced similar pressure from Murray in his next service game , seeing off three break points - the last with a dead net cord .
Murray looked increasingly subdued as the minutes passed and he handed over the opening set by dropping serve again , this time to love .
When he finally angled away a forehand volley in game two of the second set it stopped a run of 14 straight points against the Briton .
Cilic was beginning to dominate on serve and Murray needed inspiration - he found it in spectacular fashion .
After working his way to break point at 2 - 2 the Scot seemed to have lost out to another Cilic net cord , but Murray chased it down , hared back to cover the subsequent lob , and spun round to hit a blistering forehand winner past his opponent at the net .
The tension of the previous 75 minutes disappeared with a lung - bursting scream and Murray had found his form , almost breaking again at 4 - 2 but seeing out the set on serve .
606 : DEBATE Murray appeared to have well and truly wrestled the initiative from his opponent when he moved ahead with a break at 2 - 1 in the third , only to see Cilic take it straight back with a forehand pass in the next game .
But after the lacklustre start to the match Murray was now making regular inroads with his return of serve , and Cilic could do nothing to prevent another break in game seven .
The world number four was moving his man around expertly with the backhand and , despite missing a couple of set points on the Cilic serve , he played a confident game to move two sets to one ahead .
Cilic was now approaching 21 hours on court for the tournament and he looked a tired man when a wild double - fault gave up another break at 2 - 1 in the fourth set , before Murray made all but sure with a forehand winner for the double - break soon after .
After just over three hours , the man from Dunblane fired an incredible running forehand on his way to serving out the match and becoming the first British man since John Lloyd in 1977 to reach the final in Australia .
" Marin showed incredible guts , he had played three five - setters here , " said Murray afterwards .
" He made it so tough for me and he was so clearly tired after his hard week .
" After losing the first set I just went for my shots . "
Murray must now wait to see if it is 10th seed Tsonga or 15 - time Grand Slam champion Federer that stands in the way on Sunday when he attempts to finally follow Fred Perry 's 1936 US Open triumph onto Britain 's roll of honour .

Caleb Charland is a Maine - based photographer who combines a love of scientific experiments and photographs into wonderful and amazing photographs .
If Isaac Newton or Benjamin Franklin were into photography , their photographs might look something like these :
“ Wooden Box with Horseshoe Magnet ”
“ Atomic Model ”
“ Demonstration with Hair Dryer and Aluminum Foil ”
“ Candle in a Vortex of Water ”
“ Fifteen Hours ”
Regarding his work , Charland tells us ,
Wonder is a state of mind somewhere between knowledge and uncertainty .
It is the basis of my practice and results in images that are simultaneously familiar and strange .
I utilize everyday objects and fundamental forces to illustrate experiences of wonder .
Each photograph begins with a simple question “ How would this look ?
Is that possible ?
What would happen if …? ” and develops through a sculptural process of experimentation .
As I explore the garage and search through the basement to solve these pictures , I find ways to exploit the mysterious qualities of these everyday objects and familiar materials .

A bizarre blowup between a professor and a student in a Portland State University classroom recently has sent ripples of concern and curiosity through the campus .
It also has prompted the student , openly accused by the professor of being an FBI informant and a killer , to hire a prominent local civil rights attorney , and led the university to launch an investigation into the educator .
The school has taken the unusual step of stripping the tenured professor of his teaching responsibilities while it conducts its inquiry .
Meanwhile , others at PSU are divided along two lines :
Those who think the professor did the right thing , if in an unorthodox way ; and those who think his actions were strange and out of line .
Some questions remain unanswered :
Why would a tenured professor choose to openly confront a student he viewed as dangerous ; and what does the situation mean for the student , who has not been charged with a crime , yet is said to have offered to teach others how to make Molotov cocktails and buy assault rifles .
Professor John
Hall has not taught on campus since Jan. 14 , when , during a comparative economics course , he accused a 30 - year - old student of being an FBI informant and threatened to place posters of him around campus .
Depending on the outcome of the internal inquiry , Hall could face a range of sanctions , including termination , said Scott Gallagher , communications director for PSU .
Gallagher did not know when the inquiry would be completed .
The Oregonian made several attempts to reach Hall , who has taught at the university for 25 years , but he did n't return messages .
However , Phil Lesch , executive director for the Portland State chapter of the American Association of University Professors , defended Hall and said by e-mail Friday that Hall had asked him to act as his spokesman .
The association is the union that represents faculty members .
PSU student Brett Condron , 20 , who is studying German , was in class that day .
He said about 40 students witnessed the confrontation between Hall and the student .
Condron said with about 30 minutes left in class , Hall made a dramatic announcement :
An FBI informant was enrolled in the class .
He talked about his experience with government informants in East Germany , then identified the student as Zach Bucharest .
Hall put a letter detailing his accusations on the overhead projector so the class could read it .
Condron said Hall then handed Bucharest a packet to give to " his superiors . "
" And then he proceeded to say a lot of unpleasant things about Bucharest , " Condron said .
For instance , he said , Hall called Bucharest a killer and said that he had the " spirit of Cain and the spirit of Judas . "
During the confrontation , Condron said , Hall snapped a digital photo of Bucharest and said that if " he ever saw him on campus again , he would plaster his photo and copies of his photos all over campus and tell everybody who he was . "
Condron said Bucharest was stoic and silent as Hall lashed out at him .
Afterward , Bucharest defended himself , then walked out .
The Oregonian tried to talk to Bucharest multiple times but his attorney , Elden Rosenthal , advised his client against talking to reporters .
In one of two statements Bucharest released through Rosenthal , the student said he has admired Hall and " cannot imagine what I did or said to cause him to treat me the way he did . "
Another student in Hall 's class is Daniel Dreier , a 26 - year - old economics major .
He was among those who had earlier become concerned about Bucharest 's behavior .
He said at a winter term Economics Department party in December , Bucharest told a campus activist how to make a particularly effective Molotov cocktail .
Dreier said Bucharest also offered to act as a middleman to help students buy military style rifles -- AR - 15s or AK - 47s -- through a gun dealer he knew in Washington and that he had access to machine guns .
In a second interview , Dreier said that Bucharest frequently told stories about confrontations involving guns and said that Bucharest had shown him a gun that he carries on campus .
Meanwhile , Lesch , the union representative , confirmed that Hall confronted Bucharest in front of the class , but did so solely out of concern for the safety of his students and the community .
Lesch said Hall 's actions came after other students went to Hall with concerns that Bucharest was trying to " create a cabal of students on campus oriented toward violence . "
" There were some students who ended up being very upset but there were also students who were grateful " to Hall for confronting Bucharest , Lesch said .
He said previously a group of eight students that Hall had been advising came to him with concerns about Bucharest .
They told Hall that Bucharest " was trying to get them interested in shooting and blowing things up -- all kinds of weapons , not just rifles , illegal weapons , " Lesch said .
" They were scared .
They had a close relationship with Professor Hall and they brought it to his attention . "
Asked why Hall did n't go to authorities with his concerns , Lesch said Hall had extensive experience with school bureaucracy and " did not feel like taking this to campus safety was the right way to go . "
Lesch added in an e-mail that in Hall 's years at PSU , " There have been a number of occasions where his personal safety has been threatened ...
Hall reported these incidents through proper channels at the time , but the university either did nothing to address his concerns or dismissed his reports outright .
University officials could not be reached late Friday for response to Hall 's perception of campus security .
" In addition , " Lesch said Friday in an e-mail , " several of Professor Hall 's students , in expressing their concerns about Bucharest , conveyed that Bucharest boasted on a number of occasions about a ' special ' relationship with campus public safety , which suggested that they might not take any complaint about him seriously . "
" Unfortunately , he ended up doing something that was very public and inflammatory and now his career is on the line , " Lesch said .
" He ended up doing this knowing he could face personal negative consequences .
He thought it was the most immediate way of resolving what he thought was a potential threat . "
Bucharest has been a PSU student since 2006 , and a member of student government since 2009 .
" Mr. Bucharest ... is not and never has been an FBI agent , or an FBI informant , " Rosenthal wrote in a statement to The Oregonian .
The FBI in Portland confirmed last month , then again Thursday , that Bucharest is not an informant for the bureau .
" The suggestion that Mr. Bucharest in any way has tried to incite violence , or illegal activity , is false , " Rosenthal wrote .
" The suggestion that Mr. Bucharest in any way has threatened any PSU student is false .
Mr. Bucharest is disheartened that Professor Hall 's union representative is making inflammatory public statements , rather than letting the PSU investigation run its course . "
In a previous statement through Rosenthal , Bucharest said , " I truly hope that the university will take steps to clear my name . "
Hall has fans among his students at the downtown university , among them 23 - year - old senior Allison Faris , who has spent five years as a college student in the United States and France .
" I would definitely classify him as one of the top five lecturers I 've ever had in a university setting , " said Faris , who is studying French and English .
" I 've never studied economics , and he actually made the subject accessible .
He contextualized it , and he made it just very fascinating . "

Best of Zorn : Faces
Here 's something I feel comfortable saying : I will never , as long as I live , cover another coach who makes as many funny faces during his press conferences as Jim Zorn .
Now , does the ability to make funny faces qualify one to serve as an NFL head coach ?
Heck no .
But it sure did keep things interesting around Redskins Park , and made me LOL on more than one occasion .
Joe Gibbs never made me LOL .
Then again , he went to the playoffs twice in four years .
Anyhow , I have no idea whether these are truly the Best of Zorn , but here are 14 faces I 'll never forget .

According to Morgan Stanley euro analyst Teun Draaisma , we 've got a little more rally left , and then a long , low multi- year grind as moneys starts to get tight .
The tightening phase may start in the next quarter
or two .
We believe investors need increasingly to
consider the implications of monetary and fiscal stimulus
withdrawal .
We expect the first Fed rate hike in
mid-2010 , but the tightening turning point could come
sooner , for instance through higher oil .
Our portfolio is
already quite well positioned for this next phase , and we
provide a ‘ tightening checklist ’ to decide when to
position fully for it .
The Fed language change ahead of
the first hike , or a market timing sell signal , would
indicate the start of that next phase , for us .
Lessons from past tightening cycles .
The start of
tightening phases tends to lead to some indigestion and
a defensive rotation in equity markets , for two quarters
or more .
The 1994 and 2004 episodes led to a 16 % and
8 % fall in MSCI Europe over eight and five months .
Sector performance was defensive , but Oil and
Materials outperformed , too .
In the aftermath of secular
bear markets tightening phases have been more severe ,
with equities falling on average 25 % over 13 months .

AS I WRITE THIS , I AM SITTING in a coffee shop in Northridge , looking out the window at the mountains in the distance .
My cell phone is on the table , next to my computer .
I mention this because , sitting here , I just had an epiphany .
It occurred to me that there is a direct connection between
My claim that my cell phone is sitting on the table in front of me , Newt Gingrich 's recent appearance on The Daily Show , The propaganda emails I 've been writing about most recently , Obama 's " lipstick on a pig " comment during his presidential campaign , Pictures of a Muslim child having his arm run over by car , and An April , 2009 , post I made about the values of the emerging spirituality .
I 'll begin with numbers one and six , and weave the others in as I go along .
The post was titled " Eight Values of the Emerging Spirituality " .
The main point was the difference between a spirituality that emerges naturally from human nature , and a spirituality imposed on human nature by ritual , tradition , and authoritarianism .
One of the values I mentioned there was " truth " , which is valued by a natural , human spirituality , as opposed to " Truth " ( with a capital T ) , which is valued by an authoritarian spirituality .
Capital T truth is whatever the accepted party line is — it changes from culture to culture , from religion to religion , and from party to party .
To " believe " it is simply to be loyal to your group .
Small t truth is much more modest , but also much more certain .
My cell phone is on the table in front of me — if you were here now you could check , and the fact that you are n't here now to check does n't change the fact that it is on the table .
All of modern science , the fact that this computer works , that your computer works , that you car runs and the heater in your home keeps you warm is based on small t truth .
Nevertheless , small t truth is under attack these days , from various groups .
The most obvious , and probably the least threatening , are people who do n't like it when small t truth contradicts their old - fashioned capital T Truth — creationists , for example , who would like science classes to please stop being honest with their kids about evolution .
Less obvious are some academics .
During the last presidential campaign , you may remember all the commotion over a comment Obama made about " lipstick on a pig " .
I wo n't rehearse the complete story .
( If you want to read it all , click here . )
Suffice it to say that the McCain Campaign tried to make the comment a big issue , claiming that he was insulting Sarah Palin .
I wrote a piece at the time , pointing out that all one had to do was watch what he actually said , in context , to know that there was n't the slightest way it could have been intended as an insult to Palin .
An academic friend of mine responded to my remarks by saying that I did n't understand that " truth is constructed " .
Well , in fact , a good part of my own doctoral dissertation was exactly on how truth gets constructed , and I wo n't bore you with a theoretical argument here , except to say that , yes , truth is constructed , and no , that does n't mean either that Obama was talking about Palin or that my phone is not sitting on the table in front of me — or that either claim is up for grabs .
I only mention my academic friend 's confusion , in fact , because I think such talk subtly contributes to a third line of attack on small t truth , this one from the media .
It 's very common for a reporter or commentator these days to say , about a matter of simple fact , that it " probably depends on who you ask " .
Well , yes .
The answer you get may well depend on who you ask , but the fact , if it 's a matter of small t truth , does n't .
And it 's the reporter 's job , not only to say so , but to actually put some effort into finding out what the small f fact is .
But all of this confusion , religious , academic , and in the media , is merely background static which makes possible something that is far more dangerous .
I 'll explain that next time ...
Sooner or later Wayne Rooney is going to exhaust the pot of superlatives .
The Manchester United striker has now scored 27 times this season after another night in which he demonstrated the ruthlessness in front of goal that has not always been evident throughout his career .
Two headed chances , two goals .
West Ham 's defence were as helpless as Milan 's had been at San Siro a week earlier and , in the process , Sir Alex Ferguson 's team shook the 3 - 1 defeat to Everton out of their system and moved back within a point of Chelsea at the top , albeit having played a game more .
Rio Ferdinand 's late withdrawal with a recurrence of his back problems on the night Nemanja Vidic , fit again , returned to the team , is a concern , as is an injury for the returning Anderson .
Otherwise this was a satisfying , business - like win for the champions , incorporating a substitute 's goal for Michael Owen two minutes after being introduced and more evidence that Rooney is surpassing Didier Drogba as the irresistible choice for player of the year .
The hardest part for Ferguson must be finding new ways to describe his leading scorer but he summed it up in his programme notes when he wrote " the hallmark of a truly great player is the ability to grab a game by the scruff of the neck " .
Even ignoring Rooney 's goals , this was another demonstration of a player wanting to makes things happen .
He was a constant menace , always looking for the ball , even having the audacityat one stage to clip the ball in the air and try a dipping volley from 30 yards .
The ball landed on the roof of the net and Old Trafford reverberated to the collective sigh of knowing how close it was to witnessing something truly special .
What can not be disputed is that this is the most prolific form Rooney has shown since he burst on to the scene as a 16 - year - old , the " assassin - faced baby " , at Everton .
Eight years on , he is more of a penalty - box player , sacrificing some of the roaming instincts that have driven Ferguson to distraction at times .
His positioning has improved , his appreciation of where the ball might come .
His repertoire now takes in a newly developed aerial threat and this is why Ferguson spoke of him becoming the " complete player " and " ready to join the distinguished band of Manchester United legends " .
The first goal came 38 minutes into a first half in which the first flutters of snow added to the kaleidoscope of colours on another night of green and gold anti-Glazer protests .
As the ball was worked upfield , starting with Nemanja Vidic in defence through to Park Ji-sung in midfield , Rooney was hanging on the line of West Ham 's defence .
Park picked out Dimitar Berbatov on the left , and Berbatov switched play with a cross- field ball to Antonio Valencia on the opposite flank .
The pass was slightly overhit and most footballers would have been content just to control the ball .
Valencia , though , had the confidence to volley it straight across the penalty area to where Rooney was loitering with intent .
It was a sublime piece of technique and vision and it would have been almost impudent for Rooney , with a stooping header , to miss .
Valencia 's role cannot be overstated for both goals .
It was another of his inviting crosses from which Rooney , again unchallenged , headed in the second 10 minutes after the interval .
It used to be said of Rooney that heading was one his weaknesses .
Not , however , on the evidence of the last week .
" Everything he touches is a goal , " Gianfranco Zola , West Ham 's manager , reflected wistfully .
Ferguson had made five changes from the side that lost to Everton .
This was Ben Foster 's first appearance since the end of November and Anderson was also brought back only to be forced off after 19 minutes .
The Brazilian made his way to the tunnel with such a pronounced limp it was difficult to imagine him playing any part in the Carling Cup final against Aston Villa on Sunday .
West Ham acquitted themselves well in the first half and Foster , described as " a bit anxious " by Ferguson , came a couple of inches away from one of his horror moments when he dropped Alessandro Diamanti 's deflected shot on to his goalline as it fell from the sky .
But there was a clear imbalance of talent and the home side will also reflect on Park striking the crossbar and the visiting goalkeeper , Robert Green , making a string of fine saves .
Typically , Rooney did not look too pleased when Ferguson brought him off with 12 minutes to go .
Owen replaced Berbatov at the same time and quickly set about reminding Old Trafford that he too still knows a thing or two about finishing .
Paul Scholes , who ­controlled midfield alongside Darron Gibson , provided the killer pass and Owen , inside the penalty area , curled his shot in off the post .
If you really want to piss people off , tell them what you believe about God .
Actually , if you want to have some real fun , take an obnoxious Catholic who thinks Vatican II was demonically inspired ( Say… Mel Gibson ? ) , an atheist whose life - long dream is to fellate Richard Dawkins , get them stinking drunk , and say , “ Hey , what about this God business , anyway ? ”
Then stand back and watch the brawl begin .
It ’ll make Wrestlemania look like a kindergarten slap fight .
And after the carnage ends and the paramedics have taped up the combatants , tell them their dirty little secret .
Actually , tell them as they ’re getting bailed out .
The Catholic fanatic does n’t really believe in God .
The atheist does n’t not believe in God .
They ’re fighting over something else .
For lack of a better term , I ’ll call it Zeus .
Zeus , if you ’ll recall , was the king of the Greek gods .
He sat on Mt. Olympus judging man , hurling lightning bolts , and banging nymphs and mortal skanks behind his wife ’s back .
Many people ’s view of him is the angry old man with a body builder ’s physique gazing down on humanity , ready to pounce .
Of course , he ’s been ( mercifully ) stripped of the dirty old man proclivities the ancient Greeks seemed to love about their gods .
Hey , kids , Zeus is not God .
A lot of descriptions of God come off that way because , hey , if there ’s an intelligence to the universe , it ’s going to be hard to wrap one ’s head around .
Even harder when you consider it ’s a big ass universe .
It ’s easier to say , “ Well , there ’s a man in the sky running everything . ”
So people stick Zeus , sanitized for your piety , in the picture to believe in .
Or not believe in .
They just call him “ God . ” Trouble is , Zeus and God are two incompatible ideas .
Over the centuries , that ’s generated some spectacular holy wars , terror campaigns , and obnoxious wannabe barroom intellectuals sniffing their own farts .
( “ Okay , okay !
You ’re an atheist !
Now shut up and drink your beer .
I ’m trying to watch the game . ” )
At least there are no Agnostic Witnesses , unsure why they ’re waking you up early on a Saturday morning .
But if you want to understand what is ( or is n’t ) you believe in , you need to put things in perspective .
That holy book or philosophical tome might have the wisdom you seek .
It might very well have been divinely inspired .
But it ’s got human fingerprints all over it .
( Yes , even the one you ’re reading . )
Read between the lines well .
It ’s probably saying something other than what you think .
For starters , it ’s probably telling you to quit being a judgmental ass hat .
God is neither male nor female or even a person in the conventional sense .
Generations past put up that idea simply because they could n’t quite wrap their collective heads around something that ’s not male or female or even a physical creature they ’ve seen or imagined .
Or they just dispensed with the idea altogether .
To paraphrase Douglass Adams , the universe is big !
Really big !
So , if you ’re going to believe in God , you need to understand you ’re dealing with something that would have to permeate every nook and cranny of the Universe .
And no , there are no mitichlorians involved .
George Lucas may have to burn in Hell for that one .
Or come back as a red shirt on the next incarnation of Star Trek .
So how , you may ask , can someone believe in evolution and the Big Bang and still have some sort of belief in God ?
Well , kids , as a writer , I ’m aware of this literary device called “ a metaphor . ”
If you take Creationism literally , you either have to toss out some glaring evidence to the contrary or say , “ Well , they ’re lying . ”
Yonder lies madness .
And a really impressive tourist attraction in Northern Kentucky I refuse to visit .
On the other hand , if you look at it ( and most other cosmologies ) as a metaphor , suddenly it all makes sense .
At the very least , you understand that Moses probably could n’t conceive of the idea of billions of years , let alone concepts like quarks , gluons , quantum entanglement , and the heat death of the Universe .
And forget about suggesting that great great grandpa ’s many - greats uncle was a mastadon - chasing chimpazoid .
( For starters , there were n’t any mastodons by the time of Rhamses ’ Egypt . )
Even if he could figure any of this out , remember , he was busy trying to corral a few hundred thousand shepherds into Ancient Palestine .
Try telling everyone in that crowd you ’re pulling over to stop and ask directions .
( “ But we ’re making good time ! ” “ Good time ?
It ’s been forty years , you idiot !
Unless one of you geniuses would like to invent the GPS ! ” )
Now try explaining natural selection , the Big Bang , and the speed of light to them .
Not happening .
Not until they find a parking place so they can sit down and ponder things weightier than “ Watch where you step .
Zebulun ’s sheep are having a bad day . ”
“ What if I get all this and still do n’t believe ? ” Look , you ’re human .
If you look at the universe and say , “ There ’s no way that ’s the work of any divine presence , it ’s too big , ” knock yourself out .
Because guess what .
It ’s a big ass universe anyway .
If that ’s how you have to do the math , go work on your piece of the puzzle .
It ’s what this is all about , anyway .
So what if you do believe , and not only that , you believe literally ?
Many people do .
And they ’re the kindest , most generous people you ’ll ever meet .
But too many people claim to practice Christianity and swear the Bible is literal ( as do many Muslims with the Koran ) , and yet they talk about a vengeful , hateful God .
“ I want Old Testament ! ” I frequently hear , usually with righteous indignation over something that does not affect them in the least .
Funny , I never hear that from Jews , who get their spiritual guidance from that same Old Testament * .
On the other hand , I seldom hear the fire - and - brimstone crowd talking about Christ ’s compassion , his care for the poor and the sick , his generosity , or his greatest commandment , “ Do unto others as you would have them do unto you . ”
Probably too liberal and socialist for them , but there it is .
Deal with it .
You ’re human .
You ’re not smart enough to understand it all .
Hell , man started settling into towns and farming the land around 10,000 years ago , which is about when we started to think about this stuff .
We did n’t know the universe was a huge cloud of galaxies until the 1920 ’s , of which we are less than a speck .
What makes you think we ’ve got it all figured out now ?
We just opened up a whole new can of “ WTF ? ” Go , thou , and figure out some answers for yourself .
And if they differ from mine , well hopefully we reach one common conclusion :
Whether or not you believe , the most spiritual lesson you can take away from this is , “ Do n’t be a dick . ”
A very wise man once said that .
OK , so it was Wil Wheaton , but Wil ’s a smart guy .

Hey , Beavis !

Your rabbi is keeping the traditions of over four millennia when he reads it .
Pat ’s just looking for new reasons to judge people and squeeze the faithful for a few more bucks .
Somehow , he does n’t realize the whole message of that book is also “ Thou shalt not be a dick . ”
It ’s the oldest spiritual message in human history .

Most of the children questioned believed violence was often justified A study of schoolchildren has found that most of those questioned thought violence towards women was acceptable if there was a reason behind it .
The majority of the pupils said it was justified if the woman had an affair , or if she was late in making the tea .
The study by a researcher from Edinburgh Napier University also suggested that girls expect to curtail ambitions once they are married .
The research involved 89 primary seven children at five Glasgow primaries .
The 11 and 12 - year - olds were questioned in depth about their attitudes and aspirations towards gender roles and behaviour .
The children did n't agree with violence , but gave reasons to try to justify it if the woman had done something ' wrong ' .
Nancy Lombard
Edinburgh Napier University
They were asked to consider whether or not a man was justified in punching his partner when he found out she had had an affair .
Nearly all of the children thought that the woman deserved to be hit .
In another scenario , about 80 % of the children said a man had cause to slap his partner because she did not have the dinner ready on time .
Researcher Nancy Lombard described the findings as " worrying " because the youngsters had naturalised and normalised violent behaviour .
She said : " The children did n't agree with violence , but gave reasons to try to justify it if the woman had done something ' wrong ' .
" The old saying of ' If he pulls your pigtails it means he likes you ' , translates into violence in adulthood which girls accept as normal . "
Narrow expectations
The study also suggested that girls expected to modify their behaviour and narrow expectations once they were married and had children .
One of the girls said : " I want to be a dancer or a doctor . "
But she added : " When I grow up I 'm going to have two babies and work part - time in the shop down the road . "
Ms Lombard said that sexual stereotypes were limiting and modifying girls ' behaviour to accommodate boys and men .
She said : " All the girls said they do n't get much of the playground because the boys dominate the space .
" They are still told they can't play football because they are a girl . "
Ms Lombard called for work with children to start early to encourage respectful relationships , challenge violent behaviour and break down gender stereotypes .
The findings of the study will be presented at a conference in Glasgow on Wednesday which has been jointly organised between Scottish Women 's Aid and Napier University .
Edinburgh Women 's
Aid spokeswoman Suzanne Moran called for more education on violence towards women : " These findings , in effect , reflect that these attitudes are still widely held in Scotland .
" Studies like these reveal that there is still much to be done to eradicate ingrained beliefs that women are to blame for violence perpetrated against them . "

“ Do n’t make the perfect the enemy of the better , ” says the President and congressional insiders when confronted with the sorry spectacle of a health - care bill whose scope and ambition continue to shrink , and whose long - term costs to typical Americans continue to grow .
They ’re right , of course .
But by the same logic , neither the White House nor congressional Democrats will be able to celebrate the emerging legislation as a “ major overhaul ” or “ fundamental reform . ”
At best , it ’s likely to be a small overhaul containing incremental reforms .
Real reform has moved from a Medicare - like public option open to all , to a public option open to 6 million without employer coverage ( still in the House bill ) , to a public option open only to those same people in states that opt for it , or about 4 million ( the original Harry Reid version of the Senate bill ) , to no public option but expanded Medicare ( the Senate compromise ) to no expanded Medicare at all ( the deal with Joe “ I love all the attention ” Lieberman ) .
In other words , the private insurers are winning and the public is losing .
Pharmaceutical companies are winning as well .
On December 16 , proposals to allow US pharmacies and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from Europe and Canada were defeated in the Senate .
No matter that American consumers pay up to 55 % more for their prescription drugs than Canadians , or that the measure would have saved the government at least $ 19.4 billion over ten years ( according to the Congressional Budget Office ) .
Big Pharma ’s argument that the safety of such drugs could n’t be assured was belied by the defeat of another proposed amendment that would have allowed drug imports only if their safety and economic benefits were certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Service .
Doctors and hospitals are also winning .
More and more of the putative “ savings ” from health care reform ( “ savings ” should really be understood as projected costs that are under the wildly - escalating costs projected without such savings ) rely on constraints on future Medicare spending .
But the details of such constraints keep vanishing , while ever more of the messy work of coming up with them is assigned to a so - called Medical Advisory Board that will supposedly recommend them later on .
What no one wants to admit is that Congress never actually implements promised Medicare savings .
When crunch time comes , it caves in to the AMA and the AARP .
In a few years time , when boomers swell the ranks of seniors , and the political power of the AMA and AARP together rival that of Wall Street , the cave - ins will be boggling .
Meanwhile , opponents of abortion are winning , too .
Ben Nelson ( a Nebraska Democrat who enjoys being the spoiler even as much as Joe Lieberman ) held out for even more restrictions .
The political reality right now is that Harry Reid will do anything to get sixty votes — which means Lieberman , Nelson , and even Olympia Snowe are able to use extortion on behalf of Big Insurance , Big Pharma , the AMA , and abortion foes .
The President , meanwhile , remains eerily above the fray .
Having closed deals months ago with Big Insurance , Big Pharma , and the AMA — in order to get their support in exchange for guaranteeing them big profits — his only apparent interest is keeping the deals going while helping Reid corral sixty votes for just about anything .
( The deals have caused some awkwardness for the White House .
Drug importation would have cost Big Pharma far more than the $ 80 billion price tag it agreed to , forcing the White House to oppose importation even though the President had publicly supported it during his presidential campaign last year , and even though John McCain supported the amendment . )
Is the effort worth still worth it ?
Yes , but just .
Private insurers will have to take anyone , regardless of preconditions .
And some 30 million people who do n’t now have health insurance will get it .
But because Big Insurance , Big Pharma , and the AMA will come out way ahead , the legislation will cost taxpayers and premium - payers far more than it would otherwise .
Cost controls are inadequate ; in fact , they barely exist .
If Wall Street ’s top brass are “ fat cats , ” as the President described them last weekend , the top brass of Big Insurance , Big Pharma , and the AMA are even fatter .
While they do n’t earn as much , they ’re squeezing the public for even more .
We are slouching toward health - care reform that ’s better than nothing but far worse than we had imagined it would be .
Even those of us who have seen legislative sausage - making up close , even those of us who never make the perfect the enemy of the better , are concerned .
That two or three senators are able to extort as much as they have is appalling .
Why has n’t Reid forced much of the bill into reconciliation , requiring only 51 votes ?
Why has the President been so cowed ?
In all likelihood , the White House and the Dems eventually will get a bill they can call “ reform , ” but they will not be able to say with straight faces that the reform is a significant improvement over the terrible system we already have .

In her beguiling comic plots , Jane Austen often ridicules characters who fuss excessively about the state of their health .
The 19th - century novelist would therefore be perplexed – and perhaps amused – to discover that nearly 200 years after her death , the precise nature of her mysterious final illness has become a subject of enduring literary fascination .
Fresh , retrospective analysis of her symptoms , published today , suggests that the author of Pride and Prejudice may have died prematurely of tuberculosis caught from cattle .
Examination of Austen 's correspondence and the recollections of her family prove , it is claimed , that she was not , as previous medical experts hypothesised , a victim of Addison 's disease , a once - fatal hormone - disrupting condition .
With her book sales still buoyant and her fiction repackaged as popular television mini-series , Austen 's very private life still intrigues her modern readership , while physicians and biographers have been in dispute for the last 40 years about the precise cause of her death in 1817 .
Writing in the British Medical Journal 's Medical Humanities magazine , Katherine White , of the Addison 's disease self - help group , presents evidence aimed at exploding one of the more widely accepted medical theories of her demise .
" Jane Austen died at the age of 41 , leaving her seventh novel , Sanditon , unfinished , " White says .
" While she outlasted many of her peers in Regency England – she saw four of her sisters - in - law buried from childbirth complications – the cause of her death … remains tantalisingly open to posthumous speculation . "
In her youth and throughout most of her adult life , Austen enjoyed a relatively robust constitution .
While still a young teenager , she wrote her first satirical , comic novel , Love and Friendship , in which the protagonists are repeatedly mocked for their indulgent , emotional fainting fits .
Her mature works , Sense and Sensibility , Pride and Prejudice , Mansfield Park and Emma were all published anonymously – signed " By a Lady " – and appeared from 1811 onwards .
Austen 's last two works , Persuasion and Northanger Abbey , were released posthumously and were the first to identify her as the true author .
Austen travelled in May 1817 to Winchester to seek medical help but died in the Hampshire city two months later .
As one of the many literary websites dedicated to her life and works records : " Jane Austen died in the dawn of Friday 18 July 1817 , her head cradled on a pillow on Cassandra 's lap ; her sister had kept a vigil by her bedside for most of the night .
" Cassandra wrote afterwards : ' She was the sun of my life , the gilder of every pleasure , the soother of every sorrow .
I had not a thought concealed from her , and it is as if I had lost a part of myself . ' "
Jane Austen is buried in Winchester Cathedral .
White writes : " In 1964 , [ the surgeon Sir ] Zachary Cope proposed that tubercular Addison 's disease could explain her two - year deterioration into bed - ridden exhaustion , her unusual colouring , bilious attacks , rheumatic pains and the absence of more specific indicators of disease . "
By contrast , one of Austen 's most recent biographers , Claire Tomalin , suggested in 1997 that lymphoma ( cancer of the lymphatic system ) would be a better fit for the novelist 's reported symptoms .
Examining her symptoms , as described in the novelist 's letters ,
White agrees that Cope 's diagnosis of Addison 's disease could be correct , but notes : " Most patients with the disease experience mental confusion , generalised pain , weight loss and loss of appetite .
None of these symptoms appears in Miss Austen 's letters . "
Less than two months before her death , Austen wrote : " My head was always clear , and I had scarcely any pain . "
She even dictated 24 lines of comic verse from her sickbed to her sister in her last days .
Contemporary reports of Austen 's skin discolouration , White adds , may have referred to the dark circles under her eyes .
" Therefore , we can conclude that it is most likely she did not die from Addison's , " she writes .
" While lymphoma would be one possible cause of the exhaustion , recurrent fever , bilious attacks and rheumatic pains described by Austen , disseminated tuberculosis affecting the joints and liver – probably of bovine origin – would offer a simpler explanation for her symptoms .
" As to that troublesome skin colouring – black and white and every wrong colour – it was a Jane Austen fan who replied to Cope in 1964 suggesting that perhaps she simply meant the dark circles under the eyes that accompany illness .
Thus , it is likely that Cope 's hypothesis of infective tuberculosis as the source of her illness was at least partially correct , after all . "
Critic 's view
John Mullan Jane Austen 's characters are preoccupied with illness .
Mr Woodhouse shudders at every draught ; Mary Musgrove fancies herself ill whenever there is no good dance or dinner invitation ; Marianne Dashwood enacts an impressive psychosomatic illness when she is jilted by Willoughby .
It is no accident that Mr Perry , the apothecary in Emma , can afford a hugely expensive coach .
He has rich pickings among the local hypochondriacs .
But illness in Austen can also be quick and dangerous .
Everyone assumes Frank Churchill 's adoptive mother is always pretending to be ill – until she suddenly dies .
The vulnerability of flesh is taken for granted .
We laugh at Mrs Bennet for being so delighted when her daughter Jane 's illness keeps her at Netherfield , home of Mr Bingley .
But it is real alarm that sends her sister Elizabeth across the fields to nurse her .
Austen 's last completed novel , Persuasion , written when she herself was ailing , is a record of physical frailty .
Mrs Smith , Anne Elliot 's gossipy friend , is reduced by illness to an impoverished invalid .
Captain Harville 's sister Fanny has just died as has Dick Musgrove .
Austen makes illness the stuff of comedy , but only in the knowledge that every affliction might end in death .
John Mullan

Scientists announced today they have identified for the first time definitive variants associated with biological ageing in humans .
The team analyzed more than 500,000 genetic variations across the entire human genome to identify the variants which are located near a gene called TERC .
The study in Nature Genetics published today by researchers from the University of Leicester and King 's College London , working with University of Groningen in the Netherlands , was funded by The Wellcome Trust and the British Heart Foundation .
British Heart Foundation Professor of Cardiology at the University of Leicester Professor Nilesh Samani , of the Department of Cardiovascular Sciences , who co-led the project explained that there are two forms of ageing - chronological ageing i.e. how old you are in years and biological ageing whereby the cells of some individuals are older ( or younger ) than suggested by their actual age .
He said : " There is accumulating evidence that the risk of age - associated diseases including heart disease and some types of cancers are more closely related to biological rather than chronological age .
" What we studied are structures called telomeres which are parts of one 's chromosomes .
Individuals are born with telomeres of certain length and in many cells telomeres shorten as the cells divide and age .
Telomere length is therefore considered a marker of biological ageing .
" In this study what we found was that those individuals carrying a particular genetic variant had shorter telomeres i.e. looked biologically older .
Given the association of shorter telomeres with age - associated diseases , the finding raises the question whether individuals carrying the variant are at greater risk of developing such diseases "
Professor Tim Spector from King 's College London and director of the TwinsUK study , who co-led this project , added :
" The variants identified lies near a gene called TERC which is already known to play an important role in maintaining telomere length .
What our study suggests is that some people are genetically programmed to age at a faster rate .
The effect was quite considerable in those with the variant , equivalent to between 3 - 4 years of ' biological aging " as measured by telomere length loss .
Alternatively genetically susceptible people may age even faster when exposed to proven ' bad ' environments for telomeres like smoking , obesity or lack of exercise - and end up several years biologically older or succumbing to more age - related diseases . "

T.E. Braniff , founder of Braniff Airlines and friend to George H.W.Bush , was a member of the Knights Templar , an ancient Catholic anti-Islamic order , birthed during the Medieval Crusades .
Young Eric Prince worked in Bush elder 's White House .
His connections to the administration under which 9 - 11 happened , go back far and long and deep .
Russ Baker http://russbaker.com/ has been writing fearlessly about connections like this one in " Family of Secrets " .
Now , Michael Carmichael , has revealed more , in an article titled , " From Blackwater to Xe , the Templar Crusade Mercenary soldiers and security personnel for the US government " .
http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=16878
from the article :
" Erik Prince , the founder and owner of the now infamous US corporation , Blackwater , hails from Holland , Michigan where his family was both powerful and prominent in two institutions - ( 1 ) the Republican Party and ( 2 ) the evangelical Christian Church .
After scandals hit his large and lucrative firm , Prince ordered a curious rebranding that changed its name to Xe .
X is an archaic form of abbreviation for Christ and / or Christian that was derived from the cross and the Greek Alphabet .
X or Chi is the Greek letter that is the initial of " Christos " - X - which at the same time served as a symbol for the cross .
Sometimes written Chi-Rho , ( Xp ) is another abbreviation for Christos and his followers , the Christians .
From the perspective of medieval Christian symbology , ' Xe ' is a combination of the Christic cross and the Greek letter , Epsilon , the first letter in the Greek word , Evangelion , glad tidings or gospel .
From the perspective of a modern member of the Knights Templar , Xe is immediately recognizable as it symbolizes Christian Evangelism . "
A thorough diagnosis of secrecy is needed to understand how a small group of well funded and highly connected individuals could function with deadly resolve , within the highest levels of the US government .

NASA 's WISE Eye Spies First Glimpse of the Starry Sky
Infrared all - sky surveying telescope sends back first images from space .
PASADENA , Calif. -- NASA 's Wide - field Infrared Survey Explorer , or WISE , has captured its first look at the starry sky that it will soon begin surveying in infrared light .
Launched on Dec. 14 , WISE will scan the entire sky for millions of hidden objects , including asteroids , " failed " stars and powerful galaxies .
WISE data will serve as navigation charts for other missions , such as NASA 's Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes , pointing them to the most interesting targets the mission finds .
A new WISE infrared image was taken shortly after the space telescope 's cover was removed , exposing the instrument 's detectors to starlight for the first time .
The picture shows about 3,000 stars in the Carina constellation and can be viewed online at http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/multimedia/wise20100106.html .
The image covers a patch of sky about three times larger than the full moon , and was presented today at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington .
The patch was selected because it does not contain any unusually bright objects , which could damage instrument detectors if observed for too long .
The picture was taken while the spacecraft was staring at a fixed patch of sky and is being used to calibrate the spacecraft 's pointing system .
When the WISE survey begins , the spacecraft will scan the sky continuously as it circles the globe , while an internal scan mirror counteracts its motion .
This allows WISE to take " freeze - frame " snapshots every 11 seconds , resulting in millions of images of the entire sky .
" Right now , we are busy matching the rate of the scan mirror to the rate of the spacecraft , so we will capture sharp pictures as our telescope sweeps across the sky , " said William Irace , the mission 's project manager at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
To sense the infrared glow of stars and galaxies , the WISE spacecraft cannot give off any detectable infrared light of its own .
This is accomplished by chilling the telescope and detectors to ultra-cold temperatures .
The coldest of WISE 's detectors will operate at less than 8 Kelvin , or minus 445 degrees Fahrenheit .
The first sky survey will be complete in six months , followed by a second scan of one - half of the sky lasting three months .
The mission ends when the frozen hydrogen that keeps the instrument cold evaporates away , an event expected to occur in October 2010 .
Preliminary survey images are expected to be released six months later , in April 2011 , with the final atlas and catalog coming 11 months later , in March 2012 .
Selected images will be released to the public beginning in February 2010 .
JPL manages WISE for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate in Washington .
The mission was competitively selected under NASA 's Explorers Program , managed by NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md . The science instrument was built by the Space Dynamics Laboratory in Logan , Utah , and the spacecraft was built by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. in Boulder , Colo .
Science operations and data processing take place at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .

Many California lawyers have told me of rumors that Judge Vaughn Walker , who is hearing Perry v. Schwarzenegger , is gay , but so discreet that there was no substantiation of it .
Now the SF Chronicle has published an article discussing this " biggest open secret " of the case .
I had worried that the Prop 8 defenders would wait until some critical moment in the litigation - perhaps on appeal - and then pop this news as a basis for undercutting Judge Walker 's decision , if it turns out to favor the plaintiffs .
In my view , it 's good news that Judge Walker 's sexual orientation is now public ( even if still not really substantiated ) .
I wonder , in fact , if the plaintiffs ' lawyers facilitated the Chronicle 's report .
The reporters of course contacted defendants ' lawyers for comment , and received this response from Andy Pugno , counsel for the Yes on 8 team :
" We are not going to say anything about that , " Pugno said .
He was quick to assert , however , that Prop. 8 backers have n't gotten a fair shake from Walker in court .
He cited both the judge 's order for the campaign to turn over thousands of pages of internal memos to the other side and Walker 's decision to allow the trial to be broadcast - both of which were overturned by higher courts .
" In many ways , the sponsors of Prop. 8 have been put at significant disadvantage throughout the case , " Pugno said .
" Regardless of the reason for it . "

Iâ€™ve followed the issue of Climategate with great interest , as it has seemed that the issue has mirrored events in the field of domestic violence and partner abuse .
Abusegate also occurred due to money , political power , and careers at stake .
Where Abusegate is concerned , however , there is one more element â€ “ the life or death of feminism , and its determination to liberate women from the so - called â€œoppressionâ€ of marriage and family .
The story of Abusegate is as much about the attempt by feminists to obscure their real intentions as it is about feminist attempts to conceal the reality of partner abuse , in order to claim the issue as their own , and possibly the only issue available at the time to keep this essentially destructive philosophy alive .
As Joanne Nova , [ 1 ]
Australian science writer has said , â€ œScience has come full - circle , taking a page from the medieval Church by using fear and persecution to silence skeptics .
The oppressed have become the oppressors .
Given that most professional scientific bodies and peer - reviewed journals have been active accomplices in this scandal , one wonders how many other so called scientific consensuses have been similarly engineered and waiting for their own ClimateGates before truth is known.â€ 
That quote is important because it addresses the politicization of science and research .
Dean Esmay , the owner of Deanâ€™s World , [ 2 ] where I blog occasionally as part of a group , has often commented that politics and science donâ€™t mix .
While I havenâ€™t been in the field of research myself , itâ€™s fairly well - known that going after grants and funding has become a difficult process , often fraught with politics and cronyism .
What feminism is supposed to be about is the definition provided by Merriam - Webster .
1 : the theory of the political , economic , and social equality of the sexes
2 : organized activity on behalf of women 's rights and interests
This is a current popular definition , however , and has little to do with the goals of feminism , which has its roots not only in Marxist ideals , but also in anti-male hatred and a desire for power and control over society where it is most beneficial to feminists themselves .
According to [ 4 ]
Erin Pizzey : â€ œThere never was a feminist movement .
A bunch of disenchanted women refused to support their left wing men who were fighting capitalism .
They changed the goal posts and said capitalism was no longer the battle ground it was now ' Patriarchy ' and declared war on all men and the family .â€ 
In the 1970s , and into the 1980s , feminism was still an emerging movement .
Except for the halls of academia , which began to offer â€œwomenâ€™s studiesâ€ courses , and a few academicians pushing â€œfeminist law , â€  and â€œfeminist psychology , â€ the general public had little interest in a movement that was so clearly designed to create antipathy between not only the sexes , but between career women and those choosing more - traditional paths for themselves .
It was about the same time that the issue of partner abuse began to emerge as an issue on the public radar .
In 1971 , Erin Pizzey founded the first shelter for abused women in the UK .
There were also a few shelters for women developing independently in various places in the US .
This did not escape the attention of the zealots of the feminist faith and other opportunistic women .
Surely there was profit and power to be gained in promoting this cause .
According to the [ 4 ]
Herstory of domestic violence , â€ œIn the 1970s â€ ˜We will not be beatenâ€™ becomes the mantra of women across the country organizing to end domestic violence .
A grassroots organizing effort begins , transforming public consciousness and women 's lives .
The common belief within the movement is that women face brutality from their husbands and indifference from social institutions.â€ 
A theory regarding abuse was formulated , relying almost entirely on feminist supposition and the input from self - identified abused women .
There has never been any kind of formal research or investigation of the feminist theory of abuse ; it has simply been presented as a fait accompli and seldom , if ever , questioned .
A look through the â€œHerstory , â€ ( on the Minnesota Center Against Violence and Abuse website , funded by your tax dollars ) reveals a stunning lack of mention of research of any kind behind the feminist concept of domestic violence .
-- Del Martin [ 5 ] a lesbian activist , wrote one of the earliest works on the issue in 1976 .
She says , â€ œAt the outset I was told I had to produce extensive and verifiable statistics on the incidence of violence against womenâ€ ¦I concluded that incidence and incidents of violence in the home reached into the millions .
My editor deleted my estimate on the grounds that I couldnâ€™t prove it .
Since then , academia has confirmed my virtual estimate and admitted that lacking uniformity in the way data are accumulated makes it impossible to provide actual statistics.â€ 
-- Lenore Walker [ 6 ] author of " The Battered Woman " â€ œWhen I first began my study of the psychological impact of domestic violence on the battered woman , it was the mid 1970s and the feminist movement had a negative reaction to anything that came with a clinical psychology labelâ€¦â€ 
-- Ellen Pence Duluth [ 7 ]
Domestic Abuse Intervention Project â€ œMany things that we did were new and groundbreaking .
We introduced the power and control wheel and its accompanying theoretical framework , which tried to shift away from seeing violence against women as the problem of a few psychologically distorted men and lots of bad marriages , by linking menâ€™s violence toward their partners to other forms of dominationâ€ ” class , race , gender , and colonization .
We built on the work of previous projects that held individual agencies responsible to protect women and proposed a fairly bold notion of linking agencies together and forming a community - based advocacy program.â€ 
This is probably the most astonishing fact of Abusegate : While Climategate has at least some basis in research and scientific theory , there is none whatsoever behind the myriad programs and laws established since the 1970s by the so - called , â€ œBattered Womenâ€™s Movement.â€ 
Even the term itself was created for its impact by feminists whose goals had very little to do with providing aid for women .
As radical activist Susan Schecter [ 8 ] said , " I believe it is most urgent for this movement 's future to declare that violence against women is a political problem , a question of power and domination , and not an individual , pathological , or deviant one .
Continuing to make violence against women public is itself a crucial continuing task .
We also must become a movement led by battered women , women of color , and working class women .
We must develop a progressive agenda , a long range vision of what kind of society is needed so that violence against women would not exist , and to ally with groups sharing a vision of a just society "
This statement appears on the main page of the website for the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence , [ 9 ] also funded by your tax dollars .
Since the early days of the Battered Womenâ€™s Movement , nearly everything that has come after has been based on feminist principles devised out of thin air .
Even today , in the US there is no standard definition of what domestic violence is or is not .
Yet thousands of men are incarcerated , families destroyed , and women and children thrown into a permanent condition of life in turmoil because of nothing but the aberrant personal beliefs of a few women a generation ago .
While the feminists of the 20th Century are dying off or retiring , their ugly legacy of opportunism remains .
Legions of divorce lawyers , shelter advocates , and organizations providing feminist education all benefit from the multi-billion dollar industry that now forms the basis of societyâ€™s approach to partner abuse .
The real tragedy of Abusegate is that victims of genuine partner abuse are still left without hope and support .
They have been doubly victimized by a society that has been too willing to accept answers without first considering the problem .
Trudy W. Schuett has advocated for unserved victims of partner abuse since 2000 .

Police fired teargas in clashes with demonstrators in central Athens today after more than 30,000 people took to the streets to protest against austerity measures aimed at reducing Greece public debt .
Riot police confronted violent protesters who hurled rocks , red paint and plastic bottles near the parliament building in sporadic clashes after a largely peaceful rally of disgruntled workers .
" A group of 50 youths tried to storm the university building and riot police fired teargas to stop them , " a police official told Reuters .
At least two protesters were arrested .
Earlier , thousands of public and private sector workers marched through the streets under the slogan " people and their needs above markets " .
The march was part of a general strike that prompted all flights to and from Greek airports to be cancelled and caused public transport to grind to a near - standstill , with most trains and ferries standing idle .
Schools , tax offices and council buildings remain closed , while public hospitals are using emergency staff .
The country 's two largest trade unions oppose a wave of EU - backed spending cuts announced over the past weeks to reduce the budget deficit and help the country out of financial crisis .
It follows similar protests earlier this month , but this time private sector unions are also involved .
Television pictures showed a noisy crowd of tens of thousands of people marching through the streets of Athens , including many carrying union banners and anti-capitalist placards .
One of those protesting , civil servant Michalis Koroleos , told Reuters : " I am striking against the wage cuts , I am striking because others stole the money and we are the ones who are going to pay .
They are cutting my allowances and I have two children to raise – it is difficult . "
The protesters are angry at a public wage freeze , tax rises and the raising of the retirement age .
The strike coincides with a visit by officials from the European commission , the European Central Bank and the IMF to assess the success of such measures in cutting Greece 's double - digit deficit .
European finance ministers have warned that tougher austerity measures may have to be taken if progress is deemed insufficient .
Yesterday the credit agency Fitch downgraded the ratings of Greece 's four largest banks a notch from BBB + to BBB .
Earlier today the Greek government admitted manipulating its finances to mask its debt before it entered the Eurozone .
" You simply put some amounts of money in the next year .
It is what everybody did and Greece did it to a lesser extent than Italy , for example , " Greece 's deputy prime minister , Theodoros Pangalos , told the BBC's World Service .
He also suggested that Germany had an obligation to bail out Greece because of its occupation of the country during the second world war and because it stole Greek gold during the war .
" They took away the Greek gold that was at the Bank of Greece , they took away the Greek money and they never gave it back .
This is an issue that has to be faced sometime in the future , " he said .

Can Life Prevail ?
by Pentti Linkola
200 pages , Integral Tradition , $ 25
Very rarely does a book make you feel good about receiving bad news .
Usually , there ’s something you fear so much that you want anything but to face it .
But if someone is able to explain in clear steps what you must do to face it , and how the other side is indeed brighter , it lessens the burden .
With decreased resistance and doubt comes greater effectiveness , and you may emerge with more triumph than suspected possible .
Can Life Prevail ?
is one such book .
Since I was old enough to walk and perceive , it has been clear to me that something is very wrong with our world .
Our adults are not focused on the task of living , but on the task of managing their self - image .
Consequently , they ignore stupidities great and small .
From the dumbness of school to the boredom and fear inherent to the workplace , to the poor design of everyday objects , to the inanity of our public culture and the transparency of our politicians ’ lies , adults are oblivious .
They are easy to deceive and are so distracted they are “ shocked and amazed ” any time their children have sex or take drugs , their politicians cheat them , corruption is found to be rife , etc .
In short , our civilization is a ship with no one at the helm .
Most disturbing is our effect on the environment ; we can get more humans if we screw them up , but we ’re short on extra earths .
Unlike most environmentalists , Pentti Linkola does not try to talk to us through the filter of denial and distraction .
Instead , he levels with us as a Machiavellian scientist would : each additional person takes up space our nature needs , we have too many people , most are thoughtless oafs who destroy eternally beautiful things for temporary cash , and our modern laziness arises from the ease with which we interact with life through machines .
In this collection of provocative essays , Linkola targets every sacred cow with an even - handed but unequivocal whittling down of our resistance to the obvious : our species is out of control and needs pruning , and the problem is too many individuals of low intelligence and character .
Unlike most “ environmentalist ” books , this is not a hand - wringing or maudlin work ; it is forthright , assertive , strong and also very funny as Linkola probes the ostensible logic behind our decisions and contrasts it with his observations from many years in the field as an observer of birds , fish and trees .
Linkola asserts a number of worthy points :
Habitat loss is more destructive than pollution ;
Climate change is a vile problem resulting from lack of woodlands ;
We can fix climate irregularities by re-planting forests we killed ;
Domesticated animals destroy wild species ;
Most people are careless and unable to be stewards to nature ;
Democracy will not limit the selfish actions of individuals ;
Human overpopulation is the driving factor behind habitat loss ;
We are too distanced from nature , even the gross aspects ;
Our machine - oriented mentality makes us lazy and weak .
At his best , Linkola is half scientist and half satirist , always nudging us back to a level of reality .
If nature were a machine , he seems to say , we ’d pay attention to signs of its decline .
But it ’s too complex for our point - to - point modern mentality , so instead we space out and hope for the best .
Each of these essays picks an intriguing angle to its topic and explains it through a clear example , usually backing up observations with factual data from ornithology or the experience of a fisherman .
As stated above , it gives hope by giving us a clear analysis of the problem that is n’t mired in ulterior motives or the greatest ulterior motive of all , “ do n’t rock the boat . ”
Where most green books offer you what ’s basically a shopping guide for “ green ” products , Linkola goes further — not only by realizing that consumerism and environmentalism are incompatible , even if that consumerism is of a “ green ” kind , but by striking against our preference for all things human .
He makes the point many times that we only consider human emotions and thoughts , and do not stop to observe our world .
If it were named Steve and talked with a lisp , we ’d respect it as equal .
But outside the anthrosphere , nothing gains equality to us brave equal humans .
He brushes by the question of our reactions to , or judgments of , his ideas .
Like a researcher he gives us the data and recommendations , and leaves it to us to react in private and then realize our reactions have nothing to do with nature ; as history shows us , only what is effective matters .
All of our fond notions and egalitarian sentiments , politics and politeness , feelings and validations are entirely irrelevant .
What works matters .
What is not part of that process is irrelevant and forgotten by time .
I find this very comforting because our world normally has a stop - start rhythm where a new concept is uncovered and then we must all wait for the inevitable simian panic , outbursts and finally grudging admittance .
This part of our monkey heritage disgusts me the most .
There is none of it in Linkola .
It is like reading a lab report on the fauna of the North Atlantic .
It ’s unusual to see humans treated like the other subjects we write about , but comforting in that it is purely logical .
There are parts of this book where I cannot get onboard the Linkola train .
It ’s hard to tell when he is provocateur and when he is prescribing a medication of lucid sanity , but in most cases , he seems to be serious and it ’s hard to disagree .
It shocks the average human when he rails on housecats as killers of birds , but when we think back on our own experience , we ’ve all seen stray cats slaughter wrens by the bushel .
I can handle that , and the idea of being less squeamish about day - old fish , but during the last few pieces , Linkola outlines more of his ideal for a society and it falls short .
Primitivism is a neat idea on paper and would solve the problem , but lose so much of what makes us vital .
Unlike Linkola , I can not blame our machines for the fact that most people are thoughtless , destructive , short - sighted and corrupt .
I think we need to realize that we like the wrens are biological creatures and just do as our instincts instruct .
Perhaps another future thinker will suggest that those humans who do not have such frailties should prevail , and the others quietly go away , but Linkola stops short of calling for world eugenics on that scale .
Most importantly , Linkola says what so many of us think in private moments .
There are too many of us , and too many idiots .
If we keep growing we ’ll kill everything .
People sacrifice nature for short - term profit .
Because most voters are idiots , we cannot control this process .
The instant we try something constructive , a corrupt person will buy a few hundred thousand dollars of TV time and use it to sway the masses of useful idiots to do his bidding .
As a result , our current civilization is like a speeding car with no brakes .
We ’re out of control and cannot stop .
As we accept this , day after day , it kills us a little inside .
Linkola is the antidote who removes our false pretense and the emotional manipulation of our fellow citizens , giving us instead a clear path to victory that true , must rocket through taboo and the herd fear of a mass of humans whose average IQ is barely 100 , but nonetheless can be achieved if cooler minds prevail — and are willing to as relentlessly manipulate the masses as their ideological opposites .

Schmidts North , as some are calling the new development , will be arranged so that all five sides of the irregularly shaped block are lined with buildings and active ground floor uses .
The edges will start low , in deference to neighboring rowhouses , and build up to a height of 26 stories on the site 's southern edge , next to Blatstein 's Piazza at Schmidts development .
A one - acre landscaped park will eventually tie Blatstein 's Liberty Walk , and his egg - shaped office tower at Germantown Avenue , into the future development .
Last year Lucidlogix came to us with a rather amazing claim : we can do multi-GPU better than the guys who make the video cards in the first place .
Through their Hydra technology , Lucid could intercept OpenGL and DirectX API calls , redistribute objects to multiple video cards , and then combine the results into a single video frame .
This could be done with dissimilar cards from the same company , even different companies altogether .
It would be multi-GPU rendering , but not as you currently know it .
That was in August of 2008 , when the company was first showcasing its technologies in hopes of finding a suitor .
In 2009 they found that suitor in MSI , who are anchoring their new high - end Big Bang line of motherboards with the Hydra .
After some bumps along the way , Lucid and MSI are finally ready to launch the first Hydra - equipped board : The Big Bang Fuzion .
We ’ve had the Fuzion in our hands for over a month now , as the hardware has been ready well ahead of the software .
Lucid has been continuing to develop the software side , and the two parties are finally ready to sign off on the finished product , although Hydra is still very much a work in progress .
The Big Bang Trinergy , the Fuzion 's identical twin
As we ’re currently in Las Vegas for CES ( where MSI is launching the Fuzion ) , today we ’ll be taking a quick look at the performance and compatibility of the Hydra , to answer the most burning of questions about the technology .
Once we ’re back from CES , we will be following that up with an in - depth look at image quality , edge cases , and other deeper issues .
We ’ve only had the newest drivers for a few days now , so we have n’t had a chance to give it a complete workover .
Finally , this is just a look at the Hydra technology itself .
We ’ll have a separate review of the Fuzion board as a motherboard at a later time .
However it ’s virtually identical to MSI ’s other Big Bang board , the NVIDIA NF200 - equipped Trinergy .
The only significant difference between the boards is that the Fuzion has the Hydra chip , while the Trinergy has the NF200 .
With that out of the way , let ’s get started .
The Obama administration today will unveil a revamped strategy to ramp up the nation ’s use of biofuel in hopes of fixing a government effort that officials admit has fallen short in its attempts to wean cars and trucks away from fossil fuels and move toward ethanol , biodiesel and other crop - based fuels .
The new strategy , which the president will outline in an afternoon meeting with Cabinet secretaries and his top energy advisor , seeks to put the United States on track to produce 36 billion gallons of biofuels by 2022 -- the amount mandated by Congress in the 2007 energy bill .
The nation currently produces about 12 billion gallons , mostly from corn ethanol , and the federal government projects the country will not meet the 2022 goal .
White House officials say biofuel production has been hampered by a chill in private lending due to the financial crisis , by the lack of an “ explicit ” government management plan for biofuels and by a variety of issues in the cultivation and delivery to market of such fuels .
To meet the 2022 target , the White House stated in a fact sheet today , “ We will need a more strategic approach that in a new way unleashes the creativity and skills of people in government , in college laboratories , in the garages of aspiring entrepreneurs , and in the R&D facilities of the private sector .
...
We will have work in a new way and set much more aggressive internal benchmarks for progress . ”
Under the new approach , federal agencies will start from the 2022 goal and work backward , setting milestones for progress to ensure the effort is on track .
Agencies such as the Agriculture and Energy departments will coordinate their research , particularly on second - and third - generation fuels that are far more energy efficient than corn ethanol and , ultimately , would be able to replace gasoline in cars with no modification to existing fuel systems .
The agencies also will work to build regional supply chains to ensure that all parts of the country can use biofuels and to make sure that new fuels “ are compatible with the U.S. transportation fuel infrastructure . ”
The White House plans to pitch the effort as a job - creator in rural communities .
But biofuels are not without their controversies .
Critics say increased fuel production could push food prices higher , and the administration is mulling a so - called “ low - carbon fuel standard ” that could penalize some forms of ethanol production for resulting in relatively high amounts of greenhouse gas emissions .

I know that a lot of people have a hard time grasping large numbers .
Our puny brains , so recently evolved , do n't have a concrete example of a million , or a billion .
We have a hard time past about 150 !
So it does n't surprise me that the U.S. budget is difficult to comprehend , totaling $ 2.7 trillion .
Still , I can't quite wrap my head around the fact that the average American thinks that NASA gets 1/4 of the U.S. total budget :
Americans in general have no idea what NASA 's " cost " is .
In fact , most members of the public have no idea how much any government agency 's budget is .
What we do know -- and have recently documented -- is that the public perception of NASA 's budget is grossly inflated relative to actual dollars .
In a just - completed study , we asked respondents what percentage of the national budget is allocated to NASA ... NASA 's allocation , on average , was estimated to be approximately 24 % of the national budget ( the NASA allocation in 2007 was approximately 0.58 % of the budget . )
A lot of people think NASA is a waste of time and money , and maybe this is why ; they have a grossly overinflated idea of how much NASA spends .
When NASA loses a $ 150 million probe , that 's a lot of real money , but hardly a drop in the bucket compared to what we spend as a nation ( and remember , we spend $ 11 million per hour in Iraq ) .
I 've written about this before , on what NASA does with its paltry percentage .
NASA faces a clear issue here : they do an incredible amount of work and exploration with a small amount of money .
People think that they do n't do very much at all and spend vast amounts of money .
All NASA needs to do is educate the public on their real budget .
Once it 's put into perspective , really made clear , I bet public support for NASA would go way up .
To be sure , a huge amount of NASA 's budget is wasted ( I am not a big supporter of the space station or the Shuttle because of cost and mission , though I do not deny how cool they are ) , and that is a priority .
But at the same time , if they could get the public to truly understand how little of the national budget they get , they might be able to actually get them to rally behind a real project , like getting back to the Moon , or building even better probes to the planets , moon , comets , and asteroids in our solar system -- not to mention building bigger and more sensitive telescopes that can see the Universe across the electromagnetic spectrum .
I remember hearing a talk by a Hubble scientist years ago , and he said that if you download two or three Hubble images and use them to decorate your office or as a desktop wallpaper , you 've gotten your money 's worth out of the telescope .
I think he made a really good point .
Exploration , science , understanding , beauty : the price on these is small , and it 's even smaller than most people think !
“ Trying to make a movie which truly conveys the raw thrill and expressive power of art is very difficult .
So I have n’t bothered , ” Banksy said in a statement to The Times e-mailed from his publicist , Jo Brooks .
“ Instead this is a simple everyday tale of life , longing and mindless vandalism . ”
A film - within - a - film that begins as a chronicle of guerrilla art and its most prominent creators but morphs into a sly satire of celebrity , consumerism , the art world and filmmaking itself , “ Exit Through the Gift Shop ” is a nearly impossible work to categorize .
That does n’t begin to describe the contradictions that surround the new movie that ’s both about -- and made by -- the controversial and hugely popular artist .
Outside Park City ’s 446- seat Library Center
Theater , Banksy fans started queuing up hours before “ Gift Shop ’s ” 8:30 p.m. screening in 15 - degree weather , even if their chances of getting in were slim .
The screening , which was also a sales event for the film ’s representatives , Cinetic Media , felt more like a feverish night club , with Jared Leto , Adrian Grenier and uber hipster Danny Masterson ( of “ That ' 70s Show ” ) in the packed house .
The movie does n’t appear anywhere in the Sundance Film Festival ’s catalogue .
Outside a small circle of ultra-secretive confidantes , nobody knows its director ’s identity and whereabouts .
And the film ’s place in the Sundance schedule was n’t even announced until last week .
An internationally renowned art world icon whose political , occasionally angry and mordantly funny pieces sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars to such big ticket collectors as Brad Pitt and Christina Aguilera , Banksy clings to his anonymity -- despite strenuous efforts of fans and detractors , no one has been able to unmask him .
But he has legions of followers : A British show last year , titled " Banksy Versus the Bristol Museum , " attracted more than 300,000 visitors .
The graffiti artist -- who left at least 10 works of art on the sides of buildings and utility boxes in Park City and Salt Lake City last week under cover of darkness -- has become infamous for his anti-establishment bent , running afoul of both the ivory tower ideals of art academics and local law enforcement for his all - public - spaces - are - my - canvas style : stencils of kissing policemen , or the Queen of England as a chimp .
“ Exit Through the Gift Shop , ” narrated by “ Notting Hill ” actor Rhys Ifans , opens with Banksy himself -- or at least a silhouette of him .
Photographed in the dark , wearing a hoodie with his voice digitally disguised , the artist says “ Gift Shop ” is less about him than a guy who tried to make a movie about street art : Thierry Guetta , a French immigrant in Los Angeles who , since his mother ’s death , videotapes everything in his life .
One of Guetta ’s cousins is Invader , a French guerrilla artist who designs and furtively places mosaics inspired by the video game Space Invaders .
Before long , Guetta is recording Invader ’s installations , and is sucked into the riotous underground art world -- “ It was not just illegal .
It was dangerous , ” Guetta says -- as it explodes in the early 2000s with the works of Shepard Fairey , Ron English and Borf , among many others .
As Banksy points out in the film , the work by its very nature is temporal -- as soon as it ’s painted , glued or painted on a building or a billboard or a bus , the creations are removed by the authorities -- so it must be immediately documented to be shared and enjoyed by others .
Guetta is in the right place at the right time to do just that .
But as Fairey notes , Guetta is not only a filmmaker ( an assertion called into question later in the movie ) , but also an accomplice .
Yet there ’s one artist apparently beyond Guetta ’s reach -- Banksy .
In early 2006 , though , Banksy travels to Los Angeles , needing an assistant .
Guetta not only is familiar with Banksy ’s milieu , but knows where the best walls are to deface and has a massive ladder -- “ the perfect host , ” as Banksy puts it .
Even though the artist protects his identity as if he ’s in the U.S. Federal Witness Protection Program , Guetta keeps his camera going as Banksy ( seen from behind or in shadow ) creates his distinctive art in Los Angeles and England .
Their friendship is cemented when Banksy ( with Guetta videotaping ) installs an inflatable replica of a Guantanamo torture victim next to a Disneyland roller coaster , as screaming families fly past .
“ He was my guy after that , ” Banksy says .
But was Guetta actually making a movie , or just amassing a trove of tapes ?
As his work generates more hype and money , Banksy believes a movie can correct the course of the cultural conversation -- back toward art itself , rather than its commoditization .
Pushed to deliver a film , Guetta ultimately hands in a 90 - minute movie called “ Life Remote Control , ” a documentary so cinematically schizophrenic it looks like it ’s been forced through a food mill .
Banksy is n’t thrilled , concluding that perhaps Guetta is n’t really a filmmaker but “ maybe just someone with mental problems who happened to have a camera . ”
Banksy decides to recut the hours and hours of video , while Guetta travels back to Los Angeles and , in an amazing reinvention , transforms himself into an artist named Mr. Brainwash .
“ Mr. Brainwash is a force of nature .
He ’s a phenomenon .
And I do n’t mean that in a good way , ” Banksy says of his former assistant as he prepares for his first show in Los Angeles .
“ Gift Shop ” becomes less of a movie about Banksy , his work and his complicated relationship with Guetta and more a study of how we see and appraise art -- either through some subjective aesthetic test or economic valuation .
Do artists need to earn their fame , or is fame simply imposed upon them through some random algorithm ?
Is Mr. Brainwash ’s work ( he did the cover of Madonna ’s new CD ) derivative and contrived , and who ’s to say if it is ?
“ Maybe it means art is a bit of a joke , ” Banksy says near the film ’s conclusion .
Mr. Brainwash did n’t play by the rules , he observes , but there are n’t supposed to be rules , right ?
Ultimately , the film offers a guerilla artist ’s ( if not documentary filmmaker ’s ) version of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle -- by observing an action , you affect its outcome .
And that , in a way , seems in keeping with the aesthetics of street art :
It ’s all about discovery and seeing .

Statement Regarding Pat Robertson's Comments on Haiti
CBN.com  VIRGINIA BEACH , Va. , January 13 , 2010 --
On today ’s The 700 Club , during a segment about the devastation , suffering and humanitarian effort that is needed in Haiti , Dr. Robertson also spoke about Haiti ’s history .
His comments were based on the widely - discussed 1791 slave rebellion led by Boukman Dutty at Bois Caiman , where the slaves allegedly made a famous pact with the devil in exchange for victory over the French .
This history , combined with the horrible state of the country , has led countless scholars and religious figures over the centuries to believe the country is cursed .
Dr. Robertson never stated that the earthquake was God ’s wrath .
If you watch the entire video segment , Dr. Robertson ’s compassion for the people of Haiti is clear .
He called for prayer for them .
His humanitarian arm has been working to help thousands of people in Haiti over the last year , and they are currently launching a major relief and recovery effort to help the victims of this disaster .
They have sent a shipment of millions of dollars worth of medications that is now in Haiti , and their disaster team leaders are expected to arrive tomorrow and begin operations to ease the suffering .

Probably you ’ve heard lots of about various OS ’es for microcontrollers like RTOS , eCos and so on .
But none of them are targeted for Arduino .
Well probably Arduino is too low in memory for such bit players .
But Thomas W. Holtquist from skewworks.com made it real .
Pyxis OS is operating system for Arduino .
It is able to run separately compiled programs directly from microSD card and the number of programs is only limited in card size .
After all Pyxis is based on so well known programming principles where you can use standard functions for accessing analog and digital pins or other peripherals , but additionally Pyxis programming language gives ability to use specific functions that allow creating various GUI specific objects like Text boxes , Buttons , Progress bars .
To compile programs for Pyxis OS use Pyxis Studio where you can write programs and compile them in to Pyxis executables ( PXE ) .
Other interesting feature is that you can convert ATmega EEPROM in to hard drive ( PFAT ) where you are able to store files , delete up to 4 instances at once .
And of course what OS can be true OS without graphical interface .
You can have windows like controls with PyxisTSS .
So give it a try and be amazed what Arduino with OS is capable of .

A new assay capable of examining hundreds of proteins at once and enabling new experiments that could dramatically change our understanding of cancer and other diseases has been invented by a team of University of Chicago scientists .
Described January 24 in the journal Nature Methods , the new micro-western arrays combine the specificity of the popular " Western blot " protein assay with the large scale of DNA microarrays .
The technique will allow scientists to observe much of a cell 's intricate protein network in one experiment rather than peeking at one small piece at a time .
" The proteins are the actual machines that are doing everything in the cell , but nobody 's been able to examine them in depth because it 's been too complicated .
Now , we can begin to do that with this new method , " said Richard B. Jones , senior author and assistant professor at and the University of Chicago 's Ben May Department for Cancer Research and the Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology .
Since the 1970's , laboratories have used Western blots to measure proteins .
Cellular material is loaded into a gel and proteins of different sizes are separated by an electric field .
A protein is then targeted by an antibody , allowing scientists to measure the amount present in the cells .
The method has led to numerous findings across the field of cell biology , but is limited by a need for large amounts of cell material and expensive antibodies , and the inability to measure more than a handful of proteins at a time .
With hundreds or even thousands of proteins involved in cellular networks , scientists were restricted to observing only a small fraction of protein activity with each experiment .
" When you walk into a dark room and do n't have much information , it 's difficult to predict where everything is going to be , " Jones said .
" If someone can simply turn on the light , you do n't have to progress one step at a time by bumping into things .
With this new technology , you can potentially see everything at the same time . "
Micro-western arrays adapt the technology of the micro-array , typically used to assess the expression of thousands of genes in a single experiment , to proteins .
With pre-printed micro-western array gels , essentially comprising 96 miniature Western blots , scientists can compare the levels of hundreds of proteins simultaneously , or compare dozens of proteins under dozens of treatment conditions in one shot .
Mere nanoliters of cell material and antibodies are needed for the experiments , reducing cost and maximizing the information obtained from a single sample .

To demonstrate the potential of the micro-western array , Jones and colleagues from the University of Chicago and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology looked at the behavior of proteins in a cancer cell line with elevated amounts of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) .
" We started asking questions about what we could do that no one else could previously do , " Jones said .
" We could actually reproducibly see 120 things at a time rather than looking at 1 or 2 or 5 . "
The experiments found that activating EGFR simultaneously activated several other receptors in the cell -- a new discovery that may explain why some tumors become resistant to cancer therapies .
With more information , the method may potentially be used clinically for more precise diagnoses of cancer and other diseases that can direct individualized treatment .
" In the clinic , you 're limited by the fact that typically most cancers are diagnosed by one or two markers ; you 're looking for one or two markers that are high or low then trying to diagnose and treat an illness , " Jones said .
" Here , we can potentially measure a collection of proteins at the same time and not just focus on one guess .
We 've never been able do that before . "
Other scientists in the field of systems biology said that micro-western arrays would make possible experiments that were previously beyond the scope of laboratory methods .

" I think this is really a breakthrough technology that allows us to monitor in close to real time the activity profiles of modified signaling proteins , which is essentially impossible right now , " said Andrea Califano , professor of biomedical informatics at Columbia University .
" This opens up a completely new window in terms of the molecular profiling of the cell . "
" One of the biggest hurdles for systems biology is the struggle for high density , dynamic and quantitative data , and the micro- western array method will go a long way to address this problem , " said Walter Kolch , director of Systems Biology Ireland and Professor at University College Dublin .
" It is a fine example of generating exciting new technology from applying a new idea to an old method . "
The work was funded by The University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center , the American Cancer Society , the Cancer Research Foundation , the Illinois Department of Public Health , the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences , the National Cancer Institute , and the National Science Foundation .
WELLINGTON ( Reuters ) - New Zealand musician Pauly Fuemana , who found international fame with his country ’s biggest selling record ever , “ How Bizarre , ” died in hospital on Sunday after a short illness , according to media reports .
The 40 - year - old recorded under the name OMC , or Otara Millionaires Club , whose 1995 single “ How Bizarre ” reached No. 1 in eight countries , including Canada , Australia and Ireland .
It peaked at No. 4 on the radio chart in the United States .
The deceptively upbeat song -- whose title was inspired by a ubiquitous catchphrase -- revolved around peculiar encounters with policemen and circus performers .
But behind the catchy melody and Mariachi horns lurked a darker story , hinting at Fuemana ’s upbringing in a crime - infested suburb of New Zealand ’s biggest city .
“ I put a lot of hidden stories in there so people could read between the lines and sense it for what it is instead of telling them , ‘ Yeah , we got pulled over by the cops , and my mate got his head smashed in , and we got arrested , and they found some pot on him , ’ ” Fuemana told Reuters in a 1997 interview .
Fuemana failed to match the success of “ How Bizarre , ” and was declared bankrupt in 2006 , losing his house and other assets , including his songwriting royalties .
The Otara Millionaires Club was originally a rap group named for a suburb of Auckland where offshoots of Los Angeles ’ Crips and Bloods gangs reigned amid fenced - off schools , run-down buildings and curfews .
Brandishing machetes , the preferred means of settling gang disputes , the band would throw bottles at fans to hype them up .
When things got too hot , Fuemana quit the group in early 1995 , took the name with him and recorded “ How Bizarre ” as a solo artist under the abbreviated moniker .
It was produced and co-written by Alan Jansson .
The follow - up album of the same name , made for just US $ 25,000 , was released worldwide by PolyGram the following year .
After Fuemana ’s star faded he kept a low profile .
He and Jannson reunited in 2007 to release a single “ 4 All of Us . ”
Radio New Zealand said Fuemana had been ill for several months and was surrounded by his family and friends when he died in Auckland .
Destroyed by a TATP bomb ( Image : Dylan Martinez / PA archive / PA )
A CHEAP artificial nose promises to make it much easier to detect the explosive triacetone triperoxide .
The device could be installed in the doorways of buses , trains and airports to sound an alarm if someone carrying TATP crosses the threshold .
Attention started to focus on TATP following its use in the 7 July 2005 bus and tube bombings in London , and the attacks on trains the previous year in Madrid , Spain .
The explosive can be made using easily obtainable domestic chemicals and has explosive power similar to TNT .
But TATP ’s high …
Researchers are running into the physical limits of speed and scaling in silicon transistor technology , forcing them to look elsewhere for next - generation devices .
The leading candidate to replace silicon being pursued by , well , pretty much everyone , is graphene .
Graphene , single sheets of graphitic carbon , is exciting because it is a single atom thick and has remarkably high electron mobilities ( 100 times greater than silicon ) , making it ideally suited to atomic - scale , high - speed operation .
Also , graphene 's electrical properties can be controlled , switching it among conducting , semiconducting and electrically insulating forms .
That means graphene - only ( or , more likely , graphene - mostly ) devices are , in principle , possible .
In this week 's Science , researchers from IBM demonstrate graphene - based field effect transistors ( FETs ) that may operate at much higher speeds ( 100GHz ) than Si FETs .
Graphene layers were thermally grown on two - inch SiC wafers and the FETs were formed using standard Si fabrication techniques with HfO 2 as the gate oxide .
That 's a rather significant point — the researchers actually created an entire wafer of these devices .
The smallest gate length demontrated in the paper was 240nm , quite large compared to current generation Si ( 32 nm ) , but the graphene was one or two layers ( meaning one or two atoms ) thick in all the tested devices — a considerable improvement over Si .
High frequency operation , colloquially referred to as the speed of the transistors , was the key property examined in the paper .
As operating frequency increases , electrons have less time to respond to the electrical fields that drive transistors , which will eventually cause the transistor to fail because the electrons simply can't conduct across the material fast enough .
The graphene FETs in this work were tested up to 30GHz and , extrapolating those results , the authors showed that the FETs would operate , albeit poorly , up to 100GHz .
Similarly sized Si devices are limited to 30 GHz operation .
Assuming these devices can be scaled , they will undoubtedly present a dramatic speed increase over current generation Si .
Because the graphene used in this study was conductive ( i.e. no band gap ) , the demonstrated voltage - current characteristics were strange compared to Si.
Specifically , current continued to increase linearly with drain voltage up to device breakdown .
Si -based transistors typically have a point , called the threshold , at which a current cannot increase despite increasing drain voltage .
This study is a mixed bag of promise and hype .
The 100GHz speed touted in the article 's title is an extrapolation — no such properties were actually measured .
Also , the electron mobilities , the key property for high frequency operation , that the authors measured in the fabricated devices were pedestrian compared to graphene 's potential , probably due to the thermal process used to synthesized the graphene layer .
Future devices could dramatically outperform these FETs if wafer - scale fabrication can replicate some of the better electron mobility measurements of graphene .
Graphene devices have grown by leaps and bounds over the past few years , and they are probably the best bet to eventually replace silicon .
Demonstrations like this are important because they show that wafer - scale production is possible , and the properties , while not ideal , are truly impressive , in that they 're already beginning to push the limits of Si technology .

She likes Care Bears , does n’t wear makeup yet , and took her nom de plume from a character in the Disney classic “ Bambi . ”
And last year , 15 - year - old “ Bunny ” became one of Japan ’s top authors of a genre called keitai -- cellphone -- novels .
After getting its start as a tale told on tiny cellular screens , her three - volume novel “ Wolf Boy x Natural Girl ” has gone on to sell more than 110,000 paperback copies since its release in May , according to Starts Publishing Co .
The “ Wolf Boy ” author , who took her alias from Thumper ’s friend Miss Bunny , started writing when she was in the sixth grade , after her parents bought her a cellphone .
“ I was so excited , ” she says with a shy smile .
Bunny was using her phone mainly to text friends until she saw a TV ad about a keitai novel website that allowed users to write novels on cellphones for free .
Inspired by some of the novels she read , Bunny took a crack at one herself , simply following the word limit of 1,000 characters per page .
Keitai writers can choose to “ publish ” their online content immediately or keep it unlisted .
Most writers upload the content as they finish so they get instant feedback from the readers , who access the stories on the website and click through the pages .
Authors respond to readers by correcting errors and , in some cases , altering story lines .
The prize for the occasional most - read story is getting your novel into print .
Over the course of several months , Bunny tapped away in her bedroom , in between homework assignments .
“ Wolf Boy ” ended up as a high - school love story between shy , pretty Miku and tall , handsome Shun , who is generally a gentlemen except when Miku is around ( thus the name “ Wolf Boy ” ) .
One scene , from Shun ’s point of view , is typical of the style :
“ I changed into a suit for the party .
. . .
When I stepped out of my room . . .
Miku was there .
Miku was in a pink one - piece dress , wearing white heels .
She looks mature because her hair is lightly curled .
She ’s looking straight at me .
It ’s hard to keep my cool when she ’s looking at me like that . ”
“ Wolf Boy ” became one of the most popular novels on the No-ichigo website .
Unaware of her daughter ’s work , Bunny ’s mother was floored when she first heard about a pending book offer .
“ I had no idea , ” her mother says .
“ Wolf Boy ” has grossed more than $ 611,000 .
When asked whether Shun is her ideal boyfriend , Bunny looks down , blushing .
She shakes her head and mutters , “ He used to be , but not anymore . ”
Bunny does n’t have a boyfriend now .
No one at school knows about her success .
“ It ’s embarrassing , ” Bunny says .
As most other keitai novel authors do , Bunny conceals her identity for privacy .
“ Users first access these websites by giving themselves an online identity and they generally stick to operating under that pseudonym , ” Starts Publishing editor Shigeru Matsushima says .
Much of the Japanese literary establishment has been critical of the genre ’s commercial success .
“ Most keitai novel authors are amateurs who ’ve never written before and the stories follow a similar pattern , ” says Chiaki Ishihara , a literature professor at Waseda University .
Ascii Media Works , a publisher of keitai novels that targets 14 - to 17 - year - olds , acknowledges that the works are not masterpieces .
“ Keitai novels should be likened to the literary genre of light novels , ” says Kenro Hayamizu , author of a book analyzing the cellphone novel phenomenon .
“ These are like Harlequin romances for young girls . ”
The size of the keitai novel market is unclear , but Maho i-Land Co. , one of the largest keitai novel content providers , boasts 1 million online book titles and 6 million users .
“ Although sales for each new release vary widely , we ’ve sold an average of roughly 100,000 copies per book we ’ve published in recent years , ” says Mari Yusa , who works in Maho i-Land ’s content division .
The firm publishes a few of the most popular novels each month .
When keitai novels started to emerge in the last decade , many of the stories were gritty and based on real - life events .
The genre had its beginnings when a thirtysomething author known only as Yoshi wrote the novel “ Deep Love , ” about a 17 - year - old girl named Ayu who tries to pay for her boyfriend ’s heart surgery through prostitution and ends up dying of AIDS - related complications .
Matsushima , the editor at Starts Publishing , says the recent success of breezier keitai stories such as “ Wolf Boy ” has signified a shift in reader interest .
Horror stories and girls ’ comic - book - type comedies have been popular too .
“ Recent stories are noticeably being written in a more colloquial style with adolescent - speak , ” Matsushima says .
“ Over a year ago , readers started rejecting sad stories .
They turned to novels depicting the ideal , make - believe world , ” a trend possibly triggered by Japan ’s economic recession .
“ Readers ’ choices could be an honest reflection of how they feel about the real world , ” he says .
Bunny is studying for high school entrance exams .
She ’s put her book earnings into a savings account and is looking to her future : “ I ’d like to think about whether I ’d like to become a professional author . ”

ヴィクシーモデルの体型にあこがれる…
私には大きな悩みがあります。それは知り合いや友人たちよりも胸が小さいことです。胸が小さいので自分に自信を持つことが出来なくて男性の前では昔から引っ込み思案になってしまいます。悩みに悩んで、豊胸手術を受けようとも思ったのですが高価だし何よりも失敗が怖くて踏みきれませんでした…。そんな時に見つけたのがバストアップサプリであるエンジェルアップです。これなら手術をしなくても自宅で飲むだけで簡単にバストアップが出来ると思いました。でも調べてみるとエンジェルアップには効果がないという口コミもあって気になってしまいました。
だけど私に残された道はこれしかないと思い購入し試してみました。
ファッションモデルやグラビアアイドルが愛用
エンジェルアップは芸能事務所に所属しているモデルやタレント向けに商品開発されたものです。そのためとても貴重な原材料を使用しているので大量生産が不可能なものになっています。そして現在購入している人の９割が定期購入しているので生産量の関係で一般販売ができなくなる可能性が高いです。
エンジェルアップを実際に試してみました
実際に試してみた感想は本当にこんな小さなものを飲んでバストアップできるのかな？と思いました。口コミでバストアップしなかったということも見ていたので、かなり不安になってしまいましたがもしこれでバストアップが出来たらいいなぁという思いで１ヶ月飲み続けてみました。私の場合は飲みだして２週間ほどしてから少しずつ胸に変化が出てきたと感じました！１袋飲み終わる頃には元々Aカップだった私の胸がCカップになっていたので驚きです！
私が実際に試してみた結果はこちらから
私がエンジェルアップを飲むようになって嬉しかったこと
やっぱり胸が大きくなったのは本当に嬉しいですね。今までAカップしかなかったのに今ではCカップです＾＾だけど一番うれしかったことは自分に自信を持つことが出来るようになったことです！今までは胸が小さいということもあって服装も地味なものを着ていましたが、この間はCカップになったということで思い切って胸元の開いた服を買ってみました。それでちょうどトモダチに誘われていた合コンがあったのでその服を着て行ってきました。いつもだと男性の方から話しかけられることは少なかったのですが、この間はかなり話かけられました。それに今まで男性の視線というものを感じたことがなかったのですがスゴく胸を見られていると感じて恥ずかしかったです。でもそのおかげで女性として魅力があると自分に自信を持つことが出来るようになって嬉しかったです。今度は夏に向けてビキニを買おうと思っています＾＾
定期購入で購入するとかなりお得になりました
エンジェルアップを定期購入で注文するとナント通常は９８００円なのですが５９８０円で購入することができちゃいますなので３８２０円もお得に購入できます一般販売できる数が少なくなってきていますが、今のうちに定期購入にしておけば一般販売が停止されても大丈夫です。
バストアップをするために大事なこと 一番大事なことは夜は早めに寝て睡眠時間を十分にとることです。少なくても７時間は睡眠時間をとりましょう。そして寝る時にはしっかりとブラジャーを着けなければいけません。なぜかというと、女性ホルモンが一番分泌されるのは夜の１１時〜２時の間だからです。その時間にしっかりと寝くことで女性ホルモンが分泌されます。そしてブラジャーを付けることで胸の位置がしっかりと固定されてキレイな胸になります。ブラジャーの刺激によっても女性ホルモンが分泌されるので、寝る時は外しちゃっている人は注意してください。

“ Lost ” watchers , all is right with the world again : President Obama will not interrupt the long - awaited episode by giving a national address the same night .
Fear gripped the hearts of fans when it was announced that the president wanted to push back the annual State of the Union address – typically held in late January – to February 2 , which everyone should know by now is the premiere of the ABC drama ’s final season .
Crazy talk !
Does n’t he know people have been dying to find out what happened to the castaways ?
But White House press secretary Robert Gibbs assured viewers Friday he “ does n’t foresee a scenario in which millions of people that hope to finally get some conclusion in ‘ Lost ’ are preempted by the president . ”
The " Lost " news came in response to a question from ABC correspondent Ann Compton at the afternoon press briefing .
The time slot for “ Lost ” may be secured , but still no word on what day the president will deliver the State of the Union .
Unreal Engine has defined the technological standards of high - definition console shooters , but Gears of War apart it seems as if it is down to proprietary engines to exceed them : Infinity Ward , Bungie and Guerrilla Games have produced the most critically well - received FPS titles on console , and all of them are using their own in - house technology .
Coming from the technological architects of GSC's S.T.A.L.K.E.R. , the new 4A engine powering Metro 2033 from THQ is another proprietary codebase that looks capable of producing pretty astonishing visuals .
Thus far , most of THQ's marketing efforts have concentrated on the visually superb PC build , though Eurogamer got hands on with both versions last month .
Digital Foundry has had extensive access to a preview Xbox 360 build , and what we 've seen has been impressive .
To give you some idea of what has caught our eye , here 's a video of the game running on the Microsoft console , captured and edited by us with a view to showcasing the unique visual look of this new technology , and how it translates into the gameplay .
We wanted to know more , so arranged an interview with 4A Games ' chief technical officer Oles Shishkovtsov .
Having previously worked with GSC as an instrumental guiding force behind the technologically impressive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. , there has been controversy that the 4A engine is an offshoot of proprietary GSC IP , but Shishkovtsov disagrees , saying that the new tech was started as a pet project borne out of the frustrations in dealing with his older engine .
" The major obstacles to the future of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. engine was its inherent inability to be multi- threaded , the weak and error - prone networking model , and simply awful resource and memory management which prohibited any kind of streaming or simply keeping the working set small enough for ' next - gen ' consoles , " explains Shishkovtsov .
" Another thing which really worried me was the text - based scripting .
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was purely LUA - scripted , " he continues .
" Working on S.T.A.L.K.E.R. it became clear that designers / scriptwriters want more and more control and when they got it , they were lost and needed to think like programmers , but they were n't programmers !
That contributed a lot to the original delays with S.T.A.L.K.E.R . "
It was these problems and issues that left Shishkovtsov looking for an entirely new direction for the next engine .
" I started a personal project to establish the future architecture and to explore the possibilities of the design , " he says .
" The project evolved quite well and although it was n't functional as a game ( not even as a demo : for example it did n't have any rendering engine back then ) it provided me with clear vision on what to do next . "
Shishkovstov and his colleague Aleksandr Maksimchuk left GSC a full year before S.T.A.L.K.E.R. eventually shipped , and the 4A engine , with its emphasis on a hugely efficient implementation of multi- threading good for both PC and console , took shape .
Shishkovtsov claims that the 4A engine has no relationship with the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. X - Ray tech because a port would be " extremely difficult " .
" A straight port will not fit into memory even without all the textures , all the sounds and all the geometry , " he reckons .
" And then it will work at around 1 - 3 frames per second .
But that does n't matter because without textures and geometry , you can not see those frames !
That 's my personal opinion , but it would probably be wise for GSC to wait for another generation of consoles . "
According to Shishkovtsov , the philosophy of parallelising the code is different to many games , but akin to the techniques employed by Criterion Games for Burnout Paradise : processing tasks are allocated to whatever processors are available at the time .
" We do n't have dedicated threads for processing specific tasks in - game with the exception of a PhysX thread , " explains Shishkovtsov .
" All our threads are basic workers .
We use task - model but without any pre-conditioning or pre/post - synchronising .
Basically all tasks can execute in parallel without any locks from the point when they are spawned .
There are no inter - dependencies for tasks .
It looks like a tree of tasks , which start from more heavyweight ones at the beginning of the frame ( to make the system self - balanced ) .
The last time I measured the statistics , we were running approximately 3,000 tasks per 30 ms frame on Xbox 360 on CPU - intensive scenes with all hardware threads at 100 per cent load . "
And again , similar to Criterion 's multi- threading work , 4A Games has found that a similar implementation works on the Sony console too .
" The PS3 is not that different ...
We use ' fibres ' to ' emulate ' a six - thread CPU , and then each task can spawn a SPURS ( SPU ) job and switch to another fibre .
This is a kind of PPU off - loading , which is transparent to the system .
The end result of this beautiful ( apart from somewhat restricting ) model is that we have perfectly linear scaling up to the hardware deficiency limits . "
While the engine is described as a complete cross-platform development environment , there is to be no PlayStation 3 SKU of Metro 2033 .
The game will launch on PC and Xbox 360 only .
However , the Sony console played a big part in the development work for the core tech .
" From the start we selected the most ' difficult ' platform to run on .
A lot of decisions were made explicitly knowing the limits and quirks we 'll face in the future , " explains Shishkovtsov .
" For me personally , the PS3 GPU ( they like to call it RSX for some reason ) was the safe choice because I was involved in the early design stages of NV40 and it's like a homeland : RSX is a direct derivative of that architecture .
Reading Sony 's docs it was like , ' Ha !
They do n't understand where those cycles are lost !
They coded sub - optimal code - path in GCM for that thing ! '
All of that kind of stuff ... "

I 've been playing with how I color backgrounds and background objects .
I color the lines of background objects a darker version of the object and I think it makes the figures pop out more .
Going back through the archives , one of my biggest problems was busy backgrounds .
This new way of doing the background coloring seems to help out greatly in that fashion .
I 'm liking it .
I 'm also playing with some more shading / shadow effects and want to continue doing so .
" The system worked " - or more accurately , it is working .
Just fine
It 's even remotely possible that this small , dedicated and thus unmonitored organisation may contain a few people with the technical skills or contacts to make or obtain bombs or other weapons which actually work .
This is rare : more usually you 'll get an embarrassing and often inadvertently - funny failure as in the cases of Richard Reid , the comically inept UK " car bombers " of 2007 , Mr Mutallab this Christmas , etc etc .
Sometimes it will be 9/11 , and there will be cash in good supply ; sometimes it will be 7/7 , and competent bomb - making will substitute for money .
In neither of those cases , however , was the organisation capable enough to make an effective strike without the use of suicide tactics .
Thus those two teams - two of the most serious ever seen in the West under the jihadi banner - wiped themselves out in just one operation .
The Madrid bombers , another rare effective group , managed to avoid killing themselves during the operation but were subsequently caught and thus eliminated as a threat just as permanently .
So , even in the rare case where an operational jihadi terror unit is small and committed enough to avoid detection and yet has resources enough to make an effective strike , it is almost always out of play after just one operation .
This was n't true with the more effective terror groups of yesteryear , like the Provisional IRA ; but their recruiting / commitment issues were easier , as they had a stated policy against mass murder of civilians ( and they were riddled with informers anyway ) .
That 's why planes and trains are n't blowing up every day ; why people are n't opening fire into crowds every week ( not even in Israel , quite a lot of the time ) .
Because most people , even people who in all other respects you would describe as fanatical extremists , just are n't mass - murderer material - and those that are tend not to be the brightest or most competent buttons in the box * .
That 's why the threat of terrorism in general , and airborne terrorism in particular , has been reduced to negligible levels by the measures already in place , and no more are necessary .
No , really .
Do n't worry about terrorism next time you take a flight .
There is a very small risk , as an airline passenger , that you will die violently before you land , but it has nothing to do with terrorists .
It is entirely down to the chance of an accident .
Consider this , if you do n't believe it .
The year 2001 , which saw four entire airliners destroyed with total loss of life on 9/11 , was not in fact a particularly dangerous year to go flying .
More airline passengers died in the year 2000 ; nearly as many died in 2002 .
Twice as many were killed flying in 1972 , despite the fact that many fewer people flew back then , because airliners were far less safe .
Terrorism simply is n't a visible factor in your chances of dying while flying , or indeed while doing anything else : it is insignificant , a problem that has been almost totally eliminated for Western citizens since its not -very - serious heyday in the 1970s and 80s , and you should n't worry about it .
It would make absolutely no noticeable difference to your or my chances of violent death / injury if terrorism was eradicated overnight .
" The system worked , " said US Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano shortly after the attack , and in the largest sense she was right .
Terrorism , like polio , has been effectively stamped out in the developed world - had mostly been so before the Department of Homeland Security was even created , in fact , but that 's by the by .
Napolitano was subsequently forced into an abrupt volte - face by sectarian US politics and cretinous media - pumped fear , but she was basically right first time .
The free world 's counterterrorism system as it stands is working as well as anyone could reasonably ask for .
In the end , the correct response to efforts like those of Mr Mutallab and his incendiary undergarments is not panic and more security , but laughter - much as one might also laugh at the idiotic bum - kamikaze whose efforts , erm , backfired so messily in Saudi Arabia last summer .
Mr Mutallab should go down in history not as the underpants bomber , but simply as the completely pants bomber . ®
* Mutallab , quite apart from having a rubbish bomb which he should have known probably would n't work ( he did n't study proper engineering as widely reported , but " Engineering with Business Finance " ) committed several other blunders .
He should have tried to blow the plane up at height , not at low level ; doubtless the idea was to bring the plane down into an urban area , but if Mutallab had been a real engineer he'd have known his pant - bomb needed all the help it could get from decompression .
Then , he should n't have triggered his device such that everyone could see what he was doing and that he was responsible for it .
He should n't have told his family he was off to become an extremist and cut off contact in the first place , which is what led to him being on various security - services lists - much good though that did .
All in all , a piss - poor performance even among today 's generally rubbish terrorists .
Lewis
Page went through a lot of quite stressful training and preparation to battle the terrorist threat before being assigned as a military bomb - disposal operator in support of the UK police from 2001 - 04 .
He has still never got over the disappointment of finding out just how incredibly rare it is , as a bomb - disposal man in mainland Britain , to encounter a terrorist / criminal bomb of any significance at all , let alone one which has not already either gone off or failed to do so .
You get a special tie if you ever do encounter such a device .
NB : Any terrorists reading this should be aware that an essential precaution has been left out of all the bombing plans above , without which any attack is 90 per cent or more likely to fail due to a classified security tactic in use by the UK ( and presumably the US ) .
Dear Straight Dope : Every run -of - the - mill cop movie I 've ever seen involves a car chase in which , at some point , an officer commandeers a civilian 's vehicle .
You know what I 'm talking about — the cop 's car crashes and he or she jumps out , flashes a badge at an innocent motorist and announces that he or she is " commandeering the car . "
The civilian then jumps out of the car and the cop continues the chase in the civilian 's car ( which usually gets wrecked as well ) .
I do n't know much about constitutional law , but this seems to be an impermissible taking of a citizen 's private property .
My question is :
Is there any U.S. jurisdiction that actually permits this , or is it simply a figment of a screenwriter 's imagination perpetuated by Hollywood ?
Kyle in Austin
SDStaff Gfactor replies :
This is a complicated question .
It presents at least six issues .
First , there ’s an empirical question :
Do police officers ever demand the use of vehicles or other property ?
Absolutely .
For example , snopes.com found an interview with one officer who had commandeered three vehicles in a 26 - year career .
Blackman v. City of Cincinnati , a 1942 Ohio Supreme Court case , involves a police officer who ordered a driver to use his vehicle to chase a fleeing felon .
So yes , police do commandeer vehicles .
Daniel Engber , in Slate ’s Explainer , notes : “ Policemen used to commandeer cars more often .
As recently as 40 years ago , New York City cops on foot would routinely flag down taxis when they needed to bring arrested criminals back to the station house . ”
Commandeering is n’t limited to cars .
After Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flood , police commandeered a pharmacy to help the sick .
Second , is it legal for the police to order me around and take my stuff ?
The experts agree : Probably .
Many jurisdictions require civilians not only to surrender their property to a police officer in an emergency but to help officers subdue suspects on command .
The Connecticut Supreme Court noted in State v. Floyd that “ the basic concept that every citizen can be compelled to assist in the pursuit or apprehension of suspected criminals has ancient Saxon origins , predating the Norman Conquest , and … derives from a time in which the public peace depended upon the ability of the populace to summon their neighbors , through the raising of the ‘ hue and cry , ’ to come to their assistance when a crime had occurred . ”
In an essay published in the 1992 Yale Law Journal , Jon C. Blue , the trial judge in Floyd , elaborated on this custom :
The antecedents … are centuries old .
Their origins lie not in the urban landscape of present - day America but in the forests and walled cities of medieval England .
Long before the creation of organized police forces , the common - law process of apprehending suspected felons was the hue and cry .
The person discovering a felony would raise a cry of “ Out ! Out ! ” prompting the neighbors to turn out with their bows , arrows , and knives .
The “ hue ” would be passed by horn - blowing from town to town until the ad hoc posse caught the malefactor or gave up the chase .
Any malefactor overtaken would receive summary justice .
At first the hue and cry was a custom , but as time passed , participation dropped off , so Parliament made the custom a command :
The First Statute of Westminster [ 1275 ] provided : “ That all generally be ready and apparelled , at the Commandment and Summons of Sheriffs , and at the Cry of the Country , to sue and arrest felons , when any need is … and they that will not do so … shall make a grievous fine to the King . ”
Ten years later , the Statute of Winchester not only affirmed the obligation of the populace to join in the hue and cry , but also commanded every man between fifteen and sixty years of age to have in his house a quantity of arms “ to keep the Peace . ”
Wealthy subjects were required to keep “ an Hauberke , a Breast - plate of Iron , a Sword , a Knife , and an Horse . ”
The less wealthy were obliged to keep swords , knives , bows , and arrows .
Today most jurisdictions have rules empowering sheriffs , and the police generally , to command assistance from the public .
These laws are sometimes called posse comitatus ( “ the power of the county ” ) statutes .
Ironically , England repealed its statute permitting sheriffs to command assistance in 1967 .
However , Blue says , “ English constables are still thought to have the power to call upon bystanders to assist them in cases of reasonable necessity . ”
The Supreme Court has upheld the federal government ’s power to commandeer private property but imposed strict limits .
In United States v. Russell , the court noted :
Extraordinary and unforeseen occasions arise , however , beyond all doubt , in cases of extreme necessity in time of war or of immediate and impending public danger , in which private property may be impressed into the public service , or may be seized and appropriated to the public use , or may even be destroyed without the consent of the owner … but the public danger must be immediate , imminent , and impending , and the emergency in the public service must be extreme and imperative , and such as will not admit of delay or a resort to any other source of supply , and the circumstances must be such as imperatively require the exercise of that extreme power in respect to the particular property so impressed , appropriated , or destroyed .
Some states have imposed similar requirements .
For instance , in 1999 , Ken Salazar , the Colorado attorney general , opined that absent a declared emergency , police could not
commandeer the use of an electricity generator and employ it to provide electricity to other citizens .
To do so … the sheriff would have to demonstrate that he could not have “ fully performed ” his peace keeping functions in that situation without the use of that action , and therefore , his power to act was implied .
The sheriff would have to justify his actions based on the facts of each situation , and after the actions have occurred .
Therefore , the sheriff is taking a legal risk when relying on a later justification of implied powers .
By contrast , the use of traditional arrest powers is more appropriate and well defined .
Salazar was careful to note that a state statute authorized “ the sheriff to ‘ command aid ’ from others ; this language derives from the traditional notion of ’ rounding up the posse . ' ”
But he saw the power as limited to property commandeered in order to make an arrest :
“ The codification of the ‘ commanding aid ’ statute clearly contemplates aid in the making of an arrest and not otherwise . ”
So there you have it .
In most jurisdictions , police can take your property or insist that you help them , at least under some circumstances .
Some jurisdictions permit firefighters to demand your property too .
The Martinsville , Virginia fire department ’s website notes , “ In pursuance of using horses for transportation , an ordinance was passed authorizing firemen to stop and commandeer any horse - drawn vehicle on the street to pull apparatus to the fire scene . ”
Similarly , one court suggested that the state might destroy buildings to prevent the spread of a fire .
Third , what if you refuse to help or surrender your belongings ?
In jurisdictions having a posse comitatus law , you could be fined and possibly even jailed .
In Connecticut , for example , failure to assist a firefighter or peace officer on command is a Class A misdemeanor , which carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $ 2,000 fine .
Fourth , are there any limitations on this power ?
The earliest American case discussing the crime of “ refusing to assist an officer in making an arrest ” is Dougherty v. State , an Alabama case .
The court held that the defendant should be acquitted if an attempt to give aid would be both futile and dangerous .
Other courts have noted that the request must be legal , and a few have held that just because a law requires a citizen to obey does n’t mean the police are authorized to command — a separate statute is required for that .
Still other courts have seized on the word command — they require the prosecution to prove that the defendant disobeyed a command , not just a request .
There are also constitutional limits .
Is it constitutional to require people to risk their personal safety and property when a law enforcement officer asks ?
The Connecticut Supreme Court addressed this question in the Floyd case mentioned above .
In Floyd , a statute making it a “ misdemeanor for any person to refuse to assist a peace officer or fireman authorized to command assistance in the execution of his duties ” had been challenged as an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment and denial of due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments .
The court found the statute constitutional , but imposed conditions similar to the Dougherty case :
A peace officer could command the assistance of a civilian only when such assistance is “ both demonstrably necessary and reasonable under all the circumstances . ”
Fifth , what if they destroy or damage my property ?
That ’s less clear .
In United States v. Russell the Supreme Court was faced with a claim for three steamers commandeered by military authorities during the Civil War .
The Russell court found it obvious that “ the taking of such property under such circumstances creates an obligation on the part of the government to reimburse the owner to the full value of the service . ”
The court continued , “ private rights , under such extreme and imperious circumstances , must give way for the time to the public good , but the government must make full restitution for the sacrifice . ”
The court concluded that the obligation to make full restitution was based on an implied promise “ on the part of the United States to reimburse the owner for the use of the steamboats and for his own services and expenses , and for the services of the crews during the period the steamboats were employed in transporting government freight pursuant to those orders . ”
The Supreme Court has n’t said what happens if equipment is borrowed and returned damaged , but lower courts have been reluctant to award compensation in such cases .
In Blackman v. City of Cincinnati , for instance , the Ohio Supreme Court refused to compensate a vehicle owner for a crash that occurred when police ordered him to chase a fleeing suspect .
Other courts have followed suit .
In a much - discussed case , Customer Co. v. City of Sacramento , the California Supreme Court rejected a claim for compensation by a convenience store owner whose store was damaged when police used tear gas to flush out a suspect hiding inside .
The court hinted that the result might be different if a plaintiff were seeking compensation after police “ commandeered a citizen ’s automobile to chase a fleeing suspect , or appropriated ammunition from a private gun shop to replenish an inadequate supply .
Conceivably , such unusual actions might constitute an exercise of eminent domain , because private property would be taken for public use , ” entitling the owner to compensation .
Even then , the court recognized that Blackman suggested the opposite result .
Fact is , it ’s not easy recovering for damage caused by the police regardless of circumstances .
Courts have refused compensation to people whose property the police damaged while executing arrest warrants or search warrants .
They ’ve also refused compensation when police intentionally damaged property in an effort to flush out a suspect .
Of the state courts that have considered the issue so far , only three , Minnesota , New Jersey , and Texas , have allowed those with damaged property to recover .
Of course there are other sources of recovery .
If you have the right kind of insurance , it probably covers your vehicle if it ’s damaged by police while they use it for law enforcement purposes .
Many jurisdictions also either voluntarily compensate those who suffer damages when following the instructions of law enforcement personnel , or are required by local law to do so .
Some victim compensation funds allow claims like this .
Those injured while assisting police are often given workers ’ compensation benefits under the police departments workers ’ compensation program .
Sixth , if I ’m helping the police and someone else gets injured , can they sue me ?
There ’s no clear rule .
Many courts say that a person who obeys a police command for assistance is immune from suit , as the Wisconsin Supreme Court did in Kagel v. Bruger .
But other courts have let cases go forward .
In 1978 , the United States Office of Legal Counsel noted , “ We are aware of no common - law authority excusing an individual ’s negligence , even when acting under the direction of law enforcement officers . ”
