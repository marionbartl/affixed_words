THIS IS A CALL TO ARMS - NOT WITH GUNS AND BULLETS - BUT WITH THE TELPEHONE , WITH EMAILS , WITH YOUR SACRED HONOR AND PERSONAL ASSETS .
In 1913 , at 11:45 p.m. , on the eve of Christmas , a group of powerful men came together to form a private corporation , designed to control the monetary system of our country .
They moved with a calculated craftiness and deceit to pass legislation that would enslave every American as a debtor to their corporation .
To give you an idea as to where our country is with debt , as of September 2008 , the U.S. federal debt totaled approximately $ 9.7T , or $ 31,700 per person .
However when the unfunded liabilities such as Social Security , Medicare , and other social programs are added in , our total debt grows to $ 59.1T or $ 516,348 per household .
In 2005 , the total personal debt , consisting of mortgages and consumer loans was estimated at $ 11.4T , with total U.S. household assets , including real estate , totaling $ 62.5T .
( Wikipedia , United States public debt ) .
This leaves approximately a $ 3T difference between our liabilities and our assets .
Why it is Americans can't forgive themselves the interest on the debt ?
We do n't owe it to " we the people , " we owe it to the Federal Reserve and to foreign governments in the form of U.S.
Treasury bills , notes , and bonds .
Currently the top four foreign owners of our debt include : Japan at $ 592.2B , China at $ 502B , United Kingdom at $ 251.4B , and oil exporters at $ 153.9B .
Other countries include Brazil , Caribbean Banking Centers , Luxembourg , Hong Kong , Russia , Norway , Germany , Taiwan , and Switzerland .
We are told that there are a number of reasons for the financial crisis we are in today .
One is the passage of the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act of 1994 , whereby the Federal Reserve was given authority to issue regulations and interest rates over mortgages and home equity lending .
As a result , its enactment led to a sharp increase in home equity lending accompanied by a sharp boost in the subprime mortgage market , from 80,000 subprime loans in 1993 to 790,000 by 1998 .
Another is the passage of the 1999 Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , removing all the protection put in place following the 1929 stock market crash , which allowed foreign banks , brokerage firms , and insurance companies to buy American owned banks , brokerage firms and insurance companies .
Additionally , this increased a risk to our economic system by easing regulations on monetary policy .
The 45 - year low interest rates in 2001 - 2002 to stimulate the economy following 9/11 exacerbated the stress on our economy .
In short , we have been set up !
Laws were designed and passed to specifically get us into this position !
We are the sheep , but our shepherd is not Moses , King David or the Great Shepherd .
Now many of the career - congressmen who supported passage of the above laws are the same people who will push through legislation so they can recess to go home and campaign for re-election .
Their misplaced priorities have created the emotionally charged environment under the threat to " get it done , now " by the Federal Reserve 's transfer agent , Treasury Secretary , Hank Paulson , investment banker extraordinaire .
Unless you know the chicanery of how the Federal Reserve Act was passed in 1913 , unless you understand the central banking system that runs almost all the countries of the world and their history of manipulation , deceit , deception , and distortion , you will not be able to hear , see , and understand what is happening under your nose .
In July , Congress gave Hank Paulson a blank check , with his promised that he would not use it unless he needed to .
Congress went home for summer recess and Paulson found a reason to use it ; rescue Fannie and Freddie to the tune of $ 5.3T .
What do you think is going to happen when they get the new Resolution Trust Corporation and their hands on the purse of America ?
We will have several days of peace in the market and then the pattern will start all over again because the next project is to pass the Treasury 's Blueprint For A Modernized Financial Regulatory System , The Blueprint is designed to transfer to the Federal Reserve , power over all savings and loans , credit unions , thrifts , state chartered banks , the entire insurance industry , mortgage industry , the U.S. Payment and Settlement System , and to make the Federal Reserve the Market Stability Regulator .
Following this current round of volatility , we can expect more peaceful days in the market then , bang !
The attack will shift to the personal savings , 401Ks , pension plans , and commercial mortgages .
This is a complete restructuring of the American economy around the Federal Reserve .
At this point , congress will be rendered powerless because they chose to " get it done fast " and voted away ALL of their power .
As we go to press , the futures at 12 midnight are down 179 points - all because Congress did not agree on a bill on Thursday .
Let me give you an example of unbridled power .
It is called " Market based Democracy . "
It was at a Group of Seven Finance Ministers meeting in Florida that then Treasury Secretary John Snow used the phrase " market based democracy . "
After doing a fair amount of research , I realized that Wall Street had transferred all tangibles into the bond , stock , commodities , or currency market .
There is not one investment or asset that we own that cannot change in value due to markets , trends , or the power of the market .
If you remember the Asian Currency Crisis , the currencies of five Asian countries fell to horrendous lows when they refused to sign on to the World Trade Organization Financial Services Agreement .
To punish them , their currencies were sold .
So much for thinking your savings and purchasing power were safe .
The banks have made out like bandits .
They have not retained ANY risk for the loans they make .
If they make a mortgage , they can sell it on the secondary mortgage market and then that mortgage can be packaged into tranches and sold to investors worldwide ; if you have an auto loan or credit card debt , it too can be sold to investors in the form of bonds ; if you have certificates of deposit , they can be sold to money market funds or through brokerage firms , etc .
What I am pointing out is that the system is already in place whereby the value of any asset can drop substantially and without warning because of market - based democracy .
We have no control whatsoever .
Once the Federal Reserve is given unbridled power over all the valuables of America , like a pirate they will seize whatever they can , for whatever reason and we will have absolutely no recourse - that is unless YOU ARE WILLING TO STAKE YOUR SACRED FORTUNE FOR THE FREEDOM OF YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AND FOR THE PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WHO HAVE STOPPED LOOKING AT AMERICA FOR ANSWERS WHEN WE ARE THE PRIME REASON FOR THE PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD .
I PROPOSE THAT YOU DEMAND OF YOUR CONGRESSMEN AND SENATORS NOT TO VOTE FOR THE PROPOSED " BAILOUT " FOR FANNIE AND FREDDIE .
LET THEM GO BELLY UP , LET THE STOCK MARKET DROP TO 3 FROM 11,000 ; LET THE TREASURIES GO BUST AS GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD GO BELLY UP FROM JAPAN , TO CHINA , TO THE UNITED KINGDOM , TO THE CARRIBEAN BANK CENTERS AND BRAZIL .
LET US BREAK THE HOLD AND BONDAGE THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ON AMERICA !
LET US DO WHAT WILSON , ROOSEVELT , TRUMAN , EISENHOWER , KENNEDY , JOHNSON , NIXON , FORD , CARTER , REAGAN , BUSH l , CLINTON , AND BUSH II have not done .
LET US CALL FOR THE BREAKING OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BY SAYING NO .
We then absolve ourselves of the $ 51.9T which is owed to the Federal Reserve .
What freedom .
We will be dirt poor but we will have overcome a noose around the neck of every American citizen .
This is really OUR MOMENT OF OPPORTUNITY TO SET AMERICA FREE FROM BONDAGE !!!
Lastly , vote out your current Congressman or Senator if they vote for the proposed bailout .
If we fail in convincing our lawmakers , then after the Blueprint is passed we can expect a new currency , the Amero and a 50 % devaluation of the dollar as it is merged with Canada , Mexico and other countries in this hemisphere .
If that is not enough , the coming tax on services to pay for all the bailouts will add to our misery .
Will you be able to afford or stay in your home then ?
It will be too late .
Now is the time to BREAK THE BANK !

A couple disparate pieces of information have come together in a way that ’s potentially a little scary .
Earlier , Ann Ivins noted that :
Even with the terrible planning and deadly highway gridlock , San Antonio was full by the time Rita hit – and she was headed further north .
Galveston ’s already flooding .
There ’s no one here .
The hotels and motels along 37 and 35 have tons of rooms available ; I called three just now to check .
Why have n’t people been leaving ?
That is , there ought to be more evidence in the way of hotel bookings that Galveston has been abandoned .
Now
Ann updates this item by noting that , “ according to the mayor , Phil Hardberger , there are about 13,500 spaces available in four shelters , but he ’s saying that it does n’t look like that many will be needed , which makes me think that the evacuee load so far is much , much less than expected . ”
So they ’re not in San Antonio and they ’re not in the shelters .
Hmmm ….
Then Brian Angliss passes along some disturbing satellite imagery :
Brian says :
The Geospatial Intelligence Agency put these out .
Note that the last one – the one that shows nearly all of Galveston flooded – is at a 15 foot storm surge , and forecasts are for a 20 - 25 foot surge with 50 foot waves .
[ emphasis added ]
If all those people we ’d expect to be in San Antonio or in local shelters have opted to ride it out , we could be looking at an epic disaster .
Hopefully all those Galvestonians are out and simply went somewhere else .
If you have some insight , let us know .

Short version
Catch me if you can is a small library for OCaml 3.10 .
The latest release is version 0.2 , which you may find here .
This library improves management of errors in OCaml .
It is released under the LGPL licence .
It has been written by David Teller , Arnaud Spiwack , Till Varoquaux and Gabriel Scherer .
Long version
As all languages of the ML family — and most modern languages indeed — OCaml permits the management of exceptional situations using exceptions .
This mechanism lets programmer register protected sections of code , as well as exception handlers to handle any exception which may be raised during the execution of a protected section .
Whenever an exception is raised , the protected section of code is immediately stopped and the corresponding exception handler is executed instead .
In addition , exceptions may convey some information regarding the nature of the exceptional circumstance .
In OCaml , the mechanism is fast , it ’s convenient and it ’s type - safe , much like the rest of the language ( barring any type - unsafe interaction with C ) .
However , a few things are missing .
If we consider the rest of the language , exceptions are both heavyweight and clumsy : each exception must be declared before being used and there ’s no way to introduce a polymorphic type parameter in the exception .
In addition , languages such as Java offer to important features missing in OCaml : automatic case coverage and exception hierarchies .
While a nice tool exists to provide case coverage for exceptions in OCaml , this tool is complex and unfortunately unmaintained .
Catch me if you can offers an alternative mechanism , comparable to ML exceptions , to handle errors .
In comparison with OCaml ’s native exception mechanism , this library adds :
automatic inference of exceptions ( i.e. no need to declare your exceptions , unless you want to )
more flexible exceptions ( i.e. exceptions may have polymorphic type parameters , constraints , etc. )
hierarchies ( i.e. an IOException is a sub-case of Exception and a super - case of NetworkException )
case coverage ( i.e. the compiler can tell you if you forgot a case or sometimes if you wrote useless ones )
conditional success handlers ( i.e. do something with the result in case of success )
conditional success - and - failure handlers ( i.e. “ finally ” ) .
To attain this , we replace the mechanism of exceptions by an error monad , we replace exception constructors with polymorphic variants and we introduce a dose of syntactic sugar .
Examples
Expression evaluator
Let ’s write a simple expression evaluator for the following set of expressions :
type expr = | Value of float | Div of expr * expr |
Add of expr * expr |
Mult of expr * expr | Subs of expr * expr
These may be evaluated using the following function :
let rec eval = function | Value x -> x | Add ( x , y ) -> eval x +. eval y | Mult( x , y ) -> eval x *. eval y | Div( x , y ) -> eval x /. eval y | Subs( x , y ) -> eval x -. eval y
Of course , this function is bound to fail in case of division by zero .
While this is expected , there is nothing in the source code — much less in the type of the function — to let us know which exception will be raised in case of division by zero .
An alternative would be to add manual error checking , as follows :
type ( 'a , 'b ) result = |
Ok of ' a | Error of 'b let rec eval = function | Value x ->
OK x | Add ( x , y ) -> ( match eval x with | Error e -> Error e | Ok x ' -> match eval y with | Error e ->
Error e | Ok y' ->
Ok ( x ' +. y' ) ) | Mult ( x , y ) -> ( match eval x with | Error e -> Error e | Ok x ' -> match eval y with | Error e ->
Error e | Ok y' ->
Ok ( x ' *. y' ) ) | Div ( x , y ) -> ( match eval x with | Error e -> Error e | Ok x ' -> match eval y with | Error e ->
Error e | Ok y' -> if y' = 0 . then Error " Division by zero " else Ok ( x ' /. y ' ) ) | Subs ( x , y ) -> ( match eval x with | Error e -> Error e | Ok x ' -> match eval y with | Error e ->
Error e | Ok y' ->
Ok ( x ' -. y' ) ) ( * eval : expr -> ( float , string ) result * )
After this transformation , the type of the exception appears in the type of eval — here , we used strings , but anything else would have been fine .
Of course , the downside is that this is unreadable .
Well , what about the following ?
let rec eval = function | Value x -> return x | Add ( x , y ) -> perform with module Error x ' <-- eval x ; y ' <-- eval y ; return ( x ' +. y ') | Mult ( x , y ) -> perform with module Error x ' <-- eval x ; y ' <-- eval y ; return ( x ' *. y ') | Div ( x , y ) -> perform with module Error x ' <-- eval x ; y ' <-- eval y ; if y'=0 .
then throw " Division by zero " else return ( x ' /. y ' ) | Subs ( x , y ) -> perform with module Error x ' <-- eval x ; y ' <-- eval y ; return ( x ' -. y ') ( *eval : expr -> ( float , string ) result * )
This extract uses [ our customized version of ] Pa_monad ( included in the package ) , which brings syntactic support for monads .
While this is more verbose than the original version , it ’s also safer , insofar as we can guarantee that exceptions wo n’t remain uncaught .
Still too long ?
Then what about using the appropriate operators ?
open Error .
Operators let rec eval = function | Value x -> x | Add ( x , y ) -> eval x +. eval y | Mult( x , y ) -> eval x *. eval y | Div( x , y ) -> eval x /. eval y | Subs( x , y ) -> eval x -. eval y
Except for the module opening , that ’s the same thing as our first listing .
Just with the added safety .
Throwing , catching and hierarchies
By the way , the type of the result is
( *eval : expr -> ( float , [> ` Arithmetic of ( unit , [> ` Div_by_zero of ( unit , _ ) exc ] ) exc ] ) result *)
That is , eval may either succeed and return a float or fail and return an arithmetic exception , which also turns out to be a division by zero .
That ’s classes of exceptions .
With our syntactic sugar , raising such an exception is done by
throw ( exception Arithmetic ( ) ; Div_by_zero ( ) )
Note that we could have put some content instead of ( ) .
Note that exceptions are typed as they appear in the code and do n’t need to be declared ( if you wonder , polymorphic variants are involved in this ) .
Of course , various kinds of exceptions may be combined , as in the following extract :
match ... with | 1 -> throw ( exception Arithmetic ( ) ; Div_by_zero ( ) ) | 2 -> throw ( exception Arithmetic ( ) ; Overflow " by gosh ! " ) | 3 -> throw ( exception IO file_descr ) | ... (* ( ' a , [> ` Arithmetic of ( unit , [> ` Div_by_zero of ( unit , _ ) exc | ` Overflow of ( string , _ ) exc ] ) exc | `IO of ( int , [ ` > ] ) exc ] ) result * ) *)
While the type of the expression is difficult to read , catching is easy
attempt ... with | val s -> ( * success * ) | Arithmetic ( ) ; Div_by_zero ( ) -> ( * Division by zero* ) | Arithmetic ( ) ; _ -> (* Other arithmetic * ) | IO _ -> ( * Some IO stuff *) | finally _ ->
( * Do n't forget to close the door * )
This extract introduces three keywords :
attempt is our replacement for try
is our replacement for val is used to pattern - match against the result of a successful evaluation
is used to pattern - match against the result of a successful evaluation finally is used to pattern - match against the final result , whether this result was obtained after a successful evaluation or after an exception was raised and handled .
Unbreaking tail - recursion
The following extract is wrong :
let line_count filename = let rec loop file count = try ignore ( input_line file ) ; loop file ( count + 1 ) with End_of_file -> count in loop ( open_file filename ) 0
Do n’t get me wrong , it will compile and run .
The problem is that it ’s not tail - recursive .
In other words , it will be much slower and much more memory - consuming than if exceptions had been ignored .
Why ?
Because exception End_of_file may have been raised from the next call to loop , so the recursive call cannot be optimized into a non-recursive call .
Of course , exceptions ca n’t be ignored in this extract , as they are required to determine when to stop reading the file .
Now , a simple transformation would make the problem go away :
let line_count filename = let rec loop file count = let should_continue = try ignore ( input_line file ) ; true with End_of_file -> false in if should_continue then loop file ( count + 1 ) else count in loop ( open_file filename ) 0
Well , the transformation is simple , but it ’s annoying and hard to read .
What ’s even more annoying is that it ’s quite common .
With Catch me if you can , we would rather write the following :
let input_line2 x = Error.legacy input_line x let line_count filename = let rec loop file count = attempt input_line2 file with | val _ -> loop file ( count + 1 ) | _ -> count in loop ( open_file filename ) 0
In this extract , legacy is a simple manner of wrapping an existing , one - argument , function and convert it to our new exception style .
It ’s not quite as good as wrapping the function manually and giving it an actual exception , but it ’s better than nothing .
All in all , the resulting function line_count is shorter , easier to read , takes less memory and is also faster than the original .
What about performance ?
Now , that ’s a complex question .
Short answer : there ’s an acceptable performance loss .
False short answer : we wrote a paper on that subject .
When Psystar responded to Apple 's OpenComputer lawsuit last week , it came out that the company had retained law firm Carr & Ferrell LLP to defend it .
Carr & Ferrell happens to have had some success with lawsuits filed against Apple in the past , and Psystar 's move seems to have signaled the company 's willingness to tango with Apple .
And now , although Apple is n't saying anything about the case , one of the Carr & Ferrell lawyers spoke to Computerworld about where the case could go if Apple decides to tango as well .
According to attorney Colby Springer , the issue has been " mischaracterized " and is n't just about trademark or copyright infringement .
The other significant issue that could be involved is antitrust , which would likely be related to the Mac OS X licensing agreement .
Springer did n't say much about what such a defense would look like , although he did point out that Apple 's lead attorney has antitrust experience , and was on the legal team that won an antitrust suit against Microsoft .
If you 're curious about the antitrust defense for the OpenComputer might look like , Psystar 's claim would probably be that the Mac OS X EULA is a form of illegal tying ( making the sale of one good conditional on the sale of another ) , and thus is n't binding .
As you 're all well aware , I 'm no lawyer , but if you 'd like to learn a bit more about tying , the Department of Justice has a good article on the subject .
Of course , the case may never get this far and Psystar 's lawyers may take a different approach , so we 'll just have to wait and see if Springer 's plan gets put into action .
ABC managing director Mark Scott wants the ABC to run a digital channel to broadcast uncut media conferences , parliamentary hearings and public addresses .
Mr Scott flagged the possibility of a digital public affairs channel during a speech at the National Press Club in which he outlined his vision to provide more digital content to audiences in both broadcast and online mediums .
Mr Scott says while such a channel would not draw huge audiences , it would gain committed viewers and would represent an " unmediated demonstration of democracy in action " .
" I think there 's a real argument about making that service available free of charge into every Australian home , " he said .
" Let the cameras run , let the conversations be heard , do n't just give a 20 - second grab from a press conference , run the press conference , " he said .
" Let people see it in action , particularly around Parliament and I think state parliament . "
As well as broadcasting uncut conferences and speeches , the channel would also provide news and current affairs updates and would have the ability to go live with a breaking news story , Mr Scott said .
The ABC has previously asked for a dedicated children 's digital channel in addition to ABC 1 and ABC 2 .
Mr Scott did not detail how much the channel might cost but says the ABC is now in talks with the Federal Government for funding over the next three years .
" Our argument is that over 75 years the ABC has built this tremendous brand and connection with Australians , " he said .
" It is a great foundation for the future and now we have a once - in - a - generation opportunity to tap this potential and take up the opportunities offered by digital media . "
Mr Scott will not confirm how much funding the ABC is seeking but says discussions are under way with several ministers .
" I 've outlined that an investment in the ABC in terms of additional funding , and given the base we 're operating on , we think will reap enormous dividends , " he said .
Mr Scott also denied reports the ABC planned to put advertising on an ABC mobile phone site .
" If you want to go to another site hosted by a mobile phone provider like Telstra or Optus or others ... you will find ABC content there with advertising around it , just as you can see ABC TV programs that we 've shown on subscription television that has advertising around it too , " he said .
" But there is no plan to put advertising on an abc.net.au mobile site . "
I guess the CEOs felt Bush needed to make an appearance today so he made one .
A really , really brief one .
Bush usually makes time for questions to the press pool ; he calls them funny names and tries to make a joke or two , but instead today , he hurriedly ran off the stage .
I guess it 's tough to face the music when his administration is responsible for the worst economic collapse we 've seen since the Depression .
Usually he 'll make believe there really are no problems going on ( remember when he seemed oblivious to gas at $ 4 a gallon ? ) , but not today .

WH : THE PRESIDENT : The American people are concerned about the situation in our financial markets and our economy , and I share their concerns .
I 've canceled my travel today to stay in Washington , where I will continue to closely monitor the situation in our financial markets and consult with my economic advisors .
I spoke to Secretary Paulson this morning , and I will meet with him later on today .
After a day of gasps , guffaws and eyes rolled over John McCain ’s decision to reassign Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero to run an unnamed country in Latin America , it seems we are arriving at a rough consensus about what happened and what part of it matters .
As I posited earlier today , the most logical conclusion is that McCain simply did n’t understand the question and tried to wing it .
It may have been due to fatigue , lack of attention , confusion or simply an inability to penetrate the interviewer ’s fairly thick accent , or perhaps a combination of one or more of the above .
It is only if you insist on the preposterous assumption that McCain fully understood and grasped what the interviewer was asking him ( i.e. , the position of McCain ’s foreign policy advisor Randy Scheunemann ) that you have to conclude that McCain believes that Spain is a country in Latin America which may be bent on America ’s destruction .
In itself mishearing or misunderstanding a question is n’t the worse thing in the world , though being too proud to ask for the question to be repeated and going with the assumption that the mystery leader must be some Hugo Chavez type character out of Woody Allen ’s Bananas does suggest a certain recklessness of character .
The McCain campaign might simply have said that he was on the phone and did n’t understand .
But they ’re obviously unwilling to do that since they ’ve staked so much of his candidacy on his foreign policy chops .
In any case , a consensus appears to be emerging that the really shocking lapse was not the original gaffe but how the campaign chose to deal with it .
Rather than copping to the goof , they decided to stick to the nonsensical statements and risk , should McCain win in November , significant damage to our relations with a major NATO ally .
Coming to basically similar conclusions are Newsweek , Joe Klein in Time , Chris Orr at The New Republic and many others .
So to restate , I think the simplest explanation is that McCain did n’t understand what he was being asked .
And instead of trying to clarify , he assumed the interviewer , who had already asked him about Chavez and Castro , must be quizzing him on some other Latin American strongman who was up to no good .
As so often with McCain , he tried to wing it .
I think the available evidence is consistent which much less generous readings of the event .
But this read is plausible .
And Scheunemann , whose lack of experience in press work was painfully on display today , acted with characteristically knuckle - headed aggression and doubled - down on McCain ’s nonsensical statement .
And whatever the misunderstanding , let ’s face it .
When a president or presidential nominees gets confused in an interview , appears to say that a European country is in the Western Hemisphere and inadvertently makes highly belligerent statements toward a major ally , that ’s a big problem .

The U.S. policy of absorbing Georgia and Ukraine into NATO , which was enthusiastically embraced by Barack Obama and his running mate Joseph Biden , has undoubtedly been given a major boost by the Russian military operation in Georgia .
In the new narrative of the Russia - Georgia war emerging from op - eds and cable news commentaries , Georgia is portrayed as the innocent victim of Russian aggression fighting for its independence .
However , the political background to that war raises the troubling question of why the George W. Bush administration failed to heed warning signs that its policy of NATO expansion right up to Russia ’s ethnically troubled border with Georgia was both provocative to Russia and encouraging to a Georgian regime known to be bent on using force to recapture the secessionist territories .
There were plenty of signals that Russia would not acquiesce in the alignment of a militarily aggressive Georgia with a U.S. - dominated military alliance .
Then - Russian President Vladimir Putin made no secret of his view that this represented a move by the United States to infringe on Russia ’s security in the South Caucasus region .
In February 2007 , he asked rhetorically , " Against whom is this expansion intended ? "
Contrary to the portrayal of Russian policy as aimed at absorbing South Ossetia and Abkhazia into Russia and regime change in Georgia , Moscow had signaled right up to the eve of the NATO summit its readiness to reach a compromise along the lines of Taiwan ’s status in U.S. - China relations : formal recognition of the sovereignty over the secessionist territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in return for freedom to develop extensive economic and political relations .
But it was conditioned on Georgia staying out of NATO .
That compromise was disdained by Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili .
After a March 19 speech at the Atlantic Council in Washington , Saakashvili was asked whether Russia had offered a " Taiwan model " solution in return for Georgia stay out of NATO .
" We have heard many , many suggestions of this sort , " he said , but he insisted , " You can not compromise on these issues . "
Russia , meanwhile , had made it clear that it would respond to a move toward NATO membership for Georgia by moving toward official relations with the secessionist regions .
U.S. policymakers had decided long before those developments that the NATO expansion policy would include Georgia and Ukraine .
They convinced themselves that they were n’t threatening Russia but only contributing to a new European security order that was divorced from the old politics of spheres of interest .
But their view of NATO expansion appears to be marked by self - deception and naiveté .
The Bill Clinton administration had abandoned its original notion that Russia would be a " partner " in post - Cold War European security , and the NATO expansion policy had evolved into a de facto containment strategy .
Robert Hunter , former U.S. ambassador to NATO in the Clinton administration and head of a three - year project for the State Department on reform of the Georgian National Security Council , says the U.S. project of Georgia ’s membership in NATO " had to be seen by any serious observer as trying to substitute a Western sphere of influence for Russian " in that violence - prone border region of the Caucasus .
Some officials " wanted to shore up democracy , " said Hunter in an interview , imagining that NATO was " a kind of glorified Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe "  a negotiating and conflict - prevention body to which the Russian Federation belongs .
But there were also some in the administration who " genuinely wanted to contain the Russians by surrounding them , " he added .
James J. Townsend , director of the International Security Program at the Atlantic Council and formerly the Pentagon official in charge of European relations , said there was enthusiastic support in both the Defense Department and the State Department soon after Saakashvili took power in 2003 for integration of Georgia into NATO " as quickly as possible . "
Townsend believes the project to integrate Georgia and Ukraine into NATO gained momentum in part because Washington " was underestimating just how sensitive this is to Putin . "
U.S. policymakers , he said , had observed that in previous rounds of enlargement , despite " a lot of bluff and bluster by the Russians , " there was no Russian troop movement .
Furthermore , policymakers believed they were proving to the Russians that NATO expansion is not a threat to Russian interests , according to Townsend .
They did become aware of Russia ’s growing assertiveness on the issue , Townsend concedes , but policymakers thought they were simply " making trouble on everything in order to have some leverage . "
In the end , the bureaucracies pushing for NATO expansion were determined to push it through despite Russian opposition .
" I think it was a case of wanting to get Georgia engaged before the window of opportunity closed , " said Townsend .
To do so they had to ignore the risk that the promise of membership in NATO would only encourage Saakashvili , who had already vowed to " liberate " the South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions , to become even more sanguine about the use of force .
In the same March 19 speech in Washington , Saakashvili minimized the problem of Russian military power in the region .
He declared that the Russians " are not capable of enforcing the Taiwan model in Georgia .
Their army in the Caucasus is not strong enough to calm down the situation in their own territory .
I do n’t think they are ready for any kind of an adventure in somebody else ’s territory .
And hopefully they know it . "
It was a clear hint that Saakashvili , newly encouraged by Bush ’s strong support for NATO membership , believed he could face down the Russians .
At the NATO summit , Bush met resistance from Germany and other European allies , who insisted it was " not the right time " to even begin putting Georgia and Ukraine on the road to membership .
But in order to spare embarrassment to Bush , they offered a pledge that Georgia and Ukraine " will become NATO members . "
Hunter believes that NATO commitment was an even more provocative signal to Putin and Saakashvili than NATO approval of a " Membership Action Plan " for Georgia would have been .
The Russians responded exactly as they said they would , taking steps toward legal recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
And Saakashvili soon began making moves to prepare for a military assault on one or both regions .
In early July , Rice traveled to Tbilisi with the explicit intention of trying to rein him in .
In her July 10 press conference , she made it clear that Washington was alarmed by his military moves .
" The violence needs to stop , " said Rice .
" And whoever is perpetrating it  and I ’ve mentioned this to the president  there should not be violence . "
David L. Phillips , senior fellow at the Atlantic Council , told the Los Angeles Times last week he believes that , despite State Department efforts to restrain the Georgian president , " Saakashvili ’s buddies in the White House and the Office of the Vice President kept egging him on . "
But whether more specific encouragement took place or not , the deeper roots of the crisis lay in bureaucratic self - deceit about the objective expanding NATO up to the border of a highly suspicious and proud Russia in the context of an old and volatile ethnic conflict .

While doing some research for my decompiling session at Flash on the Beach , I came across this gem of a post on the Adobe ActionScript 3 message board .
Someone posts a block of code and asks “ I ’m getting 3 compiling errors when I test my flash movie : could you guys give me some advice on how to sort out these issues and correct them .
its driving me crazy trying to resolve the problem . ”
And then he posts the code .
And if you have ever decompiled any ActionScript code , it ’s painfully obvious what the guy is doing : he ’s ripping off someone else ’s code , then complaining in the Adobe forum that he can’t figure out why it wo n’t compile , and asking people to fix his broken , stolen code .
Here ’s a snippet of his code :
public function BEShell ( ) { 1 0 39 instance = this ; Logger. target = new FirebugTarget ( ) ; var _loc_1 :* = loaderInfo.loaderURL ; if ( _loc_1.indexOf ( " env1 " ) != - 1 || _loc_1.indexOf ( " Akqa " ) != - 1 || _loc_1.indexOf(" dev.site.com " ) != - 1 ) { } else { Logger.mode = Logger .
PRODUCTION_MODE ; stage.addEventListener(KeyboardEvent.KEY_UP , keyHandler ) ; }// end else if return ; }// end function
That ’s very clearly , without question , decompiled code .
It even has some extra line number information included in the dump !
And that ’s what was tripping the guy up .
He could n’t understand why that beginning line that starts with “ 1 0 39 … ” would n’t compile !
Sometimes I ’m just amazed by people .
Like , really ?
You have the balls to steal someone ’s code , then post it in a public forum and ask for help ?
And of course maybe I ’m totally off base , maybe the guy works for the company that originally wrote the code ( seems to be a Flash agency called AKQA ) and maybe he just got pulled in to fix some co-workers work and they lost the original source and they need to use decompiled code since that ’s all they have … yeah … maybe …

STOCKTON , Calif. , Sept. 28 ( UPI ) -- A Stockton , Calif. , newspaper Sunday endorsed Barack Obama for president , ending a 72 - year record of endorsing only Republicans for the office .
The Record , which did not endorse a presidential candidate in 1992 , has endorsed Republicans in every other White House election since 1940 , when it went for Wendell Willkie over President Franklin D. Roosevelt .
The newspaper had endorsed Roosevelt over Alf Landon in 1936 .

In an editorial , the newspaper said it backs Obama over Republican John McCain because Obama " has demonstrated he will think things through , seek advice and actually listen to it . "
" Obama is a gifted speaker , " the editorial said .
" But in addition to his smarts and energy , possibly his greatest gift is his ability to inspire . "
The Record said U.S. politics in the past eight years " has been marked by smears , fears and greed . "
" For too long , we 've practiced partisanship in Washington , not politics .
The result is a cynicism every bit as deep as that which infected the nation when Richard Nixon was shamed from office and when Bill Clinton brought shame to the office .
" This must end , but John McCain can't do it . "
Editor Mike Klocke wrote in Sunday 's edition of The Record that the editorial board was unanimous in its decision .

This article has the following :
In his turn , calling Azerbaijan as fraternal country , President of Uzbekistan noted that the two countries were close both historically and culturally .
“ It is difficult to find in the world two peoples tied with each other by their roots .
We can talk in our native language and we will always understand each other ” .
az men , uz men , tr ben ( I )
, uz , tr ( I ) az kömäk , uz kömäk , tr yardım ( help ) yardım
, uz , tr ( help ) yardım az barmaq , uz barmoq , tr parmak ( finger )
That 's pretty much the main gist of it , that people from both countries have quite an easy time understanding each other .
I would suspect that these ministers would have a much easier time understanding each other through all the interaction they 've already had with one another and other Turkic countries , giving them an instinct for which words are common to all and which are n't in the same way that Scandinavians more or less know which words to use and which to avoid when talking with one another .
Azeri and Uzbek certainly have a lot of terms common to each other that do n't exist in standard Turkish though .
Words like : But on the other hand there are also quite a few words that are common to Turkish and Azeri but do n't exist in Uzbek .
In any case , the languages are all quite similar and the general rule is that geographic proximity also means linguistic proximity , but it 's not a hard and fast rule ( see the Salar language for example , located inside China but much closer to standard Turkish than all the other languages that lie in between them ) .
Also note that Turkish is the only Turkic language that has a dominant standing in the country in which it is located .
Azerbaijan is the closest to this but the population is small enough that not many people learn Azeri , and all the other countries that use Turkic languages are still working on establisting their own languages under a lot of Russian influence .
Microsoft Office for example has finally been translated into Kazakh ; until now people there have had to make do with a Russian language version .
Uzbekistan is still getting used to the Latin alphabet and Kazakhstan might change over to the Latin alphabet soon , so the only real stable language in all this is standard Turkish .
The situation for these languages is of course much better than it was a few decades ago when these countries were a part of the Soviet Union , and they had no common script , which aside from a few holdouts such as Kazakh and Kyrgyz , has become the Latin alphabet .
Taking a look at this image for example one can see that Turkish +
Azeri +
Uzbek +
Turkmen = almost 80 % of the total population .
Tatar is interesting in that it uses the Cyrillic alphabet because it's the law in Russia , but their Wikipedia is in the Latin alphabet .
FX , the cable channel that is a cousin of the Fox network , also won two acting awards for its rookie - season drama “ Damages . ”

“ It really has been the ride of my career , ” Ms. Close said backstage after receiving her award .
“ This was as good as any part you would find in a feature film .
I ca n’t wait to see where our writers take us this year . ”
The viewers of all those cable series added together might not total the number that watched the Emmy broadcast .
But television executives are nothing if not optimistic , and if anything , the performance of the five reality - show hosts who together played masters of ceremony on the awards show might inspire the executives not to abandon scripted television .
With the addition this year of a new category for best reality - show host , the producers of the Emmys decided to have the five nominees share the burden of master of ceremony for the awards show .
But it was only a few minutes into the show when , with the Nokia Theater audience alarmingly silent in reaction to the hosts ’ failed attempts at a humorous opening , Howie Mandel , one of the hosts , quipped : “ The government can not even bail us out of this . ”
Home prices in August were a record 9.5 % lower than a year earlier , but the lower prices lured more buyers , shrinking the backlog of unsold homes and raising hopes that the housing market might be close to turning the corner .
The median price nationwide was $ 203,100 vs. $ 224,400 a year ago , the National Association of Realtors said .
The percentage drop was steepest in the West at 24 % .
Prices dipped 3.4 % in the South , 5.6 % in the Midwest and 3.8 % in the Northeast .
" We 're back to a level of affordability we have n't seen in three years , " says Joel Naroff , president of Naroff Economic Advisors .
" We 've wiped out a good portion of the ( housing ) bubble . "
The price plunge largely reflects fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis , with nearly 40 % of homes on the market in foreclosure or sold for less than the mortgage value , the Realtors group says .
The good news :
Fire sale prices are attracting buyers , especially in the West and Southeast .
Sales nearly doubled in California markets such as San Diego , Sacramento and Riverside , as well as in Las Vegas and Fort Myers , Fla .
That helped slash the number of unsold homes at the end of August by 7 % to 4.3 million , or a 10.4 - month supply , down from 10.9 months in July .
That 's still much higher than a typical six - month supply .
" At least it 's moving in the right direction , " says Lawrence Yun , chief economist of the NAR , adding he expects the trend to continue the rest of the year .
" The only way to get price stabilization is to get the inventory down . "
Another sign the market may be bottoming , Naroff says , is that home sales in August fell only 2.2 % from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.9 million .
Sales the past 10 months generally have been stable , he says .
Yet , only a limited number of buyers are taking advantage of the moderating prices because of tight lending criteria and higher interest rates , especially from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The government takeover of the mortgage finance giants should ease credit standards and attract more buyers , Yun says .
Both Yun and Naroff predicted home prices could fall another 5 % or so this year before mounting a rebound early next year .
Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , is less sanguine .
He notes that the shrinking inventory can largely be traced to fewer home listings because of the weak market .
He does n't see a turnaround until " well into 2009 . "

WASHINGTON 
The federal government is spending more money on veterans than at any time in modern history , surpassing the tidal wave of spending following World War II and the demilitarizing of millions of troops .
Expenditures hit $ 82 billion in 2007 , because of the rising cost of health care , the expense of caring for an aging population of mostly Vietnam War veterans and a new crop of severely wounded troops from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
That exceeds the $ 80 billion in inflation - adjusted dollars spent in 1947 after most of the 16.1 million Americans serving in World War II left the service , according to a Congressional Research Service report submitted to Congress last month .
An 11 % hike in spending to $ 91 billion is slated for this fiscal year , and the Department of Veterans Affairs has proposed $ 94 billion for 2009 .
And still more is needed , says U.S. Sen .
Patty Murray , D - Wash . , who is seeking another $ 3.3 billion for the 2009 budget proposal .
" While we are spending more than in previous years , we are still not meeting many of the health care and benefits needs of our veterans , " Murray says .
Last month 's passage of a new G.I.
Bill will add $ 100 billion in education benefits for veterans over the next 10 years , the Congressional Budget Office says .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain and his Democratic opponent Barack Obama clashed over the bill last month .
McCain opposed it , saying its increased education benefits might encourage troops to leave the military .
Obama backed the bill , saying it would boost the number of people interested in serving .
Also , medical costs could climb because of unanticipated long - term problems from wounds such as traumatic brain injuries , which remain little understood , says Adrian Atizado , assistant legislative director with the Disabled American Veterans .
Annual costs for a severe head injury can reach $ 400,000 , according to a RAND Corp. study released this year .
About 1.6 million Americans have served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
About 325,000 of those veterans use VA health care , records show .
There are 5.5 million veterans of all ages now receiving VA health care and 2.9 million receiving compensation .
Those populations overlap and the VA does not have a current figure on total number of veterans served .
Costs soared in 1947 because of a massive exodus of troops from the military , all entitled to education , training and loan guarantee benefits under the then - new G.I.
Bill , the report says .
Actual dollars spent in 1947 were $ 8.4 billion , the report says .
Then , health care was only 12 % of the veterans budget , says Dan Tucker , deputy assistant secretary for budget at the Department of Veterans Affairs .
Now health care costs make up 44 % of the budget .
Costs fell precipitously after 1947 , surging slightly in 1975 - 76 because of Vietnam - era veterans , the report says .
Roughly a third of the nation 's 23.5 million veterans served in Vietnam .

It seems that Apple has chosen this week to rain on the parades of quite a few developers , one of whom is Al Sokirynsky , developer of the Podcaster podcast streaming and downloading application that never quite made its way to the App Store .
Sokirynsky has been selling licenses for $ 9.99 using the Ad Hoc option in iTunes , allowing him to send copies to users without going through the App Store .
However , Apple was n't willing to leave the Podcaster app alone .
Based on a notice on the Podcaster site , AppleInsider has the latest development in the saga : Apple is now blocking this form of Ad Hoc distribution and licensing of the app .
The move to Ad Hoc distribution came after Apple rejected Podcaster 's App Store listing , saying that the app duplicated iTunes ' functionality .
Following the rejection , Sokirynsky turned to the Ad Hoc distribution system and offered licenses in exchange for a " donation , " sans the 30 percent cut for Apple .
The company has now shut down Sokirynsky 's ability to create ad hoc licenses for the app , but has n't actually explained why it felt the need to prohibit both App Store and Ad Hoc distribution in the first place .
On the bright side , the application is still working , so Apple appears to have only disabled the ability to grant new licenses .
If Podcaster 's App Store rejection was , in the words of David Chartier , an " anti-competitive " move , then I 'm not even sure what this latest step is .
Apple is now exerting control over multiple distribution channels for iPhone application .
Additionally , Apple 's enforcement of this type of app monopoly could be dangerous for the company .
Aside from developers chafing at a further exercise of power ( also aided by the extension of the NDA ) , continual enforcement of App Store rejections could stifle the development of some applications ;
Apple is essentially saying that if it does n't like your application , you 'll never be able to sell it .
That statement right there makes Android 's application market look pretty attractive , but Apple should n't risk pushing devs away like this .

Amazon ( NSDQ : AMZN ) has finally done what many have been asking it since the time the company bought IMDB : it has enabled video on the film and TV database / info site .
The company says users can now watch 6,000 full - length feature films and TV episodes for free on IMDb. com ’s video section .
Would be interesting to figure out how many of the videos from Amazon VOD service on being ported over to IMDB … guess would be a low figure , as it is likely IMDB video would be used more as a promotional tool .
It even says so in the release :
The rotating video content is provided by * CBS * , Hulu , * Sony * Pictures Television and about 500 indie filmmakers .
The content includes shows like “ 24 ” , “ The Office ” ( both from Hulu ) , “ Beverly Hills 90210 ” , “ Star Trek ” , and movies such as “ Fever Pitch ” , “ Bring it On ” and others .
Just last week the news came out that Amazon hired away * Microsoft * ad vet Lisa Utzschneider to head its online ad sales , and IMDB video will be a part of that effort as well .
Earlier this year Amazon bought indie movie distribution site Withoutabox , with the plans of integrating it with IMDB .
As part of that , the database site now says it is opening its platform to filmmakers and rights owners worldwide , and asking them to upload their movies / shows on it .
More details in the release .
Walter ( Killer ) Kowalski , one of professional wrestling ’s biggest stars and most hated villains when wrestlers offered a nightly menu of mayhem in the early years of television , died Saturday in Everett , Mass .
He was 81 .
Kowalski’s death was announced by his wife , Theresa , who said he had been hospitalized since a heart attack in early August .
At 6 feet 7 inches and 275 pounds or so , Kowalski was a formidable figure who delighted in applying his claw hold , a thumb squeeze to an opponent ’s solar plexus , when he was not leaping from the top strand of the ropes and descending on his foe ’s chest .
Emerging as a featured performer in the early 1950s , he became a TV celebrity with wrestlers like Antonino Rocca , Lou Thesz , Gorgeous George , Haystacks Calhoun and Nature Boy Buddy Rogers .

Is Google evil ?
One virtual supercomputer , tended by one company , is all the world needs .
Or so Google proposes , as it gently , ineluctably , pulls us in .
The more we use Google , the less we need computing power on our desk or lap and the less we need any software other than Google's .
From its start , Google has set for itself the mission of organizing all the world 's information .
Not some .
All .
In its first 10 years , it has shown no hesitation in tackling the largest scale computing challenges it can find .
This company does not scare .
Add enough servers to store 1 trillion Web pages ?
Done .
Scan every book in print ?
Well underway .
Create the world 's largest photo album - of the entire Earth ?
No problem .
Become the No. 1 destination for online video ?
Easy ; write a $ 1.6 billion check , made out to " YouTube . "
Secretly develop its own Web browser and catch the tech world by complete surprise ?

This year , the most significant announcement for Google was just made : the commercial release of T - Mobile 's G1 phone , the first cell phone that uses Android , Google 's new operating system for mobile phones .
If Android software developers fill in some missing pieces , an Android phone will jump ahead of the iPhone in capabilities and features .
Its significance is n't in comparisons to other phones , however , but in the way it sets Google up for the future .
Google already possesses the world 's most powerful network of computing machines , harnessed together to function as the world 's most heavily used supercomputer .
What it needs is a way to bring ever - more users to its services , wherever they happen to be , any place , any time .
The limited , cell phone - only versions of software that we have in our so - called " smart " phones will not suffice .
Android is intended to bring the Google supercomputer to everyone 's palm .
Google is not only assiduously collecting vast archives of information , but is also using its massive computing power to take on more and more software tasks we now use our personal computers for .
The company has been making huge investments designed to hasten the shift from computing on desktop and laptop machines to computing in what 's being called " the cloud , " remote servers whose exact location we never know but can be accessed wherever we have an Internet connection .
Microsoft has seen this shift to cloud computing coming for a long time , but has been slow to adapt .
The shift demands that Microsoft move in exactly the opposite direction from that which led it to dominance .
Microsoft 's founding mission was to put " a computer on every desk and in every home , " in essence to decentralize computing , bringing it from the mainframe into our homes .
Google is re-centralizing computing .
Which leads to the question , in light of Google 's audacious information collecting , why were we ever scared of the Microsoft Evil Empire ?
At the apogee of Microsoft 's power , its ability to know what its customers were doing was nil .
Our information was privately stored on our PCs .
But if you discard Word and Excel for Google 's Docs and Spreadsheets , your files sit on Google 's computers .
And if you avail yourself of Google 's array of other free services , so do your personal calendar , your e-mail , your online shopping history , personal photos , health records and stock portfolio .
It 's a certainty more offerings will come .
Google has made clear that it has no intention of excluding anything .
Were the federal government to embark on collecting a cross- indexed collection of records of our lives with the same zeal as Google , how comfortable would we feel ?
Now , take away the accountability and transparency that we demand of our government and put the same information into an impenetrable black box held snugly by a for - profit company .
It 's a bit unsettling , no ?
We 've never faced the concentration of personal information in a single institution like this before .
We even lack a basic vocabulary for describing the phenomenon :
What Google is collecting cannot be measured by " market share , " nor does it raise antitrust questions in any conventional sense .
Whether we even want to restrict Google 's information - gathering activities is a difficult question .
One confounding aspect of Google 's supercomputer is that the more information it collects , the smarter its algorithm becomes - and the more useful we find its services .
The Googleplex is moving with untiring energy in collecting , processing - and commercializing - our most personal information .
The outstanding question that we must consider is whether a privately controlled storehouse of so much personal information constitutes a concentration of power that begs for public oversight .
Trust Us is not an acceptable substitute .
Jason de Caires Taylor is an artist that creates unique underwater sculptures that focus on natural ecological processes .
He has a series of work called Vicissitudes that " depicts a circle of figures , all linked through holding hands .
These are life - size casts taken from a group of children of diverse ethnic background .
Circular in structure and located five meters below the surface , the work both withstands strong currents and replicates one of the primary geometric shapes , evoking ideas of unity and continuum . ”
“ The sculpture proposes growth , chance , and natural transformation .
It shows how time and environment impact on and shape the physical body .
Children by nature are adaptive to their surroundings .
Their use within the work highlights the importance of creating a sustainable and well - managed environment , a space for future generations .
Taylor notes that close to forty percent of coral reefs worldwide has been destroyed and that this figure is set to increase .
His work reminds us that the marine environment is in a constant state of flux , and that this in turn reflects poignantly the vicissitudes , changing landscapes , of our own lives . ”
Grace Reef consists of sixteen figures cast from the body of a Grenadian woman .
These figures are located across a large area of the ocean floor and depicts the continuing evolution of the island and its people .
Sometimes with the currents in the ocean , some of the sculptures become hidden or covered and at other times the figures emerge and are highly visible .
" The Lost Correspondent depicts a man sitting at a desk with a typewriter .
The desk is covered with a collection of newspaper articles and cuttings that date back to the 1970s .
Many of these have political significance , a number detail Grenada ’s alignment with Cuba in the period immediately prior to the revolution .
The work informs the rapid changes in communication between generations .
Taking the form of a traditional correspondent , the lone figure becomes little more than a relic , a fossil in a lost world . "
It ’s like a haunted house under the water .
I love the idea that nature changes these sculptures to give them a totally different look than what they once were .
These sculptures are full of mystery , just like the ocean .
My favorite is the Lost Correspondent , mainly because sometimes I just feel like sitting at the bottom of the ocean , too .
Many thanks to Jason de Caires Taylor !
Quick and Dirty JSON Speed Testing in Python
[ See updated post for analysis using timeit ]
As per Poromenos ‘ request on Reddit , I decided to do a bit of expansion on my cryptic comment about the major json packages in python ( simplejson , cjson , demjson ) :
My conclusion : use demjson if you really really want to make sure everything is right , and you do n’t care at all about time .
Use simplejson if you ’re in the 99 % of all users who want reasonable performance over a broad range of objects , and use enhanced cjson 1.0.3 x if you in the came with reasonable json inputs , and you need much faster ( 10 x ) speed ….
that is , if the json step is the bottleneck .
More worrisome — demjson did n’t handle the unicode string I threw at it properly …
The Test Setup
Python 2.4.3 on 64 - bit Linux
simplejson : 1.9.2 , with c-extensions turned on .*
demjson : 1.3
cjson : enhanced cjson 1.0.3×6 from http://python.cx.hu/python-cjson/
( We need the enhanced version for the simplified “ encode using utf - 8 ” interface . )
* To test for simplejson c-extensions :
> assert getattr ( simplejson , ‘ _speedups ’ , None ) , “ no speedups enabled ”
Test Code
## simple json testing import simplejson import cjson import demjson class A ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self.var1 = 1 self.var2 = dict( a=1, b=2,c=3 ) ## TEST DATA set_ = set ( [ 1,2,3,4 ] ) nested_dict = dict ( v1 = " a " , v2= " b " , v3=dict ( n1=1,n2=2,n3=3 ) ) ustring = u " a string with some unicod Andre \202 " # In case anyone is wondering , unicod is a text - encoding used by Nova Scotian fishermen .
class_= A ( ) ## Dump and load methods dumps = { " simplejson " : simplejson.dumps , " cjson " : lambda x : cjson.encode( x , encoding = " utf - 8 " ) , " demjson " : demjson.encode } loads = { " simplejson " : simplejson.loads , " cjson " : lambda x : cjson.decode( x , encoding = " utf - 8 " ) , " demjson " : demjson.decode } ##
Can the functions handle different data types for thing_name in ( " set_ " , " nested_dict " , " ustring " , " class_ " , ) : thing = eval ( thing_name ) for k , fun in dumps.iteritems ( ) : try : out = fun( thing ) print " SUCCESS : %s enocdes %s " % ( k , thing_name ) print out except Exception , e : print " ERROR : %s failed to enocde %s " % ( k , thing_name ) print " ERROR : " , e ## Profiling code from profile import run for thing_name in ( " nested_dict " , " ustring " , ) : thing = eval ( thing_name ) for k , fun in dumps.iteritems ( ) : print k , thing_name run ( " for ii in xrange ( 10000 ) : fun( thing ) " )
Capability Results
All handled the nested dict fine , demjson was most compact , as advertised .
demjson improperly encoded the unicode string ( any ideas why anyone ? )
demjson encoded the set as a list , all others failed to encode it .
All failed to encode the class instance , as expected .
ERROR : cjson failed to enocde set_ ERROR : object is not JSON encodable SUCCESS : demjson enocdes set_ [ 1,2,3,4 ] ERROR : simplejson failed to enocde set_ ERROR : set ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] ) is not JSON serializable SUCCESS : cjson enocdes nested_dict { " v1 " : " a " , " v2 " : " b " , " v3 " : { " n1 " : 1 , " n2 " : 2 , " n3 " : 3}} SUCCESS : demjson enocdes nested_dict { " v1 " : " a " , " v2 " : " b " , " v3 " : {" n1 " : 1 , " n2 " : 2, " n3" :3}} SUCCESS : simplejson enocdes nested_dict { " v1 " : " a " , " v2 " : " b " , " v3 " : { " n1 " : 1 , " n2 " : 2 , " n3 " : 3}} SUCCESS : cjson enocdes ustring " a string with some unicod Andre\u0082 " SUCCESS : demjson enocdes ustring " a string with some unicod Andre " SUCCESS : simplejson enocdes ustring " a string with some unicod Andre\u0082 " ERROR : cjson failed to enocde class_ ERROR : object is not JSON encodable ERROR : demjson failed to enocde class_ ERROR : ( ' can not encode object into a JSON representation ' , < __main__ . A object at 0x2aaaae9e2b90 > ) ERROR : simplejson failed to enocde class_
ERROR : < __main__ .
A object at 0x2aaaae9e2b90 > is not JSON serializable
Timing Results

Final Conclusion
I also think simplejson is pretty rad …
In the applications I use it for , json conversion is one of the bottlenecks ( rather than network timing for example ) , and I have very well - defined / trusted input / output , so I use cjson-enhanced .

Rep. Marcy Kaptur ( D - OH ) warns the American people about Constitutional enemies of the Republic and the fraudulent trillion ( s ) dollar bailout …
“ My message to the American people do n’t let Congress seal this deal .
High financial crimes have been committed . ”
“ The normal legislative process has been shelved .
Only a few insiders are doing the dealing , sounds like insider trading to me .
These criminals have so much political power than can shut down the normal legislative process of the highest law making body of this land . ”
“ We are Constitutionally sworn to protect and defend this Republic against all enemies foreign and domestic .
And my friends there are enemies . ”
“ The people pushing this deal are the very ones who are responsible for the implosion on Wall Street .
They were fraudulent then and they are fraudulent now . ”

CONTEMPT ….
After the initial dust settles on a presidential candidate debate , Phase II begins — the media moves beyond who said what , and starts looking for some overlooked trend to obsess over .
The quintessential example was , of course , Al Gore “ sighing ” during the first of the three debates in 2000 .
A few people noticed Gore ’s breathing the night of the debate , but a day or two later , it became the story .
To a lesser extent , Bush ’s bizarre facial features , and the apparent bump under his suit jacket , became fodder for discussion four years ago .
So , what ’s the stylistic story from last night ?
It may be John McCain ’s willingness to be … what ’s the word I ’m looking for … something of a jerk .
As Josh Marshall noted , “ McCain ’s unwillingness to make eye contact with Obama through the debate seems to be getting picked up by a lot of observers . ”
It does , indeed .
The specific and unusual rules of last night ’s debate were intended to generate more interaction between the two candidates .
Jim Lehrer seemed intent , at least early on , to get the two to engage each other directly .
Obama mostly spoke to the camera last night , but he did n’t hesitate to speak directly to McCain .
McCain , on the other hand , went out of his way , it seemed , to not even look in Obama ’s direction .
Chris Matthews described this as a sign of “ contempt , ” which struck me as the right description .
Others noticed the same trend .
The Washington Post ’s Tom Shales noted , for example , that McCain “ seemed determined to avoid even looking at Obama as the debate went on . ”
I seriously doubt this takes on the significance of the media ’s insane fascination with Gore ’s “ sighs , ” but as the second phase begins , do n’t be surprised if we hear more about this .

Three years ago the streets of the quiet and sleepy north - east Indian towns of Tura and Williamnagar reverberated to the sound of rifle fire as police shot dead nine protesters .
They were the single largest acts of violence in the towns since independence from the British .
Friday 30 September 2005 became known locally as " Black Friday " .
On the third anniversary of the shootings a different sound is being heard through the streets .
It is the sound of the song " Black Friday " by a well - known local rock group , Northwind .
The song has rapidly acquired cult following in the western part of Meghalaya since it was written in honour of those who died .
Extremely unpopular
But not everyone is a fan of this particular rock anthem .
The band 's manager , Dipu Marak , says that he has received anonymous warnings by text message not to distribute the song for broadcast on local radio or TV in the days immediately preceding and succeeding the anniversary .
" The events of that day will forever remain etched in our memories , " said Mr Marak .
The band has a cult following in the north - east of India

The students were protesting against the decision of the state government to transfer the education board from Tura to the state capital , Shillong .
Such a move was extremely unpopular in the west of Meghalaya because the area is predominantly made up of members of the Garo tribe - whereas the east of the state including Shillong is mostly inhabited by members of the Khasi tribe .
Protesters complained that the transfer meant that the west of Meghalaya was left with no government departments - all had been transferred to the east .
" I attended the demonstration that was held in a sports stadium Tura .
There was a large , confused and angry crowd which the police were poorly trained to deal with , " Mr Marak says .
" They panicked and opened fire without much provocation , " he says , pointing to bullet marks that can still be seen in and around the stadium .
Bullet holes from the shootings can still be seen in Tura " Some students were shot in the back as they ran away .
It was like the killing fields . "
A similar protest was held in nearby Williamnagar , 75 km from Tura ( 47 miles ) with a similar police reaction .
In addition to those killed , 160 students were injured in both towns .
Mr Marak says that it is not clear who has been sending the anonymous threats over the broadcast of the song , " Black Friday " .
The police say they had no option but to open fire when students attacked them .
At the time of the shootings , the Deputy Inspector General of the Garo Hills range , Vijay Kumar , told the BBC from Tura that the Garo Students Union ( GSU ) was not given permission to hold a rally .
Despite that , he said , hundreds of people gathered in Tura and threw stones at police - injuring several officers - before the order to fire was given .
The police version of events is strongly contested by the protesters who say that police did initially give permission for the demonstration but then revoked it without letting them know .
' Painful screams ' " I do n't suppose we will ever know , " Mr Marak says .
" But one thing is certain , the police were and are very embarrassed about what happened on that fateful day .
It 's clear they totally over - reacted and have the blood of innocent protesters on their hands . "
The band are idolised in Meghalaya Northwind 's vocalist Reynold M Sangma says memories of the violence remain vivid despite the passing of the years .
" The sound of gunfire and the painful screams still echo in my ears till today .
It will haunt me until the end of my life , " he said .
Rhythm guitarist
Tete S Momin feels equally passionate about the events leading up to and after the shootings .
" What pains the people most now is the denial of justice ... police and government officials responsible for the massacre have never been brought to justice , " he said .
Bass guitarist Jeetu N Marak says that the " Black Friday " is a tribute to " the fallen heroes of our tribe , who died defending and fighting for our rights " .
The song was written during the curfew which was imposed for more than a month after the violence and was first aired publicly on the first anniversary of the killings .
" The people loved the song and thanked us for reflecting the tragic incidents of that day .
However , we received threatening and abusive text messages from unknown senders , warning us not to play the song ever again , " Mr Marak said .
" But we will not be intimidated and will play the song again on 30th September 2008 , no matter what happens .
As long as we are supported by the people , we will not be afraid of anyone . "
The use of music in a state like Meghalaya is bound to be powerful tool of protest .
It is renowned for its love of rock and roll , reggae , blues , country and rock .
Observers believe the state got its love of melody because of its strong Christian missionary movement and consequent natural affinity to western cultural mores .
Now they have embraced another Western popular tradition - protest singing - and the trend seems to be catching on .

What are these ?
Ignorance
Curiosity
Confidence
Just before someone dies , they often have the chance to utter a few words .
They are then referred to as " So - and - so 's Last Words " and usually they will be remembered by those words .
Last words can be famous or thought provoking , but in many cases they can be absolutely stupid .
The stupid last words are what I 'll be rambling about , because they too can offer insight into a person 's life .
Stupid last words can be classified into 3 main categories : Curiosity , Confidence , and Ignorance .
Mostly the last words in these categories are spoken by people who did n't die of natural causes .
We 'll go into each of these , and show you some examples .
This is when a person does n't know that what he or she is about to do will eventually kill them .
Death in these cases can be accidental , or directly as a result of that individual 's ignorance .
Some examples are :
And then ...
Dead ...
We 've all hear the saying : curiosity killed the cat .
Unfortunately , curiosity killed a lot more than just cats .
Most cases of death here are very closely tied with ignorance ; so close , in fact , that it 's sometimes quite hard to make the distinction .
And then ...
Dead ... Confidence has to be the topper when it comes to stupid ways of dying .
If that person were to somehow come back after death , I assure you , all confidence has been lost .
And then ...
Dead ... Now you make sure that when your time comes , do n't say something stupid .
If you have more ideas about last words that fit into these or other categories , be sure to add them in the comments .
Abramoff 's assistance led to other corruption convictions
Former Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff has been sentenced to four years in prison for corruption .
Abramoff had pleaded guilty in a Washington court to charges of trading expensive gifts , meals and sports trips in exchange for political favours .
The case caused a scandal in Washington and sparked off a wide - ranging public corruption probe .
Abramoff is already serving a six - year term for his role in an unrelated fraudulent Florida casino deal .
' Changed man '
The court had heard how Abramoff made tens of millions of dollars by steering clients to consultants who charged excessive fees and then split the profits with him .
Abramoff had faced a possible 11 - year sentence but was shown leniency because of his cooperation in other corruption cases .
In 3,000 hours of interviews with the FBI , he gave information leading to the conviction of a string of lawmakers and high - profile political figures , including one member of Congress .
Abramoff told the court that he was " a broken man " and pleaded for leniency , saying it was " amazing for me to see how far I strayed and how I did not see it at the time " .
He said that much of the activity of Washington " lives in the loopholes " but that he had " blundered farther than even those excesses would allow " .
The BBC's Richard Lister in Washington says that the scandal was a disaster for the Republican party , leading to their loss of control in Congress in 2006 .
But , our correspondent says , the case is unlikely to have any impact on the current race for the White House .
Abramoff 's current jail term relates to the faking of a wire transfer to obtain loans to buy a fleet of casino boats .
Political conservatives operate out of a fear of chaos and absence of order while political liberals operate out of a fear of emptiness , a new Northwestern University study soon to be published in the Journal of Research in Personality finds .
“ Social scientists long have assumed that liberals are more rational and less fearful than conservatives , but we find that both groups view the world as a dangerous place , ” says Dan McAdams , study co-author and professor of human development and psychology at Northwestern University .
“ It ’s just that their fears emerge differently . ”
To better understand the differences between politically conservative Christian Americans and their liberal counterparts , McAdams and Northwestern University co-author Michelle Albaugh asked 128 socially active churchgoers this question :
What if there were no God ?
“ Social scientists — who are generally liberals — have for decades done research to figure out what makes conservatives tick , ” says McAdams .
The study , “ What if there Were No God ?
Politically Conservative and Liberal Christians Imagine their Lives without Faith , ” now is available online to subscribers to the journal .
Like the Northwestern study , the preponderance of research finds that conservatives fear unchecked human impulses that challenge the status quo .
What McAdams and Northwestern researcher Albaugh also find is an underlying , but different , fear that drives liberals as well .
“ Political conservatives envision a world without God in which baser human impulses go unchecked , social institutions ( marriage , government , family ) fall apart and chaos ensues , ” says McAdams .
Liberals , on the other hand , envision a world without God as barren , lifeless , devoid of color and reasons to live .
“ Liberals see their faith as something that fills them up and , without it , they conjure up metaphors of emptiness , depletion and scarcity , ” McAdams said .
“ While conservatives worry about societal collapse , liberals worry about a world without deep feelings and intense experiences . ”
The study findings may shed light on why conservatives prefer more authoritarian leaders while liberals do not , he adds .
“ What ’s clear is that it is their political and not religious orientation that underlies the different psychologies of political conservatives and liberals , ” says McAdams .
After all , all of the adults he and Northwestern researcher Albaugh studied were members of churches , and their data suggested that most were socially involved , altruistic people .
The Northwestern University study sample included 128 highly religious and politically active Americans who attend church regularly .
Although nationally conservatives are more likely to attend church than liberals , the Northwestern study was set up to sample equally from religious conservatives and religious liberals .
The researchers also observed gender differences , but said they did not interfere with the relationship between political orientation and narrative themes .
The study is part of a larger project that looks at the relationships of faith , politics and life stories in well - functioning American adults .
It is funded by the Foley Family Foundation in Milwaukee .
Pelosi : Bush ignores the American people but cannot ignore Iraqi PM Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday July 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has called on President Bush to heed Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki 's statement yesterday that he expects any pending troop deal with the United States to include a timetable for withdrawal .
" A bipartisan majority in Congress  representing the wishes of the American people  supports a timetable for redeployment as an essential step in ending the Iraq war , " Pelosi wrote on her official blog on Tuesday .
" President Bush refuses to listen to Congress or the American people , but he cannot support Iraqi political reconciliation and security and ignore Iraqi Prime Minister Malikis call for a timetable for the withdrawal . "
Iraq 's national security adviser Mouwaffak al - Rubaie has now joined Maliki in stating that Iraq will not accept any memorandum of understanding without specific dates for withdrawal .
The United Nations mandate which allows US troops to be in Iraq will expire at the end of 2008 , and Bush and Maliki have agreed that a Status of Forces Agreement setting out the terms under which they remain must be signed by July 31 , leaving little time for negotiations to iron out the many remaining issues .

If you want to know how to scam the world into doing your bidding , study the 1962 film The Music Man .
In it , “ Professor ” Harold Hill , played brilliantly by Robert Preston , is a traveling salesman and con artist who convinces a small Iowa town that juvenile delinquency is threatening their very way of life .
The threat comes in the form of the insidious , corrupting influence of a pool table .
To remedy the situation , the citizens are convinced that they must put their children in a marching band led by non other than Professor Hill .
Of course to even get started , the parents must buy instruments and uniforms from … Professor Hill .
If you think this is just a quaint old movie , think again .
The Music Man provides the blueprint for the electoral strategies of both the Republican and Democratic parties .
Find a problem that is either small or imaginary , blow it all out of proportion , and claim that you are the only one who can solve it .
Yes , that 's right folks .
We 've got trouble … right here in the land of the free …with a capitol “ T ” and that rhymes with “ G ” and that stands for Global Warming / Terrorism !
Sing along , everybody :
Seventy six Marine brigades in Afghanistan
A hundred percent carbon tax right behind
Followed by years and years of the pols exploiting fears
That were mostly or completely in your mind !
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A former Army commander who underwent a sex change operation was discriminated against by the U.S. government , a federal judge ruled Friday in an important victory for transgenders claiming bias in the workplace .
Diane Schroer won her federal lawsuit against the Library of Congress after officials backed out of a 2005 job offer when told of her intention to become a transsexual .
At the time of the job interview for a position as a senior terrorism research analyst , David Schroer was a male .
He had been a onetime Army Special Forces commander .
U.S. District Court Judge James Robinson said Schroer 's civil rights were violated .
" The evidence established that the Library was enthusiastic about hiring David Schroer -- until she disclosed her transsexuality , " Robinson wrote .
" The Library revoked the offer when it learned that a man named David intended to become , legally , culturally and physically , a woman named Diane .
This was discrimination ' because of ... sex . ' "
The judge will later rule on what financial damages Schroer is due .
" It is especially gratifying that the court has ruled that discriminating against someone for transitioning is illegal , " said Schroer in a statement from the ACLU , which represented her in court .
" I knew all along that the 25 years of experience I gained defending our country did n't disappear when I transitioned , so it was hard to understand why I was being turned down for a job doing what I do best just because I 'm transgender .
It is tremendously gratifying to have your faith in this country , and what is fundamentally right and fair , be reaffirmed . "
After Schroer had retired from the military , she applied for a job at the Library of Congress .
Court records show that Schroer , then a male , took her future boss to lunch to outline her transition to a female , as she planned to present herself as a female on her first day of the job .
Schroer testified that on the day after the lunch , the job offer was rescinded , and she was told she was n't a " good fit " for the library .
The ACLU said the ruling sends a " loud and clear " message to employers against firing or refusing to hire someone for changing their gender .
There was no immediate reaction from the library , which had claimed at trial that transgender people are not covered under federal anti-discrimination laws .
The case is Schroer v. Billington ( Cv-05 - 1090 ) .

How many times have you been in flagrante with some dude , having a perfectly nice time , when he begins a series of inquiries as to whether you 've come .
Then after he 's done , he looks up ( or down ! ) at you with a look of confusion and asks , " Why did n't you finish ? "
Sure , many men do n't know that as few as 7 % of women can reliably come from vaginal penetration alone — in which case , do you really want to sleep with them ? — but for those who do , now they can just look at our vaginas for clues !
New research might explain why some women are able to come from vaginal intercourse alone , and most women are n't .
According to the Los Angeles Times , it 's something called " the rule of thumb " : " Clitoris - vagina distances less than 2.5 cm — that 's roughly from the tip of your thumb to your first knuckle — tend to yield reliable orgasms during sex . "

Basically , if your clit is close to your vagina ( C - V distance ) , you can come from sex .
If not , you 're S.O.L. Kim Wallen , a professor of psychology and behavioral neuroendocrinology at Emory University , is the one studying the C - V distance theory , but he is n't the first to notice a correlation .
According to the L.A. Times :
In the 1920s , Princess Marie Bonaparte , a French psychoanalyst and close friend of Sigmund Freud , grew fed up with her own lack of orgasmic response .
In her professional practice , she saw plenty of patients with the same complaint ( " frigidity , " in the parlance of the day ) .
She blamed physiology , not psyche .
Bonaparte collected C- V and orgasm data from her patients and in 1924 delicately published her observations under a pseudonym .
( She also persuaded an Austrian surgeon to experiment on her , by cutting around her clitoris and stretching it closer to her vagina — with disappointing results . )

Yikes !
If your C - V distance is the size of an end zone , do n't fret .
Wallen thinks the difficulty of achieving easy female orgasm during intercourse can inspire couples to be more inventive in the sack , though he is concerned that women might feel that a small C - V distance is just another standard women might feel inadequate about , like breast size .
" People would ask , ' Is your distance really small ? ' "
Wallen suspects .
" Suspects " ?
Cosmopolitan will certainly find a way !
Female Orgasms And A ' Rule Of Thumb ' [ Los Angeles Times ]
Despite the campaign ’s sharp break in Obama ’s direction in the last week of September , we need only remember the sharp break in McCain ’s favor in the first two weeks of the month to know that elections can change quickly .
That said , I ’ve been thinking over the last few days that if John McCain loses this election he will have lost much more than the presidency .
His reputation as an honest and honorable politician will be wrecked , I suspect , for good — particularly among centrist and independent voters and the centrist commentator class in New York and Washington .
In his current guise , McCain would likely say that what the folks along the Northeast corridor think of him does n’t matter .
But I do n’t think anyone who knows him believes that for a second .
The man has spent the last fifteen years of his life assiduously cultivating these people .
This after all is what people mean when they used to say that the press was McCain ’s ‘ base ’ .
It ’s a big thing for his political viability and his ego .
Today at work I was flipping through a review copy of Elizabeth Drew ’s Citizen McCain .
I ’m sure there are critical passages buried in there .
And my point is not to criticize Drew .
Though I was never a supporter , I once had a very different view of the man than I do today .
But it came right out of the McCain maverick narrative that has so dominated elite political journalism back into the mid-1990s .
That read of McCain just dripped off the page .
But little more than a week ago she shows up in the Politico with a sort of public recantation of her one time admiration , concluding , “ McCain ’s recent conduct of his campaign – his willingness to lie repeatedly ( including in his acceptance speech ) and to play Russian roulette with the vice - presidency , in order to fulfill his long - held ambition – has reinforced my earlier , and growing , sense that John McCain is not a principled man .
In fact , it ’s not clear who he is . ”
Though not summed up in one neat essay , Joe Klein ’s change of mind about McCain strikes me as similar .
As do those of a slew of other marquee pundits who ’ve either written as much publicly or told me as much privately .
Now , on the one hand , politics is n’t or should n’t be about catering to or pandering to the fancies of prestige pundits .
But you might have told McCain that over the last ten years .
And in any case , it ’s been the key to his ascent in national politics over the last fifteen years .
And you can see a similar drop off in voters ’ assumptions about his character , honesty and decency in recent polls .
When Bob Dole lost to Bill Clinton in 1996 , if anything it enhanced his reputation and popularity .
His reputation , what people thought of him , was n’t wrecked or even damaged by the campaign .
The future seems quite different for McCain if he loses this election .
My verdict may be a severe one but I think a lot of people — a lot of former admirers — are coming around to agreeing with the general outlines .
McCain has revealed himself as a liar well outside the permissive standards applied to politicians .
He ’s shown himself to be reckless to the point of instability , repeatedly putting the country at risk ( exploiting the Georgia crisis , picking Palin , storming the bailout negotiations ) for transparently self - serving reasons .
And in too many ways to count , he ’s conducted his campaign in disgraceful and dishonorable ways .
Perhaps the most telling thing is that McCain was willing flush that reputation down the drain , betray everything he pretended to stand for , all to be president .
If he wins , it will all have been worth it .
He was happy to sacrifice one for the other .
And now he may end up with neither .
Fourier Analysis of Ocean Tides I
Feature Column Archive The United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) has an excellent site : About Water Levels , Tides and Currents .
Dean Pentcheff 's WWW Tide and Currect Predictor gives today 's tides for many locations .
The NOAA gives
One year predictions for a large number of U.S. sites .
My main reference for this column has been Paul Schureman , Manual of Harmonic Analysis and Prediction of Tides , U.S. Department of Commerce , Coast and Geodetic Survey , Special Publication No. 98 , U.S. Government Printing Office , Washington , 1958 ( reprinted May 1988 ) .
1 . Ocean Tides
Tides in the Bay of Fundy : Hall 's Harbour , Nova Scotia and Hall 's Harbour , six hours later .

Going into or out of a harbor , or anchoring near a shore , you need to know in advance about the behavior of the tide .
Here is what happened to Julius Caesar when he first landed in Britain , in 55 B.C.
In his own words : `` That night happened to be the night of a full moon , when the Atlantic has the highest tides , and we did not know this .
So the longships , which had been pulled up on the beach , were swamped , while the supply ships , moored to anchors , were tossed about by the storm ; there was no way for us to control the situation or to help .
Many of the ships were broken up , and the rest of them , having lost lines , anchors and the rest of their equipment , were useless for sailing .
As was inevitable , this produced a great disquiet in the army .
There were no other ships to take them back , everything was lacking that could be used for ship repair , and there was no provision of wheat for the winter , since all had understood that we would be wintering in Gaul . " more in English , more in Latin . ( Gallic War IV , 29 )
The expedition was cut short by this disaster .
The tide is caused by the pull of the sun and the moon on the oceans , and the rotation of the earth , but its exact pattern at any particular spot on the coast depends on the shape of the coastline and on the profile of the sea floor nearby .
So even though the forces that move the tide are completely understood , the tides at any one spot are essentially impossible to calculate theoretically .
What we can do is record the height of the tide at that spot over a certain period of time , and use these measurements to predict the tides at that spot in the future .
This process is of mathematical interest , because the tidal record is not periodic .
The tidal force is governed by a small number of astronomical motions which are themselves periodic , but since the various frequencies have no whole - number ratios between them , the whole configuration never repeats itself exactly .
Nevertheless , a geometric analysis of the problem shows that the tidal force can be expressed as a finite sum of periodic functions whose frequencies are known ( they are in fact small integral linear combinations of the astronomical frequencies ) .
Once this is established , Fourier analysis can be applied to the tidal record from any port using this finite number of frequencies as a basis .
Modern tidal analysis and prediction in all its mathematical and mechanical detail is due to Sir William Thomson ( later Lord Kelvin ) , around 1867 .
The theory rests on earlier work by Laplace , Young and Airy .
This is the first of three columns on the subject .
This one treats the geometric analysis mentioned above .
Part II will cover the Fourier analysis of the tidal record .
Part III will examine the problem of synthesis , and in particular the tidal predicting machines devised by Kelvin and his collaborators .
These mechanisms , monuments of 19th - century ingenuity , were only relatively recently ( 1965 ) replaced by digital computers in preparing the official U.S. tide predictions .

Japan Forced to Pay Damages For Sailor ’s Suicide
The suicide of a Japanese sailor who hung himself after being bullied by his superior has culminated in an award for damages .
The parents of a sailor who was 21 years old when he hung himself in 1999 , have been awarded damages in this first - of - its - kind ruling involving a civil servant .
Fukuoka High Court in southern Japan ordered the sum of 3.5 million yen ( $ 32,000 ) to the parents of the petty third class officer although they refused to offer any more details about the landmark judicial decision .
A lower court had previously ruled in the government ’s favor , claiming that the remarks fell within the “ scope of training ”  , but The High Court recognized that the sailor killed himself because he was despondent and stressed out by his superior ’s insulting and persistent disparaging remarks .
The defense ministry , which has been besieged by bribery and security scandals in recent years , was unhappy with the court ’s ruling and Kohei Masuda , Vice Defense Minister , said :
“ It is disappointing that the court did not understand the state ’s claim .
We will closely study the decision and deal with it appropriately . ”
Only time will tell what this ruling will mean for the future bullies of Japan .
It would appear , however , that it is they who should watch their backs !

Most of us were in school for years , performing our studies , ( maybe ) doing our homework , and being graded , day in and day out .
It was a constant process , and all of us were perpetually judged .
( I recently wrapped it all up after 17 years . )
Now it ’s time to turn the tables and judge the schools , all in the name of the little blue planet we love .
The Sustainable Endowment Institute is dedicated to making universities greener and more eco-friendly , and over the last few years they ’ve been conducting a process that literally yields a “ report card ” for each school .
The College Sustainability Report Card 2009 is swiftly approaching , and colleges better be on their best , earth - friendly behavior .
After all , the judging is tough and the requirements to achieve a high score are pretty far up there .
In fact , no college has yet scored a straight - up A on the report card up until this year .
Ivy League institutions have come the closest however , with Harvard , Dartmouth and Stanford all raking in very respectable A- rankings for 2007 .
Harvard and Stanford both unfortunately fell off that top podium in 2008 , with only Darthmouth making a repeat appearance – kudos for consistency , Dartmouth !
Carleton and Williams also boasted A- scores in 2008 .
2009 ’s report card is where YOU come in , dear reader .
This is a democratic nation , after all , and we all have a say in what universities should be honored for their ecological efforts .
If you think a school has shown great strides in this area , you may nominate it for the Sustainability Report Card 2009 .
The only stipulation is that the suggested school must have been involved with a public community “ green project ” in some shape , fashion or form .
Aside from that , a nifty four question application is all it takes to garner your institution the acknowledgment and acclaim it deserves for looking out for Mother Earth .
Once submitted for review , the school is judged on any of a number of considerations , such as whether they are actively purchasing renewable energy , promoting new recycling programs , reducing carbon emissions , or utilizing hybrid cars , just to name a few criteria .
If your university is doing their job on any of these fronts , they should be in line to make the grade .
Act now to support your school !
The September 12th deadline is swiftly approaching .

A Malaysian blogger has been detained without trial for two years on charges of " insulting Islam and inciting racial tensions " , the BBC reports .
Raja Petra Kamarudin was cuffed on 12 September after he unwisely used a piece in the Malaysia Today website .
to accuse Malaysia 's deputy prime minister , Najib Razak , of involvement in the 2007 murder of a Mongolian woman .
The country 's home minister ordered him to be sent to a detention centre in the state of Perak under the Internal Security Act ( ISA ) , which allows him to be held for 24 months , although the sentence can be renewed indefinitely .
The detention order can be overturned only by the minister , not a judge , the BBC notes .
Raja Petra 's lawyer , Malik Imtiaz Sarwar , decried the order as " definitely a big blow to the idea of civil liberties , especially in a climate when everybody is asking for greater rights " .
The detainee 's wife , Marina Lee Abdullah , told AFP : " This is the worst news I can receive , but we will keep fighting for his release . "
The BBC describes Raja Petra as " a thorn in the side of the Malaysian government , using his blog to become one of its most vociferous critics " .
He 's one of three " dissidents " arrested in what the opposition called " a sign of panic by the embattled administration of Abdullah Badawi " .
The trio of detainees is made up by blogger Syed Azidi Syed Aziz and Chinese - language journalist Tan Hoon Cheng .
Abdullah 's government has " suffered an unprecedented drop in support in the general election earlier this year and he has faced calls to resign from both opposition and some members of his own party " .
Indeed , cabinet member Zaid Ibrahim last week resigned in protest at the government 's use of the ISA , insisting it should " only be used on armed terrorists or those out to topple the government by force " .
Other victims of the ISA include opposition MP Teresa Kok who was " detained for one week under the act after she was accused of campaigning for a mosque to lower the volume of its call to prayer " .
Shortly before his arrest , Raja Petra told the BBC he " was n't afraid of detention " , but wanted " to be available to help in the dissemination of information that is going to be greatly required " .
There 's a pre-arrest audio interview with the errant blogger here . ®
andhave all joined ‘s upcoming World War II flick “ “ .
They ’ll co-star along sideand .
Diane Kruger ( “ Troy ” , “ National Treasure ” ) will handle the role of German actress Bridget Von Hammersmark .
Her character will figure into the plot to kill the Nazis .
Actress Nastassja Kinski was first rumored to be up for the role .
The flick is set during World War II where a band of U.S. soldiers , who are facing death by firing squad for their misdeeds , are given a chance to redeem themselves by heading into the perilous no -man ’s lands of Nazi- occupied France on a suicide mission for the Allies .
Variety reports the film is set to begin production on Oct. 13 with shooting taking place in Germany .

Even by the usual standards of British sex scandals , this one is quite something .
In March , the News of the World filmed Max Mosley , the president of formula one 's governing body , the FIA , being whipped by several women in a prison - guard scenario - video footage of what Mosley has since described as his " unfortunate interest " .
The News of the World alleged that the video had Nazi overtones - that the women spoke to him in German and were pretending to be concentration camp guards .
Mosley , the son of the British fascist leader Oswald , denies this .
He says that it was a private party with consenting women and this week launched a case against the News of the World , saying that its stories were not , as it claims , in the public interest and had violated his privacy .
" I 've been doing [ S&M ] for 45 years and ... if it had n't been for bribery and illegal acts , this would n't have come out , " said Mosley , who added that he had kept his activity from his wife .
One of the things to have come out in court was Mosley 's defence that his interest in S&M was not degrading or sick , and that the News of the World was out of touch .
James Price , Mosley 's QC , said : " It 's not a surprise to me or to others who do n't live in an ivory tower or a monastery , or , I am sure , to your lordship , to learn that quite a lot of people , men and women , have a fascinated interest in this sort of thing . "
Nobody knows how many people engage in BDSM - the acronym for Bondage Domination Sadomasochism - but it is estimated that 14 % of men and 11 % of women have tried it .
There are a huge number of BDSM websites , with everything from sites giving advice and instructions , to personal ads , to online groups where people arrange to meet .
Next month , for instance , Unfettered , a voluntary group set up four years ago to run educational workshops and promote and defend BDSM , hosts Kinkfest in London , " a whole day of non -stop salacious stage entertainment , fantastic stalls , wicked workshops , superb speeches and special guests " .
Is everyone at it ?
" I think there are people who would n't consider themselves practitioners of BDSM but who have experimented with tying themselves up with a dressing - gown cord or done a little bit of spanking here and there , " says Pamela Stephenson Connolly , a clinical psychologist and sex therapist .
" It comes up all the time in my work and people understand that what they 're doing is playing out a form of BDSM .
If the rules are observed , it is a perfectly reasonable part of the very broad tapestry of normal human sexuality . "
Stephenson Connolly recently carried out a study of 132 BDSM participants to try to find out whether there was more prevalence of clinical disorders , such as depression , anxiety or psychological sadomasochism among those who practised BDSM .
" The answer I found was no , " she says .
" Most of the assumptions that my profession has made about people who participate in BDSM is that there must be something wrong with them , but I did n't find that at all .
What I did find is that the credo in the BDSM movement - and I 'm not talking about people who do n't know what they are doing - is ' safe , sane and consensual ' .
People would discuss what was about to occur , and talk about their limitations .
I discovered tremendous detail in how it is played and anyone who does n't obey the rules is kicked out of the community and nobody will play with them again .
People are very anxious to ensure that consent takes place . "
Psychologist David Mirich and sex therapist Neil Cannon have been conducting a major study into sadomasochism in the US , and believe that BDSM behaviours are much more common than is popularly thought .
As Cannon says , " there are many people who have used a silk scarf to tie up someone 's hands , or used a feather to tickle someone , or pulled their partner 's hair - you see references on TV and in magazines to ' rough sex ' , but I do n't think that the people involved see themselves as participating in anything that could be called sadomasochistic " .
The reason that we do n't hear more about this , they say , is that " even with a great friend or a psychologist , people are very hesitant to talk about their inner sexual world " .
Mirich has studied about 220 BDSMers and says that he " was fascinated by this historical and popular assumption that these individuals were traumatised in some form or fashion in their early childhood ...
What I found was that most of them would tell me that , no , they were pretty much in an idyllic family situation as a child , that there was no sexual and physical abuse - in fact , there was no spanking . "
I speak to a man known as Sir Guy ( who is not really knighted ) , who has been involved in the BDSM scene for more than 20 years and is following the Mosley case with interest .
He says that BDSM has gradually started to gain acceptance in the mainstream , and that he now has " thousands of inquiries and hundreds of people come to events ...
It 's mainly middle - aged , middle - class , middle - income people .
Almost all are professionals - we have engineers , doctors , nurses , teachers , solicitors , accountants .
There are a couple I know , both primary school teachers , who like spanking .
It 's Middle England , very , very normal and well - adjusted .
We get the odd wild - eyed person , but we weed them out early . "
This all seems positively tame compared to what other people seem to get up to .
Unfettered has advertised workshops on " needle and medical play " where , among other things , female and male catheterisation is demonstrated .
The advert reads a bit like a Women 's Institute newsletter advertising a flower - arranging course .
" If there is time , " it reads , " Mistress Demonic will also run a short skin stapling demo as well . "
" We live in a world , " says Susanna Abse , the director of the Tavistock Centre for couple relationships , " where there is a wish to normalise such things . "
More and more people , she says , are prepared to experiment sexually , and are being encouraged to do so .
" We need to ask ourselves questions : what is perverse ? " she says .
" Does the ordinary man in the street think this is ' normal ' ?
I do n't think we 're having enough of a debate about what we think might be linked to some level of distress rather than sexual choice .
" In a way , what people do in the privacy of their own bedroom is absolutely fine .
In fact , we might understand S&M as a sensible way of containing very strong feelings , such as aggression , if it 's consensual .
But , on the other hand , there 's another kind of S&M that exploits other people , or makes people feel very disconnected from their experiences , where the relationship has broken down because of the activities , or where people feel betrayed . "
What is important , Abse argues , is not the activity itself , but , " what feelings are these activities managing ?
Does it represent some level of distress in the person ? "
If BDSM is becoming more popular , you can blame the internet .
" You name a fetish and there will be an online group or a website for it , " says Derek Cohen , chair of the Spanner Trust , an organisation " to defend the rights of sadomasochists " .
" I 'm gay and when I was growing up , there was no gay visibility and you felt like you were on your own and there was nobody around like you . "
It was the same for people into BDSM , he says .
" Now , if you 're into getting excited by people popping balloons - and I 'm serious , there are people who are into that - you will find like - minded people .
And you can actually make dates with people and go and play .
The community aspect makes it safer because the people are known .
If someone is going to cane me , do they know when to stop , do they understand hygiene issues , do other people know them , for instance ? "
Is BDSM is becoming more popular ?
" It 's hard to say , " says Cohen .
" I think it is becoming more evident in mainstream media and becoming more acceptable in a titillating way .
You see big billboard adverts of women in leather .
I think that is bound to encourage more people to feel happier about the fact they have those desires and want to act them out .
We are much more accepting of the diversity of people 's sexuality generally , although there still is a lot of disapproval about BDSM . "
Perhaps it 's because many people can't understand the point of it .
I ask him to explain .
" There are two sides to it - a physical side and an emotional side , " he replies .
" I would say 10 % - 15 % of the population find the idea of power and control quite exciting , whether that 's being tied up or being told what to do - a lot of people like that .
A lot of people have fantasy sex - it's a way of escaping their lives and being a different sort of person - and some of those fantasies involve being slaves or being dominant .
The physical side , I put it this way : imagine having sex with someone who runs their fingers down your back ; then they do it harder and start using their nails and it gets a bit painful .
It 's a continuum from that for people who are into it .
The fact that I like a certain amount of pain does n't mean that it stops hurting when I go to the dentist - it's a different context , it 's not eroticised . "
Not many people may be aware that BDSM is actually , technically , against the law ( part of the News of the World 's defence is that Mosley was taking part in a criminal act , because he bled when he was spanked ) .
Or , as Sir Guy puts it : " If someone comes to me because they want a caning , we could be locked up for it .
The laws in this country are ludicrous . "
The Spanner Trust was set up in 1995 after 16 gay men were sentenced to prison or fined for engaging in consensual S&M activities .
" The law established that you can't engage in sexual activity that left marks or bruises or injuries that are ' more than transient or trifling ' , " says Cohen .
" But in the Spanner case , none of the injuries were serious - any cuts or bruises healed within days - and it was all consensual .
But you can get in a boxing ring where people can die or suffer severe brain damage , but you can't consent to BDSM .
I always say that when sex comes in the door , common sense goes out the window .
It 's restricting people 's right to enjoy their sexuality .
BDSM does n't cause a large amount of injuries because people are n't intending to seriously hurt people , they are intending to have fun .
You 're not doing it in a hostile way . "
Sir Guy says the people he meets who are into BDSM are " very normal , well - adjusted people .
They are better company than you 'd find at a stamp - collecting society or line - dancing group .
They are more articulate , aware and caring than most people I have met .
People have found it time and again - if someone goes through a divorce or bankruptcy or difficult time , it 's their friends from ' the [ BDSM ] scene ' who rally round . "
Sounds cosy , really .
Apart from the whipping .

Flying drones from halfway across the world used to be considered a cushy , if somewhat sterile , military job .
But the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have gone on for so long – and become so dependent on the satellite - piloted planes – that Air Force commanders have had to call in chaplains , psychologists and psychiatrists " to help ease the mental strain on these remote - control warriors , " the Associated Press reports .
Just a few years ago , pilots of unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) crowed that " most of the time , I get to fight the war , and go home and see the wife and kids at night . "
Since then , the demands for remotely - flown spy planes have grown exponentially .
Pilots ' hours grew longer and longer .
And they started to compare themselves to " prisoner [s ] with [ l ] ife sentence [s ] . "
That 's taking things to a whiny extreme .
The chair - bound flyboys still have it pretty good , compared to the grunts of the Army or the Marines :
No 15 - month tours , no crappy rations , no chance of them or their friends getting blown up .
But the constant back - and - forth between war and peace is n't without its unique strains .
" It is quite different , going from potentially shooting a missile , then going to your kid's soccer game , " sighs Lt. Col. Michael Lenahan .
In a fighter jet , " when you come in at 500 - 600 miles per hour , drop a
500 - pound bomb and then fly away , you do n't see what happens , " said
Colonel Albert K. Aimar , who is commander of the 163rd Reconnaissance
Wing here and has a bachelor 's degree in psychology .
But when a
Predator fires a missile , " you watch it all the way to impact , and I mean it 's very vivid , it 's right there and personal .
So it does stay in people 's minds for a long time . "
Ender 's Game , anyone ?

8 ) THE " GATEWAY EFFECT " MAY BE A MIRAGE : Marijuana is often called a " gateway drug " by supporters of prohibition , who point to statistical " associations " indicating that persons who use marijuana are more likely to eventually try hard drugs than those who never use marijuana - implying that marijuana use somehow causes hard drug use .
But a model developed by RAND Corp. researcher Andrew Morral demonstrates that these associations can be explained " without requiring a gateway effect . "
More likely , this federally funded study suggests , some people simply have an underlying propensity to try drugs , and start with what 's most readily available .

7 ) PROHIBITION DOESN'T WORK ( PART I ) : The White House had the National Research Council examine the data being gathered about drug use and the effects of U.S. drug policies .
NRC concluded , " the nation possesses little information about the effectiveness of current drug policy , especially of drug law enforcement . "
And what data exist show " little apparent relationship between severity of sanctions prescribed for drug use and prevalence or frequency of use . "
In other words , there is no proof that prohibition - the cornerstone of U.S. drug policy for a century - reduces drug use .

Looking at such parameters as frequency and quantity of use and age at onset of use , they found no differences except one : Lifetime use of hard drugs was significantly lower in Amsterdam , with its " tolerant " marijuana policies .
For example , lifetime crack cocaine use was 4.5 times higher in San Francisco than Amsterdam .

In response to passage of California 's medical marijuana law , the White House had the Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) review the data on marijuana 's medical benefits and risks .
The IOM concluded , " Nausea , appetite loss , pain and anxiety are all afflictions of wasting , and all can be mitigated by marijuana . "
While noting potential risks of smoking , the report added , " we acknowledge that there is no clear alternative for people suffering from chronic conditions that might be relieved by smoking marijuana , such as pain or AIDS wasting . "
The government 's refusal to acknowledge this finding caused co-author John A. Benson to tell the New York Times that the government " loves to ignore our report … they would rather it never happened . "

Last week , we had an article about how a British Academic wanted to reform the English language using a phonetic approach .
Unsurprisingly , the whole thing brought quite a stir in the comments section , with some people agreeing , and others disagreeing with the proposal .
So when I stumbled on this video today , I immediately thought of all of you who were fighting to determine if a reform was actually in order .
Check it out .
Believe it or not , the man you just saw is 103 years old .
His name is Ed Rondthaler and he used to be President of the American Literacy Council .
He makes quite a point of showing why the English language needs to be reformed , but the question is , do you agree with him ?
Let us know , along with any commentary that you feel may be relevant to the issue , in the comments section .

Do you know where computers began ?
Just like all manmade things , there was a point when the computer was first invented .
But , that computer is likely to look a whole lot different from the one you ’re using today !
That first spark of an idea has been through tons of innovation and evolution , making it almost unrecognizable from modern devices .
Today , we ’re going to turn back time and go back to the beginning .
Read on to find more about the evolution of computers , starting over 200 years ago .
Before the First Modern Computer
Before the evolution of the computer , the abacus was the closest thing for many years .
But in 1801 , the first hint of the computer was invented – although by modern standards it ’s very basic .
The computer was actually a loom that read punched cards to weave designs , and it was invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in France .
This punch card system continues to pave the way forward .
In 1890 , Herman Hollerith created a punch card computer system to help calculate the census of 1880 , speeding up to process and saving the US millions of dollars .
As you can see , these were fairly far off what you now use to browse social media and check your emails , but they were a start !
The history of computers still has a long way to go , though .
The First Modern Computer
Computers really started to take off in the 1930s .
In this decade , Alan Turing presented the idea of a universal machine – also known at the Turing machine – which created the central ideas of the modern computer .
In the same year as Turing presented the notion , the first - ever modern computer was created .
This was the Z1 , and it was made in Berlin by Konrad Zuse .
He actually made it in the living room of his parent ’s house , where he used pins , film , and metal plates to create this revolutionary device .
The Z1 could add and subtract with ease , and it began the long history and evolution of computer hardware .
The Computers That Followed
After the Z1 , the ENIAC was developed , which was used during World War II .
It could work through thousands of problems in a second , but it filled an entire room .
Not so practical for a modern household !
Even as the evolution of computers moved on , they were n’t commercially available for another 20 years .
During the 1950s , they were used solely for scientific research and engineering processes .
But in the 1960s , the Programma 101 came along and changed the game .
This was the first - ever desktop computer ( even if it still does n’t resemble the monitors we know and love today ) .
It was about the size of a regular typewriter , with 37 keys and a printer .
The Rise of Personal Computing
The Programma 101 was the start of personal computers .
The next was the Xerox Alto in the 70s , which is much more similar to the kind of old - fashioned computer you might conjure up in your head .
It has a screen , keyboard , and mouse ; a design that would pave the way for all personal computers that followed .
Very importantly , these computers were designed to be easy enough for kids to use .
Gone were the days when computers where for scientific and mathematical experts alone ; now anyone could use them .
The Evolution of Apple Computers
Whilst Apple has n’t been the only designer of computers – far from it , in fact !
– they have been a leader in innovation .
To look at how computers have changed since the 1970s , you only have to look at the progress of Apple .
The Apple Macintosh , released in January 1984 , completely changed the course of personal computing .
It was famously launched with the 30 - second commercial than ran during the Super Bowl and cost the company $ 1.5 million .
The commercial was huge and the computer that followed was even bigger .
The Macintosh used a window - and - mouse system , based on the work done by Xerox .
It replaced text input with graphics , had an interface like no one had ever seen , and was the easiest computer to use that had ever been made .
From there , it was all up for Apple .
In the 90s they released their iconic iMac G3 which turned the clunky computer designs of the past on their head with its blue , clear casing .
They continued to innovate the desktop computer , leading to the slimline , advanced machines we use today .
Their next most notable innovation was the Macbook Air .
In a now - iconic move , Steve Jobs unveiled the laptop from a manila envelope , causing a ripple of excitement at how thin the laptop was , measuring just 0.76 of an inch thick .
Compared to the bulky laptops currently on the market , this was another moment of genius from the company .
Computers in Our Time
The history of computers has come a long way , but they ’re far from done !
Nowadays , we have superfast desktops , ultrathin laptops at incredibly cheap prices , and , of course , tablets , which have changed the way we think about computing .
If you ’re a fan of all things computing , view here for more updates and information .
Keep on Innovating
The world of computing is far from done – in fact , this may only be the beginning .
From see - through interfaces to holograms , there ’s still a lot of futuristic ideas that are yet to be put into action .
Who knows where the evolution of computers will take us next ?

Because what financial software really needs is Cover Flow .
At Macworld Expo 2008 in January , it was both exciting and a great relief to finally see a new version of Quicken .
Even better , it appeared that the then tentatively - named Quicken Financial Life for Mac ( QFLM ) was some ways into the development process .
Now in September , the name has been made official , and a public beta has begun , but looking at the FAQ and a few screenshots makes you wonder just what the final product will be , not to mention when it will ship .
According to the FAQ , this rewrite of Quicken " has required significant engineering and quality testing , " hence Intuit is taking " some extra time to get it right . "
Well , QFLM should be righteous indeed , as it has been over two years since pure torment Quicken Mac 2007 was released .
QFLM is now expected to ship " this Winter , " so break out your sundials , as that could be any time between December 21 , 2008 , and March 20 , 2009 .
Financial management software as bare bones as a CSI cold file .
For long - suffering Quicken users , now might be a good time to compare your system against the new requirements .
While QFLM will run on most Macs made in the last five years , it will require Leopard .
Mac users running Tiger are directed to a fate worse than death Quicken Mac 2007 .
As for features , I was told at Macworld 2008 that the initial feature set would focus on core features : cash flow , downloading , taxes , budgeting .
This appears borne out by the FAQ , which directs those needing " more advanced investment , reporting and personal finance features now " to purgatory Quicken Mac 2007 .
Who needs individual stock tracking when you have colorful graphs and charts ?
One feature that has apparently gotten the axe , at least for now , is Quicken 's Bill Pay service , but since that costs $ 9.95 per month , it hardly seems like a loss .
While you will be able to import data files from previous versions of Mac Quicken , nothing is said about Windows Quicken , and Microsoft Money is right out .
Not surprisingly , there 's no word on pricing , but the abomination of desolation Quicken Mac 2007 is $ 49.99 , so do n't expect QFLM to ship for less than that .
It 's looking more and more like QFLM will be lucky to have feature parity with alternatives like Moneydance and iBank , with one exception .
Because Intuit has a lock on the data format , only Quicken Financial Life for Mac will offer true compatibility with more than 4,400 financial institutions for direct downloads of transaction data .
That singular feature will leave some of us , myself included , waiting with fear and trepidation for what rough beast , its hour come round at last , slouching towards Macworld Expo to be shipped .

References :
Because references generally are not included on a resume , have them typed on a separate sheet of paper and readily available at an employer 's request .
What Type of Resume is Best ?
There are three main resume styles .
Your qualifications , history and career goals will help you to choose from among them :
Chronological
This is the most popular with recruiters and agencies .
It lists work history , starting with the most recent position .
This style quickly reveals work stability , progression and promotion , and works well for those who have experience in their field of employment .
Functional
The functional resume focuses attention on the ability of the individual rather than the past employment .
This style groups skills and accomplishments into special categories such as Marketing Experience , Organizational Skills , Project Coordination , Computer Experience , Supervisory and Management Skills .
This is a good resume for people who have held a number of different positions , are re-entering the work force , looking to change career paths or are recent graduates .
Combination
The combination resume draws on the best features of both the chronological and the functional resume styles .
This style emphasizes the person 's capabilities , while including a complete job history .
The Combination style is also another good choice for recent graduates .
How Can I Make My Resume Computer Friendly ?
Avoid small print and unusual typefaces
Avoid graphics
Be sure that your name is the first line on the page
Avoid the use of complicated or creative layouts
Use smooth white paper , black ink and a quality printer
Provide enough white space
Emphasize keywords References
Who to select for References
Ideally references should be previous employers .
Avoid references that are not recent .
For new graduates , references should consist of any part - time employers you may have worked for during school or any teachers / professors who can comment on your character or abilities .
Be sure to ask your references if they are willing and able to give you a good recommendation .
Let them know in advance that they may be contacted by someone and for what purpose .
You should list 3 to 5 professional references ( supervisors , faculty , colleagues , etc. ) , and avoid using personal friends and family .
Where To Put References on a Resume
Names and contact information for your references do not typically go on a resume .
Most often you would conclude your resume with a section that simply states " References Available Upon Request " .
How to Present References
Create a " Reference " heading
Name of Reference
Title or Relationship to You
Complete Business Address
Daytime Phone Number What do Employers Look For When Contacting References ?
Employment dates
Job titles
Accuracy
Job description
Work ethic - including conscientiousness , sense of responsibility , and ability to work with others
Whether of not they would rehire the candidate
The objective of screening , or an employee background check , is to help an employer verify the candidate 's previous employment information .
References are a valuable tool for determining if a candidate is truly qualified for the position .

Immature , or “ baby , ” fat cells lurk in the walls of the blood vessels that nourish fatty tissue , just waiting for excess calories to help them grow into the adult monsters responsible for packing on the extra pounds , researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center have found in mice .
Researchers have long known that such cells were probably located near blood vessels , but they did n’t know exactly where .
Discovering their existence , their identity and their lair may direct future research to find ways to stop these cells from creating undesired fat — or to use these immature cells for such clinical treatments as filling in a woman ’s breast after a lumpectomy .
“ There ’s both intellectual and clinical importance in this discovery , ” said Dr. Jonathan Graff , associate professor of developmental biology and molecular biology at UT Southwestern and senior author of the study , which appears in today ’s online edition of the journal Science .
“ Identifying the progenitor cells and finding where they live gives us an exciting therapeutic opportunity .
“ Since we can now isolate the progenitor cells , we can interrogate them molecularly and gain insight not only into how they function but also how to harness their powers to help in a variety of human conditions .
And because we have found their location , we might be able to develop therapies that can help people with obesity , diabetes or other metabolic challenges . ”
Dr. Graff said it might soon be possible to isolate immature cells from each person ’s own fat and move those cells into other parts of the body , where they might be medically useful .
For example , progenitor fat cells from the belly or thighs could be moved to a soldier ’s wounds or scars from breast cancer surgery .
These cells might even be moved for purely cosmetic reasons .
Ordinarily , the progenitor cells , called adult stem cells , create new fat cells in several situations , such as when the young body is growing and needs to form fat cells .
They are also necessary when weight is stable ; as fat cells die and must be replaced by new ones , as with most tissues in the body .
advertisement
When caloric intake exceeds use , however , not only do existing fat cells get larger to store more fat , but progenitor cells also create entirely new fat cells .
To locate the progenitor cells , the researchers engineered mice so that the stem cells would glow green , making them easy to follow as they transformed from progenitors into fully developed fat cells .
The researchers found that the progenitor cells were embedded within the walls of the blood vessels that run through fat tissue .
“ They ’re not just attached to the vessel wall , they ’re an integral part of it , ” Dr. Graff said .
This arrangement makes sense , Dr. Graff said , because it allows the cells to respond to the nutrients such as glucose that are present in the blood after a meal .
When they sense excess caloric intake , they drift out of the vessel walls and mature into fat cells .
This helps to ensure that they reside in the appropriate location among other fat cells .

The green glow also allowed the researchers to separate the progenitor cells from other cells using a technique that isolates only the glowing cells .
They then grew the cells in culture to analyze some of their properties and found that the progenitor cells have a distinct set of molecules on the surface , which could allow the cells to be isolated easily for transplant or study .
In future research , the scientists plan to characterize the cells more fully and to isolate the progenitors just by removing unwanted fat .
These cells then can be moved to other locations in that same person for reconstructive purposes , to treat a variety of diseases , and also paradoxically to treat obesity and diabetes .
Other UT Southwestern researchers involved in the study were lead author Dr. Wei Tang , postdoctoral fellow in developmental biology ; graduate student Daniel Zeve ; Dr. Jaemyoung Suh , postdoctoral researcher in developmental biology ; Dr. Bob Hammer , professor of biochemistry ; Dr. Michelle Tallquist , assistant professor of molecular biology ; Dr. Darko Bosnakovski , former postdoctoral research fellow in developmental biology ; and Dr. Michael Kyba , former assistant professor of developmental biology .
The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Excellence for Education Foundation .

CLAREMONT , Calif . — David Foster Wallace , the author best known for his 1996 novel Infinite Jest , was found dead in his home , according to police .
He was 46 .
Wallace 's wife found her husband had hanged himself when she returned home about 9:30 p.m. Friday , said Jackie Morales , a records clerk with the Claremont Police Department .
Wallace taught creative writing and English at nearby Pomona College .
" He cared deeply for his students and transformed the lives of many young people , " said Dean Gary Kates .
" It 's a great loss to our teaching faculty . "
Wallace 's first novel , The Broom of the System , gained national attention in 1987 for its ambition and offbeat humor .
The New York Times said the 24 - year - old author " attempts to give us a portrait , through a combination of Joycean word games , literary parody and zany picaresque adventure , of a contemporary America run amok . "
Published in 1996 , Infinite Jest cemented Wallace 's reputation as a major American literary figure .
The 1,000 - plus - page tome , praised for its complexity and dark wit , topped many best - of lists .
Time Magazine named Infinite Jest in its issue of the " 100 Best English - language Novels from 1923 to 2005 . "
Wallace received a " genius grant " from the MacArthur Foundation in 1997 .
In 2002 , Wallace was hired to teach at Pomona in a tenured English Department position endowed by Roy E. Disney .
Kates said when the school began searching for the ideal candidate , Wallace was the first person considered .
" The committee said , 'we need a person like David Foster Wallace . '
They said that in the abstract , " Kates said .
" When he was approached and accepted , they were heads over heels .
He was really the ideal person for the position . "
Wallace 's short fiction was published in Esquire , GQ , Harper 's , The New Yorker and the Paris Review .
Collections of his short stories were published as Girl With Curious Hair and Brief Interviews With Hideous Men .
He wrote nonfiction for several publications , including an essay on the U.S. Open for Tennis magazine and a profile of the director David Lynch for Premiere .
Born in Ithaca , N.Y. , Wallace attended Amherst College and the University of Arizona .
Today ’s NY
Times gives an update on the state of negotiations on the bailout package — the $ 700 billion bailout package for which the lame duck president who got us into this mess wants his package and nothing else :
But lawmakers in both parties voiced anger over the steep cost and even skepticism about the plan ’s chances of success .
As heated debate began on Capitol Hill , Congress and the administration remained at odds over the demands of some lawmakers , including limits on the pay of top executives whose firms seek help , and new authority to allow bankruptcy judges to reduce mortgage payments for borrowers facing foreclosure .
Yes .
The GOP is fighting for the Carly Fiorinas of the world .
Republicans are trying to protect those poor CEOs who have no one else to watch for them .
Dana Milbank documented the GOP concern for the CEOs :
“ While it is very appealing to think about executive compensation as being a part of this , one of the drawbacks to that is perhaps that we would have fewer entities participate in what is essentially a voluntary act , ” Sen. Mel Martinez ( Fla. ) said on CNBC yesterday morning .
“ It should be up to the board of directors of a private corporation to set the compensation of an executive ; it should n’t be Congress ’s role , ” Sen . Richard Shelby ( Ala. ) proclaimed on CBS News .
Bush issued a statement yesterday warning lawmakers not to “ insist on provisions that would undermine the effectiveness of the plan , ” and White House press secretary Dana Perino , asked about Democrats ’ plans to limit executive compensation , advised them to pass the legislation as Paulson proposed it , “ the cleaner the better , and the quicker the better . ”
Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) , the Senate minority leader , went to the floor to decry those who would make the bailout legislation “ flypaper for partisan add - ons . ”
Call their bluff .
After eight years , please just call their bluff .
If the Republicans are so committed to the nation ’s CEOs who helped precipitate this mess ( and we know they are ) , let them vote for protecting the multi-million dollar wages of the very men and women who got us into this mess , the very men and women we ’re bailing out with YOUR money .
Majority Leader Harry Reid and Speaker Pelosi should insist on a separate vote on the CEO pay provision .
Make that a condition of the package .
No deals behind closed doors .
Make them vote .
We deserve a roll call vote — and it will be good for the CEOs to see just who their friends are .
Let Bush threaten a veto over the CEO pay provision .
Embrace that .
With six weeks left to the election , the anger about the economic situation is palpable .
People are pissed and worried .
And , our tax dollars should n’t be used to bail out companies that are paying excessive salaries to their leaders .
If the Republicans are so adamant about it , let them vote for it .
California public students will stick to reading , writing and arithmetic , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger decided as he vetoed a bill late Friday that would have required climate change be added to schools ’ curriculum .
The measure , sponsored by state Sen .
Joe Simitian , D - Palo Alto , also would have required future science textbooks to include climate change as a subject .
In January , the state Senate approved the bill , SB 908 , by a 26 - 13 vote .
Only two Republicans supported the proposal .
In his veto statement , Schwarzenegger said he supported education that spotlights the dangers of climate change .
However , the Republican governor said he was opposed to educational mandates from Sacramento .
“ I continue to believe that the state should refrain from being overly prescriptive in specific school curriculum , beyond establishing rigorous academic standards , ” he said .
Schwarzenegger added that the state ’s Integrated Waste Management Board ’s Office of Education and Environment , along with California ’s Environmental Protection Agency , are creating an environmental curriculum for K - 12 students that includes climate change issues .
Simitian had said his bill would n’t dictate what to teach ; rather , it would require the state Board of Education and state Department of Education to decide how the topic would be covered and which grades would study it .
While global warming is included in high school classes as it pertains to weather , the subject is not required to be covered in all textbooks , according to the California Science Teachers Association .
" The findings from this study and the experimental research are sufficient to recommend that people avoid prolonged use of incense in areas where they spend a lot of time , like living rooms , " Friborg says .
The risk was seen in smokers and nonsmokers , suggesting that exposure to burning incense is an independent risk factor for certain cancers of the respiratory tract , says lead researcher Jeppe T. Friborg , MD , PhD , of Copenhagen 's Statens Serum Institut .
Long - term exposure to incense fumes was associated with an increased risk for most upper respiratory cancers , as well as squamous cell lung cancer , the study shows .
Squamous cell lung cancer is most common type of lung cancer in smokers .
Aug. 25 , 2008 -- People who breathe burning incense over long periods have an increased risk of developing certain cancers , even if they do n't smoke cigarettes , a new study shows .
Daily Incense Use Common
Used since biblical times , incense is still an integral part of daily life in large parts of Asia and India .
And many people in the U.S. and other Western countries also burn incense on a daily basis .
A wide variety of plants and oils are used to make incense .
When burned , many of these mixtures have been shown to produce some of the same carcinogens that are found in cigarette smoke .
Because of this , a number of studies have examined a possible link between incense inhaled into the lungs and lung cancer , but the findings have not been conclusive .
The newly published study is the first to follow healthy people over time in an effort to understand the impact of long - term exposure to burning incense on cancer risk .
More than 60,000 Chinese residents of Singapore who were participants in a larger health study were followed from enrollment ( which occurred between 1993 and 1998 ) and 2005 .
None of the study participants had cancer at enrollment , and all were interviewed in detail about their dietary and lifestyle habits , including their exposure to incense .
Roughly three - quarters of the men and women reported being current incense users .
Over the course of the study , 325 upper respiratory tract cancers and 821 lung cancers were reported .
Long - term and frequent exposure to incense fumes was associated with a significant increase in the risk of squamous cell cancers of the upper respiratory tract .

I ’ve just closed 48 tabs , and found that there was still loads of tabs open ( and I did n’t want to continue counting ) so I wrote this code ( inspired by Open Tab Count firefox extension ) and found I had 77 still open !
For those of you who ’s mental arithmetic is poor , that ’s a total of 125 tabs !
And firefox 3 still runs really smoothly with little delay when changing tabs , and my system is using less than 2 GB of it ’s available 4GB of RAM .
Now , I think that ’s pretty impressive , and would like to see Google Chrome compete with that with it ’s one - process - per -tab design !
( If only FF3s JS was as fast … )
Whilst I am talking about browsers , I feel I should moan that Flash 10 for GNU / Linux is still really unstable , I have to restart firefox a couple of times a day because it ’s audio gets corrupted or it stops working and just displays a white box in firefox .
If only I could restart flash without restarting firefox …
Can I do that ?
It ’s time to start using the L - word when referring to John McCain and his campaign for the presidency .
Misleading does n’t quite capture the hypocritical use of distortions to make your opponent appear dishonest , as McCain ’s latest ad attempts .
The commercial below suggests that FactCheck.org busted Obama for making “ completely false ” statements , but here ’s what the independent watchdog had to say about that : “ That ’s what we said , but it was n’t about Obama . ”
The Web site went even further , investigating the other quote in the ad , which came from a column in The Wall Street Journal .
FactCheck says the quote is distorted , and makes assertions the Obama campaign vehemently denies .
This is n’t the first time Team McCain has mangled a quote or two .
( h/t : AmericaBlog )
McCain ad :
The growing tally of international weapon deals , which started to surge in 2006 , is now provoking questions among some advocates of arms control and some members of Congress .
“ Sure , this is a quick and easy way to cement alliances , ” said William D. Hartung , an arms control specialist at the New America Foundation , a public policy institute .
“ But this is getting out of hand . ”
Congress is notified before major arms sales deals are completed between foreign governments and the Pentagon .
While lawmakers have the power to object formally and block any individual sale , they rarely use it .
Representative Howard L. Berman of California , chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs , said he supported many of the individual weapons sales , like helping Iraq build the capacity to defend itself , but he worried that the sales blitz could have some negative effects .
“ This could turn into a spiraling arms race that in the end could decrease stability , ” he said .
The United States has long been the top arms supplier to the world .
In the past several years , however , the list of nations that rely on the United States as a primary source of major weapons systems has greatly expanded .
Among the recent additions are Argentina , Azerbaijan , Brazil , Georgia , India , Iraq , Morocco and Pakistan , according to sales data through the end of last month provided by the Department of Defense .
Cumulatively , these countries signed $ 870 million worth of arms deals with the United States from 2001 to 2004 .
For the past four fiscal years , that total has been $ 13.8 billion .
In many cases , these sales represent a cultural shift , as nations like Romania , Poland and Morocco , which have long relied on Russian - made MIG - 17 fighter jets , are now buying new F - 16s , built by Lockheed Martin .
At Lockheed Martin , one of the largest American military contractors , international sales last year brought in about $ 6.3 billion , or 15 percent of the company ’s total sales , up from $ 4.8 billion in 2001 .
The foreign sales by Lockheed and other American military contractors are credited with helping keep alive some production lines , like those of the F - 16 fighter jet and Boeing ’s C - 17 transport plane .
More than 40 business executives and other professionals appointed as special reserve deputies by erstwhile Orange County Sheriff Michael S. Carona have reported their badges and IDs lost or stolen , including his chief political and legal advisor Michael Schroeder -- who lost two shields .
Others on the list include prominent developer Michael Harrah ; father - son hotel developers who hosted a lavish fundraiser for Carona ; the owner of a popular Italian restaurant where Carona regularly held court ; and the operator of the swap meet at the Orange County Fair and Event Center , where Carona ’s wife serves on the governing board .
The names of 42 so - called Professional Service Responders were obtained Thursday by The Times under a public records request .
The Sheriff ’s Department did not immediately release the stolen and lost property reports filed by these reserves , withholding them until certain personal information had been redacted .
Schroeder is one of the most prominent Carona allies on the roster .
He contributed $ 3,200 to the ex-sheriff ’s campaigns and became a reserve in 2000 .
A longtime political operative in Orange County , he has helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for powerful Republicans , including Carona and Orange County Dist .
Atty .
Tony Rackauckas .

Schroeder reported his first badge missing in January 2002 , saying it might have been taken from his coat while he was at a barber shop , according to sheriff ’s spokesman John McDonald .
Schroeder was issued a new badge and lost that one in June 2007 .
McDonald said that he did not know the explanation for the second loss , but that Schroeder was not issued a third badge .
Schroeder is in China for the Summer Olympics and could not be reached for comment .
The Professional Service Responder ranks have long been riddled by controversy .
Carona created the special category of reserves shortly after he took office nine years ago and filled it with some of the county ’s richest and most powerful residents .
Many are also campaign contributors , leading to allegations that Carona was doling out badges to allies .
Carona , who resigned in January and is facing trial on federal corruption charges , has denied handing out badges as political favors .
But former Assistant Sheriff Don Haidl has told federal agents that Carona gave badges to dozens of people in exchange for $ 1,000 donations to his first campaign in 1998 .
Advertisement
In one of her first acts in office , newly appointed Sheriff Sandra Hutchens announced last month that she is recalling all of the badges that Carona handed out to his Professional Service Responders , a group of about 400 volunteers .
Hutchens has said she wants to ensure that all volunteers are sincerely interested in public service , as well as to rid the program of cronyism and allegations that reserves who contributed to his campaign did not have to go through training or background checks and that credentials were being misused .
Hutchens , whose decision to take back the badges was unpopular with some volunteers , said Thursday that she can’t say for certain whether some of the reserves are lying so they can keep their credentials , but that she suspects that might be the case because 42 “ is a lot ” to be missing .
Either way , she said the revelation supports her reasoning that public safety should come first .
Advertisement
“ I think it serves to make my point , really , that we ’ve got all these badges that are lost , and we do n’t know where they are , and they absolutely look like a badge and can be utilized by anyone who finds them to impersonate a peace officer , ” she said .
Among those who have reported their credentials missing or stolen are hotel developers and influential political fundraisers Hadi Makarechian and his son Paul .
They operate Makar Properties , a development company whose holdings include the St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort and Spa in Dana Point .
Their company is a major contributor to political causes throughout the state and has paid out more than $ 300,000 since 2004 .
In 2006 , Schroeder helped organize a Carona fundraiser at the St. Regis that drew hundreds of guests paying $ 1,500 a plate to attend .
The event was headlined by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , another Makar beneficiary , and gave Carona a much - needed boost during a heated campaign against candidates who targeted his scandal - ridden administration .
The Makarechians -- between themselves , two other relatives and their businesses -- gave Carona at least $ 6,500 , according to campaign records .
Neither of the Makarechians could be reached for comment Thursday .

Several other Carona allies on the list could not be reached to explain what happened to their badges , including :
* Antonio Cagnolo , who owns Antonello Ristorante near South Coast Plaza in Santa Ana , a hot spot for Orange County power brokers where Carona regularly mingled with associates .
* Jeff Teller , whose family for nearly 40 years has operated the Orange County Marketplace , one of the most profitable events on the Orange County fairgrounds .
The Tellers , as individuals and through their companies , have given at least $ 5,350 to Carona ’s campaigns .
Carona ’s wife , a member of the fair ’s Board of Directors , actively supported a no - bid contract for the Tellers when they competed against another concession giant for the rights to keep running the swap meet .
* Harrah , who donated $ 1,500 to Carona ’s 2006 campaign and is known for developing revitalization projects in downtown Santa Ana .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush on Friday declared an emergency in Louisiana as Tropical Storm Gustav headed for the Gulf of Mexico on the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina ’s deadly strike on New Orleans .
“ The president today declared an emergency exists in the State of Louisiana and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from ... Gustav beginning on August 27 , 2008 , and continuing , ” the White House said in a statement .
Gustav was expected to strengthen in the warm Caribbean on Friday as it left flooded Jamaica and churned toward the Cayman Islands .
The storm , which killed at least 70 people in the Caribbean , plowed toward superheated waters south of Cuba where it could absorb enough energy to strengthen into a major hurricane before ripping through the heavy concentration of U.S. oil and natural gas platforms off Louisiana .
The White House says it is closely watching storm developments .
Bush and his administration were widely criticized for a slow federal response to Katrina .

Getting healthier is one of our prime motivations for this road trip .
We hope to wind up the trip by settling down in a new home with a better climate and walkable neighbourhoods in a sustainable community .
In the short term , we want to get in shape and stay healthy on the road !
So far , we ’re trying to build healthier choices into the fabric of our travel life such as ( even more ) plant - based , whole foods eating ; more walking ; and more exercise in general .
I was really excited when I found this Quick A.M. Yoga Twist video with Rodney Yee from Gaiam because we can do the routine together by lying end - to - end on an average hotel bed .
We just point towards the same wall at the same time rather than following the “ left ” and “ right ” instructions in the video .
If only we had bathing caps , we ’d look like Ester Williams in stereo .
Unfortunately , Gaiam has n’t set the video up so I can embed it for you here , but you can click over to watch it on their site .
We just play it on a laptop , and we ’ve found that after watching it once , we can follow along just by listening .
The 5 minute stretch seems to do wonders for our backs , and all the twisting gets our digestive apparatus revved up for breakfast .
If you try it out , with or without bathing caps , let us know what you think .
If you can recommend other simple stretches suitable for hotel rooms or highway rest stops , please let us know , too !
We ’re trying to pull off the road more often on long drives to stretch out and we have n’t settled on the perfect routine yet .

( CNN ) -- Republican nominee Sen. John McCain , appearing Friday on ABC's " The View , " was aggressively pressed on Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's qualifications to be vice president as well as his new campaign ads that several independent fact - check groups have called misleading .
Sen .
John McCain faces some tough questions Friday on ABC's " The View . "
Co-host Barbara Walters immediately questioned McCain about a remark he'd made that Palin might be the most " marvelous running mate " ever , asking , " That 's not a little strong ? "
" We politicians are never given to exaggerations or hyperbole , as you know , " McCain joked , before praising Palin as the most " popular governor in America " and one who has united a " spark in America . "
Walters went on to press Palin 's reformist credentials , noting McCain has served in Washington for more than two decades and asking repeatedly , " Who 's she going to reform , you ? "
McCain answered by saying Democrats have controlled Congress for two years , but then Walters quickly interrupted : " But tell me who she is going to reform -- we are n't talking about the economy , we 're not talking about housing ; she was chosen to reform , who is she going to reform ? "
Appearing somewhat frustrated , McCain said , " The Democrat Party , the Republican Party , even an independent .
She 'll reform all of Washington . "
Walters , seeming somewhat exasperated , asked , " How ?
What will she do ?
What is she going to reform specifically , senator ? "
McCain said Palin had a strong record on vetoing earmark spending .
" The fact is she was a reform governor , she took on an incumbent governor of her own party and defeated him .
She sold the airplane and fired the chef , " McCain said , referring to Palin 's efforts to put her predecessor 's state jet up for auction on eBay and her dismissal of the governor 's personal chef .
" She sold the airplane at a loss , " Walters interrupted .
( The jet failed to draw sufficient bids on eBay and later was sold at a loss through an ordinary aircraft brokerage . )
McCain later was pressed on the increasingly derisive tone of the campaign and his new television commercial that carries the widely discredited claim Obama supported comprehensive sex education for kindergartners as an Illinois state senator .
McCain defended the ad's claims as well as those of a Web ad that said Obama 's " lipstick on a pig " comments were directed at Palin .
He added that the tone of the campaign might have been more amicable if Obama had agreed to his proposals for a series of town - hall meetings .
" If we had done what I asked Sen . Obama to do , I do n't think you 'd see the same tenor of this campaign , " he said .
" Why do n't you ask Obama the next time he's on this show why wo n't he be in town meetings with me ? "
Walters responded , " You bring us Sarah Palin , and we 'll ask Obama . "
McCain also appeared Friday on " The Rachael Ray Show . "
Meanwhile , the McCain and Obama camps accused each other of engaging in lies , unfair attacks and gutter politics in a series of television ads and memos Friday .
McCain 's campaign released a television ad , titled " disrespectful , " that accuses McCain 's Democratic rival of launching desperate attacks and smears against Palin .
In the McCain ad , the announcer says that the Obama camp had " lashed out at Sarah Palin " and dismissed Palin as " good looking " as the Democratic nominee 's face appears on the screen .
The announcer also says the Democrats had said Palin was doing " what she was told " and had " desperately " called her a liar .
" How disrespectful , " the announcer says .
" And how Gov. Sarah Palin proves them wrong , every day . "
Obama never made any of the statements the McCain camp released to support the ad , and the comment that Palin was " good looking " was made by the Democratic vice presidential nominee , Sen .
Joe Biden , in a self - deprecating joke when he was asked what the " obvious " differences were between the two vice presidential nominees .
Watch the McCain ad »
Biden repeatedly has said on the campaign trail that he respected Palin and that he thought she was qualified for the vice presidency .
And FactCheck.org pointed out that the quote from an Obama adviser that Palin was doing " what she was told " was taken out of context .
The quote is taken from the response of Obama 's chief strategist , David Axelrod , in which he said Palin had misrepresented Obama 's legislative record .
" Maybe that 's what she was told " about his voting record , Axelrod said .
A day after the two campaigns agreed to a truce on the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , the Obama camp launched two television ads .
In one , the campaign paints McCain as being out of touch by showing pictures of him when he first entered the Senate in 1982 as disco music plays .
The ad also highlights McCain 's own admissions that he lacked computer skills and does not use e-mail .
Watch the Obama ad attacking McCain »
" After one president that is out of touch , we can't afford more of the same , " the announcer of the Obama ad concludes , a reference to President Bush .
In the second Obama ad , the candidate himself appears .
" We 've heard a lot of talk about change this year .
The question is , change to what ? "
Obama asks .
" To me , change is a government that does n't let banks and oil companies rip off the American people , " the Illinois Democrat says .
" Change is when we finally fix health care instead of just talking about it .
Change is giving tax breaks to middle class families instead of companies that send jobs overseas .
Change is a president who brings people together . "
The ads come as Obama 's campaign manager , David Plouffe , issued a tough memo to reporters that accused McCain and his campaign of turning to " smears , lies and cynical attempts to distract from the issues . "
While their campaigns sparred , Obama was to campaign in New Hampshire , first stopping in Dover to discuss tax relief then moving on to Concord .
Biden had planned to campaign Friday in Texas but canceled events after Hurricane Ike began to threaten the Galveston and Houston areas .
His Republican counterpart , Palin , was in Alaska on Friday and was to appear for a second time with ABC's Charlie Gibson , part of her first one - on - one interview with the national media .

From King James to James Bond , Chaucer to Sputnik , a personal library like no other . *
Photo : Andrew Moore *
The View From Above Looming over the library is an original Sputnik 1 satellite , one of several backups the Soviets built .
At far left is a model of NASA 's experimental X - 29 jet , with forward - swept wings .
" It 's the first plane that a pilot can't fly — only computers can handle it , " Walker says .
On the top of the center shelves are " scholar 's rocks , " natural formations believed by the Chinese to spur contemplation .
Behind the rocks is a 15 - foot - long model of the Saturn V rocket .
Nothing quite prepares you for the culture shock of Jay Walker 's library .
You exit the austere parlor of his New England home and pass through a hallway into the bibliographic equivalent of a Disney ride .
Stuffed with landmark tomes and eye - grabbing historical objects — on the walls , on tables , standing on the floor — the room occupies about 3,600 square feet on three mazelike levels .
Is that a Sputnik ? ( Yes . )
Hey , those books appear to be bound in rubies .
( They are . )
That edition of Chaucer ... is it a Kelmscott ?
( Natch . )
Gee , that chandelier looks like the one in the James Bond flick Die Another Day .
( Because it is . )
No matter where you turn in this ziggurat , another treasure beckons you — a 1665 Bills of Mortality chronicle of London ( you can track plague fatalities by week ) , the instruction manual for the Saturn V rocket ( which launched the Apollo 11 capsule to the moon ) , a framed napkin from 1943 on which Franklin D. Roosevelt outlined his plan to win World War II .
In no time , your mind is stretched like hot taffy .
Jay 's Anatomy " What 's so wonderful about our knowledge of the human body is how remarkably constrained it has been over time , " Walker says .
In the center of the table sits the Anatomia universa , an early - 19th - century medical masterwork by the Italian illustrator Paolo Mascagni .
At front right is a field tool kit for Civil War surgeons .
Grasping the box of prosthetic eyeballs at left is the original " Thing " hand from the TV show The Addams Family , signed by the cast .
In front of the 19th - century phrenological bust is a book , from about 1500 , containing the first published illustrations of surgery on humans .
" Pre-anesthesia , of course " Walker says .
At the rear are a 300 million - year - old trilobite fossil , a raptor skeleton , and a clutch of fossilized dinosaur eggs .
Wearing a huge can - you - believe - it grin is the collection 's impresario , the 52 - year - old Internet entrepreneur and founder of Walker Digital — a think tank churning out ideas and patents , it 's best - known for its lucrative Priceline.com .
" I started an R&D lab and have been an entrepreneur .
So I have a big affinity for the human imagination , " he says .
" About a dozen years ago , my collection got so big that I said , ' It 's time to build a room , a library , that would be about human imagination . ' "
Walker 's house was constructed specifically to accommodate his massive library .
To create the space , which was constructed in 2002 , Walker and architect Mark Finlay first built a 7 - foot - long model .
Then they used miniature cameras to help visualize what it would be like to move around inside .
In a conscious nod to M. C. Escher ( whose graphics are echoed in the wood tiling ) , the labyrinthine platforms seem to float in space , an illusion amplified by the glass - paneled bridges connecting the platforms .
Walker commissioned decorative etched glass , dynamic lighting , and even a custom soundtrack that sets the tone for the cerebral adventures hidden in this cabinet of curiosities .
" I said to the architect , ' Think of it as a theater , from a lighting and engineering standpoint , ' " Walker says .
" But it 's not a performance space .
It 's an engagement space . "
Planetarium
The massive " book " by the window is a specially commissioned , internally lit 2.5 - ton Clyde Lynds sculpture .
It 's meant to embody the spirit of the library : the mind on the right page , the universe on the left .
Pointing out to that universe is a powerful Questar 7 telescope .
On the rear of the table ( from left ) are a globe of the moon signed by nine of the 12 astronauts who walked on it , a rare 19th - century sky atlas with white stars against a black sky , and a fragment from the Sikhote - Alin meteorite that fell in Russia in 1947 — it 's tiny but weighs 15 pounds .
In the foreground is Andrea Cellarius ' hand - painted celestial atlas from 1660 .
" It has the first published maps where Earth was not the center of the solar system , " Walker says .
" It divides the age of faith from the age of reason . "
Inspiration Point Walker frequently meets with the Walker Digital brain trust in the seating area of the library , hoping to draw inspiration from the surroundings .
Artist Clyde Lynds ( known for integrating fiber optics into his work ) created the intricate illuminated glass panels and many other visual elements .
Walker himself designed the Escher - like tile floor , modeled after a tumbling block pattern from the Victorian age .
He bought the chandelier ( seen in the Bond film Die Another Day ) at an auction and rewired it with 6,000 LEDs .
The open book on the table features watercolor illustrations for an 18th - century papal palace that was never built .
The globe has special meaning for Walker : " It was a wedding gift Eileen and I received in 1982 . "
Reading Room
In the foreground are several early - 20th - century volumes with jeweled bindings — gold , rubies , and diamonds — crafted by the legendary firm Sangorski & Sutcliffe .
On the table ( first row , from left ) is a 16th - century book of jousting , a Dickens novel decorated with the author 's portrait , and ( open , with Post - it flags ) an original copy of the 1493 Nuremberg Chronicle , the first illustrated history book .
Second row : the 1535 Coverdale Bible ( the first completely translated into modern English ) , a medieval tome with intricate illustrations of dwarfs , a collection of portraits commissioned at a 17th - century German festival ( " Facebook in 1610 ! " ) , a tree - bark Indonesian guide to cannibalism , and a Middle Eastern mother goddess icon from around 5000 BC .
Walker shuns the sort of bibliomania that covets first editions for their own sake — many of the volumes that decorate the library 's walls are leather - bound Franklin Press reprints .
What gets him excited are things that changed the way people think , like Robert Hooke 's Micrographia .
Published in 1665 , it was the first book to contain illustrations made possible by the microscope .
He 's also drawn to objects that embody a revelatory ( or just plain weird ) train of thought .
" I get offered things that collectors do n't , " he says .
" Nobody else would want a book on dwarfs , with pages beautifully hand - painted in silver and gold , but for me that makes perfect sense . "
What excites him even more is using his treasures to make mind - expanding connections .
He loves juxtapositions , like placing a 16th - century map that combines experience and guesswork — " the first one showing North and South America , " he says — next to a modern map carried by astronauts to the moon .
" If this is what can happen in 500 years , nothing is impossible . "
Gadget Lab A brand - new One Laptop per Child XO , far left , sits next to a relatively ancient RadioShack TRS - 80 Model 100 .
In back , a 1911 typewriting machine and a 1909 Kent radio .
The large contraption at center is the Nazis ' supposedly unbreakable Enigma code machine .
The book to its left is a copy of Johannes Trithemius ' 1518 Polygraphiae , a cryptographic landmark .
On the right is an Apple II motherboard signed by Woz .
An Edison kinetoscope sits beside an 1890 Edison phonograph ( along with three of the wax cylinders it uses for recording ) .
Nearby is a faithful copy of Edison 's lightbulb .
The gadget with the tubes is an IBM processor circa 1960 .
In front of it stands a truly ancient storage device , a Sumerian clay cone used to record surplus grain .
Walker struggles to balance privacy with his impulse to share his finds with the outside world .
Schoolchildren often visit by invitation , as do executives , politicians , and scholars .
Last February , the organizers of the TED conference persuaded him to decorate their stage with some of his treasures .
But he 's never invited any press in to see the collection — until now .

Error 404 ( Not Found ) !!1
404 .
That ’s an error .
I linked to this subtly in my post about my trip to the UK next month to visit Europe 's new particle accelerator , the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , but it deserves more attention .
Two men are suing to stop the LHC from being switched on , saying it may be dangerous and might even destroy the Earth :
But Walter L. Wagner and Luis Sancho contend that scientists at the European Center for Nuclear Research , or CERN , have played down the chances that the collider could produce , among other horrors , a tiny black hole , which , they say , could eat the Earth .
Or it could spit out something called a “ strangelet ” that would convert our planet to a shrunken dense dead lump of something called “ strange matter . ”
Their suit also says CERN has failed to provide an environmental impact statement as required under the National Environmental Policy Act . [...]
The lawsuit , filed March 21 in Federal District Court , in Honolulu , seeks a temporary restraining order prohibiting CERN from proceeding with the accelerator until it has produced a safety report and an environmental assessment .
It names the federal Department of Energy , the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory , the National Science Foundation and CERN as defendants .
First off the bat , this sounds nuts , but really it 's not so nuts that we should n't look into it .
There are two causes for some concern : one is that LHC might create a black hole which would eat the Earth , and the other is that a very odd quantum entity called a strangelet might be created , with equally devastating results .
However , I do n't think there 's anything to worry about .
I want to make that clear up front .
The LHC will slam subatomic particles together at fantastic speeds .
The collision in a sense shatters the particles and all sorts of weird beasties are created in the aftermath .
This give physicists insight into the basic quantum nature of the Universe .
The higher the energy of the collision , the more interesting stuff you get .
LHC will be the most powerful collider ever built , and is expected to provide really new looks at the quantum world .
That 's what has the two litigators worried .
If two subatomic particles collide at high enough speed , it 's possible that they will collapse into a black hole .
If that happens , it would fall through the Earth and , well , you can guess what bad things would happen then^ *.
However , studies done by CERN show that the energies generated will be too low to make black holes .
Also , due to a weird effect called Hawking radiation , the tiny black holes would evaporate instantly .
The two litigants , however , say that Hawking radiation is not an established fact , and therefore we should be more careful .
While that 's technically true , they forgot something important : the same rules of quantum physics that make a black hole in a subatomic collision also indicate they would evaporate .
So if you 're worried they wo n't evaporate , then you should n't be worried they'd be created in the first place .
Same goes for the creation of a quantum strangelet .
This is a weird conglomeration of particles called quarks , and if a strangelet comes into contact with normal matter can convert it into more strangelets .
The idea is that these can cause a chain reaction that turns all available matter into strangelets .
That would be bad .
However , first , strangelets are completely theoretical , and again even if they are real it 's incredibly unlikely they would be created even by LHC .
And even if they were created , the chances of them being a danger are very small .
A study a few years ago by physicists at MIT , Yale , and Princeton shows this to be the case ; as they point out , higher energy particles hit the Moon all the time .
If strangelets could be created in this way , the Moon would have converted to a big ball o' strangelets billions of years ago .
So I think that considering things like this happening is good -- after all , we 're walking into new territory here -- but in this particular case the litigants are wrong .
A lawsuit seems like overkill .
In fact , it 's so odd that my skeptical gland was tweaked , and I decided to look into the litigants ' backgrounds .
Walter Wagner apparently has a physics background , but was involved in a similar lawsuit over the Brookhaven collider a few years back , which turned out to be completely baseless .
As for the other , Luis Sancho , he's , well , how do I phrase this delicately ?
He 's a bit outside the mainstream .
Actually , way outside the mainstream .
In fact , totally and way way far outside the mainstream .
I do n't think you can even see the mainstream from where he is .
While dismissing the idea of any danger from LHC due to these factors would be an ad hominem and therefore unfair , I think it adds a dimension to this case that 's good to keep in mind .
Again , I 'm not worried .
I do n't see any basis for their fears , and certainly not for their lawsuit .
So I 'm still greatly looking forward to visiting the LHC in April .
It 'll be a fantastic glimpse into the next generation of physics , and will open up new vistas for us to explore .
If the court agrees to let it run , of course .
^* Or you can read all about it in my book Death from the Skies !
which comes out in a few months .

Chess Principles ...
Just wanted to start a thread and share some chess principles I and others on this chess site might know of ...

CHESS ETIQUETTE - or chess ETHICS
Dear all , Generally speaking many ( perhaps most ) of my opponents often resign an otherwise hopelessly lost game .

Some continue fighting to the bitter but completely obvious end - even when the possibility of a stalemate is out of the question .
It seems to be there is something * morally * suspect about such behavior .

Many people looking at the current mudslinging and lying coming from the McCain campaign have wondered what happened to the old McCain .
You remember — McCain the straight talker who did n’t choose his words carefully , or McCain the maverick who was willing to buck his own party when they were wrong , call televangelists “ agents of intolerance ” , or point out the obvious that if you make abortion illegal , it will only force women to get dangerous and illegal abortions .
Interestingly , McCain answered that question himself .
Even though McCain lost the 2000 presidential primary , his popularity was at an all time high , and he wrote in his memoirs , titled “ Worth the Fighting For ” :
“ I did n’t decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism .
In truth , I wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president . …
In truth , I ’d had the ambition for a long time . ”
In other words , when he thought the “ straight talker ” or “ maverick ” image would help him get elected , he worked to develop that image .
But the 2000 election proved to him that it was n’t enough , so he tried something else , completely throwing away his old persona for a new , more electable one .
I previously posted a video of McCain appearing in a skit on Saturday Night Live , playing a creepy husband , and people often remark about how good an actor he is .
Maybe he is just a really good actor , and the real McCain is someone who will play any part and do anything , at any cost , in order to get elected .
How do you learn how to play a part full time , whatever part you think you need to win ?
Maybe this is something he learned while being tortured .
Potato only makes up 42 % of the ingredients of Pringles Pringles , the popular snack food in a tube , are not potato crisps , a High Court judge has ruled .
Their packaging , " unnatural shape " and the fact that the potato content is less than 50 % helped Mr Justice Warren make his crunch decision .
As a result , Pringles , in all flavours are free from Value Added Tax ( VAT ) .
Manufacturer Procter & Gamble ( P&G ) is likely to save millions of pounds as a result of the decision - with customers also likely to pay less .
Spud impact P&G had gone to court to challenge a VAT and Duties Tribunal decision that the Pringle was subject to the standard 17.5 % rate of VAT because it was " a potato crisp product " , which are , unlike most food , subject to the tax .
But the manufacturer had insisted that their best - selling product was not similar to potato crisps , because of their " mouth melt " taste , " uniform colour " and " regular shape " which " is not found in nature " .
It also argued that potato crisps - unlike Pringles - did not contain non-potato flours , and were not packaged in tubes .
Pringles are more like a cake or a biscuit , it claimed , because they are manufactured from dough .
Mr Justice Warren ruled that Pringles were not " made from the potato " - as set out in the definition laid down by the 1994 VAT Act .
To be subject to VAT , a product " must be wholly , or substantially wholly , made from the potato " .
But he said that Pringles did not meet these criteria - being made from potato flour , corn flour , wheat starch and rice flour together with fat and emulsifier , salt and seasoning , with a potato content of about 42 % .
Taking the biscuit Separately , the Food and Agricultural Organisation and the World Health Organisation have decided - after seven years of debate - what qualifies as a proper tomato .
The ruling means tomatoes may be round , ribbed , oblong or elongated , or can be cherry tomatoes or cocktail tomatoes .
Other characteristics include being clean , whole , fresh in appearance , and free from foreign smells and pests .
Earlier this year the European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) ruled that the UK Treasury had wrongly imposed VAT on a Marks and Spencer teacake .
Customers paid VAT for 20 years before the authorities accepted the product was a cake , which does not command VAT .
Under UK tax rules , most traditional bakery products such as bread , cakes , flapjacks and Jaffa Cakes are free of VAT , but the tax is payable on cereal bars , shortbread and partly - coated or wholly - coated biscuits .

Hoewel het een noodzaak is , is het mogelijk dat u te veel betaalt en zou kunnen profiteren van het leren hoe u geld kunt besparen op beste verzekeringen , van auto naar huis , en meer zoals onafhankelijk energie vergelijken .
Ik weet dat mensen teveel betalen omdat ik op een gegeven moment teveel betaalde .
Toen ik 16 was , had ik net een nieuwe auto voor me gekocht .
Het was goedkoop , had hoge kilometers en had meer verfschilfers dan echte verf .
Hoewel al het andere aan de auto te veel gebruikt en goedkoop was , was de verzekering meer dan $ 100 per maand !
Mijn vader hielp me een beleid te vinden en geen van ons besteedde veel aandacht aan de kosten , wat verrassend was , gezien zijn soberheid .
Ja , ik was een tiener en een nieuwe bestuurder .
Noch mijn vader noch ik hebben ons huiswerk gedaan en gewinkeld om geld te besparen op verzekeringen , omdat we net de verzekeringsmaatschappij van mijn vader gebruikten .
Ook had ik allerlei dekking op deze goedkope , lelijke auto .
Ik had een zeer laag eigen risico ( zoals $ 250 of zoiets ) en een botsingsverzekering ( die meestal niet nodig is voor een super goedkope auto ) .
Toen ik me eenmaal realiseerde dat ik alle fouten maakte , bracht ik wijzigingen aan en daalde mijn verzekering met meer dan HALF .
Ik ging van het betalen van meer dan $ 100 per maand aan autoverzekeringen naar ergens rond de $ 50 per maand .
Wat heeft invloed op hoeveel u betaalt voor verzekeringen ?
Ten eerste , om geld te besparen op verzekeringen , moet u weten wat precies van invloed is op uw verzekeringstarief
Enkele van de factoren die een rol spelen bij autoverzekeringen zijn :
Waar woon je .
Afhankelijk van de stad en de staat waarin je woont , kun je meer of minder betalen dan anderen .
Dit heeft invloed op uw verzekeringstarief , want als uw regio meer dan gemiddeld ongevallen , veel autodiefstallen , gek weer of iets anders heeft , moet u mogelijk meer betalen voor de verzekering .

The McCain campaign is resuming all activities and the Senator will travel to the debate this afternoon .
So McCain blinked .
He said he would suspend his campaign until there was a deal .
He did not suspend his campaign .
He asked for the debate to be postponed till after the deal .
There has been no deal and he has caved on the debate .

In the guise of humanitarian aid
Bush dispatches US military forces to Georgia
By Barry Grey
14 August 2008
In a major escalation of the conflict with Russia over Georgia , President George W. Bush on Wednesday announced a “ vigorous and ongoing ” deployment of US military forces to its key ally in the Caucasus .
Bush appeared in the White House Rose Garden for the second time in three days , this time flanked by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates , and announced the military buildup , casting it as a humanitarian relief operation .
Even as he spoke of a humanitarian mission , Bush made clear the military dimensions of the measures he was announcing .
He said he was directing Pentagon chief Gates to lead the mission , which would be “ headed by the United States military . ”
He announced that a C - 17 military aircraft was already on its way to Georgia and that “ in the days ahead we will use US aircraft , as well as naval forces , to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies . ”
This is a formula for an injection of US military and naval forces into Georgia of indeterminate scope and duration .
It will certainly involve the presence of hundreds if not thousands of uniformed US military personnel on the ground , and a substantial number of warships in the region .
The US is introducing this military force into a situation that remains highly unstable and combustible , raising the possibility of a direct military clash between the United States and Russia .
Bush spoke less than a day after Russia and Georgia had agreed provisionally to a cease - fire in their five - day war .
The agreement had been brokered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy , acting on behalf of the European Union .
Even as Bush spoke , Russia and Georgia were trading accusations of truce violations , and Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili was objecting to provisions of the agreement which , he claimed , failed to prevent the pro-Russian break - away republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from seceding from Georgia .
In his remarks , Bush issued an implicit threat against any attempt by Russia to interfere with Washington ’s “ humanitarian ” operation .
“ We expect Russia to honor its commitment , ” he said , “ to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance .
We expect Russia to ensure that all lines of communications and transport , including seaports , airports , roads and airspace , remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit . ”
The US will pour military resources into Georgia to strengthen its hand against Russia , and denounce any objections by Moscow as an attack on humanitarian aid and a violation of the cease - fire agreement .
Within minutes of Bush ’s Rose Garden statement , Saakashvili spelled out its essential meaning in a televised address from Tbilisi .
“ You have heard the statement by the US president that the United States is starting a military - humanitarian operation in Georgia , ” he said .
“ It means that Georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the US defense ministry ... ”
He went on to call Bush ’s “ relief ” mission a “ turning point , ” and characterized its import as “ definitely an American military presence . ”
Bush also announced that Rice would immediately travel to France to meet with Sarkozy and then go to Georgia .
Employing the rhetoric of the Cold War , he said Rice would meet with Saakashvili and “ continue our efforts to rally the free world in defense of a free Georgia . ”
He further threatened Russia with diplomatic and political sanctions , suggesting it might be excluded from the G - 8 group of industrialized nations and prevented from joining the World Trade Organization .
Bush ’s remarks were drenched with hypocrisy .
He reiterated Washington ’s support for Georgian control of the disputed territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , invoking once again the “ sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia . ”
Neither he nor any other American spokesperson has explained why Georgia ’s use of murderous violence against South Ossetia in its indiscriminate shelling of the region ’s capital city was a legitimate defense of “ territorial integrity , ” while Serbia ’s use of force against Kosovan secessionists was a war crime .
The US seized on Serbia ’s moves against CIA - backed separatists in Kosovo to carry out a ten - week air war , under the auspices of NATO , in 1999 .
While Washington decries Russia ’s “ disproportionate ” use of force against Georgian troops which attacked South Ossetia and condemns Moscow for military action beyond the borders of the breakaway republic , the US and NATO rained bombs and missiles on virtually all parts of Serbia , demolishing bridges , water pumping stations , electricity grids , government buildings , housing developments , schools and hospitals in the capital city of Belgrade .
The US and NATO killed far more civilians in its campaign to crush Serbia , a traditional ally of Russia , than have been killed by both sides in the current fighting in the Caucasus .
The US has absolutely no political or moral standing to denounce Russia or anyone else for deploying military force .
Washington asserts an unlimited and unilateral right to mobilize its massive apparatus of military violence wherever and whenever it wishes , spreading death and destruction from the Persian Gulf to Central Asia and threatening even more bloody conflagrations .
In the current conflict , the US government and media have cast Russia as the aggressor .
There is no progressive content to Moscow ’s actions in Georgia .
They are motivated by the predatory aims of the Russian ruling elite , which is intent on reasserting Russian control over territories on its border that it dominated for centuries .
However , the eruption of war in the Caucasus is the outcome of a policy pursued by US imperialism since the breakup of the Soviet Union whose ultimate aim is the reduction of Russia to a semi-colonial status .
It is inconceivable that Washington was not intimately involved in the preparations for Georgia ’s attack on South Ossetia .
US military advisers virtually run the military of what Washington considers its key ally in the Cacausus , a strategically critical bridgehead between the oil - rich Caspian Basin and Western Europe .
Just one month ago Secretary of State Rice visited Tbilisi and reaffirmed US support for Georgia ’s admission to NATO , a development which Russia considers an intolerable threat to its security .
Rice ’s visit was followed by a massive three - week military training exercise , in which 1,000 US troops participated .
The incendiary measures announced by Bush on Wednesday represent the response of American imperialism to the major setback it has suffered as a result of Russia ’s military intervention in Georgia .
There is great concern within the US ruling elite that Russia ’s routing of Georgia will undermine Washington ’s drive to displace Russia from Moscow ’s former spheres of influence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and establish American hegemony over the Eurasian land mass .
US policy makers worry that the example of Georgia will weaken US control over right - wing client regimes it has established in a whole number of countries that were either part of the Soviet Union , such as Georgia and Ukraine , or allied to the Soviet Union through the Warsaw Pact .
From the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 to the present , the United States has carried out a policy of militarily encircling Russia and surrounding it with hostile states dependent upon and subservient to Washington .
As the USSR was disintegrating , the United States launched its first war against Iraq , a key ally of the Soviet Union in the Middle East .
During the 1990s , the US and Western Europe sponsored the dismemberment of Yugoslavia in order to isolate and weaken the Russian ally Serbia .
In 1998 , the US spearheaded the incorporation into NATO , the US - dominated military alliance , of a whole number of newly independent states that had been either part of the Soviet Union or allied to it through the Warsaw Pact , including Estonia , Latvia , Poland , the Czech Republic , Hungary and Bulgaria .
In 1999 the US launched the air war against Serbia .
At the same time , the US organized the construction of a new pipeline to transport oil from the Caspian Basin , via Baku , through Georgia to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan , bypassing Russian territory .
In 2002 , the US set up military bases in the former Central Asian Soviet republics of Uzbekistan ( since then closed at the insistence of the Uzbek government ) and Kyrgyzstan .
At the end of 2003 , the US engineered the “ Rose Revolution ” that brought Saakashvili to power in Georgia .
In 2004 , NATO admitted a new group of states formerly aligned with Russia — Lithuania , Romania , Slovakia and Slovenia .
One year later Washington orchestrated the “ Orange Revolution ” that toppled a pro-Russian government in Ukraine and replaced it with a pro-American regime .
The final chapter in this assault on the strategic position of Russia was the recognition last February of Kosovo ’s bid for independence from Serbia .
Until now , the US has encountered no serious resistance .
The events of the past week represent a major shift .
For the first time , Russia , flush with oil money and able to exploit the overextended state of the US military , with its massive commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan , pushed back .
This has evoked an apoplectic response in the American ruling elite , which has no intention of accepting a diminution of its influence in the regions formerly dominated by the Soviet Union .
US imperialism will react by immensely escalating its confrontation with Russia , no matter what the cost .
There is also a domestic component to the US escalation of tensions with Russia .
The Bush administration is consciously seeking to create an atmosphere of international crisis in the run-up to the November presidential election .
It calculates that an election held in an environment of fear and insecurity will boost the electoral chances of the Republican candidate John McCain .
McCain has based his campaign on his military background and his supposed foreign policy experience .
From early on , he has called for a more combative stance toward Russia , and has responded to the Georgia crisis by demanding Russia ’s ejection from the G - 8 and other punitive measures .
The Wall Street Journal in an editorial on Wednesday summed up the demand of sections of the ruling elite and elements within the Bush administration for a major and permanent shift to something like a new Cold War against Russia .
The newspaper wrote : “ Reshaping US policy toward Russia will take longer than the months between now and January 20 , when a new president takes office .
But Mr. Bush can at least atone for his earlier misjudgments about Mr. Putin and steer policy in a new direction that his successor would have to deal with . ”
There are , in fact , only relatively minor tactical differences between McCain and Democratic candidate Barack Obama on US policy toward Russia .
Both continue to demand the admission of Georgia and Ukraine into NATO , which would put the US - led military alliance on the very doorstep of Russia .
Had Georgia already been a member of NATO , the alliance would have been legally bound to intervene militarily in its defense following Russia ’s incursion into South Ossetia .
The trajectory of the imperialist drive to carve up the world , spearheaded by US imperialism ’s mad drive for global hegemony , is ominously clear .
The American ruling elite will drag American workers and all of humanity into a catastrophe unless it is stopped .
The only social force capable of achieving this is the international working class , united in the struggle to put an end to capitalism , the source of imperialist war , on the basis of a revolutionary socialist program .

Energy Culture in Hasbro ’s 1980s Universe
By Hervé St - Louis
Looking at the revival of properties from toymaker Hasbro , one could say that everything that was popular in the 1980s , is popular again today , in the 2000s .
At first , pundits claimed that there was a claw back effect created by the nostalgia of 1980s children growing up as eternally adults trying to claim back some of their childhood back .
I propose that there is another reason for the popularity of Hasbro properties like G.I. Joe and the Transformers that are not explained by nostalgia .
Many of the themes found in the Transformers and G.I .
Joe are still current with today ’s public .
War and the terrorism , as exemplified in G.I.
Joe and its fight against Cobra a multinational terrorist organization bent on destroying the American way of life that has to be opposed by an elite military group from all of the United States arm forces ’ branches .

In the , giant robots that can transform into technological devices like cars , airplanes , or weapons , there is a constant arms race between the two factions , the peace - loving Autobots that protect humans from the war mongering Decepticons .
Both terrorism and military arms races are current topics that still affect the North American public today .
Since the terrorist attack on New York City on September 11 , 2001 , the American government has been fighting a “ war on terror ” against Islamic groups around the Middle East and other parts of the world .
Other countries , in Europe , and Asia , such as China and Russia are also embroiled in this fight over terrorism .
In the case of the arms race , it is no longer a typical arms race facing set in a Cold War , as it was in the 1980s .
It is a generalized arms race that opposes several nations .
Many of them are military allies , normally .
This generalized arms race can also be seen on the corporate side of the world , in places such as the mobile technology debate where companies such as Apple are facing Research in Motion .
On the Web , Google , Yahoo and Microsoft are waging a continuing fight to dominate the eyeballs of the public and be the platform the latter will use in their daily computing activities .
Themes found in the fictional worlds ofand theare as relevant today as they were in the 1980s .
Thus presenting a new version of old properties likeand theto today ’s public is a safe bet , as long as they simply update older themes explored in the 1980s and improve on the characterization and the storytelling and the visual appearance of the properties for a new generation .
Looking at the various comic book series published by Dreamwave Productions , Devil ’s Due and IDW Publishing since the early 2000s , one can see a focus on improving characterization , storytelling and the visual appearances of the properties .
However , these simple updates would not explain the popularity of these properties if it were not for the fact that they borrowed heavily from older themes such as terrorism , arms races but tend to ignore the energy crisis from the 1980s .
The energy crisis of the 1980s should probably be appropriately called the energy crisis of the 1970s .
This crisis was the result of the members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries , plus Egypt and Syria to stop providing oil to countries supporting Israel .
Effects of this political action were rising energy costs , rationing of reserve and an attempt of many nations to limit their dependence on oil , or to look for alternative energy sources .
On toymaker Hasbro , the direct result was the reduction of the size of its action figures .
The G.I . Joe line of toys was introduced as a 3 ¾ inch action figure line , instead of a 12 - inches line , in 1983 Incidentally , this concern for energy also influenced the contents of the stories about bothand the .
In the’ comic books and cartoon series of the 1980s , the main point of contention between the Decepticons and the Autobots is the consumption of energy resources and its harvest .
The Decepticons , besides wanting to rule the universe , constantly look for ways to find energy sources for themselves , their native planet Cybertron or their weapons .
The original reason the Transformers left Cybertron in many of the original stories from the comic books and the 1980s cartoon series , was to look for new sources of energy .
In many instances , the Autobots collaborated with humans in order to satisfy their energy needs .
For example , in , Autobot Jazz negotiates an agreement with oil tycoon G.B. Blackrock to fuel the Autobots in exchange for protection .
In the third part of , the first cartoon mini-series featuring the Transformers , human Spike Witwicky mentions that governments of the Earth have approved a request of the Autobots to provide them with fuel in exchange of their defeat of the Decepticons .
In , concerns for energy were more frequently seen in the cartoon series begun in 1983 .
In the first mini-series pitting G.I . Joe versus the terrorist organization Cobra , three sources of energy , from unusual sources such as a meteorite , heavy water and special crystals were necessary to power a teleportation device that could move armies and landmarks .
Although several episodes of the original cartoon series featured the quest for new sources of energy , it was the G.I .
Joe the Movie , incidentally , which was never released in theatres , that most demonstrated the need and fight for new energy sources .
In the film , Cobra stole the Broadcast Energy Transmitter , shepherded by G.I .
Joe to power space spores that could transform humans into animals !
No matter how ludicrous the themes and need for energy in these children ’s cartoon were it is still remarkable that one constant motivation for all protagonists , be they Decepticons Cobras , G.I .
Joe soldiers or Autobots was energy , and its proper allocation as an element of victory and domination against opponents .
As has been mentioned in the , featuring the first and second cartoon mini-series , the writers at the time were influenced by current world events and of course , the quest for energy was a major theme in their stories .
It ’s amazing how the writers of bothand thewere capable of inserting world themes so thoroughly and efficiently in the stories they presented to a younger audience .
I would argue that the theme of energy is mostly absent from the current crop of comic books that have come up since the revival of theand thein the 2000s .
While attempting to rejuvenate their stories for a new and aging audience , the creators ofand thein the comic book world largely ignore one constant motivation that made the properties relate on a political and societal level with its audience .
They ignore the involvement of world issues , such as an energy crisis that affect even the shape of toys G.I. Joe and the Transformers are based on .

Are we witnessing the death of the republic ?
Sound hysterical ?
Look at how Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson proposes to govern the $ 700 billion — some $ 2,000 for every man , woman and child in America — that he wants to bail out the banks .
He wants the power to buy “ Troubled Assets from any Financial Institution . . . on such terms and conditions as determined by the Secretary , ” and his decisions “ may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency , ” according to the text of the U.S. Treasury Department ’s legislative proposal .
In other words , give him the $ 700 billion to spend as he sees fit and shut up .
The occasion for this breathtaking insult to the Constitution is the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression .
Essentially , we are being held for ransom :
Give us the money on our terms or the banks will take down the global economy .
( Article continues below )
We know how we got here .
Decades of reckless economic policies and batty ideas — deregulation , disemboweling regulatory agencies , allowing a shadow banking system to develop without limits , market fundamentalists preaching nonsense about markets always being efficient and self - correcting — left Wall Street ’s speculators free to gamble on their own .
They borrowed heavily , invented complex new instruments , and pocketed millions along the way .
Much of it depended on housing prices going up .
Predatory lenders huckstered complicated loans to folks , with no stake in whether they had any chance to repay them .
When housing prices peaked out , banks found themselves with billions in toxic paper , and trillions in exposed credit swaps .
Now they want free use of $ 700 billion , which they say will get the crisis under control .
Treasury Secretary Paulson says Congress must act immediately .
Well , wait just one minute .
If it takes $ 700 billion to bail out Paulson ’s former colleagues on Wall Street , some basic questions have to be answered :
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Who pays ?
The rewards of the economic growth of the last decade went overwhelmingly to the wealthiest Americans .
Send the bill to those who had the party .
We need an excise tax on high incomes to pay for cleaning up the mess .
Who decides ?
We ca n’t allow the folks who helped create the mess be in charge of cleaning it up .
We need an independent entity , governed by a board with union and consumer representation and the power to make the rules for any bailout .
Who benefits ?
If taxpayers are bailing out banks , taxpayers should get partial ownership — so if the banks do return to profitability , we get some of our money back .
Who gets helped ?
We ca n’t just bail out Wall Street and ignore Main Street .
The bailout must be bottom up , not just top - down .
Any bailout must include provisions for renegotiating mortgages , freezing foreclosures and keeping people in their homes .
What gets the economy going ?
It ’s not enough to bail out the banks .
We need serious public investment in the real economy — in rebuilding schools and sewers , in green jobs and conservation that will put people back to work .
Who is independent ?
The oversight committees and the overseers must come off Wall Street ’s payroll .
Financial industry lobbyists should be banned from the beltway for the next year .
Legislators =2 0 should refuse Wall Street PAC and executive donations for at least the next two years .
Who is accountable ?
No executive of a firm that is bailed out should be paid more than the president of the United States .
Will the Congress act with the wisdom to put us back on track ?
Or will it squander even more money on Wall Street without making America better ?
We ’d better help Congress make the right choice .

Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga has urged the African Union to suspend Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe until he allows free and fair elections .
His appeal at an African Union summit in Egypt came as Zimbabwe 's opposition said the country faced a constitutional crisis after an " illegal " poll .
Mr Mugabe claimed victory as the sole candidate in the presidential re-run after the opposition leader withdrew .
Meanwhile , Italy recalled its envoy to Zimbabwe in protest at the situation .
The move followed a call by Italy 's foreign minister last week for European Union nations to begin withdrawing their ambassadors to Harare .
In a statement on Monday , the Italian foreign ministry said pulling out all EU ambassadors would signal the " firmness and disapproval that is shared by the international community " at the conduct of the run-off .
African observers said the election had been undermined by pre-poll violence .
' Dangerous precedent '
The situation in Zimbabwe overshadowed the African Union summit in Egypt .
I would expect them to have very , very strong words for [ Mr Mugabe ]
Jendayi Frazer
US Assistant Secretary of State for Africa
African leaders ' discomfort Zimbabwe : Possible scenarios Inside Mugabe 's mind Speaking to reporters in Nairobi , Mr Odinga said : " They should suspend him and send peace forces to Zimbabwe to ensure free and fair elections . "
Mr Odinga , a vocal critic of President Mugabe , says the AU would set a dangerous precedent by accepting him as " a duly elected president " .
The UN has urged African leaders to try to negotiate a solution to the Zimbabwe 's crisis .
Some analysts have pointed to Kenya as an example of how it could be resolved .
Mr Odinga was named prime minister as part of a power - sharing deal to end political violence in which some 1,500 people were killed , many in ethnic clashes .
No talks Zimbabwe 's opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) says the way forward must reflect the outcome of the first round of voting in March , when Mr Tsvangirai won more votes than Mr Mugabe .
ZIMBABWE AND ITS NEIGHBOURS
Zimbabwe 's opposition wants neighbouring countries to persuade Robert Mugabe to step down .
So how are relations changing ?
South Africa 's leader Thabo Mbeki remains the key mediator .
He has not criticised Mr Mugabe , despite pressure from the ruling ANC .
Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa called Zimbabwe a " regional embarrassment " , before suffering a stroke on 29 June .
Angola 's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos is one of Robert Mugabe 's closest allies .
He has urged Mr Mugabe to end the violence .
Botswana said Zimbabwe 's 27 June run -off vote was so flawed by violence that it could not be considered legitimate .
Namibia is an ally of Robert Mugabe .
It wants to re-distribute white - owned farms to black villagers .
It has not criticised the violence .
Mozambique has hosted some white farmers forced out of Zimbabwe when their land was seized .
It is seen as sympathetic to the opposition .
Tanzania 's ruling party has a history of backing Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party .
Its foreign minister has condemned the violence .
DR Congo's President Joseph Kabila is an ally of Robert Mugabe who sent troops to help his father , Laurent Kabila , fight rebels .
Malawi is seen as neutral .
But 3 m people from Malawi are in Zimbabwe and many were badly hit by the farm invasions .
BACK NEXT 1 of 9
The opposition is prepared to take part in a transitional arrangement or a government of national unity , but it says there are no negotiations currently under way between Mr Tsvangirai and the ruling Zanu - PF party .
The MDC is asking the AU to appoint three eminent African envoys to work full time on the crisis .
The US ambassador to the United Nations , Zalmay Khalilzad , says he is pressing for the Security Council to impose sanctions against Zimbabwe .
The US is expected to present a draft resolution on Wednesday calling for an arms embargo and a freeze on the assets of key individuals and companies .
Correspondents say it may be difficult to persuade South Africa , Russia , China and others to accept UN sanctions .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino has suggested the US may impose unilateral diplomatic and economic sanctions .
Few African leaders have spoken out about the election result while AU discussions continue .
The South African presidency said it would consider reports from election observers together with other members of the Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) before adopting a unified position regarding the result .
President Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania , the African Union chairman , pointedly congratulated the people of Zimbabwe over the election , but not Mr Mugabe himself .
Strong words Africa 's longest serving leader , Gabon President Omar Bongo , has given the strongest suggestion of recognising Mr Mugabe as president , saying " he was elected , he took an oath , and he is here with us , so he is president " .
US Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Jendayi Frazer said she expected African leaders to take a harder line with Mr Mugabe behind closed doors .
" I would suggest not to take the soft words of the opening plenary as a reflection of the deep concern of the leaders here for the situation in Zimbabwe , " she said .
" I would expect them to have very , very strong words for him . "
The BBC 's southern Africa correspondent Peter Biles says that apart from the recent political violence in Zimbabwe , there is continuing economic hardship , with inflation in the region of nine million per cent and the country heading for the worst harvest in 60 years .

World 's First Commercial Wave Energy Farm Goes Live
September 24th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Earlier this week , Portugal debuted the world ’s first commercial wave energy farm .
Wave energy at the Agucadoura station is converted into electricity with the use of three red “ sea - snakes ” , or cylindrical wave energy converters , that are attached to the seabed off Portugal ’s northern coast .
Energy captured by the sea - snakes is carried to an undersea cable station , where it is then fed into the electrical grid .
The devices will generate 2.25 MW of electricity — enough to power 1,500 homes .
Ultimately , the wave power station will expand to produce up to 21 MW of power .
Unfortunately , wave power is not price competitive in Portugal at the moment .
The €9 m project was only made possible by the country ’s feed - in tariff , which requires utilities to buy renewable energy from a wide range of producers .
However , proponents of the farm believe that wave energy could be cost - efficient within 15 years .
Agucadoura ’s farm is a only a small part of Portugal ’s renewable energy plans , which include both the world ’s largest wind farm and the world ’s largest solar farm .
The country hopes to generate 60 percent of its total energy from renewables by 2020 .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
( CNN ) -- CNN's Matthew Chance interviewed Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Thursday .
" We did not seek such conflicts , " Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin told CNN 's Matthew Chance .
Matthew Chance : Many people around the world , even though you 're not the president of Russia anymore , see you as the main decision maker in this country .
Was n't you that ordered Russian forces into Georgia and you who should take responsibility for the consequences ?
Vladimir Putin :
Of course , that 's not the case .
In accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation , the issues of foreign policy and defense are fully in the hands of the president .
The president of the Russian Federation was acting within his powers .
As is known , yours truly was at that time at the opening of the Olympic Games in Beijing .
This alone made it impossible for me to take part in preparing that decision , although of course , President Medvedev was aware of my opinion on that issue .
I 'll be frank with you , and actually there is no secret about it , we had of course considered all the possible scenarios of events , including direct aggression by the Georgian leadership .
We had to think beforehand about how to provide for the security of our peace - keepers and of the citizens of the Russian Federation who are residents of South Ossetia .
But , I repeat , such a decision could only be taken by the president of the Russian Federation , the commander in chief of the armed forces , Mr. Medvedev .
It 's his decision .
Matthew Chance :
But it 's been no secret either that for years you 've been urging the West to take more seriously Russia 's concerns about international issues .
For instance , about NATO 's expansion , about deployment of missile defense systems in eastern Europe .
Was n't this conflict a way of demonstrating that in this region , it 's Russia that 's the power , not NATO and certainly not the United States ?

Putin accuses U.S. of orchestrating Georgia war Analysis : NATO grapples with the angry bear
Analysis : NATO grapples with the angry bear Georgia agrees to plan to settle conflict
Vladimir Putin :
Of course not .
What is more , we did not seek such conflicts and do not want them in the future .
That this conflict has taken place -- that it broke out nevertheless -- is only due to the fact that no one had heeded our concerns .
More generally , Matthew , I will say this :
We must take a broader view of this conflict .
I think both you and your -- our -- viewers today will be interested to learn a little more about the history of relations between the peoples and ethnic groups in this regions of the world .
Because people know little or nothing about it .
If you think that this is unimportant , you may cut it from the program .
Do n't hesitate , I would n't mind .
But I would like to recall that all these state entities , each in its own time , voluntarily integrated into the Russian Empire .
Back in the mid-18th century , in 1745 - 1747 , Ossetia was the first to become part of the Russian Empire .
At that time , it was a united entity ; North and South Ossetia were one state .
In 1801 , if my memory serves me , Georgia itself , which was under some pressure from the Ottoman Empire , voluntarily became part of the Russian Empire .
It was only 12 years later , in 1812 , that Abkhazia became part of the Russian Empire .
Until that time , it had remained an independent state , an independent principality .
It was only in the mid-19th century that the decision was taken to incorporate South Ossetia into the Tiflis province .
Within a common state , the matter was regarded as not very important .
But I can assure you that subsequent years showed that the Ossetians did not much like it .
However , de facto they were put by the tsar 's central government under the jurisdiction of what is now Georgia .
When , after World War I , the Russian Empire broke up , Georgia declared its own state while Ossetia opted for staying within Russia ; this happened right after the events of 1917 .
In 1918 , as a result of this , Georgia conducted a rather brutal punitive operation there , and in 1921 , it repeated it .
When the Soviet Union was formed , these territories , by Stalin 's decision , were definitively given to Georgia .
As you know , Stalin was ethnically Georgian .
Therefore , those who insist that those territories must continue to belong to Georgia are Stalinists :
They defend the decision of Josef Vissarionovich Stalin .
Yet , whatever has been happening recently and whatever the motives of those involved in the conflict , there is no doubt that all that we are witnessing now is a tragedy .
For us , it is a special tragedy , because during the many years that we were living together the Georgian culture -- the Georgian people being a nation of ancient culture -- became , without a doubt , a part of the multinational culture of Russia .
There is even a tinge of civil war in this for us , though of course Georgia is an independent state , no doubt about it .
We have never infringed on the sovereignty of Georgia and have no intention of doing so in the future .
And yet , considering the fact that almost a million , even more than a million Georgians have moved here , we have special spiritual links with that country and its people .
For us , this is a special tragedy .
And , I assure you , while mourning the Russian soldiers who died , and above all the innocent civilians , many here in Russia are also mourning the Georgians who died .
The responsibility for the loss of life rests squarely with the present Georgian leadership , which dared to take these criminal actions .
I apologize for the long monologue ; I felt it would be of interest .
Matthew Chance :
It is very interesting that you are talking about Russia 's imperial history in this region because one of the effects of Russian intervention in Georgia is that other countries in the former Soviet Union are now deeply concerned that they could be next , that they could be part of a resurgent Russian empire ... particularly countries like Ukraine , that have a big ethnic Russian populations , but also Moldova , the central Asian states and even some of the Baltic states .
Can you guarantee to us that Russia will never again use its militarily forces against a neighboring state ?
Vladimir Putin : I strongly object to the way this question is formulated .
It is not for us to guarantee that we will not attack someone .
We have not attacked anyone .
It is we who are demanding guarantees from others , to make sure that no one attacks us anymore and that no one kills our citizens .
We are being portrayed as the aggressor .
I have here the chronology of the events that took place on August 7 , 8 and 9 .
On the 7th , at 2:42 p.m. , the Georgian officers who were at the headquarters of the joint peacekeeping forces left the headquarters , walked away from the headquarters -- where there were our servicemen , as well as Georgian and Ossetian servicemen -- saying that had been ordered to do so by their commanders .
They left their place of service and left our servicemen there alone and never returned during the period preceding the beginning of hostilities .
An hour later , heavy artillery shelling started .
At 10:35 p.m. , a massive shelling of the city of Tskhinvali began .
At 10:50 p.m. , ground force units of the Georgian armed forces started to deploy to the combat zone .
At the same time , Georgian military hospitals were deployed in the immediate vicinity .
And at 11:30 p.m. , Mr. Kruashvili , brigadier general and commander of the Georgian peacekeeping forces in the region , announced that Georgia had decided to declare war on South Ossetia .
They announced it directly and publicly , looking right into the TV cameras .
At that time , we tried to contact the Georgian leadership , but they all refused to respond .
At 0:45 a.m. on August 8 , Kruashvili repeated it once again .
At 5:20 a.m. , tank columns of the Georgian forces launched an attack on Tskhinvali , preceded by massive fire from GRAD systems , and we began to sustain casualties among our personnel .
At that time , as you know , I was in Beijing , and I was able to talk briefly with the president of the United States .
I said to him directly that we had not been able to contact the Georgian leadership but that one of the commanders of the Georgian armed forces had declared that they had started a war with South Ossetia .
George replied to me -- and I have already mentioned it publicly -- that no one wanted a war .
We were hoping that the U.S. administration would intervene in the conflict and stop the aggressive actions of the Georgian leadership .
Nothing of the kind happened .
What is more , already at 12 noon local time , the units of the Georgian armed forces seized the peacekeepers ' camp in the south of Tskhinvali -- it is called Yuzhni , or Southern -- and our soldiers had to withdraw to the city center , being outnumbered by the Georgians one to six .
Also , our peacekeepers did not have heavy weapons , and what weapons they had had been destroyed by the first artillery strikes .
One of those strikes had killed 10 people at once .
Then the attack was launched on the peacekeeping forces ' northern camp .
Here , let me read you the report of the General Staff : " As of 12:30 p.m. , the battalion of the Russian Federation peacekeeping forces deployed in the north of the city had beaten off five attacks and was continuing combat . "
At that same time , Georgian aviation bombed the city of Dzhava , which was outside the zone of hostilities , in the central part of South Ossetia .
So who was the attacker , and who was attacked ?
We have no intention of attacking anyone , and we have no intention of going to war with anyone .
During my eight years as president , I often heard the same question :
What place does Russia reserve for itself in the world ; how does it see itself ; what is its place ?
We are a peace - loving state and we want to cooperate with all of our neighbors and with all of our partners .
But if anyone thinks that they can come and kill us , that our place is at the cemetery , they should think what consequences such a policy will have for them .
Matthew Chance :
You 've always enjoyed over your period as president of Russia , and still now , a very close personal relationship with the U.S. President George W. Bush .
Do you think that his failure to restrain the Georgian forces on this occasion has damaged that relationship ?
Vladimir Putin :
This has certainly done damage to our relations , above all government - to - government relations .
But it is not just a matter of the U.S. administration being unable to restrain the Georgian leadership from this criminal action ; the U.S. side had in effect armed and trained the Georgian army .
Why spend many years in difficult negotiations to find comprehensive compromise solutions to inter-ethnic conflicts ?
It is easier to arm one of the parties and push it to kill the other and have it done with .
What an easy solution , apparently .
In fact , however , that is not always the case .
I have some other thoughts , too .
What I am going to say is hypothetical , just some suppositions , and will take time to properly sort out .
But I think there is food for thought here .
Even during the years of the Cold War , the intense confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States , we always avoided any direct clash between our civilians and , most certainly , between our military .
We have serious reasons to believe that there were U.S. citizens right in the combat zone .
If that is the case , if that is confirmed , it is very bad .
It is very dangerous ; it is misguided policy
But , if that is so , these events could also have a U.S. domestic politics dimension .
If my suppositions are confirmed , then there are grounds to suspect that some people in the United States created this conflict deliberately in order to aggravate the situation and create a competitive advantage for one of the candidates for the U.S. presidency .
And if that is the case , this is nothing but the use of the called administrative resource in domestic politics , in the worst possible way , one that leads to bloodshed .
Watch Putin describe possible U.S. role »
Matthew Chance :
These are quite astounding claims , but just to be clear , Mr. Prime Minister , are you suggesting that there were U.S. operatives on the ground assisting Georgian forces , perhaps even provoking a conflict in order to give a presidential candidate in the United States some kind of talking point ?
Vladimir Putin : Let me explain .
Matthew Chance :
And if you are suggesting that , what evidence do you have ?
Vladimir Putin : I have said to you that if the presence of U.S. citizens in the zone of hostilities is confirmed , it would mean only one thing : that they could be there only at the direct instruction of their leaders .
And if that is so , it means that in the combat zone there are U.S. citizens who are fulfilling their duties there .
They can only do that under orders from their superiors , not on their own initiative .
Ordinary specialists , even if they train military personnel , must do it in training centers or on training grounds rather than in a combat zone .
I repeat :
This requires further confirmation .
I am quoting to you the reports of our military .
Of course , I will seek further evidence from them .
Why are you surprised at my hypothesis , after all ?
There are problems in the Middle East ; reconciliation there is elusive .
In Afghanistan , things are not getting any better ; what is more , the Taliban have launched a fall offensive , and dozens of NATO servicemen are being killed .
In Iraq , after the euphoria of the first victories , there are problems everywhere , and the number of those killed has reached 4,000 .
There are problems in the economy , as we know only too well .
There are financial problems , the mortgage crisis .
Even we are concerned about it , and we want it to end soon , but it is there .
A little victorious war is needed .
And if it does n't work , then one can lay the blame on us , use us to create an enemy image , and against the backdrop of this kind of jingoism once again rally the country around certain political forces .
I am surprised that you are surprised at what I 'm saying .
It 's as clear as day .
Matthew Chance :
It sounds a little farfetched , but I am interested because I was in Georgia in the time of the conflict , and the country was swirling with rumors .
One of the rumors was that U.S. personnel had been captured in combat areas .
Is there any truth to that rumor ?
Vladimir Putin : I have no such information .
I think it is not correct .
I repeat : I will ask our military to provide additional information to confirm the presence of U.S. citizens in the conflict zone during the hostilities .
Matthew Chance : Let 's get back to the diplomatic fallout of this conflict , because one of the consequences is that action is being threatened at least against Russia by many countries in the world .
It could be kicked out of the G - 8 group of industrialized nations .
There are threats it could have its contacts with the NATO militarily alliance suspended .
What will Russia 's response be if the country is diplomatically isolated as a result of this tension between Russia and the West ?
Vladimir Putin : First of all , if my hypothesis about the U.S. domestic political dimension of this conflict is correct , then I do n't see why United States allies should support one U.S. political party against the other in the election campaign .
This is a position that is not honest vis -à - vis the American people as a whole .
But we do not rule out the possibility that , as happened before , the administration will once again be able to subordinate its allies to its will .
So what 's to be done ?
What choice do we have ?
On one hand , should we agree to being killed in order to remain , say , in the G - 8 ?
And who will remain in the G - 8 if all of us are killed ?
You have mentioned a possible threat from Russia .
You and I are sitting here now , having a quiet conversation in the city of Sochi .
Within a few hundred kilometers from here , U.S. Navy ships have approached , carrying missiles whose range is precisely several hundred kilometers .
It is not our ships that have approached your shores ; it 's your ships that have approached ours .
So what 's our choice ?
We do n't want any complications ; we do n't want to quarrel with anyone ; we do n't want to fight anyone .
We want normal cooperation and a respectful attitude toward us and our interests .
Is that too much ?
You have mentioned the G - 8 .
But in its present form , the G - 8 already does n't carry enough weight .
Without inviting the Chinese People 's Republic or India , without consulting them , without influencing their decisions , normal development of the world economy is impossible .
Or take the fight against drugs , combating infectious disease , fighting terrorism , working on non-proliferation .
OK , if someone wants to do it without any involvement of Russia , how effective will that work be ?
That 's not what we should be thinking about , and it 's pointless to try to intimidate anyone .
We are not afraid , not at all .
What 's needed is a realistic analysis of the situation , looking to the future so as to develop a normal relationship , with due regard for each other 's interests .
Matthew Chance :
The raw as you 've mentioned areas of cooperation still between the United States and Russia , particularly for instance over the issue of Iran 's very controversial nuclear program .
Are you suggesting that you may withdraw your cooperation with the United Nations in tackling that problem from the United States if the diplomatic pressure were to be ruptured up between Russian and the West ?
Vladimir Putin : Russia has been working very consistently and in good faith with its partners on all problems , those that I 've mentioned and those that you added .
We do so not because someone asks us and we want to look good to them .
We are doing it because this is consistent with our national interests , because in these areas , our national interests coincide with those of many European countries and of the United States .
If no one wants to talk to us about these problems and cooperation with Russia becomes unnecessary , God bless , do this work yourself .
Matthew Chance :
And what about the issue of energy supply , because obviously European countries in particular are increasingly dependent on Russian gas and on Russian oil .
Would Russia ever use the supply of energy to western Europe as a leaver to apply pressure should the diplomatic tensions be ratcheted up ?
Vladimir Putin :
We have never done it .
Construction of the first gas pipeline system was started during the 1960s , at the height of the Cold War , and for all those years , from the 1960s until this day , Russia has been fulfilling its contract obligations in a very consistent and reliable way , regardless of the political situation .
We never politicize economic relations , and we are quite astonished at the position of some U.S. administration officials who travel to European capitals trying to persuade the Europeans not to buy our products , natural gas for example , in a truly amazing effort to politicize the economic sphere .
In fact , it 's quite pernicious .
It 's true that the Europeans depend on our supplies but we too depend on whoever buys our gas .
That 's interdependence ; that 's precisely the guarantee of stability .
And since we are already talking about economic matters , I would like to inform you about a decision that will be taken in the near future .
Let me say right from the start that it is in no way related to any crisis , not to the situation in Abkhazia nor in South Ossetia ; those are purely economic matters .
Let me tell you what it 's about .
For some time , we have had a debate about supplies of various products from different countries , including the United States .
And of course the debate is particularly intense , as a rule , as regards agricultural products .
In July and August , our sanitation services conducted inspections of U.S. plants that supply poultry meat to our market .
It was a spot - check inspection .
It revealed that 19 of those plants ignored the concerns that our specialists had raised back in 2007 .
These plants will be removed from the list of poultry exporters to the Russian Federation .
Twenty - nine plants were given warnings that they must , in the near future , rectify the situation that our sanitation specialists find unacceptable .
We hope the response will be rapid and that they will be able to continue supplying their products to the Russian market .
That information has just been reported to me by the minister of Agriculture .
Let me say once again that I would hate these things to be lumped together : the problems caused by conflict situations , politics , economics , meat .
They all have their own dimension and are unrelated .
Matthew Chance : Prime Minister Putin , this appears or may be interpreted in the United States as tantamount to economic sanctions .
Specifically , one of these 19 agricultural enterprises been importing to Russia that you 've found to be flawed ?
Vladimir Putin : Well , I am not an agricultural expert .
This morning , the minister of agriculture gave me the following information .
I have already said it and want to repeat it .
In July and August of this year , spot checks were made at U.S. plants that supply poultry to the Russian market .
It was found that some of the concerns raised by our specialists earlier , in 2007 , had been ignored and that the plants had done nothing to correct the deficiencies identified during the previous inspections .
For that reason , the Ministry of Agriculture decided to remove them from the list of exporters .
At 29 other plants , certain problems have been found .
They have been properly documented , with instructions as to what needs to be changed in order for the previous agreements on deliveries from those plants to Russia to remain in effect .
We hope that they will quickly rectify the problems identified during those checks .
It has been found that their products contain excessive amounts of some substances that are subject to certain controls in our country .
They contain excessive amounts of antibiotics and perhaps some other substances such as arsenic .
I do n't know ; it 's for the agricultural experts to consider .
This has noting to do with politics .
These are not some kind of sanctions .
Such measures were taken here on several occasions in the past .
There is nothing catastrophic here .
It just means that we should work on this together .
What 's more , when the minister called me , he said , " Frankly , we do n't know what to do .
It 'll look like sanctions , but we need to take a decision .
Of course , we could take a pause , too . "
I think they said it 's arsenic .
But we have our rules .
If you want to export to our market , you must adjust to our rules .
They know all about it .
They were told about it back in 2007 .
Matthew Chance : The U.S. wo n't like it .
Vladimir Putin :
We too do not like some of the things being done .
They need to work closer together with our Ministry of Agriculture .
Such things have happened before .
We closed it , and then we allowed them in again .
It happened not only with regard to U.S. suppliers but Brazilian , too .
Matthew Chance : To conclude --
Vladimir Putin :
We could go on .
I am in no hurry .
Matthew Chance : Prime Minister Putin , perhaps more than anyone else , you 're credited with restoring a degree of international prestige to this country .
After the collapse of the Soviet Union , after the chaos of 1990s , are you concerned that you 're squandering that international prestige by your actions over Georgia , by actions like these banning of bird meat imports from the United States ?
Is that something the concerns you ?
Vladimir Putin :
Well , I have told you that there is no ban on U.S. poultry .
It 's a ban on some plants that did not respond to our concerns for a whole year .
We have to protect our domestic market and our consumers , as is done by all countries , including the United States .
As for Russia 's prestige :
We do n't like what 's been happening , but we did not provoke this situation .
Speaking of prestige , some countries ' prestige has been severely damaged in recent years .
In effect , in recent years our U.S. partners have been cultivating the rule of force instead of the rule of international law .
When we tried to stop the decision on Kosovo ; no one listened to us .
We said , do n't do it , wait ; you are putting us in a terrible position in the Caucasus .
What shall we say to the small nations of the Caucasus as to why independence can be gained in Kosovo but not here ?
You are putting us in a ridiculous position .
At that time , no one was talking about international law ; we alone did .
Now , they have all remembered it .
Now , for some reason , everyone is talking about international law .
But who opened Pandora 's box ?
Did we do it ?
No , we did n't do it .
It was not our decision , and it was not our policy .
There are both things in international law : the principle of territorial integrity and right to self - determination .
What 's needed is simply to reach agreement on the ground rules .
I would think that the time has finally come to do it .
As for the public perception of the events that are taking place , of course this in large part depends not only on the politicians but also on how cleverly they manipulate the media , on how they influence world public opinion .
Our U.S. colleagues are of course much better at it than we are .
We have much to learn .
But is it always done in a proper , democratic way , is the information always fair and objective ?
Let 's recall , for example , the interview with that 12 - year - old girl and her aunt , who , as I understand , live in the United States and who witnessed the events in South Ossetia .
The interviewer at one of the leading channels , Fox News , was interrupting her all the time .
All the time , he interrupted her .
As soon as he did n't like what she was saying , he started to interrupt her , he coughed , wheezed and screeched .
All that remained for him to do was to soil his pants , in such a graphic way as to stop them .
That 's the only thing he did n't do , but , figuratively speaking , he was in that kind of state .
Well , is that an honest and objective way to give information ?
Is that the way to inform the people of your own country ?
No , that is disinformation .
We want to live in peace and agreement ; we want normal trade ; we want to work in all areas : to assure international security , to work on problems of disarmament , on fighting terrorism and drugs , on the Iranian nuclear problem , on the North Korean problem which is now showing a somewhat alarming tendency .
We are ready for all that , but we want this work to be honest , open and done in partnership , rather than selfishly .
It is wrong to make anyone into an enemy ; it is wrong to scare the people of one 's own country with that enemy and try to rally some allies on that basis .
What we need is to work openly and honestly on solutions to the problem .
We want that and we are ready for that .
Matthew Chance : Let 's go back to the assertion that the U.S. provoked the war .
Diplomats in the United States accuse Russia of provoking the war by supporting the separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia by arming them , by increasing forces in the territories and by recognizing their institutions ... basically giving them the green light to go ahead and operate de facto .
Was n't it Russia that really caused this conflict ?
Vladimir Putin : I can easily reply to this question .
Since the 1990s , as soon as this conflict started , and it started in recent history because of the decision of the Georgian side to deprive Abkhazia and South Ossetia of the rights of autonomy .
In 1990 and 1991 , the Georgian leadership deprived Abkhazia and South Ossetia of the autonomous rights that they enjoyed as part of the Soviet Union , as part of Soviet Georgia , and as soon as that decision was taken , ethnic strife and armed hostilities began .
At that time , Russia signed a number of international agreements , and we complied with all those agreements .
We had in the territory of Abkhazia and South Ossetia only those peacekeeping forces that were stipulated in those agreements and never exceeded the quota .
The other side -- I am referring to the Georgian side -- with the support of the United States , violated all the agreements in the most brazen way .
Under the guise of units of the Ministry of the Interior , they secretly moved into the conflict zone their troops , regular army , special units and heavy equipment .
In fact , they surrounded Tskhinvali , the capital of South Ossetia , with that heavy equipment and tanks .
They surrounded our peacekeepers with tanks and started shooting at them point blank .
It was only after that , after our first casualties and after their number considerably increased , after tens of them had been killed -- I think 15 or 20 peacekeepers were killed , and there was heavy loss of life among the civilian population , with hundreds killed -- it was only after all that that President Medvedev decided to introduce a military contingent to save the lives of our peacekeepers and innocent civilians .
What is more , when our troops began moving in the direction of Tskhinvali , they came across a fortified area that had been secretly prepared by the Georgian military .
In effect , tanks and heavy artillery had been dug into ground there , and they started shelling our soldiers as they moved .
All of it was done in violation of previous international agreements .
It is of course conceivable that our U.S. partners were unaware of all that , but it 's very unlikely .
A totally neutral person , the former Georgian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ms. Zurabishvili , who is I think a French citizen and is now in Paris , has said publicly , and it was broadcast , that there was an enormous number of U.S. advisers and that of course they knew everything .
And if our supposition that there were U.S. citizens in the combat zone is confirmed -- and I repeat , we need further information from our military -- then these suspicions are quite justified .
Those who pursue such a policy toward Russia , what do they think ?
Will they like us only when we die ?
Matthew Chance : Thank you .
Vladimir Putin :
Thank you very much .
All About Vladimir Putin • Russia • Republic of Georgia
I was pretty sure there were other people in the military , but apparently not .
They must not have any TVs in any of those seven houses .
What a frickin ' jerky thing to say .
You could just go with hocking a loogie on military familes next time , Meg .
Much has been written and said ( and a lot more to come ) about the incredible Olympic performance of Michael Phelps .
And there ’s no question in our minds that he deserves every one of the accolades and then some .
Well , he did it .
8 gold medals in 8 races for Michael Phelps .
A truly amazing accomplishment .
And the beautiful thing is that all of us benefit from his performance .
Every time Michael stood up on that gold medal platform , he reminded us that anything is possible .
Why ?
Because he ’s an outstanding example of someone who has followed the Universal Laws that always bring success .
And you can find the clear evidence of that in some of the media coverage of
Phelps .
In an article about Phelps and his coach , Bob Bowman , NBC Sports reported , “ Bowman , who is something of a student of success literature , said a recurring theme of his coaching and direction is that successful people … make a habit of doing things other people are n’t willing to do .
And that ’s our game here . ”
“ The difference between successful people and failures is that successful people make a habit of doing the things that failures do not like to do . ”
And that ’s just one pretty obvious reason for Michael ’s success , but there are others … Contrary to what NBC might have you believe , the purpose of these games is not to have you sitting around spending more time on your butt in front of the TV !
The purpose is to get you inspired to go out and reach for YOUR dreams !
Like the Universal Law of Cause and Effect , “ the greatest principle in the history of mankind . ”
Read
“ The Law of Cause and Effect says that everything happens for a reason .
For every effect in your life , there is a cause , or series of specific , measurable , definable , identifiable causes .
This law says that if there is anything you want in life , an effect that you desire , you can find someone else that has achieved the same result or effect , and that by doing the same things that they have done over and over you can eventually enjoy the same results and rewards .
“ Success , however you define it , is not an accident .
It is not a result of good luck versus bad luck .
Even if you have not taken the time to clearly identify how you got from where you were to where you are today , there have been a series of specific steps that you have taken that have brought you to where you are at this minute .
And the fact is , they could have brought you to no other place .
You are where you are , and what you are because of yourself .
It has been your choices and your decisions over the months and years that have inevitably determined the condition of your life at this moment .
“ The most wonderful part of this is that at any time you can start making different choices and different decisions , taking different steps and you will inevitably arrive at a different place than where you are today .
“ The greatest thinkers of all time , going back to the earliest recorded writings of the earliest religions , the earliest philosophers and metaphysical schools have all emphasized the power of the human mind to shape individual destinies .
“ The key to your enjoying more of what people call luck is for you to engage in more of the actions that are more likely to bring about the consequences that you desire .
At the same time , you must conscientiously decide to avoid those actions that will not bring about the consequences that you desire , or even worse , will bring about consequences that you do n’t want .
“ The laws of cause and effect , action and reaction , sowing and reaping , are timeless truths , universal principles that have existed since the beginning of man on this earth .
All success , happiness and high achievement comes from organizing your life in conformance with these timeless principles .
When you do , you will achieve satisfaction and enjoyment at levels seldom experienced by the average person and of course , people will start to refer to you as lucky . ”

Gold and silver prices have crashed .
Ted Butler , Rob Kirby , James Conrad and others are all blaming manipulation .
Let 's take a look at those manipulation theories starting with Ted Butler .
Lessons of a Lifetime
Here are a few excerpts from Ted Butler 's Lessons of a Lifetime .
The drastic sell - off in silver ( and gold ) is further proof of an ongoing manipulation to the downside .
proof
proof
The proof that this sell - off was criminal lies in public data provided in the Commitment of Traders Report ( COT ) and a basic understanding of how the futures market works .
This has been the most extreme sell - off in the recent history of silver and gold .
We are farther below the moving averages than at any point since I have been writing about silver .
Price movements this severe are likely to be intentional and not accidental .
Every criminal act must have a motive and an opportunity to commit the crime .
By the simple process of elimination , those responsible for this crime are the concentrated commercial shorts on the COMEX .
No one else fits the profile .
They had the means ( through their dominant and monopolistic position ) , the profit motive and the skill to cause the sell - off .
How is it possible that the commercials could buy back short positions on thousands of contracts at times of steep sell - offs , without triggering a rise in price ?
There is only one possible and plausible explanation - through discipline and collusion .
The Smoking Gun
For years , the data contained in the weekly Commitment of Traders Report ( COT ) , issued by the CFTC , have indicated that several large COMEX traders have manipulated the price of silver and gold .
The recent widespread shortage of silver for retail purchase coupled with a price collapse appears to have shaken these analysts ’ confidence that the COMEX silver market is operating ‘ fair and square . ’
Well it should , since there is no rational explanation for a significant price decline going hand in hand with product shortages other than collusive manipulation .
In summary , there is no need to concoct manipulation theories in order to explain the dollar 's rebound .
A more plausible explanation for the currency market turnaround is that the recent intermediate - term trend reversals in the commodity markets removed the pressure that had previously been preventing the US dollar from moving back towards fair valuation .
We think the dollar 's move back towards fair valuation is still in its infancy , but the market looks over - extended in the very short - term so some consolidation is likely over the coming 1 - 3 weeks .
Shortage Of Silver Eagles
Gold and silver have seen a small bounce off the extreme oversold condition .
Remember I stated several times in my last few reports that I did not believe a bottom in the metals would be made until a capitulation move lower was seen .
I have been stating that Gold and Silver will still be strong in the month of September and into year end - the only question has been " Where will the bottom be made ? "
The sharp correction was a typical long liquidation break that seems to always go much deeper than most expect as longs are squeezed out of the market .
Retail Demand A Contrary Indicator ?
Facts speak for themselves .
Here are the facts .
As of July 1 , 2008 , two U.S. banks were short 6,199 contracts of COMEX silver ( 30,995,000 ounces ) .
As of August 5 , 2008 , two U.S. banks were short 33,805 contracts of COMEX silver ( 169,025,000 ounces ) , an increase of more than five - fold .
This is the largest such position by U.S. banks I can find in the data , ever .
Between July 14 and August 15th , the price of COMEX silver declined from a peak high of $ 19.55 ( basis September ) to a low of $ 12.22 for a decline of 38 % .
For gold , 3 U.S. banks held a short position of 7,787 contracts ( 778,700 ounces ) in July , and 3 U.S. banks held a short position of 86,398 contracts ( 8,639,800 ounces ) in August , an eleven - fold increase and coinciding with a gold price decline of more than $ 150 per ounce .
As was the case with silver , this is the largest short position ever by US banks in the data listed on the CFTC ’s site .
This was put on as one massive position just before the market collapsed in price .
This data suggests other questions should be answered by banking regulators , the CFTC , or by those analysts who still doubt this market is rigged .
Is there a connection between 2 U.S. banks selling an additional 27,606 silver futures contracts ( 138 million ounces ) in a month , followed shortly thereafter by a severe decline in the price of silver ?
That ’s equal to 20 % of annual world mine production or the entire COMEX warehouse stockpile , the second largest inventory in the world .
How could the concentrated sale of such quantities in such a short time not influence the price ?
What real legitimate business do 2 or 3 U.S. banks suddenly have for selling short such quantities of speculative instruments over a brief time period ?
Do we want banks to be engaging in this type of activity ?
If the manipulation was not successful , would U.S. taxpayers be called on to bail out yet another bank speculation gone bad ?
The data in the Bank Participation report is so clear and compelling that it is hard to conclude anything but manipulation .
It is beyond credulity to conclude other than two or three banks caused one of the most severe price collapses in precious metals history .
The CFTC has a lot to answer for as the regulatory agency responsible for preventing this type of blatant manipulation .
Wake - Up Call
Disconnect Between Supply And Demand
There is a huge demand for both gold and silver right now in India and North America .
North American shops are completely bare of silver .
Indian shops are empty of both silver and gold .
Even the Indian banks do n't have any gold or silver .
The big western bullion banks , based in New York and London , control both the gold and silver trade .
Reports from India are that they are refusing to extend Indian bank lines of credit , forcing the small banks to deliver to clients , collect money , and pay down lines of credit , before being allowed to take delivery of another gold or silver shipment .
This is very abnormal .
Normally , if a banker ’s bank knows that its customer - bank has firm orders , it would extend the smaller bank a bigger line of credit .
Not now .
By refusing to extend lines of credit , the big bullion banks are essentially rationing a very thin supply .
Lease Rates
As of a week ago , if you are a dealer , and you lease gold or silver , from the bullion banks , incredibly enough , THEY WILL PAY YOU !
At the end of this article , I have attached a chart , showing the current negative lease rates for the various metals .
Price Action vs. Physical Accumulation
The ETFs have shown no dishoarding for the huge falls in the metals which stands out like a sore thumb .
Report on Large Short Trader Activity in the Silver Futures Market
During the past 20 to 25 years , the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC or Commission ) has received numerous letters , e-mails and phone calls from silver investors alleging that the price of silver futures on NYMEX has been manipulated downward .
In 2004 , Dr. Michael Gorham , Director of the Division of Market Oversight ( Division ) addressed silver investors ’ concerns in an open letter ( 2004 Silver Letter ) that considered the plausibility of a long - term short - side manipulation of the silver futures market and provided an analysis of activity in the silver futures market .
That letter concluded that the existence of a long - term manipulation was not plausible and that an analysis of activity in the silver futures market did not support the conclusion that the market was being manipulated .
Recently , silver commentators and a group of investors that rely upon them have reasserted their allegations that the silver futures market is being manipulated downward by a small group of traders on the short side of the market .
As a result , DMO staff decided to revisit this issue by taking a fresh look at activity in the silver futures market .
The analysis draws the following conclusions :
There is no evidence of manipulation in the silver futures market .
• Silver cash and futures prices have risen dramatically between 2005 and 2007 , with silver outperforming the gold , platinum and palladium markets , suggesting that silver futures prices are not depressed relative to other metals prices .
• NYMEX silver futures prices tend to track closely the price of physical silver .
• Concentration levels for the top four short futures traders in the silver futures market are comparable to those observed in the gold and copper futures markets , and generally are lower than the levels seen in the platinum and palladium futures markets .
The composition of the traders comprising the top four short futures traders , in terms of net positions , changes over time .
These traders represent a diverse group , and their futures positions are driven by an even more diverse group of customers .
• There is no observable relationship between short - futures - trader concentration levels and silver prices .
• There is a slightly positive relationship between the total net position of the large short futures traders and silver prices ; this suggests that larger short futures positions are associated with higher , not lower prices .
Advocates of the short - side manipulation argument contend that silver futures prices have been manipulated downward for close to 25 years .
What these advocates fail to indicate , however , is where prices should be , except to argue that prices should be higher than they have been currently or in the recent past .
With respect to the claims of silver commentators that prices are being suppressed , it should be noted that these commentators have never articulated a credible explanation as to why , for more than 25 years , buyers have not entered the market to purchase silver ( at the supposedly depressed prices ) , thereby driving up prices to a level that these commentators believe is reasonable .
In this regard , no barrier to entry has been identified that would prevent individuals or firms from buying cash silver or entering into long silver futures positions .
Given the similarities between price movements in these four metals , it appears that general market forces that have contributed to an increase in gold , platinum and palladium prices have also supported an increase in the price of silver .
Moreover , the fact that the price of silver outperformed the prices of the other metals during the period , while not definitively answering the question of whether silver prices have been manipulated , calls into question the contention that silver futures prices have been manipulated downward .
In short , there is nothing obvious in the silver price series between 2005 and 2007 , when compared to other metals ’ prices , to suggest that silver prices have been manipulated downward .

Trader Concentration
An area that has drawn significant attention from silver commentators is the level of concentration among short traders in the silver futures market , as reported in the CFTC ’s weekly Commitments of Traders ( COT ) reports .
Silver commentators have argued that the four - trader net short position reported in the COT reports is unusually high and imply that it is indicative of an effort by a specific group of four or fewer traders to maintain low prices indefinitely .
The commentators also imply that the futures positions held by these traders are “ naked ” in that they are not legitimate hedge positions or otherwise entered into to offset positions in the physical silver market .
To evaluate this claim , staff examined the specific traders comprising the top four shorts and their overall futures positions , their motives for holding these positions , how the levels of concentration in the silver futures market compare to those in similar futures markets ( i.e. , gold , platinum , palladium , and copper ) , and the relationship between open interest concentration and the level of open interest held by these futures traders to changes in silver futures prices .
The analysis of open interest , collected daily from June 6 , 2005 through January 16 , 2008 — a total of 659 days in the sample — indicates that the composition of market participants among the top four net traders is not static , though certain traders do appear in the top four significantly more often than others .
For the period as a whole , there were a total of 10 different traders who at some point were counted among the top four in terms of their net short futures position .
Of those 10 , three were present in the top four more than 50 percent of the time .
The trader most often in the top four was usually ranked number two in terms of net position size among traders , when present .
The trader present second most often was typically ranked fourth among the top four traders , and was never ranked first .
Finally , the trader showing up third most often was usually the number one ranked trader , holding that position on 356 days of the 475 days in which they were present in the top four .
Thus , the Commission ’s large trader data shows that , as opposed to the allegation that four traders dominate the market by consistently holding a large concentrated short position , the top four traders at any point in time may involve any of 10 different market participants .
Notably , these large traders are not always net short ; of these 10 traders , four at times were among the top four net long silver futures traders .
These data show that any scheme to manipulate the silver futures market would require involvement of up to 10 traders as opposed to the four that silver commentators suggest .
This renders the allegation more implausible , as such a large diverse group would increase the difficulty and complexity of effecting concerted actions while ensuring discipline within the group .
In addition , the top 10 traders are not monolithic and represent a wide diversity of business interests with diverse customer bases .
In this regard , staff interviewed five of the largest traders that are included among the group of 10 .
Based on these interviews and from the Commission ’s records , the staff has determined that the entities in this group are involved in the silver markets as dealer / merchants , index traders , swaps / derivatives dealers , money managers , banks and silver depositories .
Two of the five traders interviewed indicated the futures positions they entered into were to offset activity that they engaged in with customers situated in the physical silver markets .
This activity included buying silver from producers and selling silver to consumers in various manufacturing industries .
Few of the futures positions of these two traders represented proprietary trading of the firms .
The remaining three traders were less active in the physical markets , but , nonetheless , they primarily established futures positions to offset other obligations , such as over - the - counter swap trades and other financially settled contracts , that they had entered into with their customers .
For each firm interviewed , their futures trading activities are driven primarily by the desires and needs of the firms ’ customers to either buy or sell silver or to assume or hedge financial exposure to silver prices .
The understanding that the largest net short silver futures traders have an overall neutral position in the silver market is confirmed by information collected by NYMEX relating to several of these large traders .
In August 2007 , NYMEX contacted several of the largest short silver futures traders requesting specific information regarding their activity in the silver cash and OTC markets .
The exchange found that these firms generally held significant forward purchase and sales agreements that , overall , left the firms with a net long silver exposure .
The short futures positions on NYMEX were approximately offset by their long cash exposure .
This means that , contrary to the silver commentators ’ allegations , the largest net short traders in the NYMEX silver futures markets are not “ naked ” shorts , as the firms ’ overall exposure in the silver markets ( considering their futures , cash and OTC positions ) is approximately neutral .
Trotsky Weighs In
You could add that it not unusual for a commodity market to experience a 23 % correction in a short time .
It happens all the time !
In fact , during the 1970 's bull market in the metals it happened several times as well .
Were today 's ' manipulators ' at it back then too ?
The ' physical silver and gold shortage ' as you 've correctly explained is an illusion .
Only certain forms of retail product were in a shortage , and it is NOT bullish when the retail public clamors to buy the dip .
Also , I would emphasize the CFTC 's explanation - one that has been confirmed by the former CEO of PAAS , who took on Butler 's claims as well - that the large commercial shorts do in fact have offsetting positions in both physical and OTC derivatives markets , where they act as middlemen for a much larger group of customers .
Therefore , the apparent ' concentration ' comes from the fact that these traders ( the 10 biggest ) tend to aggregate offsetting customer positions and hedge them in the silver futures market .
The fact remains , Butler and others have ZERO proof because if they had proof , they would present it .
Furthermore , one would expect by now a whistleblower would talk , or some documents , or something to emerge .
Instead the manipulation crowd continually infers things from watching the COT report , and their conclusions are simply wrong .
As the CFTC correctly states , to successfully co-ordinate an ongoing manipulation between 10 large traders over so many years ( Butler has been writing about this for 20 years already ) seems nigh impossible .
Their interests would diverge too often for one thing , and cartels have proved to be ineffective in both practice and well - established economic theory ( see OPEC , which can not determine the price of oil in spite of controlling 40 % of output ) .
So far NO - ONE has reported that they have suffered large losses from silver 's 400 % rally .
That in and of itself is indirect confirmation that the commercial shorts have offsetting positions .
And lastly , the mere fact that silver has rallied by 400 % at all shows that there is no outside force controlling this market in a downward direction with the slightest success .
Addendum # 1
Addendum # 2
What is seen and what is not seen
Those who hold that there is market manipulation are victims of an optical illusion .
What appears as an oversize naked short position involving no more than eight trading houses or bullion banks , is just the visible side of basis trading in silver .
...
The high concentration of short positions is due to the fact that governments and wealthy individuals wanting to earn a return on their silver holdings prefer to take their business to a select few trading houses and bullion banks with the necessary expertise and capital to trade the silver basis on a large scale .

Silver Hoard In China ?
Analysts keep talking about supply / demand factors , instead of concentrating on the falling basis and looking for other signs of the coming backwardation in the gold and silver markets .
They should also answer the question : Whatever happened to the Chinese silver , remnants of China ’s defunct silver standard ?
Whatever Happened to the Chinese Silver ?
The most populous country , China has one of the oldest civilizations on earth .
It had been on a silver standard since time immemorial before the Communists overran the mainland .
Nobody knows how much silver was involved in running China ’s monetary system , but the amount must be mind - boggling .
In addition , China was forced to absorb enormous amounts of silver ( both through legal channels and through smuggling ) after silver was demonetized by the rest of the world and the price of silver collapsed .
We do know that this addition to the Chinese money supply created an inflation horrible enough to cause the fall of the Kuo- min - tang regime and the ascension of the Communists to power in 1949 .
We do not know what proportion of the monetary silver the Communist government left in the hands of the people while confiscating the silver in the banks with characteristic ruthlessness .
Finally , we do not know whether or not China was buying silver clandestinely during the twenty - year period between 1980 and 2000 when the price was falling .
Be that as it may , the silver left over from the silver - standard days , plus the silver subsequently flowing into China , is largely unaccounted for .
The question is : where is this Chinese silver ?
It appears that China does hold the silver wild card , and has n’t played it yet .
We cannot lithely assume that China will play it stupidly .
The possibility exists that China will play it intelligently .
For all we know , China may already be active , if only clandestinely , in the silver market and has been deriving handsome profits from it .
The alleged naked short positions in silver may in fact be genuine hedges for Chinese - owned silver .
In other words , China may have decided upon a strategy to derive a steady income from her silver treasure , at least for as long as prices remain low , in preference to the alternative strategy of driving up the price of silver and then cashing in .
I have n’t examined the evidence and I am not suggesting that this is the case .
All I am saying is that there is another possibility that could explain the anomalous market behavior for silver .
One reason why I find the theory of inordinate and growing naked speculative short positions unattractive is because it assumes that the insiders are either stupid or suicidal or both .
It is dangerous to underestimate one ’s opponents .
As in his appearance on the View , Bill Clinton offered the most tepid support possible for Barack Obama 's presidential ticket on David Letterman 's Late Show last night .
After repeatedly invoking his vanquished wife Hillary , Clinton said the typical American voter will recall John McCain 's heroic torture in a Vietnamese prison camp before deciding to " go the other way " and vote for ... whoever that other candidate for president might be .
In an inspired feat of booking , Letterman had comedian Chris Rock lined up to follow Clinton and , uh , remind him who won the primary .

Angry John McCain showed up at the debate last night .
It did n’t sit well with undecided voters :
McCain was seen as the more negative of the two — by 7 points before the debate and by 26 points after .
The audience did not like it when he went after Obama for being “ naïve ” or used his oft - repeated “ what Senator Obama does n’t understand ” line .
When the two clashed directly in the second half of the debate , with Obama repeatedly protesting McCain ’s characterization of his statements or positions , the voter dials went down .
Voters appear to have judged McCain too negative in those encounters and Obama more favorably .
Jed put Angry John McCain on video :

The air strike was called " after multiple warnings " , the US says
The US military says seven people , including three women civilians , have been killed in an air strike in Iraq .
The US said it was targeting insurgents in the village of al - Dawr , near Tikrit north of Baghdad , where Saddam Hussein was captured in 2003 .
Witnesses are quoted as saying the attack happened after US troops had surrounded a compound in the village .
The village is home of a former leader of the Baath party , Izzat Ibrahim al - Douri , who is still a fugitive .
A military statement said those killed included four suspected insurgents and three women .
A child was pulled from the rubble of the building and was treated at a nearby US base .
It said the target was a man believed to be the leader of a bombing network in the area north of Baghdad .
Reports quote Iraqi officials and neighbours saying that the family whose members were killed in the air strike had no connection to the insurgency .
The US said its forces surrounded the compound and called for its occupants to surrender after the main suspect , who was armed , had shown " hostile intent " at a doorway and been shot dead by troops .
However , nobody emerged from the building for about one hour " despite multiple warnings " the statement said , and the troops called in the air strike .
" Sadly , this incident again shows that the terrorists repeatedly risk the lives of innocent women and children to further their evil work , " said US military spokesman Colonel Jerry O'Hara .

What are these ?
Critics of Sarah Palin have accused the John McCain campaign of keeping his running mate in a “ cone of silence ” for not having her hit the Sunday - morning talk shows immediately after the convention .
The McCain campaign played coy , only stating that McCain and Palin would conduct interviews at the times and conditions of their choice .
That set off howls of outrage , claiming it to be a verification that Palin could n’t handle media scrutiny .
It seems that Team McCain may have been sandbagging :
But it turns out that she is spending much of Thursday and Friday with Gibson — at the ceremony in Fairbanks , Alaska , and at her home in Wasilla , Alaska .
Campaign aides said the anchorman will get extensive , repeated access to Palin throughout her first trip home since becoming the nominee .
“ ABC News will have plenty of time to question her and examine her and spend time with her , ” a campaign official said .
“ They ’ll do multiple interviews over two days .
No topics are off - limits – there are no ground rules .
There ’s tons of time to talk to her about every topic . ”
The remarkable rollout reflects new confidence in Palin by her handlers , who initially had suggested it would be a while before she did interviews .
Now , there will be several .
Sandbagging is a term used in bowling ( and golf , I believe ) where a participant deliberately underperforms at first to get a better handicap for the rest of the season .
This seems applicable to the McCain approach to Palin , a strategy practically handed to them by the media and Democrats .
They spent so much time and effort throwing mud at Palin in the first few days that they drastically lowered expectations for her acceptance speech — and she dazzled America with it .
The campaign did the same thing with press scrutiny in the general election .
They waited for a few days , and then they arranged to put Palin in one of the most difficult positions for any candidate — two days in an uncontrolled environment with a network news agency .
They get two days in the life of Sarah Palin to do with as they will .
That does n’t sound like Team McCain has a confidence problem with their new running mate .
It sounds like they think she ’ll hit home runs , even in a difficult environment .
If McCain and his team worried about Palin , they would have cocooned her in 15 - minute interview slots in little conference rooms , with handlers at her side .
Instead , they ’ve allowed ABC and Charles Gibson unfettered access over two days , with no limitations on topics or venues .
Why ABC , and why such intimate access ?
The Republicans want to expand Palin ’s appeal beyond the conservative base that has been energized with her selection .
They think her intelligence , wit , and energy can attract voters in the center as well as with women who may still be skeptical of Palin .
ABC has provided the most balanced coverage of the alphabet networks this cycle , and they can hope that Gibson wo n’t come in with an Olbermann - like agenda .
( Brokaw would n’t have been a bad choice , but there was no way Team McCain was going to give NBC any scoops while they still employ Keith Olbermann . )
It guarantees a wide dissemination of whatever results from the interview , and gives Palin a chance to make a pitch to a much wider swath of the electorate .
That does n’t sound like a campaign afraid of its running mate .
It sounds like a campaign that has a champion , and wants to force the media to lower expectations once again to gain maximum impact .
MOSCOW , Aug 14 ( Reuters ) -
The outbreak of war between Georgia and Russia shocked most of the world last week , but an investment bank analyst predicted it two days in advance .
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili sent troops into the breakaway , pro-Russian region of South Ossetia on Aug. 7 , on the eve of the Beijing Olympic Games , and Russia responded with overwhelming military force .
Geoff Smith , a Kiev - based analyst for Renaissance Capital investment bank , had anticipated the Georgian move with uncanny prescience in an e-mail two days earlier to a fellow strategist .
" So whaddaya think ?
I say Saakashvili is going to ' restore the territorial integrity of Georgia ' five minutes before the opening ceremony starts in Beijing and dare the Russians to invade while the games are on ? " the note said .
Reuters has seen a copy of the e-mail and confirmed its validity with both the sender and recipient of the message .
The Kremlin swiftly asserted its vastly superior military might and thousands of Russian troops pushed out Georgian troops from the rebel region .
Russian units are still operating inside Georgia proper .
Russian sovereign Eurobond spreads , a measure of investment risk , widened on the hostilities , and shares tumbled .
" It was just intuition , " Smith said by telephone .
" I said nothing about the possible Russian response , but if you had asked me I would say that Moscow could not have taken it lying down , " Smith said .
Explaining his reasoning , the former journalist said the upcoming presidential election in the United States could have played a role in Saakashvili 's decision to send troops into South Ossetia .
" Certainly the next White House will not be as supportive of Saakashvili as this one and so if Saakashvili wanted to reunite Georgia he really had to do it this year and he was probably hoping the Olympic Games gave him the right cover , " he said .
He refused to forecast how the crisis would end .
DEMISE OF AMERICA
By Frosty Wooldridge
September 29 , 2008
NewsWithViews.com
Can you hear the clock ticking on the demise of America ?
Yes , Congress expects to pass a package bailout deal to save all those bankers , realtors and lenders from their dirty deals for the past 15 years .
They might as well tighten a tourniquet around America ’s arm while her legs fall off .
A reader said , “ I admire your efforts , and I admire your passion .
I hate to say it , but I think the cause is lost .
I do n't say it because I think the causes you push are unjust .
Far from it .
I say it because the globalists have done their work very well .
“ Americans have been ‘ enstupidated ’ .
Having read John Taylor Gatto's seminal work , and several thousand other books on history and political subjects , it just appears to me that the main goals have been achieved .
The communist party agenda has largely been enshrined in State and ( especially ) Federal laws .
Rule of law is dead , as well as is obedience and fealty to our Constitution .
Most people , especially so called elected officials and law enforcement , are ignorant as to what is actually written in our Constitution .
“ One thing struck me recently as I was re-reading John Taylor Gatto 's book .
The goal of public schools is not education , but social control .
It was to make revolution impossible by dumbing the populace down , and making them dependent upon their leaders .
Previous generations of Americans ( and other nations ) often found their political leadership superfluous as they were more than capable and confident of seeing to their affairs without government direction .
“ I do n't know what the long haul holds for western civilization .
Having read a number of sources and prognostications , it does NOT look good .
In the end , I do n't think I can participate in saving a civilization that seems committed to killing itself , and punishing those that try to save it .
In the end , all I think I can do is try to wage the battle of ideas , and secure the future of my family .
I no longer see that future in the USA .
The tyranny is no longer creeping .
It is running forward at a full gallop .
People are cheering it on .
People do n't want to be free ; they want the illusion of security .
They are no longer free spirited yeomen , but peasants of the technological age .
I want my kids growing up free , self - interested , moral , educated free agents whose loyalty and patriotism are not used to get them to support tyranny , but are used to allow them to explore freedom .
If they can't have freedom where they are , I want them to have the intellectual and moral fortitude to seek it anywhere in this world they can .
At one point , Americans all came from somewhere else .
I do n't consider it wrong to follow the example of my own ancestors .
The only difference is that instead of coming to the USA seeking freedom , we now flee it , seeking freedom .
“ To that end , we 'll probably just move around the globe like gypsies , no longer calling the USA , or the UK , or Dubai , or anywhere , " home . "
Places we go are places to see , and make a living .
To us , America resides in its ideals , which were expressed in its Constitution and the Declaration of Independence , and the Articles of Confederation even .
Unfortunately , teaching those is almost a crime in many schools in the USA ( all those " racist " Founding Fathers , and the way they dared to believe in the Christian God ) .
“ Western civilization had a good run , and the USA was a great experiment .
It has now devolved , and will soon end in abject failure .
I wonder if the civilizations the Chinese and Indians build will eventually rise in freedom , or will we just enter a long , technologically advancing , but philosophical Dark Age ?
All I can say is that expat families like ours will do our bit to keep the philosophies of freedom alive , but I do n't hold much hope that nations like the USA will remain fertile soil for those ideas .
Maybe someday things will recover , but if and until the Federal Government implodes and collapses , and then only if enough people value not only their own liberty , but respect the rights of their neighbors to be left alone , will true and real freedom ever flourish .
Modern Americans , by and large have no clue what being free actually is , so I do n't expect that they will do anything to reconstruct it should the chance arise . ”

What about you ?
Will we survive depth and level of corruption manifesting within America today from the president and Congress ?
We face an interesting election and outcome in 2009 .
I know one thing : if we refuse to participate in our country ’s future , I see the continuing demise of our country .
Long ago , assembly languages were endowed with expressive macroprocessing facilities .
But it still sucked to write in non-portable languages with incompatible proprietary such metalanguages .
And thus , I wanted to metaprogram in something reasonably portable , which at the time pretty much meant C .
The first obvious choice was to look at what the standard C pre-processor , CPP offered .
So as to prevent people from shooting themselves in the foot , the language designers made sure the macro expansion algorithm would terminate , by disabling recursion on already - expanded tokens in expressions where the token was already processed .
Some people , notably hbaker , thought of using #include as a recursion mechanism .
Unhappily , this is n't enough , because you cannot store infinite state in a CPP program : there is a finite number of variable - setting clauses in a program , each to a fixed variable known at compile - time , which leads to a finite number of variables usable in tests .
There is a finite number number of test statements , each combining into a boolean a finite number of variables , in a computation restricted to operators of modular arithmetics ; variables being expanded as lexical text can actually expand to something that has more combinations than a fixed - precision integer , but up to the reduction to some arithmetic operations , there is still but a finite number of observable grammatical states that a variable can take .
All in all , it is impossible to write a useful non-trivial metaprogram in CPP .
But that does n't mean it is impossible to write trivial harmful metaprograms in CPP , as is easily demonstrated in my counter - example die_die_stupid_c_compiler.c.
So CPP is but one more example of a fascist bondage and discipline meta-language .
At the same time , the C++ language was slowly extending itself with a meta - programming system , its template language , that soon enough became weakly " Turing equivalent " , and allowed wizards to write metaprograms to do all kind of wonderful things .
Except that this metalanguage was a pure functional language completely disconnected from C++ itself , extremely hard to debug -- you pretty much have re-develop all meta - level libraries from scratch in a completely new language to do non-trivial metaprograms , and cannot reuse libraries across language levels to bootstrap new functionality .
Yet another misguided design .
The correct approach was OpenC++ , that provides metaprogramming in the same recursively - bootstrappable meta- language as C ++.
But by the time you get there , you understand that C++ is not a language you want to use for metaprogramming anyway .
Like Perl , C++ is a swiss army chainsaw of a programming language .
Unlike Perl , it 's got all the blades simultaneously and permanently cast in a fixed half - open position .
Do n't turn it on .
If you want to metaprogram a language in itself , you 'll do yourself a favor by instead choosing Lisp , OCaml , Oz , Haskell , Erlang , or any other HOT language .
As for C , it 's rather bad as a portable assembly language , as it does n't handle continuations , multiple - value returns , does n't allow you precise access to the memory model and temporary variables as required for precise garbage collection , etc .
I will spare you my pitiful attempts at metaprogramming it with m4 ( do n't try it -- m4 really sucks , being better than CPP is a very low bar ; however you may look at This Forth for a relative success at using it ) .
Tom Lord did interesting things with the hard part of metaprogramming : not just generative but analytic , too .
He achieved the automatic verification of some GC invariants in the C layer of his Scheme implementation -- and that convinced me that even when done the best possible way , metaprogramming C still sucks : the CPP layer makes it hard to reason about actual source , and the language has lots of arbitrary semantics that make it hard to reason about where side effects happen unless you have intimate knowledge of the compiler , but there is no way to access this knowledge unless you re-write your own compiler at which point , why choose C ?
These days , LLVM seems to be the main thing as far as a portable low - level language target for metaprogramming goes ( unless you join the dark side and drink the .NET kool - aid ) .
And if you do n't care as much for mainstream and portability , you could try to go the way of Factor or your own COLA and build a system from the ground up around sound metaprogramming principles .
An ISP which was ordered by a court to stop illegal file - sharing on its network , says it simply can not .
The Belgian ISP Scarlet says the court 's verdict is unworkable and after trying to slow traffic and also filter it , it says it 's not possible to stop the flow of illicit files since Audible Magic does n't work .
In mid-2007 , after a battle with copyright group SABAM , a court in Belgium ruled that Internet Service Providers can be forced to block and / or filter copyright infringing files on P2P networks .
Although most people familiar with the technical hurdles recognized that this was a massive if not impossible task , the judge in the case ruled that ISPs are indeed capable of blocking infringing content and gave Scarlet six months to comply .
Scarlet said right from the start that it believed that if it complied with the court order it would be breaking the law .
The ISP claimed that Belgian law forbids it from spying on its customers so it lodged an appeal against the ruling , with managing director Gert Post saying : “ This measure is nothing else than playing Big Brother on the Internet .
If we do n’t challenge it today , we leave the door open to permanent , and invisible and illegal , checks of personal data . ”
Now , over a year later , Scarlet ’s lawyers argued in court that the company simply cannot stop the flow of illicit files , which is a serious situation since the ISP has to pay compensation of 2,500 Euros for each day it fails to do so .
According to a report , Scarlet has tried different techniques to try to comply with the ruling but has had no success .
First of all , Scarlet slowed down P2P traffic with the help of some Cisco technology .
All this led to was complaints from the customers , and it did nothing to stop the availability of the illicit files .
A lawyer for Scarlet , Christoph Preter said : “ We have actually received complaints that P2P traffic was slower , but it remained possible .
It is only a deterrent measure . ”
The ISP quite rightly refused to block all P2P traffic , since it said it would be blocking legitimate traffic too .
However , copyright group SABAM said this was not a valid excuse .
“ The argument put forward by Scarlet , ” said SABAM ’s lawyer , “ is not about the impossibility of blocking , but about the consequences . ”
SABAM clearly does n’t care who is affected , as long as it gets its way , stating that Scarlet simply has n’t tried hard enough to comply with the court .
The second solution , the filtering of illicit files , was a solution put forward last year by SABAM itself .
On the advice of an appointed P2P ‘ expert ’ , the court ruled that Scarlet must use the content filtering technology offered by Audible Magic .
However , Scarlet tried this system and it did n’t work when scanning for files on their network .
During last year ’s court case it was claimed that Audible Magic had experience with filtering in the US with Verizon and in Asia with another ISP .
However , Scarlet made inquiries with Verizon about the partnership but was told that no such deal exists and Audible Magic refused to reveal who the Asian ISP is .
“ We have misled the court , ” said SABAM ’s lawyer .
“ But SABAM followed the expert in the choice of Audible Magic , so we were acting in good faith . ”
A ruling in the case is not expected until 2010 .
CREW releases profiles of ' most corrupt members of Congress '
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has released its fourth annual report , " CREW 's Most Corrupt Members of Congress , outlining Washington politicians who it says have " most egregiously betrayed the public 's trust . "
12 of the 24 members of Congress listed in the report are under investigation .
The thirteenth , New York Congressman Charlie Rangel , has opened a House ethics investigation on himself .
" With soaring gas prices , a housing market in crisis , rising unemployment , and a nation at war , elected officials should be prioritizing their constituents ' needs over their own self - interests , " said CREW executive director Melanie Sloan .
" Unfortunately , the members of Congress listed in CREW 's Most Corrupt report have decided that their personal needs are paramount to those they represent .
This report holds them accountable for those choices . "
The entire list is as follows :
The report also adds four " dishonorable mentions " :
Cyber - crime police have arrested a man who uploaded the movie ' Wanted ' to a file - sharing network .
The man , Kazushi Hirata , was detained after he added custom subtitles to a pirated copy of the movie and uploaded it to the Internet , in advance of its Japanese theatrical release .
He faces up to 10 years in jail .
In many countries , police and anti-piracy agencies are combining forces to target people who pre-release media onto the Internet .
Those that put music or movies onto the Internet before their official release dates are treated much more harshly than regular file - sharers , as the music and movie industries claim they are more damaging than those who leak media later on in the product ’s life - cycle .
We have seen how harshly the pre-releasers at EliteTorrents were treated by the US legal system , and the UK music industry is lining up people who pre-released music on OiNK .
Now it is the turn of Japan to target a pre-releaser , this time of the movie ‘ Wanted ‘ .
The movie , starring James McAvoy , Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie , was released early September in the United States and Europe , but wo n’t enjoy an official Japanese release until Saturday .
The movie is , of course , already available for download on P2P networks in its native English , but thanks to the work of Kazushi Hirata , a 33 year - old from the city of Sendai , the movie is also available with Japanese subtitles .
According to the authorities , after adding his own home - made subtitles to an already - released pirate version of the movie , Hirata uploaded it onto the Winny network , which is hugely popular in Japan .
Hirata was tracked down on Thursday by the Kyoto Prefectural Police , who were also responsible for the 2004 arrest of Isamu Kaneko , the creator of the Winny software .
The arrest of Mr Hirata is believed to be the first in Japan relating to the uploading of a pre-release movie .
According to a report , he faces up to 10 years in jail and a $ 95,000 fine .
The Winny network has always been touted as anonymous , and indeed functions on this level to a degree .
The police were unable to crack the encryption used by the file - sharing part of the software , however , they did manage to exploit a loophole to identify certain users .
Winny ’s forum feature fails to protect the anonymity of people who start discussion threads .
In the past the police have searched for copyright material in such threads and recorded the IP address of the poster .
By initiating a file - transfer but denying connections from all IP addresses apart from the suspected infringer , when someone started to upload to them they knew that the original poster was sharing the illicit material .
EA 's Crysis- ready PC Costs $ 699 , Specs Unveiled ; Aims to ' Make PC Gaming Convenient '
Priced at $ 699 , the one and only Crysis Warhead PC was made with the involvement of EA , game developer Crytek , hardware maker Nvidia , and system builder UltraPC .
It will launch alongside Crysis Warhead on September 16 , and pack the following :
CPU : Intel Core Duo e7300 ( @2.66GHz )
Video card : Nvidia 9800GT
RAM : 2GB
The system actually represents the internal benchmark Crytek Budapest used when developing the stand - alone Crysis expansion , and is said to run Warhead with High settings at an average of 30 frames per second .
" For us as a team , that was really valuable , " franchise producer Bernd Diemer told Chris Remo .
" We had a tangible border we could bump our heads into . "
" When we started working on Warhead , we decided performance was a big issue , " he explained .
" We said , ' Guys , we 're going to build a PC which has a maximum price of six or seven hundred dollars , and it has to run Warhead in high spec at an average framerate of 30 '...
All the milestone presentations we did for EA , for the [ founding brothers ]
Yerlies , for the team , all the new prototypes , we showed on that machine . "
While more details are n't slated to arrive until the system is officially announced this week , Diemer was clear that the PC does not signal a new player in the hardware market .
" EA 's not getting into the hardware business , and Crytek is n't either , " he promised .
" The biggest thing for us is convenience , " Diemer concluded .
" We want to make PC gaming convenient . "
Making your own cardboard box solar food dryer is so easy and cheap , you might have to make two !
ILLUSTRATION : DALE J. JENNINGS
Well , all that may be necessary ( although I doubt it ) for some solar energy applications , but I 've designed a solar food dryer that anyone — and I do mean anyone — can put together for pennies ... and in minutes !
To build your sun-powered unit , choose a long , shallow cardboard box and cut a few holes in each of the narrow ends .
That done , paint the inside of the container black or line it with black plastic sheeting — whichever is easier .
Cover the box with clear plastic , and your heat catcher is complete .
Now , take another cardboard box and make several holes in one side .
Then use some scrap cardboard and masking tape to form an air duct connecting the shallow " solar " unit to the side of the drying box .
Set the latter on a table or stand , and lean the solar box against it at the most effective angle to catch the sun 's rays .
Finally , lay a cloth screen on top of the drying box and deploy the food to be dehydrated on that surface .

If you really splurged on this device , you might be able to spend $ 1 , but I doubt it !
Granted , it 's not very permanent , and it 's certainly not waterproof .
But , then , you would n't leave your drying comestibles out in the rain or snow anyway , would you ?
Note :
Run the dryer for a few days without any food , to drive off any fumes that might be released from the paint or plastic .
A telecommunications company is seeking to take advantage of the reform in broadcasting law to offer viewers free internet - based TV .
Magnet Entertainment is planning to offer customers five Irish television channels and at least a dozen radio stations for free via high - speed broadband link - ups , so sidestepping the much - maligned television licence .
The web - based system will initially only be available to half a million homes in Dublin , Cork , Galway , Limerick , Waterford and Portlaoise .
Mark Kellett , Magnet chief executive , said : “ We plan to continue to shake up the market , to innovate in the interest of Irish consumers and to really compete with those companies that have held a monopoly position for too long , ” he said .
“ I think television companies need to change in the same way telecoms companies need to change .
Ultimately it does signal the need for businesses like RTÉ to address how they meet the shortfall in revenues , ” he said .
The company is taking advantage of the liberal changes to broadcasting laws introduced last year by Eamon Ryan , Minister for Communications , Energy and Natural Resources , who designed the new act to allow for free web - based TV .
The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland have given their blessing to the broadband internet and TV service .

A new trend is surfacing , as spammers have sent out millions of emails targeting BitTorrent users .
The emails , that claim to come from MediaDefender , warn the receiver that he or she has been logged using BitTorrent and points them to an attachment supposedly containing evidence , but which is in fact infected with a virus .
Over the years BitTorrent has attracted some shady figures .
We ’ve reported on malware ridden BitTorrent clients and media players , a BitTorrent site that infects its users with spyware , and several other scams .
Although most scams can be avoided easily when a few simple rules are followed , they still manage to trick thousands of novices every day – and this is not going to end anytime soon .
Since BitTorrent has become more or less mainstream , with millions of users worldwide , it also proves an interesting target for email spammers .
The latest scam , unlike the others we have reported on before , is one that is sent by email .
The email is disguised as a message from the anti-piracy company MediaDefender ( using their logo etc. ) , and warns the recipient that his or her download behavior has been logged .
The email has a report attached with more details about the infringed material , which turns out to be a virus ( A Mytob worm which installs a trojan , and allows outsiders to gain access to your computer ) .
Pirate Spam Email
Dear User !
Your recent internet activity was logged on the following sites : * Btjunkie
* SumoTorrent
* isoHunt
* Btscene
* Mininova
* Fenopy
* Monova
* Yotoshi
* GetInvites
* Btmon
We have attached a report about the copyrighted movies , music , softwares you
downloaded or searched on these webpages .
We strongly advise you to stop any
future activities regarding the downloading of illegal content or you can
expect prosecution by 17 U.S.C. Â§Â § 512 , 1201? 1205 , 1301 ?1332 ; 28 U.S.C. Â§
4001 laws .
Sincerely , MediaDefender Inc .
To the more experienced and BitTorrent savvy users it is clear that the email is a scam .
First of all , MediaDefender has never been involved in anti-piracy enforcement .
The only thing they do is spoofing , flood BitTorrent sites with fake files , and the occasional DDoS attack on Revision3 .
In addition , the email claims to have data on what the user searched for on the sites , which is irrelevant and practically impossible .
It seems that the spammers should have done some more research on the topic .
A good spammer would have included The Pirate Bay in the list of sites instead of Getinvites , which is a BitTorrent invite trading site , and not a search engine
A related scam email , sent out by the same group of people judging by the style and format , is also targeted at filesharers and threatens to suspend their Internet connection .
The email claims to be sent by the Internet service provider consortium , and again includes an infected attachment with a report .
The email is a clever scam that shows how mainstream BitTorrent has become .
The emails are sent out randomly , but many recipients , scared by be cut off by their ISP , or sued for downloading copyrighted material , might open the infected attachment without realizing that it is a scam .
Mass - market Solar Panels Could Result from Chipmakers ' Competition
July 30th , 2008 by Carol Gulyas
As tech giants rush into the solar cell business , their competition promises to bring down the cost of solar photovoltaic ( PV ) panels used to generate electricity .
PV modules use silicon cells , which are also used in computer chips .
But with the traditional chip business growing at only 5 % annually , tech companies are looking for a new market niche to grow .
This is good news for the solar industry , where cost has been a barrier to wider acceptance .
Thus far , technology improvements have lowered solar PV costs only marginally , with each improvement coming at a large research cost .
Fierce competition on the part of the largest tech companies could change that .
According to Paul Davidson in USA TODAY :
“ Since May , computer powerhouses Intel ( INTC ) , IBM ( IBM ) and National Semiconductor ( NSM ) have barreled into solar energy , joining hundreds of fellow technology mainstays .
Virtually every chipmaker is weighing a solar play , says Rhone Resch , head of the Solar Energy Industries Association .
‘ We have a classic Silicon Valley land rush , ’ says T.J. Rodgers , CEO of Cypress Semiconductor ( CY ) , which owns 56 % of SunPower .
Drawing the stalwarts is solar ’s 40 % annual growth , says Gartner analyst Jim Hines . ”
The savings will come largely in the area of automating manufacturing .
How then , will the solar industry deal with the shortage of silicon ?
Semiconductor International rather mysteriously predicts that supplies of silicon will increase next year .
Along with the shift to solar thin film technology , which uses little or no silicon , this may mean that mass - market adaptation is within reach .

On Sunday , Henry Paulson , the Treasury secretary , tried to draw a line in the sand against further bailouts of failing financial institutions ; four days later , faced with a crisis spinning out of control , much of Washington appears to have decided that government is n’t the problem , it ’s the solution .
The unthinkable  a government buyout of much of the private sector ’s bad debt  has become the inevitable .
The story so far : the real shock after the feds failed to bail out Lehman Brothers was n’t the plunge in the Dow , it was the reaction of the credit markets .
Basically , lenders went on strike : U.S. government debt , which is still perceived as the safest of all investments  if the government goes bust , what is anything else worth ?
 was snapped up even though it paid essentially nothing , while would - be private borrowers were frozen out .
Thus , banks are normally able to borrow from each other at rates just slightly above the interest rate on U.S. Treasury bills .
But Thursday morning , the average interest rate on three - month interbank borrowing was 3.2 percent , while the interest rate on the corresponding Treasuries was 0.05 percent .
No , that ’s not a misprint .
This flight to safety has cut off credit to many businesses , including major players in the financial industry  and that , in turn , is setting us up for more big failures and further panic .
It ’s also depressing business spending , a bad thing as signs gather that the economic slump is deepening .
Sept. 15 , 2008  -- Lehman Brothers was identified eight years ago by ABC News and the New York Times as doing business with a company suspected of writing fraudulent mortgages and cheating consumers , but Lehman Brothers company defended its ongoing relationship as appropriate .
Lehman Brothers ' collapse today is blamed , in large part , on its heavy involvement in sub - prime mortgage investments dating back to that time .
In a joint investigation in March 2000 , 20/20 and the New York Times revealed how Lehman Brothers helped to " bundle " or package millions of dollars worth of mortgages arranged by California - based First Alliance Mortgage , accused by the Federal Trade Commission and several state attorneys general of defrauding homeowners through " predatory lending . "
( Click here to watch the 20/20 report . )
Watch 20 /20 on Friday for the full report .
The company continued to do business with the broker even after a Lehman Brother executive wrote a memo in which he expressed misgivings about the firm 's lack of ethics .
On the 20/20 broadcast , New York Times reporter Diana Henriques said Lehman Brothers became , in effect , First Alliance 's Wall Street enabler giving them " cachet on Wall Street " and " making hundreds of millions of dollars available to this country to continue to make loans . "
Lehman Brothers helped invent the financing of sub - prime mortgages from companies like First Alliance by taking over the individual mortgage loans and packaging them as high - interest paying investment vehicles for Wall Street , known as " securitization . "
When huge numbers of those sub - prime loans went into default , it triggered the financial crisis that continues to shake the country .
In March 2002 , the Federal Trade Commission announced a $ 60 million settlement with First Alliance charging that " First Alliance and its chief executive officer violated federal and state laws in making home mortgage loans to customers . "
The complaints against First Alliance alleged the company marketed its mortgages " through a sophisticated campaign of tele - marketing and direct mail solicitations . "
The ABC News / New York Times investigation revealed that Lehman Brothers was aware of the allegations and state investigations of First Alliance but continued to do business with them despite the ongoing government investigations and numerous civil lawsuits .
According to the Orange County Register , First Alliance went out of business after the FTC settlement .
A 2003 jury verdict against First Alliance also held Lehman Brothers partially responsible , according to the paper , " because it represented First alliance despite a memo written by one of Lehman 's executives that called First Alliance a ' sweatshop ' where employees ' leave your ethics at the door ' . "
Lehman Brothers ' chairman Richard Fuld declined to be interviewed in 2000 , but in a statement Lehman Brothers said " it is an underwriter and not a regulator . "
It also said that it believed First Alliance had stepped up compliance .
It was two years later , that the FTC took its enforcement action .
Homeowners who said they had been defrauded by First Alliance , alleging they were tricked into paying exorbitant fees and stuck with higher interest rates than they had been promised , questioned Lehman Brothers ' role at the time .
" If they knew anything of what was going on , they are just as guilty , " said Bernae Gunderson who said a First Alliance telemarketer had tricked her .
A tape recording of the telephone conversation she made proved to be a key piece of evidence against First Alliance .

An ( unnamed ) industry source told us a great story this week about Kirk Herbstreit being disappointed how his picture turned out on the side of the ESPN GameDay bus .
It seems he was a little too well done .
Too tan .
Almost….um … black !
Herbstreit complained and ESPN did the logical and had the wrap removed for a new , lighter version of Frosted Tips .
The new picture made its debut at the USC game .
Great Photoshop job , fellas , but actually he now looks a little too blown out .
And what ’s up with that really brown edge around his hair ?
We ’ll be keeping an eye on this bus for any other future changes .
Google 's keyword auctions redefined web advertising .
Now , a patent filing reveals , the search company wants to do the same thing for wireless services .
Google 's patent filing describes " devices , systems and methods " that would automatically poll nearby wireless services to find the best price for a voice or a data connection for a " portable communications device . "
That connection might come via a cellphone carrier , a WiMax provider , or even a Wi -Fi hotspot .
According to the patent , users can either manually select the bid they like best or they can allow the device to connect automatically with the lowest - cost provider .
The upshot ?
Just as advertisers know they 're always getting the market price for keywords on Google 's AdWords system , wireless users would always get the market price for wireless data service – or phone calls .
The system could potentially free users from cellphone contracts and locked phones that tie them to one service provider and allow them to switch from one carrier to another , seamlessly , based on which carrier had the lowest price at that moment .
" It is an interesting notion , " says Neil Strother , mobile analyst for Jupiter Research .
" The idea would be that the device or system is smart enough that the switching could be invisible and in the background and , if they could patent it , it could be very disruptive . "
Granted , a lot of obstacles stand in the way of this vision , not least of which would be the unwillingness of entrenched cellular carriers to play ball .
Also , the system would require compatible software not only on handsets , but also on any potential wireless connection points – a major infrastructure hurdle .
But the patent is striking for its scope – and for the glimpse it gives of Google 's lofty wireless ambitions .
The patent covers both voice calls and data transmission sessions and also covers a device that will wirelessly connect to a number of carriers , pull pricing information and then select a carrier based on the information .
The patent , filed in March 2007 but published today , is an indicator of how the company sees mobile as its next playground .
Already the launch of the T - Mobile G1 phone ( carrying the Google brand and Google 's Android operating system ) has established the company as a serious contender in the mobile business .
Mobile , after all , is the among the few technology sectors that have the potential to be a bigger business for Google than search .
And the patent goes along with Google 's mantra of opening up the wireless industry .
In its patent , Google has said it wants to bring together all the different modes of connectivity and offer consumers a device that potentially make them agnostic to the carrier they use .
With the proliferation of wired and wireless access technologies including DSL , cable , Wi-Fi or 3G networks , consumers are struggling to unify their communications , says Google 's patent .
Most users have a land line at home or work , a cell phone for mobility and sometimes a
PDA for data access .
" And they may have a different provider for each of these services , even though , to the user , they are just communications applications and not much more , " says the patent .
Though some attempts have been made to simplify communications , they are limited and restrictive , claims the patent .
And that 's where Google could step in .
If successful , the company could offer a system that could help a single device operate on multiple networks .
The patent cites an example of a mobile phone that could run on a home broadband network and transition to a Wi -Fi network or a cellular network outside .
" The connections may , in appropriate circumstances , be provided by different telecommunications providers , and may involve hand - offs of a particular communication session from one provider to another , " says the patent .
The advantages to the system are clear .
It would help users have access to the lowest cost network at all times .
" In addition to cost as a factor in selecting appropriate telecommunications providers , users may opt for alternative auction models based on maximal bandwidth offered , best coverage / reliability , or some combination of options , " says the patent .
To be sure , the patent may not amount to much .
Even Google with its might may not be able to break the stranglehold of telecom carriers in North America , and it is unlikely most wireless carriers or telecom service providers would play ball .
" There is a lot of heavy lifting that would be required in the background to pull this off , " says Strother .
" The software has to be really smart and the device has to be well tuned to detect and switch quickly across different technologies . "
" It 's not impossible , " says Strother , " but it would have to be a very nifty trick that they would have to pull off . "
But even if telecom carriers do n't sign on , Google can potentially pull this off – albeit slowly .
Last year , the company participated in the federal government ’s auction of wireless spectrum in the 700 Megahertz band .
Though Google failed to win any licenses , it bagged a commitment from the Federal Communications Commission that spectrum owners ,
Verizon and AT&T , among others , can't block out internet or telecom rivals .
Meanwhile , the company has invested about $ 500 million in the Sprint - Clearwire WiMax wireless broadband network
" It is not clear how big WiMax will be , but if it takes off , then it could be an alternative to current carriers , " says Strother .
The biggest challenge then would be in convincing the FCC , says Strother .
" The question is would the FCC go along with this ? "
So far Google has been pushing the FCC to open up the airwaves , and just maybe it can convince it to take this step .
Eventually if Google can realize a part of its vision and convince customers to sign on , carriers will have little choice but to work with the company , say industry experts .
" You ca n't stop innovation , " says Frank Meehan , director and general manager of 3G Handsets and Products for the Hutchison Whampoa Group .
" As carriers we can instead choose to become platforms that drive innovation and look at building value around advertising and applications . "

A touch of the grape may be good for the heart
Question : I heard on the news that grape juice may help prevent heart attacks .
How is this ?
( Asked by a curious column reader . )
Reply :
What ’s good and bad for you seems to change every day , and it is easy to get lost and / or confused .
First of all , let ’s talk about blood cells .
Most people know there are white and red blood cells .
But there is a third type called platelets .
Platelets are involved in the first stage of the blood clotting process .
When a blood vessel is injured ( and you bleed ) , platelets gather there and provide a sticky substance that “ glues ” the cells together .
Other chemicals in the blood then assist in forming a clot that seals the wound .
Clotting is not always good , in the sense that heart attacks can occur when blood clots stick to fatty deposits on the walls of the arteries , blocking the flow of blood .
You may have read that aspirin and red wines tend to reduce the platelets ’ activity to clot , thereby reducing the possibility of heart attack .
Natural substances called flavonoids found in various foods appear to have the ability to reduce platelet clotting .
Red wines and grape juice contain flavonoids .
In recent studies on humans and monkeys , it was found that drinking purple grape juice reduced the platelet activity by as much as 75 percent , as compared to 45 percent for aspirin and red wine .
It is hoped that a drug can be manufactured from grapes that could be used in heart attack treatment .
However , always remember to consult with your physician on such things .
Blood clotting is very essential and slowing down platelet activity could lead to unwanted bleeding .
C.P.S. ( Curious Postscript ) I like red wine because it ’s more sophisticated , more complex and mature .
It ’s a bit like me , no longer young but not old yet either .

Even his own family is coming out and remarking on the 180° turn from the Straight Talkin ' Maverick to the craven , say anything , do anything , pander to all politician desperately taking his last covetous bid at the White House .
Ouch .
John and I are related through our grandmothers .
Katherine Vaulx McCain and Huetta Vaulx Boles , both of Fayetteville , Ark. , were sisters .
My side of the Vaulx family represents a long line of Democrats , but it is with no small amount of pride that we 've followed the life and career of now - Sen.
John McCain .[.. ]
Although neither my father nor I have ever voted for a Republican , when John threw his hat in the ring in 2000 , we were both very proud and encouraged , and not just because he 's our relative .
This was the first Republican who , on a national stage , was saying things like , " If we repeal Roe vs .
Wade tomorrow , thousands of young American women will be performing illegal and dangerous operations , " and , " Neither party should be defined by pandering to the outer - reaches of American politics and the agents of intolerance . "
Wow !
Here was a man who was not abiding by partisan lines , who was , instead , living up to his promise of " straight talk " and commonsense thinking .
The right - wing Republican base may not have agreed with everything he said , but the rest of America certainly respected him for speaking his mind honestly .
Jump ahead to the campaign Sen. McCain is currently running .
Clearly , a lot can change in eight years .
Our nation has gone from a time of unparalleled prosperity and peace to one marked by debt in the trillions of dollars , record foreclosures , and a global reputation for warmongering and neo-imperialism .
So , where is the straight - talking , commonsense John McCain of 2000 ?
I 'm afraid he is long gone , replaced by a desperate version of himself who seems to contradict nearly everything he once stood for .
What becomes apparent in his ideological about - face is just how out of touch McCain really is with America 's working families . [..]
But , as he continually demonstrates in this campaign , my cousin John is long gone .
" Straight talk " has been replaced with " flip - flop . "
Saddest all , this is the same man who , when campaigning in 2000 , told a crowd of supporters , " I do n't think Bill Gates needs a tax cut .
I think your parents do . "
MADISON , WI , September 29 , 2008 - A plot of land on the campus of Auburn University shows that 110 years of sustainable farming practices can produce similar cotton crops to those using other methods .
In 1896 , Professor J.F. Duggar at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama ( now Auburn University ) started an experiment to test his theories that sustainable cotton production was possible on Alabama soils if growers would use crop rotation and include winter legumes ( clovers and / or vetch ) to protect the soil from winter erosion .
Today , his experiment on the campus of Auburn University is the oldest , continuous cotton experiment in the world and the third oldest field crop experiment in the United States on the same site .
The experiment , known as " the Old Rotation , " has continued with only slight modifications in treatments and was placed on the National Register of Historical Places in 1988 .
Researchers at Auburn University and at USDA - Soil Dynamics Laboratory in Auburn , AL , have prepared the first ever comprehensive research publication covering the entire 110 - yr history of this experiment .
It was published in the September - October issue of Agronomy Journal , and provides insight into issues both past and present that effect sustainable crop production in the South .
The thirteen plots in the Old Rotation include ( i ) continuous cotton , ( ii ) a 2 - yr rotation of cotton with corn , and ( iii ) a 3 - year rotation of cotton - corn - wheat - soybean .
These crop rotations include treatments with and without winter legumes ( usually crimson clover and / or vetch ) and with and without fertilizer nitrogen .
After more than 110 years , the Old Rotation continues to document the long - term effects of crop rotation and winter legumes on cotton production in the Deep South .
It provides growers , students , and faculty with a living demonstration of fundamental agronomic practices that result in sustainable crop production .
Long - term yields indicate that winter legumes are as effective as nitrogen fertilizer in producing non-irrigated , 10 - yr average cotton yields of 1,100 pounds lint per acre .
Winter legumes and crop rotations contribute to increased soil organic matter .
Higher soil organic matter results in higher crop yields .
In 1997 , the Old Rotation entered a new era of agricultural production where boll weevil eradication , genetically modified crops , and conservation tillage almost eliminated the need for the plow and pesticides .
In 2003 , irrigation was added to half of each plot .
Yields of cotton , corn , wheat and soybean continue to increase far beyond the yields of Professor Duggar 's generation .
Since initiating conservation tillage practices in 1997 , all - time , non-irrigated record yields have been made on all the crops grown on the Old Rotation : 1,710 pounds cotton lint per acre in 2006 , 95 bushels wheat per acre in 2001 , 236 bushels corn per acre in 1999 , and 67 bushels of double - cropped soybean per acre in 1997 after wheat .

News Feature
China burns more coal than any other country ; how it does so in the future will determine our planet 's climate .
Jeff Tollefson reports from Beijing .
Huang Bin , a 30 - year - old engineer , is surveying the scene at one of China 's showcase energy projects : a retrofit that will make the Gaobeidian coal - fired power plant in Beijing burn just a little bit cleaner .
Three engineers in red hard hats pore over a blueprint , their fingers tracing lines on paper splayed across a steel tank .
Two workers adjust a valve nearby , one of hundreds on a two - storey platform erected alongside two 30 - metre - high vessels that will house the chemical reactions at the heart of the project .
Sparks fly as welders connect pipes ; the buzz of grinders comes and goes .
The ground was broken on this project just three months ago , and even an outside observer can tell that there is plenty still to do .
But no one seems to doubt that the world 's latest carbon - capture pilot plant will be finished in three weeks ' time .
“ Chinese speed , ” Huang says with a smile .
That was in late June .
Last week , as planned , the new unit began stripping carbon dioxide out of a small stream of exhaust from the plant , a high - efficiency , 1,065 - megawatt monster that churns out 10 % of Beijing 's power and one - third of its hot - water heat .
The Huaneng Group , the government - owned company that runs the plant , plans to collect less than 1 % of the CO 2 emitted here , ultimately to provide some of the fizz in locally made carbonated drinks .
It is a modest goal , but for China the project is a gesture of goodwill , a tentative step into the kinds of technologies needed to decarbonize an economy that derives more than two - thirds of its energy from coal .
N. BEHRING / PANOS
For years , China has lagged behind the West in researching ways to burn coal more cleanly , but that is beginning to change .
Huang and his colleagues are coming of age in an era in which the Chinese learn by doing , and what they are doing today is advanced coal technology .
The total time for the Gaobeidian retrofit from announcement through design and commissioning was nine months .
Chinese speed has raised entire cities and built modern highways , all while providing at least basic energy services to most of its 1.3 billion people .
It has also frightened a world already alarmed by global warming .
The planet 's most populous nation has added some 170 gigawatts of coal - fired power capacity in the past two years alone — more than double Britain 's entire electricity - generating capacity , installed over a century — and has overtaken the United States as the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases .
Yet China 's single - minded determination to get things done , if properly harnessed , could drive down costs and commercialize advanced coal technologies that have languished in labs and boardrooms in the West .
In many ways , China has already positioned itself at the forefront of coal technology , but ' advanced ' does not necessarily mean clean .
Climate - friendly technologies would enable companies to capture and pump CO 2 underground , eliminating most of the emissions from coal .
By contrast , even new technologies for converting coal into transportation fuels without carbon capture might increase China 's reliance on coal , as well as its emissions .
“ When the Chinese government says it is going to do something , it will do it . ”
Lu Xuedu
“ It 's relatively easy for me to imagine the Chinese will get way out in front of us in the United States and Europe , ” says Kelly Sims Gallagher , an expert in China energy at Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
“ The Chinese are committed to installing advanced technology .
The question right now is which technology it will be . ”
So far , China 's industrial revolution resembles a compressed version of that experienced in the West , with all the associated environmental problems and resource limitations .
Evidence suggests that solutions , too , may come in rapid - fire fashion .
An oft - cited statistic is that the Chinese bring a new power plant on line every week or two ; less appreciated is that today 's power plants generally employ state - of - the - art combustion technology , whereas older , less - efficient plants are being shut down .
The main goal is to save coal .
China 's coal reserves rank as the world 's third largest ; the country mined and then devoured some 2.5 billion tonnes of coal last year , more than double the tonnage of the next - largest user , the United States .
Still , the mining industry has struggled to meet demand , and imports are on the rise .
Efficiency drive
The government has also made energy efficiency its de facto climate policy ( see ' Kicking the coal habit ' ) , beginning with an ambitious effort to cut energy intensity ( the amount of energy consumed per unit of gross domestic product ) by 20 % from 2006 to 2010 .
The emphasis is on the manufacturing industries , such as iron , steel and cement , which consume 68 % of the nation 's electricity and even more of its overall energy .
It 's not clear whether China will meet that goal on time .
For many observers , though , what makes the policy real is the fact that national communist leaders now grade local officials according to their progress on energy efficiency .

The government is also taking aim at conventional pollutants from coal - fired power plants , hoping to curb acid rain and the dense smog that envelops many of China 's cities .
Roughly half of China 's power plants are now equipped with ' scrubbers ' for sulphur dioxide emissions .
Most of these have been installed since 2006 , and there are more to come .
“ China now has more scrubber capacity than all of the rest of the world put together , ” says Robert Williams , a senior scientist at the Princeton Environmental Institute in New Jersey .
Nitrogen oxides are likely to be next on the clean - up list .
According to the official government line , such efforts are intended to create a wealthier and more ' harmonious ' society .
At the same time , leaders are under pressure from an increasingly large and vocal middle class that aspires to a cleaner , more prosperous lifestyle .
Also telling is that the government has acknowledged in public documents the cold economics of pollution - related deaths and disease .
Pollution is likely to slash the country 's gross domestic product by anything from 2 % to an eye - popping 18 % by 2020 , depending on how successful the clean - up initiatives are , according to Ming Lei , an environmental economist at Peking University .
Those estimates do not include the potentially enormous effects of climate change .
Both politicians and scientists foresee huge problems with increased floods , dwindling crop yields , and less freshwater run-off as Himalayan glaciers recede ( see page 393 ) .
But only a new carbon economy or a regulatory directive from the government — probably preceded by some kind of international climate agreement — is going to change the status quo , as businesses currently have no incentive to curb CO 2 emissions .
“ Unless you tell them this will make them money , then they say ' no ' , ” says Zhang Hai , an engineering professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing .
“ Nobody is a volunteer . ”
Fifty kilometres southeast of Beijing , in the industrial city of Langfang , China 's energy economics are on display at the new headquarters and research facilities of ENN .
This independent company with global ambitions is now betting big on technologies for converting coal into a substitute for diesel fuel .
A visitor is driven up to the new , six - storey office building in a black company Audi , complete with tinted windows .
Outside , bulldozers are clearing land for three new labs ; already standing are pilot plants for coal gasification , biofuels and solar projects , as well as a solar - cell manufacturing plant .
All of this has been achieved in the past year , during which ENN has hired some 4,000 employees , boosting its workforce by 20 % .
The facility has its own hotel , restaurant and golf course .
Next up : a university .
ENN began as a rental - car company in 1989 and made its money as a distributor of natural gas and other fuels .
It is now pursuing coal gasification , an old technology that glimmers whenever petroleum supplies seem threatened , and is a leader in the new wave of interest in underground gasification .
At its simplest , the technique involves drilling a well , igniting the coal within it and adding oxygen ; another well sucks out the resulting ' syngas ' , a mixture of mostly hydrogen , carbon monoxide and CO 2 .
The syngas can then be condensed to make liquid fuel or chemicals .
Most of the early research projects in this area have run their course , although one commercial project has been operating in Uzbekistan for more than four decades .
Other companies are planning projects in the United States , Canada and beyond .
ENN says it has been operating two pilot projects in Inner Mongolia since last year and is now developing a commercial - scale facility .
Gan Zhongxue , ENN 's chief scientist , readily admits that his company is several years behind some of the most advanced Western companies pursuing gasification technologies .
ENN purchased its first gasifier from US - based General Electric , one of several multinationals seeking a piece of the action in China .
Gan says that the company is now talking to a different US firm about a partnership that would allow ENN to deploy new technologies in the field .
If it works , both companies could profit from subsequent growth and exports back to the United States and Europe .
Advocates argue that underground gasification could be one of the wisest ways to use coal , in part because it eliminates the cost — and energy — of mining and transportation .
Cooking the coal in place also leaves unwanted pollutants in the ground , and any CO 2 stripped out during the chemical processing can be pumped right back where it came from .
ENN is n't interested in burying CO 2 ( at least not until there is money in it ) , although Gan is trying to diversify his energy portfolio and thus envisages using the CO 2 to stimulate the growth of algae for biofuel .
And that 's the problem : unless the carbon is actually captured at its source and sequestered in some form , even the newest and fanciest coal - based liquid fuels put roughly double the CO 2 into the atmosphere compared with fuels derived from oil .
China is under pressure to avoid doing exactly that , and the state - owned Shenhua Group is considering carbon capture and storage for the US $ 1.5 - billion coal - to - liquids plant it expects to start up this year in Inner Mongolia .
Shenhua is using its own technology to convert some 3.5 million tonnes of coal into diesel and other transportation fuels , equivalent to more than 24,000 barrels of oil per day .
The plant will also recycle water and waste products , making it cleaner than older coal - to - liquids technologies , says Julio Friedmann , a researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Berkeley , California .
“ It 's an engineering marvel . ”
China views the Mongolia plant as a technology showcase , and many think that Shenhua will eventually move forward with a plan to bury as much as 85 % of the plant 's CO 2 emissions .
Without making promises , Ren Xiangkun , Shenhua 's vice - president and head of its Coal Liquefaction Research Centre , says that the company attaches “ great importance ” to carbon management .
Coal - to - liquids projects will move forward in “ close connection ” with the development of carbon - capture and sequestration technologies , he says .
Even if CO 2 is captured during production , however , the carbon in the fuels remains .
That means the best hope is to come out neutral on greenhouse emissions .
Deep burial
The economics seem to be enough to support sequestration .
Qingyun Sun of West Virginia University in Morgantown is working with Shenhua and the US Department of Energy on the project , and says that the plant will make money as long as the price of oil is above $ 45 per barrel .
Capturing and storing carbon emissions adds another $ 5 –8 per barrel , but with the oil price hovering at around $ 130 per barrel , “ that is still very profitable ” , Sun says .
Nearby oil and gas fields could hold some of the extracted CO 2 , but with volumes exceeding 3 million tonnes of CO 2 annually — larger than any sequestration project in the world so far — the ultimate target will have to be saline aquifers or deep coal seams .
Any lessons learned here might need to be applied throughout the industry .
Shenhua 's plant is n't even on line yet , and the company is already planning an expansion .
Shenhua is also partnering with South African coal - to - liquids giant Sasol to build another pair of plants that could each produce 80,000 barrels of fuel , or 3.4 million tonnes , per day .
In all , seven coal - to - liquids plants are under construction in China , according to Sun , and many more are in the planning stages .

China has also been given an opportunity — one that it did n't ask for — to lead the world in developing the first low - emission coal - fuelled power plant , by coupling coal - gasification technology with carbon capture and storage .
Integrated gasification combined cycle ( IGCC ) is a leading technology at present because the gasification process strips out conventional pollutants and produces a clean gas to generate power ( see graphic ) .
The two - stage electrical generation converts more energy into electricity , and the plant can be configured to produce a relatively pure stream of CO 2 that can be siphoned off — for a price .
Until earlier this year , the United States had been the assumed leader in the race to build the first IGCC plant with carbon capture .
But in January , the US Department of Energy cancelled the signature project , called FutureGen , citing disputes with its industry partners over the $ 1.8 - billion cost .
The decision baffled and angered Chinese officials and scientists at the Huaneng Group , who were partners in the project .
“ This will not happen in China , ” says Lu Xuedu , who handles global environmental affairs as deputy chief of China 's Ministry of Science and Technology .
“ When the Chinese government says it is going to do something , it will do it , surely . ”
Race for the future
With FutureGen off the table ( at least in its original design or until the White House has a new occupant ) , the race is on between China and Australia to build the first plants .
In China , Huaneng is leading a consortium that hopes to complete a 250 - megawatt pilot IGCC plant by next year , then commission by 2015 a 400 - megawatt plant complete with hydrogen production , fuel - cell electricity generation and carbon sequestration .
Total cost : $ 1.5 billion , almost entirely funded by industry , although project officials say that figure could rise .
The final permit has yet to be approved by China 's National Development and Reform Commission ( NDRC ) , but ' GreenGen ' , as it is known , has already — unofficially — broken ground along the coast in Tianjin , south of Beijing .
The Australians are taking a different approach with the Aus$ 1.2 - billion ( US $ 1.17 billion ) ' ZeroGen ' IGCC plant in Queensland .
Project managers aim to commission a 115 - megawatt pilot plant with 75 % CO 2 capture and storage by 2012 , followed by a 400 - megawatt unit with 90 % CO 2 capture by 2017 .
ZeroGen has already brokered agreements with local landowners and begun drilling test wells into a saline aquifer .
“ If we can crack it , then that has the greatest commercial application all around the world , ” says Chai McConnell , corporate affairs manager for the ZeroGen consortium .
“ China has an extensive base of real - world gasification experience . ”
John Thompson
Aside from GreenGen , the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology has supported several demonstration projects that target either IGCC or ' polygeneration ' , which uses gasification technology to produce both power and chemicals .
In addition , companies have submitted at least a dozen other IGCC applications to the NDRC , according to multiple industry sources .
All these projects are pending , generating endless speculation , but few within the coal industry expect the government to approve them all .
Lu thinks that as few as one or two will make it through .
That 's not nearly enough to make much of a difference in terms of overall greenhouse - gas emissions , given that China could bring hundreds of coal - fired plants on line in the coming years .
The problem is the cost .
An analysis by Gallagher and her colleagues suggests that IGCC capital technology costs upwards of 50 % more than pulverized coal in China — and that 's without adding carbon capture and storage .
Advanced coal power plants thus need more government subsidies or higher electricity costs , which in turn eat into government priorities such as poverty relief and economic growth .
Lu says that many companies are ready to take the lead on IGCC technology , but the government has to make its own decision .
If companies fail , he says , “ they come to the government saying , ' give me the money ' ” .
Irrespective of how these initial IGCC plants fare , China will continue to develop its expertise in gasification technologies for producing chemicals .
In some cases , these plants might even deploy small - scale power production on the side , a trend that some experts think is already under way .
A new gasifier patented by East China University of Science and Technology , for instance , has been licensed at nearly 30 plants in China , according to the Clean Air Task Force , a US - based environmental group .
“ What China has going forward is an extensive base of real - world gasification experience , ” says John Thompson , who handles coal issues for the group .
“ That counts for a lot . ”
“ Politicians are quiet when it comes to spending massive amounts of money . ”

Even as new coal - fired plants come on line , the old ones might eventually need to be shut down or retrofitted with carbon - capture equipment .
China and Australia are collaborating on several retrofit projects , including the Gaobeidian plant and some in Australia .
Plenty of other pilot - scale projects are under way around the world , but the United Kingdom might well be the first country to implement post - combustion capture on a large scale .
Last November , the UK government launched a competition to demonstrate 90 % capture and storage on a 300 –400 - megawatt plant by 2014 .
This is also the only candidate to meet the criteria for a broader call by the European Commission for upwards of a dozen commercial - scale coal power plants with carbon capture and storage by 2015 ( it 's not yet clear , though , where the money will come from ) .
“ This is what I like about GreenGen .
The Chinese government decided ' we will do this ' and it will be done .
We in Europe rather dither about it , ” says Derek Taylor , who works on energy issues at the European Commission .
“ We 've had projects announced in Europe , but none of them is that far down the line .
Politicians are quiet when it comes to spending massive amounts of money on it , but massive amounts of money need to be spent . ”
Carbon credit
In the end , the issues faced by all these technologies are who pays , and how much .
One possible source of money is the Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) of the Kyoto Protocol , which allows companies in developed nations to pay for projects that reduce emissions in developing countries .
But the sums of money currently changing hands are too small .
Contracts under the European emissions - trading scheme could bring in roughly $ 7 billion in credits to China between 2008 and 2012 .
That might be a hefty figure but it's not enough to affect broader energy trends in China , says Fu Ping , who works on the CDM programme under the Chinese finance ministry .

Moreover , the CDM programme would need to be revised and ramped up if it is to work for even one integrated carbon - storage project .
First of all , it cannot currently be used to promote underground carbon storage , simply because the rules and regulations are not in place .
Fu says that the United Nations , which administers the programme , has already had talks about changing that , but it might not make much of a difference until the prices for carbon storage and credits converge .
CO 2 credits currently sell for $ 13 – 20 per tonne on the primary market in China , he says , and estimates for the cost of storing CO 2 from coal - fired power plants generally hovers around $ 50 per tonne .
Last year , the Bush administration proposed an international fund for direct investment into these types of technologies .
The idea has garnered international support among the G8 leading industrialized nations , which have so far committed roughly $ 6 billion .
Such a fund could be used to support clean - energy projects and , in the case of China , help pay for the additional costs of managing CO 2 emissions .
The World Bank would manage the fund , but no decisions have been made on exactly how much money there would be or how it would be administered .
Harvard 's Gallagher has been advocating this approach for some time , arguing that a simpler and more aggressive tool than the CDM is needed to change the development pattern in China and other developing countries .

One idea being aired in climate circles in China is that the country could halve its energy intensity by 2020 , then commit to levelling out emissions in the subsequent decade .
A similar idea arose last year in a study sponsored by WWF China and headed by Lu and other government officials .
That document also pegged the necessary investment in clean - energy technologies at roughly $ 220 billion .
Lu plays down that number , pointing out that everything that everybody , including the Chinese , thought they knew about energy development in China five years ago was wrong .
He is also confident that China can and will tackle the problem one way or another .
But if the goal is a rapid transition to a green economy , he says , the West would be wise to open the money spigot a little wider and send along its best technologies as well .
“ We need help , ” he says .

Cavemen , read this timeline for goodness sake and realize how big Linux has become :
I 'm sometimes annoyed when I read some ignorant people 's comment that Linux does n't matter anymore and that it is slowly dying .
Like , a comment from a blog said , " Linux ?
Do people still use it ? "
Another one , a hermit probably , wrote , " I think Linus Torvalds is the only person in the world right now who 's using Linux " .
These people must have been living in a cave for the past 10 years .
Cavemen , read this timeline for goodness sake and realize how big Linux has become :
* 1983 ( September ) : GNU project was announced publicly
* 1991 ( September ) : first version of the Linux kernel was released to the Internet
* 2001 ( second quarter ) : Linux server unit shipments at 15 % annual growth rate
* 2004 : Linux shipped on approximately 50 % of the worldwide server blade units , and 20 % of all rack - optimized servers
* 2005 : Microsoft representatives accuse Brazilian college using Famelix of pirating Microsoft Windows
* 2007 : Dell announces it will ship select models with Ubuntu Linux pre-installed
* 2007 : Lenovo announces it will ship select models with SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 pre-installed
* 2007 : HP announces that it will begin shipping computers preinstalled with Red Hat Linux in Australia
* 2007 : ASUS launches the linux - based ASUS Eee PC
* 2008 : Dell announces it will begin shipping Ubuntu based computers to Canada and Latin America
* 2008 : Dell is shipping systems with Ubuntu pre-installed in China
* 2008 : Acer launches the Linux - based Acer Aspire One
Not only giant computer makers are adopting Linux , but also government institutions , schools , and businesses from different countries .
Indeed Linux has gone mainstream , and it's not finished yet .
However , I do n't want to predict right now that it 's going to kick Microsoft Windows ' fat ass and go beyond its market share in the near future .
One thing is for sure though , Linux is here to stay , and it 's here to rule .

A woman said to be 70 years of age has given birth to twins in India 's northern Uttar Pradesh state after taking IVF treatment .
Omkari Panwar has no birth certificate but if her age is proven it would make her the world 's oldest mother .
The twins , a boy and girl both weighing 2lbs , were delivered one month early by Caesarian section .
The couple were so desperate for a male heir that they spent their life savings and took out a bank loan for IVF .
Now , we are very grateful to God , who has answered our prayers
Charam Singh , father of twins
Omkari Panwar already has two daughters and is a grandmother to five children .
" We already have two girls but we wanted a boy so that he could have taken care of our property .
This boy and girl are God 's greatest gift to us , " Omkari said .
Father of the twins , Charam Singh , a farmer in his mid-70s , told ABC News he was very happy .
" The desire for a male child has always been there , but God did not bless us with a male child .
Now , we are very grateful to God , who has answered our prayers , " he said .
Doctors said the twins were doing fine .
Omkari maintains she was nine years old when the British left India in 1947 , which would make her 70 .
In December 2006 , a 67 - year - old Spanish woman gave birth to twins in Barcelona .
A woman said to be 65 gave birth to a boy in India 's eastern Orissa state in 2003 .

Title • international fireworks # 3
I do n't think this one is quite in the same league as yesterday's , but it does do a reasonably good job of demonstrating quite how hectic it can get when you 're close to a big display .
What I probably did n't make clear yesterday is that the crowd were viewing this display from the promenade and the display was launched from the pier .
I was with the launching team , about one third of the way down the pier ; probably a few hundred feet from the sea - front .
It was n't the best angle from which to view the display , but it was certainly a lot more exciting than either standing with everyone else or shooting the display from the beach .
As with yesterday 's this was shot at f/16 , but this one was a nine second exposure .
And in this instance I 've cropped a 3x2 portrait format shot to a 3x2 landscape one .
Normally , I would n't post anything that had been cropped so drastically , but with fireworks the only viable option is to set up your camera and try and work out what will end up in the shot .
In this one , there 's a considerable amount of blown out areas in the original so I could bin it or crop it .
There 's a final display next Friday so I 'll try and come up with another interesting location to shoot from , either that or I 'll shoot from the pier again .
A new BBC series makes use of satellite technology to create stunning images of Britain from above .

Yobs threw rocks at his house for years .
But the father who fought back is arrested
For more than two years , Sydney Davis 's house has been under siege from youths throwing stones .
After two hours of bombardment in the latest attack and no sign of the police , the 65 - year - old retired builder decided enough was enough .
As a particularly large missile landed in his kitchen , he grabbed a plank of wood from the garden and ran towards the gang to scare them away .
Taking a stand : Sydney Davis and son Jimmy , five with a rock thrown by thugs .
He got the wood to scare them
The police arrived just in time - to arrest Mr Davis for possession of an offensive weapon .
He now faces up to six months in prison .
Yesterday Mr Davis said he was bewildered by the decision to prosecute him .
He claims objects have been thrown at his house on 700 separate occasions .
His windows have been smashed five times in eight months .
' Something needs to be done to stop these kids .
They are out there every night , ' he said .
' One of my neighbours even had a seven - month - old in their kitchen when a brick came through the window .
' It showered glass across the baby 's face .
When these kids see the police they are off through the alleyways .
The police have got no chance of catching them . '
Mr Davis 's 42 - year - old wife Pauline dialled 999 when their home came under attack yet again last week , but two and a half hours later officers had failed to arrive .
The couple 's two sons , five and seven , were cowering behind the sofa when their father ran at the gang .
He recalled : ' My wife called the police at 6 o'clock .
But [ the youths ] just kept on throwing stones .
' I have two kids and if one of those stones hit them it could have caused some really nasty damage .
' I left the back door open to stop them smashing it . '
When officers arrived outside his home in Swindon , Wiltshire , Mr Davis was handcuffed and led away to the cells , where he was later charged .
The youths ran off .
' What in the world is this country coming to that the police arrest people like me for protecting their own property ? ' he said yesterday .
' The police say they want to reduce crime , yet they let evil little toe - rags like this off .
Then they prosecute hard - working , upstanding residents like me .
The law is , quite simply , a colossal ass . '
Wiltshire police claim to have increased their patrols after two houses in the region were attacked by arsonists .
Officers ' shift patterns were also changed so they would be in the neighbourhood after dark , while the local council is considering blocking - off some of the alleyways .
Yesterday a spokesman confirmed that no youths were arrested in relation to the incident .
Local councillor Justin Tomlinson said homeowners in the area were ' living in fear ' of unruly youths .
' We have sympathy with frustrated local residents - the Government continues to ignore a broken society , and therefore it is little wonder that frustrations boil over . '
( CNN ) -- Indicted U.S. Sen .
Ted Stevens easily turned back challengers in Alaska 's Republican primary , but the state 's longtime representative , Don Young , was locked in a neck - and - neck battle with a GOP rival Wednesday .
Both Stevens and Young have been embroiled in controversies over congressional spending in the past two years .
Stevens has pleaded not guilty to charges that he filed false Senate ethics reports .
With just under 98 percent of precincts reporting , Stevens led a field of seven with more than 63 percent of the vote , the state Division of Elections reported .
The 84 - year - old senator is seeking a seventh full term and will face Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich , the Democratic primary winner , in November .
Meanwhile , Young led Alaska Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell by fewer than 150 votes out of more than 93,000 cast in the GOP primary for the state 's sole seat in the House of Representatives .
" What a night , " the 18 - term incumbent said in a statement .
" This has been an extremely spirited and hard - fought primary , and now it appears as if we wo n't know the results until sometime Wednesday , at the earliest . "
Young said that about 4,000 absentee ballots remain to be counted , along with votes from the outstanding precincts .
" I 'm confident the final results will give us a primary victory , and we can move on to the general election , " he said .
Young and Parnell , who was backed by Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , each had about 45 percent of the vote .
A third candidate , Gabrielle LeDoux , took a little more than 9 percent .
The eventual winner will face Ethan Berkowitz , the victor in Tuesday 's Democratic primary , in November .
Both Young and Stevens were backers of the infamous " Bridge to Nowhere , " a $ 223 million span that would have connected the Alaskan mainland to Gravina Island , population 50 .
The funding " earmark " became shorthand for pork - barrel spending , and Congress later rescinded it .
In April , the Senate voted to seek a federal investigation into a 2005 highway - funding earmark that was altered between the time Congress approved the spending bill and when President Bush signed it .
The $ 10 million allocation was changed to put the money into building a freeway interchange in Lee County , Florida , where local business leaders contributed $ 40,000 in campaign funds to Young .
The congressman 's staff made the changes to fix a mistake in the original bill , his office said , but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on the chamber 's ethics committee to investigate the matter .

AS RECENTLY as a few months ago , it seemed possible to hope that this year 's presidential election would be a civilised affair .
Barack Obama and John McCain both represent much that is best about their respective parties .
Mr Obama is intelligent , inspiring and appears by instinct to be a consensus - seeking pragmatist .
John McCain has always stood for limited , principled government , and has distanced himself throughout his career from the religious ideologues that have warped Republicanism .
An intelligent debate about issues of the utmost importance — how America should rebuild its standing in the world , how more Americans could share in the proceeds of growth — seemed an attainable proposition .
It does n't seem so now .
In the past two weeks , while banks have tottered and markets reeled , the contending Democrats and Republicans have squabbled and lied rather than debated .
Mr McCain 's team has been nastier , accusing Mr Obama of sexism for calling the Republican vice - presidential candidate a pig , when he clearly did no such thing .
Much nastier has been the assertion that Mr Obama once backed a bill that would give kindergarten children comprehensive sex education .
Again , this was a distortion : the bill Mr Obama backed provided for age - appropriate sex education , and was intended to protect children from sex offenders .
These kinds of slurs seem much more personal , and therefore unpleasant , than the more routine distortions seen on both sides .
Team McCain accuses Mr Obama of planning to raise taxes for middle - income Americans ( in fact , the Democrat 's plan raises them only for those earning more than $ 250,000 ) ; Mr Obama claims Mr McCain wants to fight in Iraq for 100 years ( when the Republican merely agreed that he would gladly keep bases there for that long to help preserve the peace , as in Germany ) and caricatures him far too readily as a Bush toady ( when Mr McCain 's record as an independent senator has been anything but that ) .
An issue of life and life
The decision to descend into tactics such as the kindergarten slur shows that America is back in the territory of the “ culture wars ” , where the battle will be less about policy than about values and moral character .
That is partly because Mr Obama 's campaign , perhaps foolishly , chose to make such a big deal of the virtues of their candidate 's character .
Most people are more concerned about the alarming state of the economy than anything else ; yet the Democrats spent far more time in Denver talking about Mr Obama 's family than his economic policy .
The Republicans leapt in , partly because they have a candidate with a still more heroic life story ; partly because economics is not Mr McCain 's strongest suit and his fiscal plan is pretty similar to Mr Bush 's ; but mostly because painting Mr Obama as an arrogant , elitist , east - coast liberal is an easy way of revving up the Republican Party 's base and what Richard Nixon called the “ silent majority ” ( see article ) .
The decision to play this election , like that of 2004 , as a fresh instalment of the culture wars is disappointing to those who thought Mr McCain was more principled than that .
By choosing Sarah Palin as his running - mate he made a cynical tryst with a party base that he has never much liked and that has never much liked him .
Mr McCain 's whole candidacy rests on his assertion that these are perilous times that require a strong and experienced commander - in - chief ; but he has chosen , as the person who may be a 72 - year - old heartbeat away from the presidency , someone who demonstrably knows very little about international affairs or the economy .
What Mrs Palin does do , as a committed pro-lifer , is to ensure that the evangelical wing of the Republican party will turn out in their multitudes .
Mr McCain has thus placed abortion , the most divisive cultural issue in America , at the centre of his campaign .
His defenders claim that it is too big an issue to be ignored , that he has always opposed abortion , that culture wars are an inevitable part of American elections , and that it was only when he appointed Mrs Palin that the American public started to listen to him .
All this is true : but the old Mr McCain , who derided the religious right as “ agents of intolerance ” , would not have stooped to that .

August 16 , 2008 -- Indonesian trade union activist and chairperson of the Deliberative Council of the National Liberation Party of Unity ( Papernas ) Dita Sari has declared that she will run for the Star Reform Party ( PBR ) in the 2009 legislative elections .
Sari and around 40 other Papernas members have declared their intention to contest the elections as part of the PBR .
Sari will occupy the number one position on the party ’s candidate list for an electoral district in Central Java that incorporates the towns of Klaten , Boyolali , Sukoharjo and the city of Solo .
According to Indo Pos , the district where Sari will run is a hotly contested area , with other candidates including Puan Maharani , daughter of former president Megawati Sukarnoputri , running for the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle ( PDI - P ) and Hidayat Nurwahid , speaker of the People ’s Consultative Assembly from the Prosperity and Justice Party ( PKS ) .
Klaten , Boyolali , Sukoharjo and Solo were strongholds of the Indonesian Communist Party ( PKI ) during the 1950s and ’60s .
It was in these areas where the worst massacres in Central Java took place in 1965 - 66 , as General Suharto seized power and physically exterminated the PKI .
Dita Sari ’s decision to run under the banner of the PBR , a party that began as an Islamic party , has created controversy .
Papernas has been targeted consistently by right - wing Islamic groups , such as the Defenders of Islam Front ( FPI ) , and dubbed the new PKI .
Some Indonesian political commentators have posed the question of how anti-communist forces will respond to this instance of left activists running inside a party that has Islamic origins .
It is understood that Papernas has been in negotiations with the PBR leadership since at least 2007 to discuss a joint platform or some form of electoral collaboration in 2009 .
PBR
The PBR began as a split from the United Development Party ( PPP ) , a party that was created out of the forced amalgamation of a number of Islamic parties in 1973 and sanctioned by the Suharto ’s New Order dictatorship .
The PPP was recognised as one of three parties , alongside Suharto ’s Golkar party and the Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) , allowed to exist and run in elections throughout the New Order period .
The key founder of PBR , Zainuddin MZ , an Islamic religious leader with a huge following , was a member of PPP until he and several others left to establish PPP Reformasi in 2002 .
PPP Reformasi was established in the aftermath of Suharto ’s 1998 overthrow , when restrictions to establish and join political parties were lifted .
Zainuddin argued that PPP Reformasi was to be “ the smiling party ” — leaving behind notions of “ political revenge and sins ” of the past and intent on reforming the political and economic system of the country .
Zainuddin explained that the party stood against corruption , in favour of justice for the poor and for “ clean ” politics .
At an extraordinary meeting of the party in 2003 , its name was changed to PBR , the Star Reform Party .
Zainuddin left the PBR last year .
Some PBR leaders , such as Bursah Zanubi , have their political origins in the Islamic Students ’ Association ( HMI ) .
Sari explained that Papernas would continue to exist and not be liquidated into PBR .
She told Indo Pos that she was not perturbed by PBR ’s Islamic origins , pointing to the aspects of the PBR program that she agreed with — for example economic independence , free from foreign domination , the abolition of the foreign debt and prioritising development of the rural economy .
She argued that Papernas had made strenuous efforts to meet the requirements to be registered as a party able to participate in the elections , however only 34 parties have successfully met all the bureaucratic requirements to run .
Deputy secretary - general of PBR ’s central leadership board , Yusuf Lakaseng , argued that there were common areas of struggle between Papernas and the PBR .
He said , “ Indeed we are opening ourselves up towards the activist currents ” .
In the 2004 elections , PBR only achieved 2.5 % of the vote but will be aiming for around 7 % in these 2009 elections .
Lakaseng is confident of achieving this target , as the party now has set up structures throughout the country , compared to four years earlier .
The party claims 780,000 members and 60,000 branches .
Youth
According to Lakaseng , himself a former member of the predominantly young People ’s Democratic Party ( PRD — the left - wing party that helped found Papernas and that Sari is also a leader of ) , the PBR is prioritising youth candidates .
The PBR is putting in place a quota system of 60 % for candidates below the age of 40 .
The party also aims to have women compose 30 % of its fielded candidates .
Chairperson Bursah Zanubi said that his party tried to embrace as many young people as possible , with 30 legislative candidates under the age of 30 and a policy of two maximum terms on the leadership board of the party .
On July 12 , Zanubi explained to Kompas that his party would focus on the issues of food and constructing an economy oriented to the needs of people and workers .
He said that the PBR would campaign through meetings , discussions and gatherings , aiming for 50 - 100 people at each event .
Sari said that no party was completely “ clean ” , but that the challenge in Indonesian electoral politics was to “ seek the best out of the worst ” .
In response to the case of PBR parliamentarian Buylan Royan , who arrested on June 30 under order of the Corruption Eradication Commission , the PBR central leadership board sacked him from the position two days later and declared its willingness to cooperate with the commission ’s investigation .
Royan was accused of receiving bribes for procurement of government patrol boats .

Previous Rantings
Here ’s a little lunch - time diversionary math .
Suppose you want a function that takes a number , and returns the average of all the numbers it ’s been called with so far .
Handy for continuously updated displays , that kind of thing .
Here ’s a method that will return this averaging function .
private static Func MakeAverager ( ) { float sum = 0 ; int count = 0 ; return delegate ( float x ) { sum += x ; count += 1 ; return sum / count ; } ; }
It creates sum and count variables for the function to close over .
The function takes a number , x , and adds it to sum .
It increments count , and divides .
Pretty standard .
Now , let ’s get crazy , and pretend this code is going on Voyager , and it ’ll be running for ever .
sum will get pretty high , right ?
We ’ll blow through 231 , the upper - bound for .
Net 32 - bit ints .
Sure , we could make it a long , and go up to 263 , but that ’s not the point .
The point is , it ’ll eventually run out , because sum is too high .
I ’ve been chewing on this brain - teaser for a while .
I knew there must be a way to calculate a long - running average without storing the sum and the count ; it seems the average so far , and the count , should be enough , but I do n’t want to resort to ( ( average * count ) + x ) / count ++ , because that ’s the exact same problem .
( Of course , count could still get so high it overflows , but that ’s somewhat less likely .
Hush , you . )
I finally sat down and figured it out .
The trick is , each successive x tugs your average up or down — first by a lot , but by less over time .
With each x , the average gets harder to move : the effect each new x has on the average is inversely proportionate to the count .
We can put it like this :
average += ( x - average ) / count
We tug average by x - average , the distance between them , scaled down by count .
Then , add that on to average ( of course , if x < average , then x – average is negative , so it ’ll tug the average down ) .
Let ’s make a new averager .
private static Func MakeNewAverager ( ) { float average = 0 ; int count = 0 ; return delegate ( float x ) { average += ( x - average ) / ++ count ; return average ; } ; }
It works the same , but it ’ll take a lot longer for count to overflow than sum .
For the record , here ’s the ruby I used to sketch this idea out .
Of course , in ruby , this problem is even more bogus , because ruby ’s Bignum can handle any number that your machine has enough free RAM to store .
But still .
def make_averager sum , count = 0 , 0 lambda { |x| sum += x count += 1 sum.to_f / count } end def make_sum_free_averager avg = 0.0 count = 0 lambda { |x| count += 1 avg += ( x - avg ) / count } end
If you think the current economic crisis is hurting only your pocketbook , think again .
Researchers say the decline of Wall Street , the mortgage crisis , and the looming threat of layoffs may take a heavy toll on your heart , especially if you are already at risk for cardiac problems .
" Financial stress can cause your whole cardiovascular system to be off , " says Louise Hawkley , PhD , associate director of the Social Neuroscience Laboratory at the University of Chicago .
" Elevated stress hormones constrict the blood vessels and create a vicious cycle where blood scrapes the cells and aggravates atherosclerotic plaque , which increases your risk for a cardiovascular event like a heart attack . "
She adds that new research suggests the social isolation of being laid off from a job can compound the problem .
One study found that older workers who lost their jobs had a two - fold increase in the risk for subsequent heart attack and stroke .
Financial stress also contributes to behavior proven to increase heart disease risk .
Smokers , for example , are 13 % less likely to quit during economic hard times , and ex-smokers are more likely to relapse .
Drinkers tend to drink more , which drives up blood pressure , and alcoholics who have quit drinking are more prone to relapse when exposed to chronic stress .
" People also eat less heart - healthy foods during times of stress — more sweets and carbohydrates , " adds Redford Williams , MD , Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Duke University .
So what can you do if the bad economy has you worried about your ticker ?
First , do n't catastrophize .
Take stock of your own situation and make sure you are not panicked about something that hasnt happened yet .
But if your situation is dire , it 's crucial not to isolate yourself .
" Sharing concerns with friends and getting some social support can make your stress hormones go down and improve your health , " says Dr. Williams , who also recommends exercise , yoga , and meditation .
Technology juggernaut Apple , Inc. reported recently that revenue for its fiscal third quarter , which ended June 27 , 2020 , totaled nearly $ 60 billion — $ 59.7 is the exact figure .
Strong earnings should come as no surprise , as the most recent iteration of MacBooks is garnering positive reviews , especially in comparison to the older Air and Pro models with their troublesome butterfly keyboards .
In addition to the laptop sector , iPads , iPhones , wearable tech such as Apple Watches , and other products and services are all performing well .
If you ’re unable to upgrade , however , you may find your aging Mac running slow .
That ’s why we ’ve compiled these tips and tricks to help boost its sluggish performance and make it feel a little more like a brand - new machine .
1. What ’s Your OS ?
One reason your Mac might be crawling when it ’s supposed to be sprinting ?
An outdated OS .
There ’s really no reason not to be using the most current operating system , since they are released regularly by Apple as free upgrades .
Each new MacOS provides enhanced performance and improved security .
2. Have You Tried Turning It …
All together now : “ … off and then back on again ? ”
At the risk of sounding like Captain Obvious , this is still a valid question to ask .
Sometimes a quick reboot is the kick - in - the - pants that your computer needs to start behaving again .
Note that we ’re talking about actually powering down , not restarting .
So go ahead and give that a whirl — bookmark this page first so you can come back to it if you need more tips on
3. Monitor Your Mac’s Activity
Knowing what is causing your Mac to run so slowly is important , since otherwise you ’ll be at a bit of a loss to help it gain speed .
Do a Spotlight search for your Activity Monitor , then sort the items by CPU % .
Watch the fluctuations for a while to get a sense of which apps are using more than their fair share .
Then you can address them one by one .
Check for upgrades ; often , an app that ’s out of date can cause the system to crawl .
You may also simply need to uninstall an app and find an alternative .
4. Chrome Could Be to Blame
When you fire up your laptop in the morning and go about your digital routine — catching up on Facebook , IG , or Twitter , checking your emails , or reading the news — what browser do you use ?
Google makes it awfully convenient for people to choose Chrome , especially if they use any other apps in the G - Suite , such as Gmail or Google Docs .
Others steer clear of it for that very reason , loathe to give Apple any more information about and control over their information and web browsing than it already has .
Regardless of whether you have welcomed our new Google overlords or are still fighting the good fight to maintain a modicum of privacy , Chrome might not be the best choice for people who are logging on with a MacBook .
Both Safari and Firefox are neck - and - neck in the competition for Best Browser , and there are several open - source options , like Opera and Brave , that are lesser known but still contenders .
Which is the right browser for you depends on your computing habits , level of concern about security and privacy , and personal preference .
It ’s worthwhile to give Chrome a break and see how another browser stacks up .
5. Editing Apps
While we ’re on the topic of how you use your Mac , remember that certain apps simply gobble up more resources and storage than others .
This is particularly true for apps and programs that allow you to edit video , audio , or images .
If you routinely use Garage Band , iMovie , Photoshop , or similar , you may just have to grin and bear it — or opt for a more powerful machine the next time you purchase a new computer .
6. Media Storage Snags
Similarly , even just storing a lot of videos , audio files , or photos on your Mac may be causing the sluggishness you see .
If you sync photos from your iPhone , the hard drive on your MacBook is going to fill up fast .
Take some time to sort through all of those old selfies and snaps of your restaurant meals and delete what you do n’t want to keep .
Then turn your attention to videos and music .
Another way to free up space is to move these items to an external hard drive or back them up to the cloud .
It ’s probably a good idea to keep copies in your possession , rather than rely solely on cloud storage , but it ’s not necessary to have them on your internal drive .
7. Win the Storage Wars
Sometimes , all your MacBook needs is a data cleanup .
The more crowded its SSD becomes , the slower it will run .
You can check out how much free space remains on your MacBook ’s drive by clicking the Apple logo in the top left , select About This Mac and then click the Storage tab .
If you are approaching maximum capacity , click the Manage button to free up some space .
Here , you ’ll see four recommendations for reclaiming free drive space .
8. Perform Some First Aid
It can be dangerous to go behind the scenes or your Mac and start poking around .
Unless you ’re a very experienced user , do n’t try to DIY your computer disk utility , clean up , or other first aid actions .
Luckily , there are tools that will take care of cleanup and maintenance chores for you .
Some of these , like Disk Utility , are built into the MacOS ; others are free to download and run .
They will clean out duplicate files , unused apps and widgets , and any other clutter that ’s impacting your computer ’s speed and performance .
9. Starting Up May Be Slowing You Down
Let ’s say you do power down occasionally , and it seems that each time you try to boot up again , it takes longer and longer for your Mac to come alive .
That may very well be due to mac startup programs .
Here ’s how to investigate these potential culprits :
Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups .
Click on the Login Items tab , which is where you ’ll find a list of all apps that automatically open at startup .
From there , it ’s an easy job to remove unnecessary ones .
Mac Running Slow ?
Do n’t Despair !
As you can see , there are plenty of tips and tricks to try before giving your current Mac the ol’ heave - ho .
There ’s a good chance you ’ll be able to speed things up without much time of effort , so you can get back to work !

Beijing
Do n't worry about the pollution , the Beijing authorities have been telling us .
Factories will shut down .
Cars will be taken off the roads .
Skies will be seeded with silver nitrate and clouds conjured away to leave the air perfect for the world 's athletes .
That 's the theory .
Happy to lay my lungs on the line in the name of unscientific research , I decide to head out into the city on a long run to test conditions first - hand .
The initial signs are disconcerting .
As I jog down the stairs and out into Monday morning , the concrete tower - blocks of the Green Homeland Media Village are shrouded in what looks like a heavy autumnal fog .
Even with the sun completely hidden away in the grey blanket up above , the heat is intense .
Traffic is roaring by on the Beiyuan Lu expressway , soldiers in pale khaki shirts and white gloves marching in rectangles around the security barriers .
I wave at a group of staring schoolkids and head south towards the Olympic Green .
Five minutes down the road , my t- shirt is already drenched , hanging heavy off my shoulders .
It 's 9am .
At this time of day , the Olympic marathon runners will still have seven or eight miles to go .
The triathletes wo n't even be starting the run leg of their races for another three hours .
I pass a woman whose mobile has an Axel F ring - tone and realise that my throat has started to feel sore , as if I had a cold coming on .
Maybe it 's the road I 'm running alongside , I think , and head down a side - street in search of a patch of greenery .
Another five minutes down the line , there 's a strange lumpy feeling halfway down my throat .
An old chap watering a freshly - planted verge hawks up a fat lump of phlegm and flobs it expertly into a plant - pot .
When in Rome , I think , and spit into the gutter with relish .
The metallic taste in my mouth remains .
It 's not easy working out where to go .
The haze obscures anything more than 100 m away .
I 've picked a bad day - today the BBC reading registers 292 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic metre ( the World Health Organisation target is 50 ) .
I 'd planned to aim for the Bird 's Nest Stadium 5 km away , but there 's as much chance of me spotting it in these conditions as there is of me doing the pole vault there in 10 days ' time .
The road stretches into the gloom , the two dedicated Olympic lanes completely empty of traffic while buses and bikes fight for position in the other lane .
" One world , one dream , " read the banners flapping from the lamp - posts .
My map shows a large park off to the left , but everywhere you look are tall fences and short officials with strict instructions to keep you out .
At the halfway stage , my eyes have started to feel gritty , as if I 'd been out all night in a club full of smokers .
Three weary - looking blokes slumped on a bench ni-hao in my direction as I rub my eyes and I ni-hao back .
The stinging in my throat gets worse as I head back north , the Bird 's Nest lost somewhere in the smog .
Towers of apartment blocks loom slowly out of the mist .
Young blokes on mountain - bikes pedal past while shouting into mobiles , which at least makes me feel more at home .
Every now and then a solitary soldier stands on a small plinth , staring into a seemingly random direction with a blank expression .
My lungs feel half their normal size .
No wonder an asthma sufferer like Haile Gebrselassie decided to sack off the Olympic marathon , even though he 's the world record holder .
The only other time my lungs have felt this bad was when I got stuck behind a brigade of belching buses while foolishly cycling down Oxford Street .
By the final few miles I 'm dragging my legs along like sandbags .
There could be several reasons for that - seven hours of jet - lag , the cannonball - like lump of egg - fried rice lodged halfway down my digestive tract , a delusional attitude towards my own fitness - but I 've also taken it incredibly easy .
How much worse would I be feeling if I 'd really opened the lungs up and got my heart - rate going ?
At the end I 'm coughing like a 20 - a - day man .
It 's like I 've borrowed the lungs of my colleague Ben Dirs - and if you 've ever seen Dirsy trying to walk up a flight of stairs , you 'd know that 's a very bad thing indeed .
In the long list of cities that you 'd never want to run in again , the competition is fierce .
Choosing between the traffic - choked hell of San Salvador or the dusty madness of Delhi , for example , is almost impossible , while a man can lose so much fluid in sweat in Kuala Lumpur that he 'll grow a beard before he visits a urinal again .
Until today , however , I 'd always considered Cairo to be out there alone at the top of the pile .
Not any more .
And when would they ever stage an Olympics in Cairo ?
Lately , I ’ve been noticing food .
Yes , but not in the usual places like the grocery store , farmer ’s markets , produce stands , et cetera .
No , I ’ve been noticing food in unusual places .
On the ground .
Under trees .
In the street .
While many people these days may think that apples , pears , plums and walnuts only come from pristine orchards in pastoral valleys , there is food among us .
Right under our noses .
And often , it ’s going to waste .
Yes .
Perfectly good food is piling up in our neighborhoods while we trot off to the Big Box Mart to fill our baskets with the very same species of fruit and nuts that have ( often ) been trucked in thousands of miles from exotic places like Australia and Chile .
You may be thinking to yourself – “ So What ?
I do n’t have an apple tree in my backyard , and my neighbor would see it as a good opportunity to unleash his rottweiler if he saw me plucking plums from the tree in his yard . ”
Maybe so .
But , then again , maybe not .
Since 2005 , some folks in Los Angeles have taken the risk and have come up with delicious results .
David Burns , Matias Viegener , and Austin Young went out into L.A. ’s streets and looked for fruit .
They found it , and started mapping the fruit they found and posting the maps on their website .
The concept is simple – the guys believe “ … that fruit is a resource that should be commonly shared , like shells from the beach or mushrooms from the forest . ”
Further , they state that “ Fallen Fruit is a mapping and manifesto for all the free fruit we can find .
Every day there is food somewhere going to waste .
We encourage you to find it , tend and harvest it .
If you own property , plant food on your perimeter .
Share with the world and the world will share with you .
Barter , do n’t buy !
Give things away !
You have nothing to lose but your hunger ! ”
Okay , okay , since this is web 2.0 , here ’s a video for those of you who do n’t like to read .
Some have taken to calling this act of snaggin free food urban harvesting .
Check out “ Urban Harvesting ” in a nutshell ( pun intended ) :
Urban harvesting - Collect and distribute local foods to local markets from Kemper Barkhurst on Vimeo .
Inspirational ?
Yes .
The Portland Fruit Tree Project , The Philadelphia Orchard Project , and Lettuce Link in Seattle are similar groups that have uncovered the fruits that lay at our feet and in our communities , going to waste .
The groups hold food processing classes , they plant trees to provide food security for urban dwellers , and drop renegade tomato plants in freeway medians for making salsa .
If you ’re in Victoria , B.C. , hit up the LifeCycles Fruit Tree Project , a group that gathered 35,000 pounds of fruit last year .
For those of you keeping score at home , that ’s around 17.5 TONS .
If it takes two pounds of apples to make one nine - inch pie , 17,500 apple pies could be made that would have otherwise decomposed at the base of the tree .
At six slices per pie , they ’ve harvested dessert for 105,000 people .
You can pick your jaw up off of the table now .
The point is , there are literally tons and tons of fruit going to waste every summer and fall , and these folks are not going to stand for it .
Should you ?
City dweller , there ’s free , local , delicious food out there that likely has n’t been treated with anything and will be there next year and for many years to come .
Oh , and it requires absolutely NO maintenance and very little effort .
So grab your ladder , talk to your neighbors , and start foraging !
There is such a thing as a free lunch , or at least a free dessert .

Advertisement A Swiss man has become the first person to fly solo across the English Channel using a single jet - propelled wing .
Yves Rossy landed safely after the 22 - mile ( 35.4 km ) flight from Calais to Dover , which had been twice postponed this week because of bad weather .
The former military pilot took less than 10 minutes to complete the crossing and parachute to the ground .
The 49 - year - old flew on a plane to more than 8,200 ft ( 2,500 m ) , ignited jets on a wing on his back , and jumped out .
Yves Rossy aimed to reach speeds of 125 mph Mr Rossy had hoped to reach speeds of 125 mph .
It felt " great , really great " , said Mr Rossy : " I only have one word , thank you , to all the people who did it with me . "
He said weather conditions on Friday had been perfect and his success signalled " big potential " for people to fly " a little bit like a bird " in the future .
Known as " Fusionman , " he was aiming to follow the route taken by French airman Louis Blériot 99 years ago when he became the first person to fly across the English Channel in a plane .
In Dover , Mr Rossy flew past South Foreland lighthouse - which the building 's manager Simon Ovenden said Blériot used as a target during his pioneering flight - and looped onlookers before landing in a field .
" It 's a remarkable achievement , we saw the climax of his attempt as he came down to earth with his parachute .
It 's been an exciting afternoon , " said Geoff Clark , a 54 - year - old spectator from Chatham , in Kent .
His quote consistently is : I 'm not worried about risk , I manage risk
Kathryn Liptrott
National Geographic Channel Mark Dale , the senior technical officer for the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association , described Rossy 's flight as a " fabulous stunt " .
In an interview earlier this week , Mr Rossy said : " If I calculate everything right , I will land in Dover .
But if I get it wrong , I take a bath . "
The flight was broadcast live for the National Geographic Channel .
Its producer , Kathryn Liptrott , told the BBC Mr Rossy was fearless .
" When we 've talked to him and asked him are you worried about risk his quote consistently is : I 'm not worried about risk , I manage risk .
" He flew Mirage fighters for the Swiss army , he now flies an Airbus .
And in his sort of heart he 's a pilot and a parachutist and what they do is manage risk . "
The longest flight he had previously taken lasted 10 minutes .
The wing had no rudder or tail fin , so Mr Rossy had to steer it using his head and back .
As well as a helmet and parachute , he wore a special suit to protect him from the four kerosene - burning turbines mounted just centimetres from him on the wing .

What are these ?
A company called Ultra Motor has released a new electric bike called the A2B .
This bike looks great – I like the functional , minimalist style .
The A2B is designed for urban or suburban commutes .
According to Ultra Motors , the A2B offers unassisted power on demand for up to 20 miles at a cruising speed of 20 mph .
At that speed it ’s still categorized as a bicycle as opposed to a scooter , moped or motorcycle .
No special license is required .
You can double the range by carrying an optional ( and more visible ) $ 399 secondary battery pack .
You can increase its carrying capacity with the addition of baskets and rear carrier bags .
The 73 - pound bike is constructed with aluminum , and it features full suspension , and a 500 - watt motor .
The lithium - ion battery is well - concealed under the down tube .
It is available at Amazon for about $ 2600 .
The CEO of Ultra Motors , Chris Deyo , says this about the A2B ’s price :
If you compare the one - time price of the A2B to the ongoing costs of commuting by car , moped or motorcycle–given the cost of gas , insurance , maintenance , parking , and parking tickets –it ’s not so steep .
“ We found , in talking to folks , that ( at ) $ 2,500 , it ’s a considered purchase , but it ’s of value to them , ” Deyo said .
Ultra Motor ’s design team is in Germany , and manufacturing is in Taiwan .
The company ’s global headquarters are in London , with the US operation is based in San Francisco , California .
Ultra Motor offers two other electric bikes , the Europa and the Portia .
The A2B is expected to be available in September , most likely from bicycle , scooter , and motorcycle dealerships .

Stewart : Hannity applies Wile E. Coyote theory of gravity to economics David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday September 19 , 2008
Print This Email This When Fox News announced that Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin 's second - ever interview would be with its own Sean Hannity , promising that " no topic is off limits " many were skeptical that the interview would involve any serious questioning .
The Daily Show's Jon Stewart , however , presented himself as willing to take Fox at its word .
" No holds barred !
Anything goes ! " he cheered .
" Let 's start with the economy !
Sean , pin her down ! "
" Has Senator Obama been using what happend on Wall Street this week ... for political gain ? "
Hannity asked Palin .
" Is there a danger if a presidential candidate is saying to the world , that America 's situation , economic crisis , is the worst we 've seen in decades .
...
Is there a danger in terms of the world 's hearing that ? "
" Sarah , " said Stewart mockingly , " answer this for me .
Should n't we be lying to the world ? "
He then suggested , " Apparently , for Sean Hannity the greatest danger of being in an economic freefall -- is acknowledging it .
It 's the Wile E. Coyote theory of gravity applied to economics . "
Hannity then suggested to Palin , " Senator Barack Obama yesterday was attacking Senator McCain for saying that the fundamentals of the economy are strong . "
" It was an unfair attack on the verbiage that Senator McCain chose to use , " Palin responded .
" He means our workforce .
He means the ingenuity of the American people .
...
That was an unfair attack there , again , based on verbiage that John McCain used . "
" Yah , Sean , I think on this election , Sean , " said Stewart , imitating Palin 's mispronunciation of " verbiage " and tangled diction , " the candidates , what they say , their verbage , um , I think that should be off limits .
You know that what we say , you know , or you should know , Sean , we do n't mean it . "
Stewart then returned to the interview and showed Hannity asking , " Why does everyone benefit if the rich pays less -- or if everybody pays less -- in taxes ?
Why is that good for the economy ? "
" I should n't have been watching this interview so late at night , " commented Stewart , " because this interview began to blend in with this other hard - hitting interview that I was watching on another channel . "
He then interspersed clips of Hannity with an informercial for a book called Debt Cures , which featured almost identical expressions of " that 's a good question , " " it 's ridiculous , " and " thank you so much . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The nation 's retailers could be in for the weakest holiday season in six years as the sluggish economy continues to squeeze household budgets , according to a trade group report issued Tuesday .
The National Retail Federation forecasts that retail sales between November and December will expand 2.2 % to $ 470.4 billion .
That 's below the ten - year average of 4.4 % and the lowest since 2002 , when sales rose 1.3 % .
" Current financial pressures and a lack of confidence in the economy will force shoppers to be very conservative with their holiday spending , " said NRF Chief Economist Rosalind Wells in a statement .
Weakness in the housing market , rising unemployment and lackluster income growth are among the challenges that consumers will face this holiday season , the NRF said .
Additionally , high energy and food costs will continue pinch American consumers .
And the crisis in the nation 's financial system will erode consumer confidence in the months ahead .
" We expect consumers to be frugal this season and less willing to splurge on discretionary items , " Well said .
Given the current outlook , the NRF does not expect the economy to rebound until the second half of next year .
Last year 's holiday sales rose 3 % ( correct ) , driven largely by gains in the consumer electronics market , NRF said .
The forecast was for a 4 % increase .

An earlier version of this story erroneously reported last year 's sales gain .

FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
Yet another sign that Hillary Clinton is doing her dead - level best to take title to the Democratic National Convention .
In addition to the laundry list of concessions she has already wrung out of Barack Obama , Bill and Hillary Clinton plan to use the convention to raise money to pay off more of her campaign debt from the primaries .
Hillary Clinton has announced she will award one lucky donor a trip to the convention – with her .
And in case that 's not incentive enough , Bill Clinton sent an e-mail to potential contributors promising a memorable week with his wife .
Watch : Cafferty : Clinton in debt ?
" You 'll get to see Hillary speak on Tuesday , and Barack Obama – the next president of the United States – on Thursday .
And I hear Hillary and you will have a chat – I 'll make sure to stop by . "
Makes you want to borrow against your house .
I mentioned Hillary Clinton 's doing her best to take title to the convention ?
Clinton will have her name placed into nomination and there will be a roll call vote .
She gets her own prime - time speaking slot .
She will be introduced by her daughter , Chelsea .
The video preceding her will be produced by her own production company – the same bunch that did the " Man From Hope , " for Bill Clinton .
Oh , and he 's going to speak too .
All this for the loser in the race .
The clock is ticking when it comes to Clinton 's debt .
According to campaign finance rules , candidates only have 20 days after the convention ends to fund - raise for their personal loans .
So if you see Senator Clinton out in front of the convention hall with a cup of pencils , buy one .
She needs the money .
Here ’s my question to you :
Is the Democratic Convention the appropriate place for Hillary Clinton to raise money to pay off her campaign debt ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Jessica from Springfield , IL writes :
NO !
Not appropriate .
If she had gracefully " suspended " her run when WE all knew she could n't win , she would n't BE $ 20 M in debt !!
This is Obama 's time , also historical ; she needs to BUTT OUT !!
Larry from Scappoose Oregon writes :
I guess the media is so desperate for a story you are talking about Hillary fund - raising at the convention .
To me it just does n't matter , as long as she does n't make a fool of herself on the stage during the speech , it just does n't matter .
There are so many important issues that we could be discussing .
Chad from Los Angeles writes :
I voted for her , but now starting to feel a little embarrassed for her and how desperate she appears now .
All this just to pay off a debt that she will make up with her next book , or Bill ’s next guest speaking tour .
Karen from Houston
Texas writes :
What difference does it make what we think ?
Obviously the only thing that matters is what Hillary , Bill and her PUMA supporters think .
At least that 's what the media and she and her supporters keep telling everyone .
I will be so glad when this election process is over and I do n't have to see or hear the Clintons again .
Nicole from Virgin Islands writes :
Hell to the no !
Let her 18,000,000 supporters retire her debt .
J. writes :
It is in poor form and inappropriate , but I 've got an idea , Jack .
Why does n't Hillary just charge large amounts of money for people to overnight in her home ?
That worked when she and Bill lived in the White House , it should work in New York , too .
Ed from Florida writes :
Jack ,
Who are you going to pick on after the convention ?
Why did the bailout plan fail ?
Because it was n't a good plan .
It also stood to benefit Wall Street at the expense of the taxpayer , which was understandably a non-starter for much of the country .
Fortunately , there is another option that 1 ) will be more effective , and 2 ) wo n't piss off the 295 + million Americans who do n't work in the financial services industry .
Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke : Please confirm that you have reviewed this option .
If you 're not going to pursue it , please explain why not , so we wo n't be forced to include that you really do care a lot more about Wall Street than the rest of the country .
As we and others have explained , the only way the previous bailout plan would have worked is if the Treasury intentionally paid more for banks ' trash assets than they were worth .
This would have allowed the Treasury to secretly re-capitalize the banks ( by replacing the garbage with a greater amount of cash , thus strengthening the bank 's capital ratio ) .
If you want a very simple , clear explanation of this -- and why the Paulson / Bernanke plan was flawed -- please read this excellent essay by fund manager John Hussman .
And now for the better plan .
Again , John Hussman :
A better approach would be for the government to provide capital directly , in the form of a “ super - bond , ” in an amount no greater than the debt to bondholders .
The “ super - bond ” would be subordinate to customer liabilities , so it could be counted as capital for the purpose of capital requirements , and would be seen by customers as a legitimate cushion of protection .
However , in the event of bankruptcy , it would have a senior claim in front of both stockholders and even senior bondholders .
Do that , and you 've actually got a mechanism to protect the financial system while at the same time protecting customers and taxpayers .
Ideally , the super - bond accrues a relatively high rate of interest so that financials have an incentive to shift to private financing as soon as possible , but you would also defer the interest until the bank meets a minimal level of profitability to make sure that the financing does n't strain the institution 's liquidity .
To this we would only add : Make the superbond convertible into stock -- or include warrants as in the case with AIG -- in the event the company survives .
This way , the government ( and taxpayers ) will get paid for their trouble and offset the many cases in which the banks go bankrupt .
Why is this a better plan ?
It makes the banks deal with their own problems .
If they can't , so be it .
Their shareholders and bondholders suffer , but their customers do n't .
It is eliminates the need for the government to hire fund managers to manage a portfolio of crap assets .
It does n't bail out banks , stockholders , or bondholders ( none of which deserve a bailout ) .
It protects the financial system : good banks survive , bad banks do n't
It eliminates the massive conflict of the original plan : pay too much for the crap assets , hose the taxpayer ; pay too little , hose the banks .
Bondholders are exposed to risk , but not likely wipeout :
Thus , the ripple effects that killed the credit markets after the Lehman bankruptcy wo n't likely happen .
It does n't involve the absurd suggestion that we abandon mark - to - market accounting ( as if denial is a better option ) .
Hank and Ben , this plan just makes too much sense not to pursue .
Now that Congress has given you the ability to go back to the drawing board , can you consider proposing it ?
If not , can you please explain why on earth not ?

Treasury : We Have n't Faintest Idea What To Do Now , But We 're Going To Do It
In a basement conference room at the Codman Square Health Center yesterday morning , Lew Finfer did what he 's been doing for almost four decades : community organizing .
This time that meant leading a meeting of 20 representatives of grass - roots and nonprofit organizations from Dorchester and Mattapan to mobilize city residents against a ballot question that would abolish the state 's personal income tax .
Finfer 's profession took center stage at the Republican convention in St. Paul this week when Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , the vice presidential nominee , and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani mocked Democrat Barack Obama 's experience as a community organizer in Chicago .
" Community organizer , " Guiliani shrugged .
" What ? "
Palin likened her former job as mayor of an Anchorage suburb to being " sort of like a ' community organizer , ' except that you have actual responsibilities . "
With that , Palin and Giuliani ridiculed a tradition whose roots in this country reach back to the Boston Tea Party and organizers ' successful efforts to persuade colonists to boycott tea to protest taxation without representation .
ACORN , a nationwide network of community organizations , issued a statement condemning the GOP 's " condescending remarks . "
Anti-Palin T - shirts emblazoned with " Jesus was a community organizer ; Pontius Pilate was a governor " appeared for sale online almost immediately .
Community organizers in Boston and beyond have taken offense at the barbs from St. Paul .
" You get angry that somebody is disrespectful of what you 've done all your life , " said Finfer , director of the Massachusetts Community Action Network .
" Community organizing is what the civil rights movement was .
The key people were community organizers who worked for Martin Luther King Jr. and with him .
Sarah Palin held up that her husband was a union member .
Unions have organizers . "
" Without organizers things do n't happen , " said Marvin Martin , 54 , director of Dorchester 's Greater Four Corners Action Coalition .
" Ideas often come from the community .
People who organize bring ideas to the legislators and work with them to pass it .
If they do n't understand that , I 'm concerned with how they make decisions . "
Marshall Ganz , a lecturer at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government , sees an irony in Palin 's remark .
" The very politics that Palin and McCain have rooted their appeal in are the result of a social movement on the right , the conservative movement , which was organized by organizers , too , " he said .
For Finfer , 57 , the comments conjured memories .
In 1991 a former intern recommended that Finfer recruit a Harvard Law School classmate who had been a community organizer in Chicago .
The classmate 's name was Barack Obama .
The young law student came for an interview .
" He said , ' I learned a lot about organizing , but I 'm interested in going back to Chicago and getting into politics , ' " Finfer said .

Is McCain open to reenacting the draft ?
At a town - hall event in New Mexico today , John McCain was asked about veterans ’ care , but the questioner added a provocative point at the end of her question .
Take a look :
For those of you who ca n’t watch clips online , a woman in the audience told the presumptive Republican nominee , “ Senator McCain I truly hope you get the opportunity to chase Bin Laden right to the gates of hell and push him in as you stated on your forum .
I do have a question though .
Disabled veterans , especially in this state , have horrible conditions … .
I think it is a sad state of affairs when we have illegal aliens having a Medicaid card that can access specialist top physicians , the best of medical and our vets ca n’t even get to a doctor .
These are the people that we tied yellow ribbons for and Bush patted on the back .
If we do n’t reenact the draft I do n’t think we will have anyone to chase Bin Laden to the gates of hell . ”
McCain , without hesitation , responded , “ Ma’am , let me say that I do n’t disagree with anything you said and thank you and I am grateful for your support of all of our veterans . ”
Now , it ’s likely McCain was just being polite .
But the woman who spoke at the event insisted we have to “ reenact the draft , ” and McCain said he did n’t disagree with anything she said .
And that is bound to cause some headaches for the McCain campaign .
Frankly , I find it unlikely that McCain would ever seriously propose reenacting the draft , but he has said a few things on the subject that have raised eyebrows .
A year ago , for example , McCain told a New Hampshire audience , “ I might consider [ a draft ] , I do n’t think it ’s necessary , but I might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve . ”
VoteVets.org pounced this afternoon .
Jon Soltz , Iraq War Veteran and Chairman of VoteVets.org said , “ At least Senator McCain is being honest .
A vote for him is a vote for the draft .
Period .
Unless Senator McCain radically changes his worldview , there would be a draft to implement his plans . ”
Soltz added , “ When you take into account his indefinite military commitment to Iraq , his desire to send more troops to Afghanistan , record lows in recruiting and retention , and possibly more wars he is looking to get into , like “ Bomb Bomb Bomb ” Iran , his numbers do n’t add up without a draft .
Whether America likes it or not is n’t relevant — a draft is the only way to do everything Senator McCain wants to do .
I give him points for being honest and upfront , though , that we ’re going to need a draft if he is elected . ”
I ’m not sure if I agree with every word of this —
I suspect McCain would be content stretching our military even further , and extending tours of duty to ridiculous lengths — but with his comments in New Mexico today , McCain has opened the door .
This is Ronak Singhal , he works for Intel , say hello :
He ’s kind of focused on the person speaking in this situation , but trust me , he ’s a nice guy .
He also happens to be the lead architect on Nehalem .
Nehalem of course is the latest microarchitecture from Intel , it ’s a “ tock ” if you ’re going by Intel ’s tick - tock cadence :
It ’s a new architecture , at least newer than Penryn , but still built on the same 45 nm process that debuted with Penryn .
Next year we ’ll have the 32nm version of Nehalem called Westmere and then Sandy Bridge , a brand new architecture also built on 32nm .
But today is all about Nehalem .
Recently Intel announced Nehalem ’s branding : the Intel Core i7 microprocessor .
I ’ve asked Intel why it ’s called this and so far the best response I can get is that the naming will make sense once the rest of the lineup is announced .
Intel would n’t even let me know what the model numbers are going to look like , so for now all we ’ve got is that it ’s called the Core i7 .
I ’ll use that and Nehalem interchangeably throughout the course of this article .
Well before Abu Ghraib suddenly burned itself into the American conscience , Chalmers Johnson was an in - demand lecturer .
For years he has been telling horrified audiences that their country now runs a world empire based on over 700 overseas military bases , a global gulag of prisons for " illegal combatants , " and host of agencies that ignore Americans ' rights .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
When his listeners ask what they can do about it , Johnson has a simple reply : Buy a condo in Vancouver .
" My wife says I should n't end my lectures like that , " he told me in a recent interview .
But at this late date he does n't see much hope for restoring American democratic values and institutions .
Johnson 's latest book is The Sorrows of Empire : Militarism , Secrecy , and the End of the Republic .
At first glance it looks like other anti-Bush best - sellers .
Against All Enemies , Plan of Attack , Worse Than Watergate , Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them , House of Bush , House of Saud - - the books pour off the presses , meeting a seemingly insatiable demand .
Almost unanimously , they see Bush as an aberration , an awful stumble away from real American values .
Chalmers Johnson takes a wider view , and sees Bush as the natural heir of a century of American imperial expansion .
A naval officer in the Korean War , then a scholar of international relations , Johnson at 72 has become an American Tacitus .
In The Sorrows of Empire , like the Roman historian Tacitus , he describes the wasteland imperialists call peace .
Goes back to 1898
Johnson sees the roots of U.S. militarism in the Spanish - American War of 1898 , but it did not flower until after World War II and the onset of the Cold War .
The Soviet threat provided good grounds for a huge standing army , for overseas bases , and for budgets that could pay for them .
But the Soviet collapse between 1989 and 1991 did not lead to a shrinkage in American military power .
On the contrary , the U.S. under Clinton and then Bush scrambled to spend more and to establish yet more bases in regions like Central Asia .
Over 700 U.S. bases now ring the globe , permitting it to project power anywhere on earth .
Unlike earlier empires , this one does n't trouble to found colonies or impose its own bureaucracy on the natives .
Instead its bases are little military suburbias plunked down in Qatar and Uzbekistan .
Okinawa has been more or less the property of the U.S. Marine Corps for almost 60 years .
Ostensibly all these bases are to protect American interests ; in reality , argues Chalmers , their presence actually harms American interests , ensuring that the locals hate both the U.S. and their own governments .
The governments in turn protect themselves against their own people by purchasing billions of dollars ' worth of American weapons .
The eastward expansion of NATO has required its new members to re-equip themselves with U.S. - made weapons as well .
Four sorrows of empire
In 300 well - documented pages , Johnson makes a concise and very well - written historical case for American imperialism right up to the early days of the Iraq War .
It 's a depressing but illuminating book .
And what exactly are the sorrows of empire ?
Johnson names four : perpetual war , the loss of democracy and rights , the supremacy of propaganda and disinformation , and financial ruin .
When I asked him which of these was the least discussed , he replied instantly : " The erosion of the Constitution .
The overbalancing of the imperial presidency has created a loss of democracy and rights .
The political system does n't offer a solution . "
He cited James Madison 's comment that the most important power in the Constitution is the right of Congress alone to decide when to go to war .
That power has now been handed over to the executive .
And what is the most advanced sorrow of empire ?
" That 's a hard call , " Johnson said .
" A public that 's uninterested in our clandestine activities deserves what it gets .
But even if the public is indifferent to perpetual war and public lying , bankruptcy will cause a crisis . "
He estimated the U.S. is currently spending the unimaginable sum of $ 750 billion a year on " defense " -- not only regular military spending , but also the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and unknown billions for intelligence activities .
" Forty percent of the defense budget is secret , " he said , " and 100 percent of the intelligence budget .
" But it 's not being paid , " he went on .
" It 's being borrowed from East Asia .
If they decide to go to the euro instead of the dollar , we get the end of the empire , and of course a worldwide howling recession .
Even conservatives like the Heritage Foundation now say Bush is the most fiscally irresponsible president in history . "
' Purpose is to mobilize '
Johnson says the reviews of his book in the New York Times and Washington Post were " decidedly cool , " with no analysis of the militarism question .
He 's seen little hard criticism of his arguments , " just shock and dismay . "
But when he appeared on C - SPAN , sales of his book on Amazon carried it to the number 6 position , and almost 50,000 copies are now in print .
" I 'm not doing it for the money , " he told me .
" My purpose is to mobilize citizens , to alert them to what they 're about to lose . "
The Sorrows of Empire makes it very clear that no political group in the U.S. advocates an end to the empire ; the debate is only about whether to rule the world politely or not .
About the best hope Chalmers Johnson offers is that empires ' shelf lives are getting shorter .
" It took Rome 300 years to fall , " he says .
" The Soviet Union collapsed in three years .
The American empire could fall even faster . "
In which case , should Americans follow Chalmers ' advice , the B.C. real estate market for foreigners would get even hotter .
Crawford Kilian , a frequent contributor to The Tyee , has taught at Capilano College in North Vancouver since 1968 .
" Both the LHC and the Space program are vital if the human race is not to stultify and eventually die out .
Together they cost less than one tenth of a per cent of world GDP .
If the human race can not afford this , then it does n't deserve the epithet ' human ' . "
Everyone has heard of a variation of the poodle in the microwave story … you know the one where the old lady dries her poodle in the microwave then sues the microwave manufacturer for not putting this warning on the product .

Well even though this is an urban legend that has it ’s roots way before microwaves existed , it ’s popularity is surely partly responsible for the utterly ridiculous warning messages that manufacturers often apply to their products .
I once heard that a pack of peanuts had a warning about the product containing nuts !
I do n’t think this is true but some of the examples below are almost as bad .

開発したRRAM素子の透過型電子顕微鏡写真
独立行政法人・産業技術総合研究所は9月25日、シャープと共同で「RRAM」（Resistance RAM：抵抗変化メモリ）の開発に成功したと発表した。電源を切っても記憶を保持できる不揮発性ながら、既存のNOR型フラッシュメモリと比べ1000分の1の低消費電力化が可能という。
RRAMは、金属電極で挟んだ遷移金属酸化膜の電気抵抗変化を記憶情報とするメモリ素子。不揮発性で低消費電力・高速動作が特徴だが、抵抗変化を定量的に制御する方法が開発できていないのが現状だ。
産総研とシャープは2006年、RRAM素子をMRAM並みの書き換え時間（10ナノ秒程度）に高速化することに成功していた。今回開発したRRAM素子は、タンタル電極とコバルト酸化物による単純な金属・酸化物接合が基本構造。接合界面のナノレベルの電気化学反応を定量的に制御することで、メモリ動作を高性能化したという。
貴金属を使わずに安定したメモリ動作が可能な上、現行プロセスとの整合性が高いため、ビットコスト競争力にも優れているとしている。今後、集積化と量産化に向けた技術開発を進める。

In the sandbox
Since its release a few weeks ago , curious developers have been sniffing through the source code for Google 's new Chrome web browser .
Chrome 's source is interesting for a variety of reasons : there 's the new V8 JavaScript virtual machine with its boasts of near - native code performance , the WebKit rendering engine that does all the hard work of understanding and displaying web pages , and ( last but not least ) , Chrome 's secure sandbox designed to minimize the impact of any security flaws that might exist in both the browser and plugins alike .
It is this secure sandbox that has piqued the curiosity of some observers , and for a reason that many may find surprising .
From reading the source , it looks as though Google has reverse - engineered Windows , and that 's explicitly prohibited by the Windows EULA .
But before looking at the question of disassembly , it 's worth taking a look at how Chrome is put together and at why its security architecture is interesting .
Chrome 's security architecture
Of all the things that Chrome brings to the web browser market , its security architecture is the most unusual and significant .
Traditional browsers ( Firefox , Internet Explorer 7 and below , Opera , Safari ) all create a single process for doing everything — displaying the user - interface , connecting to the Internet , parsing HTML , running plugins — and they share this process across all the tabs within the browser .
This one - process - for - everything model has a number of repercussions , the most obvious and most frustrating of which is that a crash in one tab ( perhaps due to a bug with the browser 's rendering engine itself , or perhaps due to a plugin ) will crash the entire process , taking out all the tabs and destroying any work that the user is doing in an open tab .
This architecture also has a number of other undesirable aspects that are less obvious .
There 's no particular reason that the " risky " pieces of code ( the parts that have to deal with potentially malicious web pages or run plugins ) should be able to read or write to the filesystem , for example ; no reason , except that since some parts of the browser must be able to do so ( to save downloaded files , say ) , the single - process model means that all parts of the browser can do so .
Redmond led the way
Windows Vista and Internet Explorer 7 have actually beat Google to the punch in making the first small step away from this single - process model .
Internet Explorer has long had the concept of " security zones , " which allow different security options to be applied to a local corporate intranet than to the global Internet .
One long - standing source of bugs within Internet Explorer has been that a malicious web page can trick the browser into treating a web page from one zone as if it came from another ( more privileged ) zone .
To address this vulnerability , Vista 's IE7 prohibits the mixing of security zones within the same process .
A browser open at the " Internet Zone " cannot then be used to open a page from the " Intranet Zone " ; instead , a whole new iexplore .
exe process is created , and the two are kept separate .
Internet Explorer 8 , released as beta earlier this year , has moved even further from the monolithic model .
Rather than one process per security zone , IE8 uses one process per tab , along with a parent process to control the user interface .
This provides the separation that IE7 on Vista already had , plus a great deal more .
With IE8 , even tabs within the same security zone are independent and isolated from each other .
This architecture also resolves the aforementioned long - standing problem with tabs , i.e. , that one crashing tab destroys the entire browsing session .
With IE8 , one tab can crash and other tabs are unaffected .
IE8 and Data Execution Prevention ( DEP )
The other major security feature of IE8 is its support for Data Execution Prevention ( DEP ) , which is a feature designed to prevent buffer overflows from being able to inject executable code into a process .
Traditionally on x86 processors , memory could be marked as readable - and - executable and / or writable ; if memory was readable it could also be executed .
This leads to exploitation through buffer overflows ; a program allocates a temporary storage space ( which must be both readable and writable so that the program can store some information and later read back that information ) , and a malicious attacker conspires to place a small piece of executable code into the storage space .
With DEP , readable and executable are no longer conflated ; a piece of memory can be marked as readable and writable , but not executable .
This provides an impediment to those wishing to overflow buffers for nefarious purposes .
Unfortunately , there can be legitimate reasons to have memory that is readable , writable , and executable .
One of these is just - in - time compilers , the kind of thing used by Java and .NET .
These programs emit executable instructions at run-time , so they necessarily must be able to allocate memory that is writable , fill it with instructions , and then mark it as executable .
Although x86 has only recently supported independent settings of read , write , and execute permissions , the Win32 API has always supported the manipulation of these settings .
Conscientious developers will have performed the correct manipulations even when it was n't strictly necessary , to provide support both for non-x86 systems and for a future world ( the one we now live in ) where even x86 supports independent read and execute permission .
Lazy developers , however , just blindly assumed that writable memory would be executable and so did not perform any of the permission setting that they now need with DEP .
The result is that some older Windows programs crash when used with DEP , including a variety of ActiveX browser plugins .
To provide compatibility with these plugins , IE7 by default opted out of using DEP .
In the time since IE7's release , some of the more important plugins have been updated to be compatible with DEP , and so IE8 now defaults to using DEP .
Which brings us neatly to Chrome .
Just as with IE8 , Chrome creates a process per tab .
In fact , Chrome goes further in that it creates a process for each plugin , too .
And just as with IE8 , Chrome enables DEP for all its processes .
It 's this latter decision that has raised some eyebrows .
The Palin- mania that is sweeping the GOP reminds me of the publicity surrounding “ American Idol , ” the popular American television program that catapults complete unknowns on to the national stage and gives them a chance at stardom : the anticipation , the gossip , the frenzy ( and partisanship ) of the fans .
In the last days of the old Republic , this is what American politics has degenerated into : “ reality ” TV .
Prior to being plucked from obscurity by the neocons who run the McCain campaign , Sarah Palin was a complete unknown .
Today , she is the object of a burgeoning cult that proclaims her to be the virtual incarnation of the Republican renewal .
And never did a party require renewal like the GOP .
What with G.W. Bush ’s bottom - of - the - barrel poll numbers , after eight years of nightmarish mismanagement on the home front and frenzied recklessness abroad , dispirited conservative intellectuals and activists have been asking themselves “ What went wrong ? ”
Now , they do n’t have to bother with such worrisome introspection , their identity crisis has been indefinitely delayed , all due to the appearance of a messiah on the horizon 
Sarah , the new Wonder Woman of the Right .
So where did she come from , and why has such an obscure figure  formerly mayor of a small town in Alaska , and only lately elevated to the governorship  been raised up so quickly , and mysteriously , like Venus sprung from the sea -foam ?
McCain really wanted Joe Lieberman , the last surviving member of the Scoop Jackson wing of the Democratic party , whose neoconservative credentials , electoral appeal in certain key areas , and ability to provoke the Obama - crats made him the natural choice .
Karl Rove , however , is too smart for that : he knew there would be a floor fight over it , and the McCainiac - neocon faction could very well lose  torpedoing the campaign before it got out of the harbor .
How they prevailed on the headstrong McCain to back off is not known : perhaps the candidate suffered a sudden spasm of common sense , or even diplomacy .
He did back off , however , and then they were left with  nothing .
Romney , Pawlenty , or some other boring white guy was n’t good enough for the McCainiac high command : no , they wanted something more .
They knew they had to secure the base , while retaining the cross-party ideological punch Lieberman would have delivered .
Their task was to capture the Clinton Democrats , who , prior to Hillary ’s late conversion to the antiwar cause , were defined ideologically by their more cautious , and even hawkish , approach to the Iraq war issue .
Obama staked his claim to the antiwar franchise early on , and Hillary ’s refusal to second - guess or apologize for her “ yes ” vote in the Senate on the war question cost her the nomination .
By the time she got on board the get - out - of - Iraq train , it had already left the station .
The Democrats promised “ change ” in the foreign policy realm in the 2006 congressional election : they won , but did n’t deliver .
Obama reminded Democratic voters of that promise : whether he ’ll keep it , if elected , is another question altogether .
Yet there are still all those Clinton voters out there , who were n’t put off by her unapologetic stance on the war , or her more bellicose statements on Iran : these are the old Reagan Democrats , whom the neocons regard as their natural constituency .
Hillary ’s butch persona , especially during the latter days of her doomed campaign , when she became a veritable street - fightin ’ gal , is another major theme the McCainiacs latched onto .
By some alchemy of ideology and identity politics , the grand strategists of the McCain campaign came up with a formula and then looked around for someone who fit the bill .
McCain and his top advisors are ideologues who care about one thing and one thing only : war .
The glory of it , the utility of it , the necessity of it .
It ’s the McCain panacea , like “ free silver ” was to William Jennings Bryan and socialism was to Eugene Debs .
It ’s his answer to everything : it solves all problems , and , more importantly , stifles all criticism .
If you doubt his veracity , question his good intentions , or point out his inconsistencies , you ’re attacking a war hero , doubting the divine wisdom suffering is supposed to impart .
Religion also played an important role in the choice of Palin : she ’s a member of a dispensationalist sect , within the Pentecostalist tradition , a “ born again ” Christian who believes in the Rapture and the centrality of Israel in world affairs .
This latter belief is a theological verity with the dispensationalists , who make up the rank - and - file of the GOP ’s electoral machine : after the Rapture , when the anointed are raised up to heaven and the rest of us are left on earth , the church will be represented by the Chosen People of God  the Jews .
According to the biblical prophecy , they will gather together in the land of Israel , their historic home , and this signals the coming of the End Times .
Israel , for the dispensationalists , is the key issue : its interests must be defended at all costs , even above the national interests of the US .
Israel is , in short , a non-negotiable item , and it ’s easy to see how this fits very neatly into the neoconservative agenda .
According to news reports , Palin was diverted away from a fundraiser for a pro-life group headed up by Phyllis Schlafly so she could attend a grilling session conducted jointly by AIPAC and Lieberman , but this hardly seemed necessary .
After all , the woman has a little Israeli flag in her office .
I ’m sure , however , her interrogators gave her a few useful pointers .
Maybe they asked her about that pastor who came to her church and delivered a sermon explaining that Jews were doomed to suffer eternally from terrorist attacks in Israel until and unless they accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior .
Yes , the lady has her own Jeremiah Wright .
As Rachel Maddow remarked the other day  in between bouts of panicky hysteria over Palin ’s instant stardom  the parallels between Palin and Obama are pretty striking .
The McCainiacs chose Palin out of jealousy : they wanted an Obama of their own , and since they could n’t have one , they settled on Palin  the Bizarro Obama .
Yes , she ’s fresh , new , a self - anointed outsider in this Year of the Maverick  but she ’s the complete opposite of Obama in every other imaginable way .
She ’s aggressive , even a bit snarly , while he ’s soft - spoken and calm , a reversal of gender roles well - suited to Bizarro World  albeit one the writers for Superman Comics in the late - fifties and early sixties never imagined .
Oh , the irony !
A campaign that put out a television ad comparing Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton has now created a celebrity candidate of its own : Sarah Palin , the Caribou - hunting tough - talking feisty little lady from Alaska , with the showgirl legs and the spine of steel .
The Brits are already likening her to Maggie Thatcher .
Sarah , who looks  and acts  an awful lot like Xena , the Warrior Princess , is the perfect messenger for the GOP ’s credo of unmitigated militarism .
Her speech to the Republican convention was , in large part , a continuation of the theme of the previous night : aggressive nationalism rationalized by religious fervor .
The references to God were interspersed with worshipful references to all things military along with a full catalogue of all the current neocon targets : not only Iraq , but Iran , Russia , and “ dangerous enemies ” who are oil - rich ( the Saudis ? ) .
The anti-Russian trope has been taken up with special alacrity by the McCainiacs , who are touting Palin ’s position as commander - in - chief of the Alaska National Guard and her proximity to the Russkies to highlight her readiness to take the helm in the Situation Room .
I would n’t be too surprised to hear tales of Commander Palin ’s derring do when confronted with previously unreported Russian incursions across the Bering Strait .
The Palin choice is really all about the internal politics of the GOP , as much as it is about the hubris of McCain ’s handlers .
With the party led over the cliff by the neocons , whose Iraq adventure has cost them control of Congress and likely the White House , it was necessary to start anew .
By reaching back into the party grassroots , and playing the gender card , the neocons could retain control of the GOP instead of being blamed for its demise  and , perhaps , hold on to the White House .
It ’s a big gamble , because Palin ’s unreadiness to be President , in the event of McCain ’s untimely demise , is all too apparent .
Far from injecting a youthful note into the campaign , Palin ’s physical presence next to the Old Man only underscores his advanced age  and the prospect of President Palin staring us in the face .
If that does n’t scare voters , then nothing will .
Palin ’s role is the traditional one assigned to the vice president , as candidate and office - holder : she is the attack dog , in what will be a campaign very much concerned with foreign policy issues .
Expect her to be the point - woman on the alleged threat represented by Russia : after all , it was n’t so long ago that the Alaskans suffered under the Czars ’ yoke , and , to add insult to injury , were sold to the Americans for a truly paltry sum .
If I were an Alaskan , I ’d resent that , and there ’s evidence Palin did , too : at least that ’s one explanation for her flirtation with the Alaska Independence Party , which advocates secession from the US .
But her secessionist days are over , I believe : in the future she ’ll be attacking the secessionist Ossetians as Russian agents - of - influence and defending US intervention there , as in Iraq , as a mission divinely ordained .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Check out my ruminations on the GOP national convention in The American Conservative blog , here .
This is what happens when campaigns let reporters into photo ops .
They get all uppity and ask questions .
From the pool report account of what happened after McCain and Palin 's meeting with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvilli and Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko :
McCain then looked around the room and gestured as if to welcome questions .
The AP reporter shouted a question at Gov. Palin ( “ Governor , what have you learned from your meetings ? ” ) but McCain aide Brooke Buchanan intervened and shepherded everybody out of the room .
Palin looked surprised , leaned over to McCain and asked him a question , to which your pooler thinks he shook his head as if to say “ No . ”

Surprising no one , the cyclist who was captured on videotape being violently slammed off his bike by a rookie cop during a July Critical Mass ride plans to sue the city .
In his first interview , Christopher Long also tells Chelsea Now that after Officer Patrick Pogan knocked him to the curb , he stood over Long and asked , " Do you wanna try that again ? "
Long also says he thinks Pogan " is going to be a scapegoat in this situation because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time ... I think that the department really helped him do what he did , because he felt safe to act that way .
He felt entitled to act that way .
That ’s the department , culturally .
The department set him up for failure .
He committed a crime , he assaulted me .
He did n’t do that by himself . "
Long spent 27 hours in the Tombs after his arrest and was charged with attempted assault , resisting arrest and disorderly conduct .
The D.A. finally dropped the charges earlier this month ; Pogan is still under investigation .
Inspired by : reading Naomi Klein ’s The Shock Doctrine this week alongside Ludwig von Mises ’s The Anti-Captialistic Mentality .
Addendum ( 7/28 ) : Here ’s my review of The Shock Doctrine .
If you want to know what I thought of the book , you should probably just read the review and ignore the dumb fable that follows .
I tried unplugging the router and plugging it back in , messing around with my DHCP settings — everything I could think of .
Still no Internet .
Hours passed , then a day .
In desperation , I finally called the tech support number for my Internet service provider , Laissez - Faire Solutions .
After putting me hold for an hour with Brahms and Beethoven , “ Ayn ” finally picked up the phone .
” I do n’t know what to tell you , ” she said curtly , after I ’d explained the situation .
“ Your connection ought to be working perfectly . ”
“ But it is n’t . ”
“ It ought to be . ”
“ But it is n’t !
Look , is n’t it possible that there ’s some failure on your end ? ”
“ You do n’t understand , sir .
There can be no such thing as a failure on our end .
If a failure exists , then it must by definition be on your end and your end alone .
What is provided to your home qua home is Internet access qua Internet access .
It follows , then , as surely as A is A , that either your router is not configured properly , or your cable is disconnected , or in some other way your own stupidity or incompetence have prevented you from getting online , a failure you now seek absurdly to blame on the Internet itself . ”
“ I ’m not blaming anything on the Internet .
I ’m blaming it on you , my ISP . ”
“ Let me ask you something , ” said Ayn .
“ Did anyone hold you at gunpoint , or otherwise coerce you to sign up for Internet service with us ? ”
“ Well , I guess not … ”
“ Then what exactly is your complaint ? ”
“ That the service you agreed to provide is n’t working . ”
“ As I explained previously , it is working , by definition .
If for some fanciful reason you think otherwise , obviously you have the freedom of switching providers . ”
“ But all the others suck as much as you do . ”
“ That is not possible .
Were it the case that every Internet provider sucked , a provider that did n’t suck would have arisen and driven all the others out of business .
The market abhors a vacuum . ”
“ Yeah , I ’ve been waiting more than a decade for this particular vacuum to be filled .
Until it happens , what else would you suggest I do ? ”
“ Did you try going to Google again ? ”
“ I ’m still getting a ‘ Page Not Found ’ error . ”
Frustrated , I decided to call the Tech - support Cooperative of the People ’s International Proletariat ( TCPIP ) .
Karl picked up the phone .
As I related my conversation with Ayn , Karl doubled over with laughter .
“ You mean you actually believe they want it to work ? ”
“ Who exactly is the ‘ they ’ we ’re talking about ? ”
“ All of them — the service providers , the government , even the academics who designed the Internet in the first place .
We ’ve amassed mountains of evidence that they ’re all conspiring to keep the Internet broken , in order to force people like you to sign up for expensive , exploitative ‘ solutions ’ — solutions no one would ever agree to under normal circumstances !
Wo n’t you join us this weekend ?
We ’re going to carouse around some rich neighborhoods and slice their fiber - optic cables .
Maybe the fatcats will finally get it , once their precious Internet connections work exactly as well as ours do … ”
“ To be honest , I really just wanted to check my email and blog comments . ”
“ This is not about the individual ; it ’s about the community !
There can be no truly reliable connections until the Internet as a whole has been demolished and rebuilt from scratch , until we ’ve established a new social order on this planet where everyone is responsible for everyone else being able to get online … ”
“ Until the millennium comes , can you put me in touch with someone who specializes in fixing Internet connections now ? ”
“ Traitors !
Do n’t you see Internet access has to get much , much worse before it can get better ?
That fixing your connection would just be a ruse to lull you into complacency and dim your justified anger ? ”
So what did I end up doing ?
Well , until my connection starts working again , I found this unsecured wireless in my apartment building that I ’m sometimes able to leech off of , as well as a nearby cafe that offers free wireless from 10 to 4 on weekdays .
And when all else fails I use my Blackberry , pecking out emails on the microscopic keyboard ( though that connection , too , has become finicky lately ) .
I talked again this morning to Ayn and Karl , and they completely agreed with each other that I was beyond hope .
By focusing so obsessively on “ fixing ” a “ problem , ” they explained , I ’d become distracted from the real goal : namely , comprehending a universal principle that explained why my Internet access was n’t working , as well as every other question that I might ever want an answer to .
Maybe they ’re right .
All I know is , at least for now I can usually get my email when I have to .
Sometimes turning an amp up to eleven simply does n’t cut it .
If you ’re looking for something to point back at those cars that drive by your house with the bass cranked , this speaker ( which is likely the loudest speaker in the world ) might just do the trick for you .
The “ Was 3000 ” , made by Wyle Laboratories can produce a sound level of 165 dB , which can literally melt the wax out of your ears .
To properly put this into perspective , the pain threshold of noise is 125dB .
The loudest rock concerts in the world can get to 130dB , which isalso the sound level that airport workers would experience standing beside a jet engine if they took off their hearing protectors .
Here is an interesting dB table that describes the scale and what each level relates to in more detail .
150 dB Can vibrate the walls of your chest , and the space shuttle taking off measures in somewhere around 150dB .
On the dB scale , a sound that is twice as powerful as another sound is 3 dB louder .
That means that a 90 dB sound is four times as powerful as a 84 dB sound .
it also means that the Was 3000 is more than TEN TIMES as powerful as the deafening roar of a jet engine right beside you … and five times as powerful as the space shuttle taking off .
At an output of 30,000 Watts and 165dB , this speaker can be physically dangerous – consider this :
at 135 dB you experience a slight cooling sensation from the air
at 140 dB your throat and vocal chords start to vibrate
at 142 dB your chest starts to pound intensely
at 148 dB the vibration because uncomfortable and even painful
at 150 dB you experience the overwhelming sensation of being compressed as if underwater
at 155 dB the compression and expansion from vibration is felt to the core
at 158 dB the vibration is violent , and nausea becomes intense
at 190 dB eardrums rupture 50 % of the time
at 198 dB human death from sound ( shock wave ) alone
Now , before you go out and try to buy a couple of these to hook up to your XBOX 360 , be aware that the Was 3000 is primarily used to make noise .
It uses a technique called airsteam modulation that pushes compressed air and nitrogen through various slots in the device , which create ‘ puffs ’ of air which acts as a modulator .
What is it used for other than other that in acoustic test chambers , you ask ?
Well , you know those noise - cancelling headphones that work by sampling the ambient noise , creating a waveform that is an exact duplicate of the noise , reversing the polarity and combining it with the original signal ?
Well the idea of this speaker is to do the same thing at airports and other installations that have a huge amount of noise .
Wyle has demonstrated its low - frequency noise reduction technology at various locations including Baltimore / Washington International Airport .
The US Army uses the WAS 3000 in a speaker setup called “ The Mother of All Speakers ” for battlefield simulations .
This speaker sort of brings that old Maxell ad to mind .
Asus Eee Box
Asus has been cranking out new versions of the Eee PC faster than a Kansas twister , all thanks to the growing herd of Eee-mitators out there .
Still , with everyone and their grandmother now hot for these little dwarfbooks , the company 's continued claim to the mini laptop throne is tenuous at best — even with those 23 existing and soon - to - be- released Eee PC configurations .
Behold , the new Eee Box !
Like the rest of the Eee bloodline , these varicolored desktop boxes are small , cheap and adorable .
Unlike Eee PCs , they 're in a league of their own … at least for the time being .
In essence , Asus simply did what Apple has been doing for years : using notebook innards to assemble small - form factor desktop devices ( think AppleTV or Mac Mini ) .
Only Asus is doing it on the low end .
Indeed , the unit 's specs are more or less identical to the latest Eee PC 901 — save for the beefier 80 or 160 - GB hard drives you can choose between .
What 's really interesting about the new Eee Box , however , is how these components actually end up working better in a desktop setting .
Much of what hampered Eee PCs — those small , cramped keyboards and tiny screens — are not an issue here .
And at $ 270 or $ 300 , it 's hard to find anything out there that offers as much for as little .
Sure , you can configure some craptastic
Dell rig that 'll be more powerful , but you 'll also give up form factor and pay a good $ 100 more for all the fixins .
Intel 's 1.6 GHz
Atom processor , up to 2 GBs of memory , four USB ports , an SD card slot , 802.11n and Bluetooth are plenty for the Eee Box to hit that elusive " good enough " mark with aplomb .
Once again , you 'll get your choice of running either Linux or Windows XP .
And , borrowing another page from Apple 's playbook , you 'll also get the Michael Jackson " Black or White " color options .
Then there 's the size .
Living up to its
Eee heritage , this box makes its few competitors look downright pudgy .
While it does have a slightly larger overall footprint , it 's much trimmer than the Mac Mini .
The Eee Box even makes Asus 's own Nova P22 mini PC look like it was viciously beaten with the fat stick .
Not only will this elegant 8.5 x 7 x 1 - inch box fit anywhere , but you also have the choice of mounting it directly to the back of any extra monitor you happen to have one lying around .
To be clear , the Eee Box is not for sweaty frag fests or heavy duty HD video decoding .
But if you have hankering for a killer kitchen PC or just an uber cheap second or third home PC that runs Linux or XP , it simply can't be beat .
Let the Eee Box knock - offs commence !

President Obama , with Vice President Palin ?
President Biden ?
President Pelosi ?
Call them the “ Doomsday ” scenarios — On Nov. 5 , the presidential election winds up in a electoral - college tie , 269 - 269 , the Democrat - controlled House picks Sen.
Barack Obama as president , but the Senate , with former Democrat Joe Lieberman voting with Republicans , deadlocks at 50 - 50 , so Vice President Dick Cheney steps in to break the tie to make Republican Sarah Palin his successor .
“ Wow , ” said longtime presidential historian Stephen Hess .
“ Wow , that would be amazing , would n’t it ? ”
“ If this scenario ever happened , it would be like a scene from the movie ‘ Scream ’ for Democrats , ” said Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh .
“ The only thing worse for the Democrats than losing the White House , again , when it had the best chance to win in a generation , but to do so at the hands of Cheney and Lieberman .
That would be cruel . ”
Sound impossible ?
It ’s not .
There are at least a half - dozen plausible ways the election can end in a tie , and at least one very plausible possibility - giving each candidate the states in which they now lead in the polls , only New Hampshire - which went Republican in 2000 and Democratic in 2004 , each time by just 1.5 percent - needs to swap to the Republican column to wind up with a 269 - 269 tie .
There are currently 10 tossup states , according to RealClearPol - itics.com , which keeps a running average of all state polls .
If Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain wins Ohio , Virginia , New Hampshire and Indiana - not at all far - fetched - and Mr. Obama takes reliably Democratic states Pennsylvania and Michigan , and flips Colorado ( in which he holds a slight poll lead ) , with the two splitting New Mexico and Nevada , the electoral vote would be tied at 269 .
Absurd ?
Possibly , and there is not complete agreement among constitutional experts on whether a newly elected Congress or the currently sitting House and Senate would make the decision .
So try this scenario :
The newly elected House , seated in January , is unable to muster a majority to choose a president after a 269 - 269 tie , but the Senate , which is expected to be controlled by Democrats , picks Sen.
Joseph R. Biden Jr. from the Democratic ticket .
If the House is still deadlocked at noon on Inauguration Day , Jan. 20 , Mr. Biden becomes acting president .
Or try this one on for size : Neither the House nor the Senate fulfills its constitutional duty to select the president and the vice president by Jan. 20 , so House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , becomes acting president until the whole mess is sorted out .
“ That would cause all kinds of lawsuits :
We would have 50 Floridas , and we might not know who the president is for two years , ” said Judith Best , a political science and Electoral College specialist at the State University of New York in Cortland .
The archaic system in the Constitution was set up in the days of oil lamps and horse - drawn carriages .
After the presidential vote on the first Tuesday in November , electors have until the Monday after the second Wednesday in December , this year Dec. 15 , to reach the state capital , where they cast their ballots for president .
The electoral vote is then transmitted “ sealed to the seat of the government of the United States , directed to the president of the Senate , ” according to the 12th Amendment .
If there ’s a tie , the 1804 amendment says , the House of Representatives “ shall choose immediately , by ballot , the president . ”
“ The Constitution says ‘ immediately , ’ ” Mr. Hess said .
“ It ’s that word ‘ immediately ’ that makes me believe it ’s got to be the outgoing Congress that makes the decision , because we know that the Electoral College ballots are counted in December . ”
But despite the delicious possibility that Mr. Cheney would break a Senate tie to create a Obama - Palin White House , several other constitutional scholars say , forget the Constitution .
They say the operative - and decisive - verbiage was set out in U.S. Code Title 3 , Chapter 1 , Section 15 , in 1934 .
“ Congress shall be in session on the sixth day of January succeeding every meeting of the electors .
The Senate and House of Representatives shall meet in the Hall of the House of Representatives at the hour of 1 o’clock in the afternoon on that day , ” the section says .
That , they say , means the new Congress would decide the president and vice president in the event of an Electoral College tie .
Here ’s where things get dicey , though .
Back to the Constitution , the 12th Amendment : ” … in choosing the president , the votes shall be taken by states , the representation from each state having one vote . ”
That means that a state ’s entire House delegation gets just one vote each - California , with 53 House members , would get one vote ; Alaska , with its one representative , would get one vote .
Florida , for instance , has 16 Republicans and nine Democrats .
That means the delegation would ( almost certainly ) vote 16 - 9 for Mr. McCain , while Colorado , with four Democrats and three Republicans , would vote 4 - 3 for Mr. Obama .
In the current House , Mr. Obama would win - 27 delegations have a majority of Democrats , 21 have a majority of Republicans , and two states , Kansas and Mr. McCain ’s home state of Arizona , are evenly split .
But those numbers will change Nov. 4 , and Paul Sracic , associate professor in the department of political science Youngstown State University in Ohio , said they could change dramatically .
Of the 27 state congressional delegations with a majority of Democrats , 25 of them would switch to deadlocked or Republican control if two or more seats change to Republican .
At least 26 state delegations in the House must agree before the next president can be chosen .
But even if Democrats maintain a majority , there would be pressure on Democratic delegations to vote Republican in states where voters chose Mr. McCain .
It took 36 ballots in the House to select Thomas Jefferson as the third president after the 1800 election ended in a 73 - 73 tie .
There was so much animosity after that election that Aaron Burr , elected vice president , faced off in a duel with Alexander Hamilton , who had thrown his support behind Jefferson .
Burr shot Hamilton dead in a duel .
The number of electors , 538 , is equal to the number of senators - 100 - and representatives - 435 - in the Congress , plus the three electors added in 1961 when the 23rd Amendment gave the District a say in U.S. presidential elections .
Thus , there have been 10 presidential elections in which a 269 - 269 tie was possibly , but it has never occurred .
“ The probability of a tie in 2008 is about 1.5 percent , which is slightly higher than we calculated at about the same time back in 2004 , ” said Mr. Sracic , who enlisted the help of the university ’s math department to come up with a possible 1,024 combinations with the current 10 states now considered tossups .
“ What really strikes you is how easy it would be for a tie to occur .
Take the 2004 map and switch Iowa , New Mexico and Colorado into the Blue column , which is what the poll numbers indicate .
Then , take New Hampshire and give it to McCain , which is what two recent polls suggest is going to happen .
There is your tie . ”

OTTAWA – Canada 's national television broadcasters have barred Green Party leader Elizabeth May from the leaders ' election debates , to be held on Oct.1 - 2 .
In a statement today , the consortium of television networks justified the decision as a saying three other party leaders opposed May 's inclusion .
Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion had not objected to May 's participation , but said that if Harper refused to participate , he would not either .
" It became clear that if the Green Party were included , there would be no Leaders ' Debates , " a written statement from the broadcasters said .
" In the interest of Canadians , the consortium has determined that it is better to broadcast the debates with the four major party leaders , rather than not at all , " it said .
He said the broadcasters tried to explore different ways of including the Green Party , but never even got to the point of discussing an appropriate format because of the opposition to May 's participation .
The decision means that the other four party leaders – Harper of the Conservative Party of Canada , Dion of the Liberal Party , Jack Layton of the New Democratic Party and Gilles Duceppe of the Bloc Quebecois – will go head - to - head in front of the cameras four and a half weeks into the campaign , and just two weeks before its end .
The French language debate will be held Wednesday , Oct. 1 , at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa from 8 - 10 p.m. , with moderator - journalist Stephane Bureau .
The English language debate will air the next evening from the same venue , but an hour later , from 9 - 11 p.m. with TVO host Steve Paikin moderating the discussion .
May had already dubbed " ridiculous " and " absurd " the arguments of leaders like Harper that she represented merely another Liberal voice at the debates .
Harper dismissed her earlier today as a " Liberal candidate , " though he did not say he would refuse to participate .
" For us , there is no strategically important question here .
The Green Party does not split our vote .
But I do think it 's unfair in principal to have two Liberal candidates in the debate , " Harper said during a campaign stop in Richmond , B.C .
" Elizabeth May is not an opponent of Stéphane Dion .
She is his candidate in Central Nova and I think it would be fundamentally unfair to have two candidates who are essentially running on the same platform in the debate .
That 's my view , " said Harper .

May is the Green candidate in Central Nova against Defence Minister Peter MacKay where the Liberals opted not to run a own candidate .
But May called that merely " a leader 's courtesy " and stressed her party had planned to run candidates against Liberals in all other ridings .

I ’m off for the Labor Day weekend .
Little would I have known that my scheduled weekend away , right in the heart of Palin country ( known to Alaskans as “ The Valley ” ) would fall on the weekend she became one of our Vice Presidential nominees .
No , it still has n’t sunk in .
I ’ll be passing through Wasilla itself and will post more pictures when I return , and get some local reaction on the “ day after ” .
I ’ll have internet access , though it will be dial - up .
Eek .
*********************************
UPDATE : Just watched the back - to - back McCain / Palin and Obama / Biden rallies in the “ rust belt ” .
I was waiting to hear Palin ’s second speech , but got the recycled speech from yesterday .
McCain ’s intro was the same too .
Palin keeps referencing Alaska , which no doubt endears her more to her fan base here , but I keep asking myself ….can people relate to Alaska gas issues ?
When she talks about Juneau , do they even know that ’s the capitol of Alaska ?
The most remarkable thing ?
The McCain camp obviously hoped to endear themselves to the disgruntled Hillary supporters by choosing a female running mate .
But when Palin saluted Hillary Clinton saying that she ran her campaign with ‘ determination and grace ’…. there were Boos .
Lots of them .
I ’m guessing that any Hillary supporters who had tuned in to check out the McCain / Palin party did n’t feel very welcome .
I doubt that they ’ll mention Hillary again on the open road .
They wo n’t want to risk that again .
Maybe we ’ll hear it at the convention where delegates will understand it ’s strategically not good to jeer at the candidate whose votes you hope to win .
Then the Obama / Biden appearance .
Looks like they ’re being cautious about Palin .
Obama referred to Biden as one of the great statesmen of our times .
They did n’t even have to say Palin for everyone to make that comparison in their minds .
Then Obama made reference to the fact that he ’d visited every state except Alaska , and that , come to think of it , he ought to visit now .
He ’s been saying this for months , but nothing firm yet .
I think it would be great .
Obama got 75 % of the votes in the Democratic caucus here , and the caucus site in Anchorage was packed .
People were literally having to park 2 miles away from the caucus site and ran in 5 below zero to make it in on time .
I know many people that could n’t even make it into the building .
I think a huge rally for Obama would go a long way to show how much support he has in Palin ’s home state .
In my trip throgh the Valley today , I did n’t see any McCain signs .
I was n’t really surprised , as McCain came in a less - than - impressive fourth in the Alaska Republican caucus .
But I ’m sure when the name Palin gets added , they will pop up like mushrooms overnight .
I did see a resurrected ‘ Sarah Palin for Governor ’ sign in front of a store .
The shopkeep said he cried with joy when he heard the news , and that she was a good woman who supported Alaskans .
Then he said that he had given up on all those ‘ liberal socialists ’ and decided they may as well all be ‘ queer ’ .
I ’m hoping that this is one of the more extreme reactions , and I was really glad I took the Obama sign out of my car window before leaving home .
The only other person I ’ve talked to so far is an Independant ( over 50 % of Alaskan voters are Independant or registered non-partisan ) who said she was stunned by the announcement and added , “ But she ’s not qualified ! ”
She also said that she did n’t remember Palin standing up against the Bridge to Nowhere .
More tomorrow .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Threatened by a “ financial tsunami , ” the world must consider building a financial order no longer dependent on the United States , a leading Chinese state newspaper said on Wednesday .
A panel displays the morning trading curve at the Hong Kong Stocks Exchange September 17 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Bobby Yip
The commentary in the overseas edition of the People 's Daily said the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH .
P " may augur an even larger impending global ' financial tsunami ' . "
The People ’s Daily is the official newspaper of China ’s ruling Communist Party , and the overseas edition is a smaller circulation offshoot of the main paper .
Its pronouncements do not necessarily directly reflect leadership views , but this commentary by a professor at Shanghai ’s Tongji University suggested considerable official alarm at the strains buckling world financial markets .
China ’s central bank earlier this week cut its lending rate for the first time in six years , a move analysts said was aimed at bolstering the economy and the battered stock market .
“ The eruption of the U.S. sub - prime crisis has exposed massive loopholes in the United States ’ financial oversight and supervision , ” writes the commentator , Shi Jianxun .
“ The world urgently needs to create a diversified currency and financial system and fair and just financial order that is not dependent on the United States . ”
But Vice Premier Wang Qishan , on a visit to the United States , told U.S. trade officials in a meeting on Tuesday that China and the United States needed to maintain close economic ties with global markets going through such turbulence .
“ The Chinese government is well aware of the fact that the United States , which is the world ’s largest developed country , and China , which is the world ’s largest developing country , should have constructive and cooperative economic and trade relations , ” he said .
China is a major buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds , and through its sovereign wealth fund it has taken stakes in two large U.S. financial institutions .
In July 2005 , China revalued the yuan and freed it from a dollar peg to float within managed bands .
But the yuan and China ’s trade remains tightly linked to the fortunes of the dollar .
The commentary suggested China must brace for grave economic fallout and look to alternatives , saying the crisis brings to mind the Great Depression of the 1930s .
“ Lehman Brothers announced bankruptcy will not only have a domino effect on the global financial world , it will bring a shock to the world economy , ” the front - page comment stated .
It seems only fair , since last weekend ’s spew about Zell using Cuban as a pawn to raise the value of the Cubs , to offer a glimpse into Zell ’s history as a business person .
I feel it was too easy to distribute the Zell - Cuban - Cubs rumor as true because they guy appears to be in the practice of some suspect business practices .
Let 's take a look , shall we ?
Core Facts
According to Wikipedia , Sam Zell is ranked 52nd amongst the richest men in America , starting his enterprise in real estate and then recently dabbling into the media industry with his acquisition of the Tribune company ( he has prior media investments as well ) .
A Chicago native , Zell came from modest beginnings and used education and connections to slowly build his empire .
It appears that his thirst for capitalism was the driving force in his un-quenching quest for monetary dominance .
Along the way it seems he has forgotten about his roots ( and his business ethics class ) and manifested into a self - inclusive entrepreneurial speedball ; this can be assumed by his philanthropic ventures which include primarily higher education institutions and Middle Eastern economic trusts ( Zell is Jewish / Poland ; Cuban is Russian Jew .
Would Zell really screw over a fellow Jew ? ) and through his disinterest in the LA Times .
Zell in the Media
Zell is not often painted in a positive light in the media .
In fact , a recent article in the WSJ reports that he is being sued by a number of LA Times writers .
Check out this illustration to see why , or read article ; both will give you a good image of how he is perceived by his employees .
Most importantly , it appears that Zell is not at all concerned with how he is perceived by anyone other than himself .
But , I do not know the man .
The list goes on about Zell and his business dealings , but what I care about most is the upcoming sale of the Chicago Cubs ; most importantly , to Mark Cuban .
Why the Zell - Cuban - Cubs Rumor is False
Not that I would put it past Zell to pull something like this ( READ ARTICLE ) , but it just does not make sense .
Zell could care less who he sells to .
Why else would he sell the field separately from the franchise ?
As well , I doubt he puts any time into the MLB incestuous drama ; Selig , Reisendorf , and Canning in a circle jerk , fantasizing about monopolizing pro sports in the Midwest .
Beyond Zell , and beyond Cuban , even beyond the Cubs , the Internet has a plethora of news sources ; all slanted , some true facts , most are BS .
When it comes to business dealings we can not rely on the media to produce valid progress .
The only thing we can do is wait it out until the pen hits the paper .
Until that time , everything else we see in the media / Internet is meaningless , including this website .
Of course , I had grand delusions that this effort would be an influencer in the process , and maybe it has had some influence ; some influencers have been to the site and I have corresponded with others .
But , in the end the decision is made behind closed doors , leaving us salivating at the end result .
Until then I continue my effort to appease those who have a true vested interest in the future of this historic franchise we call the Chicago Cubs
It appears that I am not the only blogger that has some thoughts about Zell .

Tensions in the border region are rising
At least 14 people have been killed and 15 injured in a suspected US missile strike in Pakistan 's border region , witnesses and officials say .
Suspected aerial drones bombed a house and seminary linked to Taleban commander Jalaludin Haqqani .
Pakistan 's army confirmed an explosion in the North Waziristan tribal area .
It would be the fourth cross - border attack in less than a week allegedly carried out by US forces , who have not officially confirmed their involvement .
This follows persistent US accusations that Pakistan is not doing enough to eliminate Taleban and al - Qaeda sanctuaries in the border region .
The upsurge in strikes has alarmed Pakistani military and government officials , who say it seriously undermines their counter - insurgency operations Bodies Villagers say unmanned US aircraft fired several missiles at a house and an Islamic seminary in the tribal area of North Waziristan .
Haqqani and Sirajuddin were in Afghanistan at the time of the attack - they are alive
Badruddin Haqqani Officials and witnesses say the complex was hit a number of times .
" There were two drones and they fired three missiles , " an unnamed resident of Dandi Darpakheil , a village near Miranshah , the main town of North Waziristan , told Reuters news agency .
Other reports speak of three drones .
Some reports say the death toll could be as high as 20 .
Casualties include militants , as well as a number of civilians .
Security officials say that the house belonged to Jalaludin Haqqani , a veteran Afghan Taleban commander said to have close links to Osama Bin Laden .
Mr Haqqani and his son , Sirajuddin , who is also a Taleban commander , were not at home , another son , Badruddin , told Reuters by telephone .
Badruddin Haqqani said one of his aunts had been killed in the raid , and that women and children were among those who had been hurt .
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan says the residential - cum - seminary complex has been raided a number of times by the Pakistani army , and hit by aerial attacks from across the border with Afghanistan .
Mr Haqqani has maintained the complex since 1980 and family , clansmen and militants still use the premises , our correspondent says .
Our correspondent says militants immediately cordoned off the entire area and shifted bodies dug up from the debris elsewhere .
Officials in Miranshah say they still do not have evidence that any high - value target may have been hit .
Rising tensions
In recent months , US forces based in Afghanistan have been accused of stepping up attacks against suspected Taleban targets over the border in Pakistan 's tribal region .
Last week Pakistan condemned an alleged raid by foreign troops based in Afghanistan , which officials say killed at least 15 villagers in South Waziristan .
In the same week , at least 10 people were killed in two suspected US missile strikes on alleged militant targets in North Waziristan .
Pakistan 's army has warned that such direct US action could rally more tribesmen behind the Taleban and incite a wider uprising , our correspondent says .

The Minnesota woman who lost the only RIAA copyright - infringement case to go to trial thus far had her verdict set aside Wednesday by the judge who originally oversaw the case .
District Court judge Michael Davis took the remarkable step of vacating the verdict reached on Capitol v. Thomas in his very own courtroom .
The judge 's 44 - page decision is based on his conclusion that he did give the jury improper instruction as to whether the law disallows making files available for distribution , as Ms. Thomas allegedly did when she saved songs in a folder that was visible to peer - to - peer networks .
Plaintiffs representing the Recording Industry Association of America claimed that dropping the 24 contested tracks into a folder on her computer was exactly the same as actively distributing them .
By that theory , therefore , RIAA 's investigators had no need to prove that anyone ever downloaded those tracks from her .
Judge Davis originally agreed and told the jury -- which last October found Ms. Thomas guilty and fined her $ 9,250 per track -- not to worry that the RIAA did n't prove that downloading occurred .

But after the trial , as both sides prepared to re-join in the appeals process the battle they 've been fighting since April 2006 , Judge Davis had more time to consider the case law .
In May he made it known that he believed he may have committed a manifest error of law and was thinking of granting a new trial .
That 's what happened on Wednesday .
Since the trial phase now begins again , Judge Davis did n't rule on the hefty liability and statutory damages penalties from the last trial , but he did have some strong words for Congress about the state of the Copyright
Act when it comes to peer - to - peer network cases such as this one , where the defendant clearly had no wish to turn a profit or build a business based on her purloined tracks :
" The Court would be remiss if it did not take this opportunity to implore Congress to amend the Copyright Act to address liability and damages in peer - to - peer network cases such as this ... The Court does not condone Thomas 's actions , but it would be a farce to say that a single mother 's acts of using Kazaa are the equivalent , for example , to the acts of global financial firms illegally infringing on copyrights in order to profit in the securities market . "
Davis was referring there to Lowry 's Reports Inc v. Legg Mason , one of the cases the RIAA cited to make their play for large statutory damages .
The RIAA was quoted in some reports as saying the decision was " not unexpected , " but this song may be all too familiar to them by now .
Courts in Arizona and Massachusetts have previously disputed the association 's claim that making tracks available is the same as distributing them .
A New York court , on the other hand , has sided with the RIAA 's take on the matter .
Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Corynne McSherry , in a post to the EFF's Deeplinks blog , said that the Foundation " applauds Chief Judge Davis 's thorough rejection of the RIAA 's effort to rewrite copyright law and thereby avoid the trouble of actually proving any infringement has occurred .
And we wholeheartedly endorse the court 's call to amend the Copyright Act 's oppressive damages provisions . "
The EFF was one of the organizations that briefed Judge Davis after he expressed his original concerns about his jury instructions .
Georgia says may pull out of Beijing Games Reuters
Published : Saturday August 9 , 2008
Print This Email This By Sean Maguire BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Georgia may pull its 35 - strong Olympic team out of the Beijing Games because of Russian military attacks on its territory , the country 's National Olympic Committee told Reuters on Saturday .
" We 're talking about it now .
It will be the decision of the president of the country ( Mikheil Saakashvili ) , " spokesman Giorgi Tchanishvili said in the Chinese capital .
The Georgia conflict has knocked the Olympics down page , dimming some of China 's glory .
The vast Asian nation 's hopes for a trouble - free games were dashed on Saturday by the daylight murder of the U.S. volleyball coach 's father - in - law .
Chinese hopes of quick wins were partly met as competition got under way in earnest .
A woman 's weightlifting gold and men's shooting gold came their way , though they lost the first medal to be awarded after the Chinese favorite buckled under pressure .
Calls by the International Olympic Committee for a traditional Games truce to be honored have gone unheard , in a reminder of the limits of sport 's ability to bring nations into harmony .
Russian forces have widened an offensive against Georgia to force Tbilisi 's troops out of the breakaway Caucasus region of South Ossetia , whose inhabitants are loyal to Moscow .
Russian armor and troops have poured across the border and its planes have hit bombed targets far from the combat zone in what U.S. President George W. Bush called a dangerous escalation .
Georgia 's parliament has declared a state of war , leaving the country 's athletes anxious and uncertain .
Its Olympic team urged the international community to help end the violence .
Bush , in Beijing to cheer on U.S. athletes , broke away from spectating to call on Russia to end its bombing of Georgia .
CLOUDED BACKDROP
The U.S. volleyball team was hit by tragedy when the father - in - law of coach Hugh McCutcheon was murdered .
A 47 - year - old Chinese man stabbed the parents of the coach 's wife and a Chinese tour guide at a popular tourist site , killing American Todd Bachman and seriously injuring Bachman 's wife , also a U.S. citizen .
The assailant , Tang Yongming , then jumped to his death from high up the Drum Tower , a 700 - year - old 45 - metre ( yard ) high monument once used to sound time for the Chinese capital 's residents .
Police said Tang 's motive was unknown .
Attacks on foreigners in Beijing are rare .
Olympic organizers have deployed a 100,000 - strong security force to protect the 10,500 athletes and thousands of spectators , citing the threat of terrorism but sparking criticism they were blocking protests .
On the opening day of competition , Katerina Emmons won the first gold , in the women 's 10 - metre air rifle , for the Czech Republic .
Pre -Games favorite Du Li of China finished fifth and left in tears .
" There was pressure for all of us but for her it was even harder , " Emmons said of her rival .
" I 'm sorry , but the Chinese press is putting a lot of pressure on Chinese athletes . "
Pang
Wei restored home pride in the shooting with victory in the men's 10 - metre air pistol , the second gold for China after Chen Xiexia won , as expected , in the women 's 48kg weightlifting .
U.S. swimming sensation Michael Phelps set off on his quest for a record eight gold medals , diving into the pool at the bubble - wrap Water Cube building to win his heat in the 400 meters individual medley in an Olympic record .
Phelps first gold could come on Sunday , when the mighty U.S. swim team is well - placed to triumph in three of the four finals being staged .
ENDURANCE TEST
In the first event to test athletes ' ability to withstand the heat and smog of a Beijing summer , Spain 's Samuel Sanchez won the men 's cycling road race along a grueling 245 - km route from the Forbidden City in Beijing to the Great Wall .
More than a third of contestants dropped out , including favorites like German Stefan Schumacher who said the humidity and smog made a hard course even tougher .
" I have a very , very strong headache , " said Schumacher , after abandoning the race .
" I suppose it's the pollution . "
Sanchez 's Spanish team mates said they had decided to work together to support whichever of them had the best chance to win .
" In the end it turned out that Samuel felt the best and so we played his card , " said Spain 's Carlos Sastre , this year 's Tour de France winner .
The women 's cycling road race is along the same route on Sunday when it is forecast to be wet and cooler .
Tennis officials said they may allow heat breaks during matches to help players cope with stifling humidity and heat in the high 90s Fahrenheit ( above 35 Celsius ) .
Competitors have said the conditions are among the toughest say they have faced .
Warnings smog would hinder performance have persisted despite an $ 18 billion campaign to clean the air around the city by shutting down smokestack industry and forcing cars off the roads .

In the new browser wars , speed and technology are the key weapons employed by browser vendors .
Sitting in the CTO chair of open source browser vendor Mozilla is Brendan Eich , the creator of JavaScript and a former Netscape employee .
A veteran of the first browser war which decimated Netscape and left Microsoft in command of the field , Eich is not about to yield the field this time around to anyone .
With Apple , Google , Opera and Microsoft now all competing for mind and market share in the new browser war , the challenges and the stakes are perhaps greater than ever .
Yet in this new contest , it 's not the vendors themselves that will ultimately prevail , but rather it is likely that it is the web itself which will emerge victorious .
" The future of the Web is bright , " Eich told InternetNews.com .
" We talk about things like Silverlight and Adobe AIR being a threat to the open Web but they wo n't succeed in displacing the reach of the Web .
Competition is going strong in the Web browser market and I think that will bring them all up towards parity and keep them evolving in ways developers want . "
Though Firefox and Internet Explorer ( IE ) are rivals for browser share , Eich credits Microsoft with improving IE in recent years .
" My interpretation of what Microsoft is doing with IE in the last few years is they are trying to support standards more and they took some risks doing that with CSS improvements that frankly could break things for some of their enterprise customers , " Eich said .
The question for Eich however is how far Microsoft will actually go in supporting truly open standards .
That said he noted that between the pressures of competition and developers , Microsoft may have little choice but to support standards .
The Impact of HTML 5
One such new standard that is emerging is HTML 5 which would be the first major revision of HTML in nearly a decade .
The first public working draft of HTML 5 was released earlier this year and the final draft is expect by 2010 .
Efforts on revising HTML have been underway since at least 2004 .
" HTML 5 is a large thing and it's kind of a standards party , " Eich commented .
In some ways there is a lot in it that is good , original and a logical extension to what is already in HTML today .
Some of it is a response to the needs of developers building Web apps in the modern world who really can't make do with the scotch tape and wire approach that has been used so far . "
Though the specification is not yet finalized , several browser vendors , including Mozilla , Google ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) and Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) , have already included some components in their browsers .
" We 're really concerned about getting the best parts implemented first , making sure they are interoperable and then going from there , " Eich said .
" I think that 's happening . "
In particular Eich noted that WebKit , used by Apple Safari and Google Chrome , has done a good job of implementing some early HTML 5 features .
Eich also credits Google for Chrome 's multi-process isolation model .
Eich noted that for years there have been various bugs in Mozilla where people have blamed plug-ins and wanted to put them out of process .
That said Mozilla has been at work updating its plugin model which had been based on an old Netscape API .
The Google Chrome approach for process isolation however wo n't necessarily work for Mozilla , in part because , according to Eich , it uses more memory .
" If we went back and started using more memory that would be a problem for us , but with Chrome they have a clean slate approach and they can say they use more memory , but it goes away as you exit processes , " Eich said .

In a disturbing expose Sunday , the McClatchy papers joined the growing list of press , pundits and politicians raising a red flag about John McCain 's out - of - control temper .
Following on the heels of the devastating revelations from the Washington Post in April , McClatchy documents many of the tantrums , outbursts and eruptions that continue to call McCain 's presidential temperament into question .
And as Mitt Romney 's campaign revealed in January , those McCain tirades are directed at friend and foe alike .
Starting with an f-bomb hurled at GOP colleague John Cornyn , McClatchy details McCain 's long history of explosions , a record which led Mississippi Republican Thad Cochran to conclude " the thought of ( McCain ) being president sends a cold chill down my spine " :
There 's a lengthy list of similar outbursts through the years : McCain pushing a woman in a wheelchair , trying to get an Arizona Republican aide fired from three different jobs , berating a young GOP activist on the night of his own 1986 Senate election and many more .
And that 's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to John McCain 's white hot temper .
Among the most shocking incidents are those involving POW / MIA activists .
As this video shows , McCain 's " prosecutor - like questioning " of Dolores Alfond , chairwoman of the National Alliance of Families for the Return of America 's Missing Servicemen and Women , left her in tears during a 1992 Senate hearing .
In 1996 , McCain lost his cool again when 25 of the group 's members came to see him at the Senate :
Six people present have written statements describing what they saw .
According to the accounts , McCain waved his hand to shoo away Jeannette Jenkins , whose cousin was last seen in South Vietnam in 1970 , causing her to hit a wall .
As McCain continued walking , Jane Duke Gaylor , the mother of another missing serviceman , approached the senator .
Gaylor , in a wheelchair equipped with portable oxygen , stretched her arms toward McCain .
" McCain stopped , glared at her , raised his left arm ready to strike her , composed himself and pushed the wheelchair away from him , " according to Eleanor Apodaca , the sister of an Air Force captain missing since 1967 .
McCain 's staff would n't respond to requests for comment about specific incidents .
McCain 's rage is hardly limited to political opponents or messengers of inconvenient truths .
Just ask Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn .
As Perrspectives recalled in March :
While Cornyn ultimately endorsed McCain for the White House , in March 2007 he was on the receiving end of a McCain tantrum .
Clashing over immigration policy , McCain dropped the F - bomb , saying to Cornyn , " F **k you !
I know more about this than anyone else in the room . "
Cornyn was far from alone among Senate Republicans in feeling the wrath of McCain .
In 1999 , McCain told the Finance Committee Chairman Pete Domenici ( R- NM ) , " Only an a****** would put together a budget like this . "
On another occasion , he blasted the mild mannered Chuck Grassley ( R - IA ) , " I 'm calling you a f****** jerk . "
McCain 's fury also extended to his GOP allies in the House of Representatives .
As the Washington Post and Real McCain author Cliff Schecter each reported , McCain nearly came to blows with his Arizona colleague , Rep. Rick Renzi .
In recent weeks , Democrats including Harry Reid , Dick Durbin and Barbara Boxer have all sounded the alarm about John McCain 's decidedly unpresidential temperament .
But it was Mitt Romney , the man who almost became the Republican vice presidential nominee , who offered the most ominous warnings to Americans that John McCain 's dangerously out - of - control temper made him unfit for command .
As his make - or - break Florida primary contest against John McCain approached in January , Mitt Romney abandoned his pledge that " I 'm not going to talk about the character of the people I 'm running against . "
Instead , the Romney campaign produced a memo titled , " The McCain Way : Attack Republicans - A Top 10 List . "
Romney 's top 10 includes some of McCain 's greatest hits - literally .
In addition to the Cornyn , Grassley and Domenici episodes , the Romney list features some comparatively minor McCain blow - ups towards Dick Cheney , Mitch McConnell and other leading lights of the GOP .
Amazingly , the Romney camp claimed that in 1995 , John McCain " had a scuffle " with then 92 - year old Strom Thurmond .
( The complete " McCain Way " memo is available at the Boston Herald . )
During his first president run back in 1999 , John McCain tried to defuse the growing concerns over his hot temper , insisting , " Do I insult anybody or fly off the handle or anything like that ?
No , I do n't . "
And when the Washington Post detailed John McCain 's legendary temper in April , his spokesman Mark Salter called its account " 99 % fiction . "
On Sunday , Salter defended his man again :
" McCain gets intense , and intent on his argument . "
His blowups with senators often result from colleagues being accustomed to deference , he said .
" A lot of these guys are n't used to that , " Salter said , so they get annoyed when a peer gets emotional .
Mitt Romney is n't the only Republican who 's fretting about John McCain 's finger being on the nuclear button .
As Jon Hinz , the Arizona Republican Party executive director during McCain 's 1986 Senate run , put it :
" It seems the only way to deal with John McCain is to think the way he does .
If he gets more power , what 's going to make him suddenly become a fuzzy , nice guy ? "
With friends like that , who needs enemies ?
And thanks to Mitt Romney , we know how John McCain treats his friends .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Michael Phelps collected his second gold of the Beijing Games on Monday when the U.S. men turned on the power to win the fastest 4x100 meters freestyle relay of all time .
In an astonishing race that saw the existing world record slashed by nearly four seconds , while Australian Eamon Sullivan also broke the individual 100 meters freestyle world mark in the opening leg , the U.S. smashed France into second place .
Australia took the bronze .
France , who had qualified inside the old world record on Sunday and had boasted about “ smashing ” the Americans , led into the final 50 meters with former 100 freestyle world record holder Alain Bernard as their anchor .
Jason Lezak pulled out all the stops in a thrilling finish to hit the wall in 3:08.24 , with the French stopping the clock at 3:08.32 .
Victory kept 23 - year - old Phelps , swimming three races in the space of a day , on course to break compatriot Mark Spitz ’s 1972 record of seven golds at a single Games .
He had earlier qualified for the 200 freestyle final and has 200 butterfly heats later .

It ’s clear the Obama campaign is n’t going to touch the “ rape kit ” issue .
It ’s time for the women ’s groups to do Obama ’s work for him .
The women ’s community should be all over this issue .
And I do n’t mean just issuing press releases .
I mean launching excoriating Web sites , holding public press conferences and protests – finding all sorts of creative ways to make this issue news , and to hold McCain ’s and Palin ’s feet to the fire .
So , I want to talk to Eleanor Smeal , one of the feistiest human beings I have ever met .
I ’m going to call her office on Monday , but if anyone knows her , knows how to get a hold of her , tell her that her son ’s favorite blogger , the guy who interviewed her at the CNN Grill during the Democratic Convention , wants to talk with her about blowing this issue up .
In a roller - coaster day of hopes raised and hopes dashed , efforts to negotiate a compromise on the $ 700 - billion plan for rescuing the nation ’s financial system bogged down Thursday , with conservative Republicans denouncing the strategy as ill - conceived and Democrats accusing GOP presidential candidate John McCain of encouraging the revolt .
What remained unclear was whether Thursday ’s breakdown marked the beginning of the end for the rescue effort , or merely a tumultuous interlude on the way to approving a federal bailout that many in Congress consider unpalatable but unavoidable .
There were signs that , behind the scenes , skeptical Democrats and Republicans were beginning to move toward a compromise version of Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson ’s original plan , but it remained to be seen whether there would be enough votes to pass legislation .
“ I ’m seeing both Republicans and Democrats start to move toward voting for it , ” Rep. John Campbell ( R - Irvine ) said .
“ I ca n’t tell you that there ’s a majority at this point , but there ’s movement . ”

The working proposal contained most of the features that critics of the administration ’s original plan had been demanding : limits on compensation for executives of companies that take part in the bailout , a provision for taxpayers to share in any profits from the sale of distressed assets , and payout of the $ 700 billion in three stages instead of one .
The final $ 350 - billion tranche would require a congressional vote .
Republicans , meanwhile , denied that McCain had put obstacles in the way of a deal .
“ Focus on a deal that ’s real , ” said Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) , a close McCain ally .
“ Do n’t focus on a phony deal and blame John McCain . ”
Late Thursday , Democrats and Republicans from both houses of Congress , joined by Paulson , returned to the bargaining table in another unsuccessful attempt to craft a proposal that could command majority support .
Democratic leaders said they would resume Friday morning without Paulson , but they contended that no deal was possible without at least some House Republican support .

In an assessment echoed by many of his colleagues in both parties , Rep. Howard P. “ Buck ” McKeon ( R - Santa Clarita ) , an early skeptic who is now convinced that Congress must act , said , “ We ’ve got 40 days until an election .
You ’ve got a lot of nervous people here .
Some of them are totally consumed by the policy .
More of them are totally consumed by the politics . ”
With financial markets continuing to remain calm , members of Congress in both parties apparently concluded that there was still time .
Some suggested that the new deadline was sometime Sunday , before Asian financial markets opened .
“ Whatever is going to be done has to be done this weekend , ” said Rep. Lee Terry ( R - Neb . ) , who supports congressional action .
“ Allowing it to go beyond Sunday into Monday will devastate the markets . ”
With issues as complex and politically explosive as the Wall Street bailout , it is not unusual for Congress to delay action until the last minute .
Many members said more time was needed for constituents to understand the rescue plan and get beyond their anger at using tax dollars to bail out financiers who helped bring on the crisis .

Some Democrats accused McCain of getting behind a plan put forward Thursday by conservative House members .
“ John McCain did not attack any proposal or endorse any plan , ” said his spokesman , Brian Rogers .
In an interview with ABC News , McCain said he was hopeful that a compromise could be struck .
Pointing to the opposition among House Republicans , he said , “ There never was a deal , ” contradicting what leading congressional negotiators had said earlier in the day .
Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind. ) , however , said McCain ’s involvement in negotiations gave fiscal conservatives hope that any eventual compromise would be more to their liking .
“ Knowing John McCain to be the fiscal conservative he is makes many conservatives breathe a lot easier to know he’s at the negotiating table , ” Pence said .
“ The core of the president ’s proposal is unacceptable . ”

McCain met with House conservatives before a White House session Thursday attended by congressional leaders of both parties , McCain and Democratic presidential challenger Barack Obama .
Obama , who earlier in the week had voiced concerns that the presidential hopefuls would be a distraction to the negotiations , expressed support for the ongoing negotiations after the White House summit .
“ My impression from the meeting today is that the president and the secretary of the Treasury . . . still have some work to do ” in getting House Republicans to agree to the proposed bailout .
The seesaw series of events began late Thursday morning , when key congressional negotiators from both parties announced the outlines of a compromise .
“ We ’ve reached a fundamental agreement on a set of principles , ” said a triumphant Sen. Christopher J. Dodd ( D - Conn . ) .
“ We ’re very confident that we can act expeditiously . ”
But one of the GOP negotiators , Rep. Spencer Bachus of Alabama , later sounded what turned out to be a prophetic note .
“ There was progress on many issues , but no agreement other than to continue discussions , ” he said , adding , “ As I made clear in the meeting this morning , I was not authorized by my colleagues to make any agreement on behalf of House Republicans . ”
Advertisement
Almost immediately , House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) made the GOP position explicit : “ House Republicans have not agreed to any plan at this point , ” he said in a statement .
Instead of facilitating an agreement , President Bush ’s afternoon summit ended in disappointment .
Sen. Richard C. Shelby ( R - Ala . ) , the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , who has said he opposes the administration plan , walked out of the meeting about 40 minutes after it began , saying , “ We have n’t gotten an agreement .
There ’s still a lot of different opinions . ”
Shelby said he had told the president that he did n’t think there had been enough study of alternatives .
“ I brought it up in there , ” Shelby said .
“ I ’m probably not welcome again . ”
In a dramatic moment described by a Democratic aide , Paulson took several Democrats aside as participants were leaving and asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) in particular “ not to blow this up . ”

Pelosi retorted angrily that it was House Republicans who were putting the brakes on the plan , according to the aide , who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to discuss the meeting .
As the aide described it , Paulson then dropped to one knee and repeated his appeal .
Pelosi again blamed Republicans for holding up a deal .
“ I know , I know , ” Paulson was said to have replied .
Even as the White House meeting was underway , a group of conservative House Republicans began pushing a drastically different approach .
Their idea , they said , was to get Wall Street firms to pony up funds for an insurance program to bail out their less - solvent siblings by creating a kind of insurance program for investment banks like the one for commercial banks .

In addition , the present liquidity crisis could be resolved , according to the proposal , by further deregulation , temporary tax breaks and relaxation of other rules to encourage investors to put more money into the financial system instead of using government funds .
“ It makes Wall Street pay for its own bailout , ” Rep. Paul D. Ryan ( R - Wis. ) said in a news conference .
Ryan and other proponents said the idea had been in the works for days .
Many officials , including members of the Bush administration as well as independent economists , have said that excessive deregulation and inadequate government supervision played a substantial role in creating the current crisis .
It was not immediately clear how financial firms burdened with billions of dollars in toxic mortgage - backed securities could finance what appeared to be a retroactive insurance program .
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass. ) , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and a lead negotiator with Treasury Department since the bailout plan was first proposed , said the insurance idea was an eleventh - hour “ campaign ploy ” designed to give McCain more exposure during the crisis negotiations .
Advertisement
At a Democratic news conference , Frank said Paulson had already deemed the insurance - based approach unworkable .
“ Rather than help us negotiate differences , [ McCain has ] identified with a radically different approach that the secretary of the Treasury has already rejected , ” Frank charged .
He noted that House Republicans did not bring up their alternative plan when Paulson was testifying before the House on Wednesday .
“ This notion of an insurance approach was never surfaced , ” Frank said .
“ It ’s an odd way to behave when you have an alternative proposal . ”
Frank said the negotiators had reached a substantial consensus with the administration .
Advertisement
“ The next thing I know , members of the media are saying to me that House Republicans have a very different plan , supported by Sen. McCain and involving insurance , ” Frank said .
“ I go to Secretary Paulson and said , ‘ Did you know this ? ’
He did not . ”

Bailout :
The latest
According to a current draft , the rescue plan would :
Set limits on executive compensation for participating companies .
Advertisement
Minimize risk for taxpayers .
Require that the government be given an equity stake in any participating company .
Install an oversight board that could halt the program .
Require regular , detailed reporting to Congress .
Advertisement
Create an inspector general .
Require Government Accountability Office audits .
Release $ 700 billion in authorized funds in installments .
The first would be $ 250 billion , then $ 100 billion .
The final $ 350 billion would require a joint resolution of Congress .

With Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley becoming commercial banks , and the other three big investment banks / brokerage houses being acquired by commercial banks , politicians and the press wo n't have Wall Street to kick around anymore .
Headlines now shout about a $ 700 billion " Bailout for Wall Street . "
Yet strictly speaking , Wall Street as we knew it no longer exists .
The conversion or absorption of all five of Wall Street 's big investment banks into commercial banks raises several intriguing issues .
First ...
Blimey .
I did n’t realise that Facebook are trending down support for IE6 .
The “ new look ” is disabled , and if you use the old look you get a big message complaining about your browser choice :
Two interesting things here : first , they recommend that you try another browser , and give a list of Firefox , Safari , and Flock as well as “ upgrade to Internet Explorer 7 ” .
Flock ?
I bet the Opera people are a bit hacked off about that .
Second : there have been a few cases so far of people dropping support for IE6 ( MobileMe , not that that really counts because all its users are Mac people , and 37 Signals , ditto ) , but nothing remotely as high - profile as Facebook .
This is the boot starting to descend , I think .
IE6 is already the bugbear of the industry ( and has been for some time : I said “ Internet Explorer is the new Netscape 4 ” in 2005 and I was hardly the first ! ) ; how long before we see support for it drop to Netscape 4 levels of “ you get the unenhanced non-JavaScript version ” ?
I ’d like to see more people publish browser stats for their websites .
Yes , they ’re unreliable , yes people change their user agent , blah blah blah .
They ’ll give us an indication , though ; how many people out there are using IE6 ?
Google Analytics tells me that 36 % of my visitors are using IE , and 37 % of those are using IE6 , which means that IE6 visitors to my site are down to under 15 % .
( If you ’re not using Analytics , analog - G - A +a + B < apache logfile > will give you a browser list , as will many other things . )
Other people will doubtless differ , and I ’d be thoroughly interested in seeing more of these percentages from sites with a different user - base to mine .
If you ’re a company , tell us what percentage of your users are using IE6 !
We ’re not going to get stats out of Google or Yahoo or the BBC , but non-behemoths will do fine here .
Everyone else , start thinking : where ’s the cut - off point ?
How low does IE6 ’s market share need to go before it ’s reasonable to not devote extra development time to it ?
“ Extra ” is the keyword there — people thinking “ hey , Opera / Safari / Firefox 3/IE8 has less than 15 % market share in my statistics , let ’s cut them off , Mr. Microsoft Hater ” need to consider that modern browsers do n’t ( or at least should n’t ) take any extra development time to work around their idiosyncrasies .
( In practice , Safari does require more extra development time than I ’d like , I find , but its market share is high enough ( or the idiosyncracies are infrequent enough ) that supporting it is broadly worth the effort . )
So : if you have IE6 stats , publish them .
If you ’re a web hacker : when should we cut off the ailing IE6 ’s life support ?

REPRESENTATION : The Alpern Group
If you 've ever wondered about the definition of hypocrisy you 'll find the answer right here .
Last month the Swiss foreign minister visited Iran and , together with President Ahmadinejad , attended the signing of a multi-billion euro contract for Iran to supply Switzerland with large amounts of natural gas over the next 25 years .
The US State Department immediately condemned the deal and said it would be investigating whether it breached the Iran Sanctions Act.
Israel complained too , describing the Swiss minister 's visit to Tehran as an " act unfriendly to Israel " .
Various Jewish groups also joined in the protests , including the World Jewish Congress .
This righteous indignation was entirely predictable but more than a little odd nevertheless .
On March 30 , the Swiss newspaper Sonntag retaliated with the revelation that Israel , supposedly observing an ironclad boycott of all things Iranian , has been buying Iranian oil for years .
The story is in German but Israeli journalist Shraga Elam has provided me with a translation which I 'll quote from here .
" Israel imports Iranian oil on a large scale even though contacts with Iran and purchasing of its products are officially boycotted by Israel .
Israel gets around the boycott by having the oil delivered via Europe .
A reliable Israeli energy newsletter , EnergiaNews , reported this last week [ March 18 ] ... " EnergiaNews got the information about the Iran trade from sources with ties to the management of Israeli Oil Refineries Ltd ...
According to EnergiaNews the Iranian oil is liked in Israel because its quality is better than other crude oils .
" The report by EnergiaNews editor Moshe Shalev states that the Iranian oil reaches various European ports , mainly in Rotterdam .
It is bought by Israelis and the necessary European bill of lading and insurance papers are supplied .
Then it is transported to Haifa in Israel .
The importer is the Eilat - Ashkelon Pipeline Co ( EAPC ) , which keeps its oil sources secret . "
EAPC was established in 1968 as a joint Israeli - Iranian company to transport oil from Iran to Europe .
After the fall of the Shah , Iran ceased to play an active role in its affairs and there are ongoing legal disputes between the two partners .
The Swiss report continued :
" It is not clear if the Iranian exporters know about Israeli purchases of their oil .
At the other end , the Israeli buyers and governmental offices are well aware of where the high - grade oil comes from , although it is a blatant defiance of the boycott .
The EnergiaNews article even made it through Israeli censorship , which asked only for some changes in the text .
The fact that the report cleared the censors increases the credibility of the information .
In the past , such reports were forbidden .
" When questioned by Sonntag , an energy expert of one of the leading Israeli papers confirmed the EnergiaNews report : Israel has been importing Iranian oil for many years .
The expert stressed , however , that the purchases were made on the free market and not directly from Iran . "
Sonntag quoted a spokesman for Oil Refineries Ltd as denying that his company imports and processes Iranian oil .
However , Sonntag pointed to a report in Haaretz newspaper last October which said that an Israeli energy company called Paz would be refining Iranian oil and supplying it to the Palestinian Authority from the start of this year .
This begs the question : if Iran is , as Bibi Netanyahu argues , an existential threat to Israel , why does the government allow such trade ?
Would Israel have the US attack Iran 's nuclear programme and provoke a potential region - wide conflict while it cannot seem to wean itself from high quality Iranian crude ?
You'd think if Israelis are cowering in fear from an Iranian bomb and the arch antisemite Ahmadinejad , they would n't want to trade with such an enemy .
When is a boycott not a boycott ?
When it's in your naked economic interest to circumvent it , apparently .
But one should ask : if Israel does n't honour its self - declared boycott of Iran , why should the rest of the world honour its boycott of Hamas and Gaza ?
If Israel does n't honour its own boycott , then why should members of Congress vote with AIPAC when it proposes a measure that even Israel honours only in the breach ?
It 's interesting to note from a discussion ( in Hebrew ) on the Kedma website that Israel does not formally define Iran as an " enemy nation " and therefore in a strictly legal sense such trade is permissible .
Ironically , Iran too has a boycott against Israel in place and is violating its own measures in that regard .
Furthermore , the same commenter notes that Israel last week dismissed attempts to engage Syria in a diplomatic process as a failure because Syria refuses to renounce its ties with Iran .
Do I hear the word " hypocrisy " ?
Hasse diagram of the 2008 Olympic medal table
Simon Tatham
Different people have different conventions for how to rank the Olympic medal results .
Some people prefer to count total medals first , and only look at the individual number of gold , silver and bronze medals in order to break ties .
Some people , on the other hand , prefer to count gold medals first , break ties using silver medals , and break any persisting ties using bronze .
In between those two extremes , there are any number of other reasonable rankings : for instance , one could adopt a points system allocating three points for a gold medal , two for a silver and one for a bronze .
( Better still , if you allocated π 2 for a gold , π for a silver and 1 for a bronze , there could never be any tie in the total scores except when two countries had exactly the same medal counts in all three categories ! )
Any of these ranking systems , or quite a few others , could reasonably be argued to be some sort of measurement of how successful ( in absolute terms ) a country had been at winning medals ; but each would place the 87 medal - winning countries in a different overall order .
With all that scope for reasonable disagreement , is there anything we can all agree on ?
How much of the hierarchy in the medal table is indisputable , and how much depends on your point of view ?
( I 'll restrict the following discussion to the absolute ranking of countries , solely by their medal counts .
There is a lot of scope for reasonable comparisons which try to offset countries ' natural advantages due to size or wealth , or which are more interested in some kinds of sport than others , but that 's outside the scope of what I 'm discussing here . )
There are two basic constraints which are common to all the above possibilities , and which must be obeyed by any " reasonable " absolute ranking system :
We must consider more medals to be better than fewer , other things being equal .
If country A has at least as many gold , at least as many silver and at least as many bronze as country B , then we must surely consider it to have done at least as well .
.
If country A has at least as many gold , at least as many silver and at least as many bronze as country B , then we must surely consider it to have done at least as well .
We must consider the higher medals to be better than the lower .
If country C has one more silver than country D but one fewer bronze , we must surely consider it to have done unambiguously better by any sensible ranking , because it has the score country D would have had if one of their bronze medallists had done a little better and won silver instead .
So we want to say that one country has done strictly better than another if the medal score of the latter can be transformed into the former by a sequence of medal additions and medal upgrades .
A bit of thought shows that this is exactly equivalent to defining a partial order on triples of medals , in which a triple ( G, S , B ) is considered at least as good as another triple ( g , s , b ) if and only if it satisfies the three conditions
G ≥ g
≥ G + S ≥ g + s
+ ≥ + G + S + B ≥ g + s + b
Based on this criterion , we can analyse the results of an Olympic Games to determine all the unarguable relationships within the medal ranking table , and distinguish them from those which are matters of opinion .
Here I present the results of applying this procedure to the Beijing 2008 Olympics results .
The diagram below is a Hasse diagram : a country has unarguably done better than another country if there is a chain of arrows running from the former to the latter .
If two countries are not connected by a chain of arrows in either direction , it means that there is scope for legitimate dispute about which has done better .

With a push from the McCain camp , the conservative blogs are suddenly aflutter with claims about Sarah Palin ’s “ executive experience ” and readiness for the presidency based on her six years as Mayor of Wasilla , Alaska …
In terms of hearings for impeachment , I have heard that when a hearing is held in congress for impeachment that the president cannot claim executive privilege , and that people have to testify .
Is this true ?
As far as I understand it that is true and it is an advantage over a simple investigative hearing , ( video starts ) and of course they are not supposed to perjure themselves .
That does n’t mean that the witnesses who come forward — who are subpoenaed and come forward – will tell the truth .
It does mean that they are subject in theory to perjury charges .
But it does mean that the administration cannot order people not to come .
That ’s very important .
Because the purpose of whether it ’s impeachment hearings or investigative hearings into crimes of the government which John Conyers has talked about .
Right ?
I was in a meeting where he talked about that – having them ; said he would have them , but , have n’t happened yet .
Investigative hearings on crimes that may have been committed , fine ; and that – would almost inevitably point to impeachment and that will make them just as leery of holding those hearings as they are of impeachment hearings .
But , if you did hold the impeachment hearings you could get these people ; and he could not order people , as Bush has done , not to appear .
The importance of that is that there are people who would love to tell the truth if they are subpoenaed , and , if they ca n’t be fired for appearing .
And those are the people to get .
A friend of mine is very anxious to see Cheney under oath .
I said , I would n’t give a dime for that .
The chance of getting the truth out of Cheney under oath , you know , is just negligible .
But there are a lot of people who would be happy to tell if they were pressed to do it .
Today , Comcast officially announced a 250 GB cap , while threatening to disconnect users who exceed this limit more than once .
Comcast is taking the heat once again , but they are not the only ISP that limits its users .
Other ISPs , Qwest being one of them , have exactly the same policy - and the same threats .
The 250GB bandwidth limit that Comcast has announced is not as new as it may seem .
For several months , even years , Comcast subscribers who went over an “ unspecified limit ” have been contacted by the ISP .
Customers are presented with two options : cut back their bandwidth use , or find a new provider .
Today , however , they officially announced a 250 GB limit , perhaps in an attempt to be more transparent about their network management practices .
We ’ve wrote before that ISPs are looking for new ways to manage their network by introducing bandwidth caps and metered plans .
Although we ’re not in favor of it , we have to applaud Comcast for being open about it .
Most other ISPs have similar policies , limiting their unlimited services , but they seem to get away with it .
One of these ISPs is Qwest , one of the larger Internet providers in the western United States , who forces customers to accept an invisible 250 GB cap .
Qwest ’s approach is quite aggressive to say the least .
When customers reach the magic limit , their web traffic is is redirected to an “ excessive use ” page .
The page informs the customer that they “ noticed extremely high usage ” on their Qwest Broadband account .
The notification blocks all HTTP access from your computer , making it impossible to access any website .
In order to proceed and release the block on your system , customers must acknowledge notification on this web page , and agree to a new service agreement .
There are no other options , no personal phone calls , no further explanation what acceptable use is , or how customers can track their usage .
The new service agreement , dated August 12 , 2008 ( pdf ) , allows Qwest to limit your use in any way they see fit , and even terminate your service when the customer exceeds the ( invisible ) limit again .
Note that Qwest does not specify how much bandwith customers are allowed to use .
They only state ( pdf ) that “ normal ” subscribers use 1 - 3 GB a month ( oh really ? ) , and that 40.000 – 80.000 typically sized MP3 downloads is considered to be excessive use .
Comcast ’s MP3 limit 250 GB limit comes down to 62,500 4 MB MP3s , so it is safe to say that Qwest has a bandwidth cap that is similar to Comcast – 250 GB .
Unlike Comcast , excessive use is not specified anywhere in the service agreement , so customers can only guess , and hope that their service will not be limited or terminated out of the blue .
One of the affected Qwest users , who tipped us off , told TorrentFreak : “ Since Qwest holds a monopoly in many areas , they can continue to reduce allowed bandwidth usage as they add new users while not adding new infrastructure .
Such radical bandwidth limitation will have a chilling effect on further evolution of the Internet .
If people ca n’t get bandwidth , then they ca n’t use bandwidth intensive services such as YouTube and Netflix .
We may never know what the future could have been . ”
Indeed , as we have said before , ISPs should think ahead .
To most “ normal ” customers 250 GB may sound as a lot of bandwidth , but this might be totally different in the future .
Making an online backup of your harddrive is pretty much impossible with a bandwidth cap like this , so will HD - streaming .
It hinders innovation while it ’s ignoring the real problem .
ISPs should invest in their network instead , but I guess it ’s not only the entertainment industry that finds it hard to adapt to technological change .
The US Internal Revenue Service is putting tax payers at risk by operating thousands of web servers that contain security vulnerabilities or have not received proper authorization , a new report has concluded .
According to the Treasury Inspector for the Tax Administration - a Treasury Department watchdog - the IRS operates 2,093 web servers with at least one vulnerability .
It said 540 of those servers contained one or more vulnerabilities rated high risk .
The report identified 1,811 internal servers that had not been approved to connect to the network .
Some 1,150 of those were being used for non-business purposes .
Under IRS rules , all internal websites and servers must be registered with the agency 's Modernization and Information Technology Services organization .
" Unauthorized servers pose a greater risk because the IRS has no way to ensure that they will be continually configured in accordance with security standards and patched when new vulnerabilities are identified , " the report 's authors wrote .
" Malicious hackers or employees could exploit the vulnerabilities on these web servers to manipulate data on the servers or to use the servers as launch points to attack other computers connected to the network . "
Examples of high - risk vulnerabilities included buffer overflow weaknesses and servers that used blank passwords .
The authors blamed the vulnerabilities on employees who failed to carry out duties as required .
The report offered five recommendations that included assigning responsibility for registration of specific servers , the blocking of unauthorized servers from the IRS network and an annual scan of the network to identify all machines that are connected .
The full report is available here . ®

Honor is not the exclusive property of any political party .
Herbert Clark Hoover ( 10 August 1874 – 20 October 1964 ) was the 31st President of the United States ( 1929 –33 ) .
He was a professional mining engineer and was raised as a Quaker .
A Republican , Hoover served as head of the U.S. Food Administration during World War I , and became internationally known for humanitarian relief efforts in war - time Belgium .
As the United States Secretary of Commerce in the 1920s under Presidents Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge , he promoted partnerships between government and business under the rubric " economic modernization " .
In the presidential election of 1928 , Hoover easily won the Republican nomination , despite having no elected - office experience .
Hoover is the most recent cabinet secretary to be elected President of the United States , as well as one of only three Presidents ( along with William Howard Taft and Donald Trump ) elected without electoral experience or high military rank .
Quotes [ edit ]
Food will win the war .
Slogan unveiled by then - food administrator Hoover on 29 September 1917 , reported in the NY Times 1 October 1917 , p. 15 .
Nor are liberal ideals alone sufficient :
Ours is a practical people , to whom ideals furnish the theory of political action , upon which they want not only firm assurance , but also effective practice .
They want programmes , but they want action to flow from them .
They want constructive common sense .
They want the development of the common will , not the views of a single individual .
They are beginning to realize that words without action are the assassins of idealism .
On the other side , they are equally disgusted with seeking for power by destructive criticism , demagoguery , specious promises and sham .
Excerpt from a statement to the New York Tribune concerning the 1920 Presidential campaign ( 29 April 1920 )
On the other side , they are equally disgusted with seeking for power by destructive criticism , demagoguery , specious promises and sham .
I see no reason why such a body should have any power that leads to supergovernment , or that in any way minimizes the very essential principle of nationalism upon which our patriotism and progress is founded .
Comment about the League of Nations in 1922 Herbert Hoover and Economic Diplomacy : Department of Commerce Policy , 1921 - 1928
You convey too great a compliment when you say that I have earned the right to the presidential nomination .
No man can establish such an obligation upon any part of the American people .
My country owes me no debt .
It gave me , as it gives every boy and girl , a chance .
It gave me schooling , independence of action , opportunity for service and honor .
In no other land could a boy from a country village , without inheritance or influential friends , look forward with unbounded hope .
My whole life has taught me what America means .
I am indebted to my country beyond any human power to repay .
Letter to Senator George H. Moses , chairman of the Republican national convention , upon learning of his nomination for president ( 14 June 1928 ) ; reported in The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover ( 1952 ) , volume 2 , p. 195 .
In no other land could a boy from a country village , without inheritance or influential friends , look forward with unbounded hope .
My whole life has taught me what America means .
I am indebted to my country beyond any human power to repay .
I have ... instituted systematic , voluntary measures of cooperation with the business institutions and with State and municipal authorities to make certain that fundamental businesses of the country shall continue as usual , that wages and therefore consuming power shall not be reduced , and that a special effort shall be made to expand construction work in order to assist in equalizing other deficits in employment ...
I am convinced that through these measures we have reestablished confidence .
Wages should remain stable .
A very large degree of industrial unemployment and suffering which would otherwise have occurred has been prevented .
Agricultural prices have reflected the returning confidence .
The measures taken must be vigorously pursued until normal conditions are restored .
State of the Union Address ( 3 December 1929 )
While the crash only took place six months ago , I am convinced we have now passed the worst and with continued unity of effort we shall rapidly recover .
There is one certainty of the future of a people of the resources , intelligence and character of the people of the United States — that is , prosperity .
Address at annual dinner of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States ( 1 May 1930 ) .
Hoover is sometimes misreported as having said on this occasion or another , " Prosperity is just around the corner " ; reported in Paul F. Boller , Jr. , and John George , They Never Said It : A Book of Fake Quotes , Misquotes , & Misleading Attributions ( 1989 ) , p. 48 .
The American people are doing their job today .
They should be given a chance to show whether they wish to preserve the principles of individual and local responsibility and mutual self - help before they embark on what I believe to be a disastrous system .
I feel sure they will succeed if given the opportunity .
Press statement ( 3 February 1931 )
What the country needs is a good big laugh .
...
If someone could get off a good joke every ten days , I think our troubles would be over .
Statement to Raymond Clapper ( c. February 1931 )
Older men declare war .
But it is youth that must fight and die .
If , by the grace of God , we have passed the worst of this storm , the future months will be easy .
If we shall be called upon to endure more of this period , we must gird ourselves for even greater effort , for today we are writing the introduction to the future history of civilization in America .
The question is whether that history shall be written in terms of individual responsibility , and the capacity of the Nation for voluntary cooperative action , or whether it shall be written in terms of futile attempt to cure poverty by the enactment of law , instead of the maintained and protected initiative of our people .

Address to the Nebraska Republican Conference , Lincoln , Nebraska ( 16 January 1936 )
We chatter to - day of reactionaries , conservatives , liberals , and radicals .
It is true that mental attitudes can be classified on this gamut , but in their application as political labels in the United States they have been wholly distorted .
For instance , the term ‘ liberal ’ flows from the word ‘ liberty ’ ; it does not come from the word ‘ coercion . ’
Yet the New Deal has camouflaged itself with this honored term .
Of course the dictionary also gives a definition of ‘ liberal ’ which connotes giving generously and spending freely .
This attracts many people , but the dictionary means liberality with one ’s own money .
A ‘ reactionary ’ in ordinary times is a gentleman who wants to reëstablish the status quo ante .
The New Deal wants to do precisely that — as a matter of fact it is status quo George III or Diocletian .
This process has now attained the label of ‘ liberal . ’

In every single case before the rise of totalitarian governments there had been a period dominated by economic planners .
Each of these nations had an era under starry - eyed men who believed that they could plan and force the economic life of the people .
They believed that was the way to correct abuse or to meet emergencies in systems of free enterprise .
They exalted the State as the solvent of all economic problems .
These men thought they were liberals .
But they also thought they could have economic dictatorship by bureaucracy and at the same time preserve free speech , orderly justice and free government .
They might be called the totalitarian liberals .
They were the spiritual fathers of the New Deal .
These men are not Communists or Fascists .

In my public statements I have earnestly urged that there rested upon government many responsibilities which affect the moral and spiritual welfare of our people .
The participation of women in elections has produced a keener realization of the importance of these questions and has contributed to higher national ideals .
Moreover , it is through them that our national ideals are ingrained in our children .
Speech accepting the Republican Party Presidential nomination , Stanford University ( 11 August 1928 ) [ edit ]
One of the oldest and perhaps the noblest of human aspirations has been the abolition of poverty .
By poverty I mean the grinding by undernourishment , cold and ignorance and fear of old age of those who have the will to work .
We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land .
The poorhouse is vanishing from among us .
We have not yet reached the goal , but given a chance to go forward with the policies of the last eight years , and [ sic ] we shall soon with the help of God be in sight of the day when poverty will be banished from this Nation .
There is no guarantee against poverty equal to a job for every man .
That is the primary purpose of the economic policies we advocate .
Campaign speech in New York ( 22 October 1928 ) [ edit ]
Liberalism should be found not striving to spread bureaucracy but striving to set bounds to it .
Bureaucracy is ever desirous of spreading its influence and its power .
You cannot extend the mastery of the government over the daily working life of a people without at the same time making it the master of the people 's souls and thoughts .
Every expansion of government in business means that government in order to protect itself from the political consequences of its errors and wrongs is driven irresistibly without peace to greater and greater control of the nation 's press and platform .
Free speech does not live many hours after free industry and free commerce die .
Liberalism should be found not striving to spread bureaucracy but striving to set bounds to it .
True liberalism seeks all legitimate freedom first in the confident belief that without such freedom the pursuit of all other blessings and benefits is vain .
That belief is the foundation of all American progress , political as well as economic .
The American people from bitter experience have a rightful fear that great business units might be used to dominate our industrial life and by illegal and unethical practices destroy equality of opportunity ...
Our people are steadily increasing their spending for higher standards of living .
Today there are almost nine automobiles for each ten families , where seven and one - half years ago only enough automobiles were running to average less than four for each ten families .
The slogan of progress is changing from the full dinner pail to the full garage .
Our people have more to eat , better things to wear , and better homes .
Wages have increased , the cost of living has decreased .
The job of every man and woman has been made more secure .
We have in this short period decreased the fear of poverty , the fear of unemployment , the fear of old age ; and these fears that are the greatest calamities of human kind .
My conception of America is a land where men and women may walk in ordered freedom in the independent conduct of their occupations ; where they may enjoy the advantages of wealth , not concentrated in the hands of the few but spread through the lives of all ; where they build and safeguard their homes , and give to their children the fullest advantages and opportunities of American life ; where every man shall be respected in the faith that his conscience and his heart direct him to follow ; where a contented and happy people , secure in their liberties , free from poverty and fear , shall have the leisure and impulse to seek a fuller life .
Some may ask where all this may lead beyond mere material progress .
It leads to a release of the energies of men and women from the dull drudgery of life to a wider vision and a higher hope .
It leads to the opportunity for greater and greater service , not alone from man in our own land , but from our country to the whole world .
It leads to an America , healthy in body , healthy in spirit , unfettered , youthful , eager — with a vision searching beyond the farthest horizons , with an open mind , sympathetic and generous .
The Challenge to Liberty ( 1934 ) [ edit ]
The high tenet of this philosophy ( Liberalism ) is that Liberty is an endowment from the Creator of every individual man and woman upon which no power , whether economic or political , can encroach , and that not even the government may deny .
And herein it challenges all other philosophies of society and government ; for all others , both before and since , insist that the individual has no such unalienable rights , that he is but the servant of the state .
Liberalism holds that man is master of the state , not the servant ; that the sole purpose of government is to nurture and assure these liberties .
All others insist that Liberty is not a God - given right ; that the state is the master of the man .
Page 4
In order that there can be no doubt as to its antithesis to Liberalism , we may well accept Premier Mussolini ’s definition of Fascism : . . .
‘ Granted that the nineteenth century was the century of Socialism , of Liberalism and Democracy . . . it may rather be expected that this will be the century of authority , a century of the left , a century of Fascism ; for if the nineteenth century was a century of individualism ( Liberalism always signifying individualism ) it may be expected that this will be the century of collectivism , and hence the century of the state .

Quotations from Hoover Off the Record ( 1934 ) by Theodore G. Joslin
So far as the personal side is concerned , the victory was to him who lost and the defeat to him who won .
I can say that never in the last fifteen years have I had the peace of mind that I have since the election .
I have almost a feeling of elation .
On losing the presidency to Franklin Delano Roosevelt
The President is not only the leader of a party , he is the President of the whole people .
He must interpret the conscience of America .
He must guide his conduct by the idealism of our people .
This is not a showman ’s job .
I will not step out of character .
Prosperity cannot be restored by raids upon the public Treasury .
The Hoover Policies ( 1937 ) [ edit ]
The Hoover Policies ( 1937 ) by Ray Lyman Wilbur and Arthur N. Hyde
It does not follow , because our difficulties are stupendous , because there are some souls timorous enough to doubt the validity and effectiveness of our ideals and our system , that we must turn to a state controlled or state directed social or economic system in order to cure our troubles .
No country can squander itself to prosperity on the ruin of its taxpayers .
As a nation we must prevent hunger and cold to those of our people who are in honest difficulties .
The basis of successful relief in national distress is to mobilize and organize the infinite number of agencies of self help in the community .
That has been the American way .
I am willing to pledge myself that if the time should ever come that the voluntary agencies of the country together with the local and state governments are unable to find resources with which to prevent hunger and suffering … I will ask the aid of every resource of the Federal Government ....
I have the faith in the American people that such a day will not come .
Our tasks are definite .
The first to see that no man , woman , or child shall go hungry or unsheltered through the approaching winter .
The second is to see that our great benevolent agencies for character building , for hospitalization , for care of children and all their vast number of agencies of voluntary solicitude for the less fortunate are maintained in full strength .
The third is to maintain the bedrock principle of our liberties by the full mobilization of individual and local resources and responsibilities .
The fourth is that we may maintain the spiritual impulses in our people for generous giving and generous service — in the spirit that each is his brother ’s keeper .
Reports to the Surgeon General ... represent the final word upon the efficient and devoted sense of responsibility of our people in this obligation to our fellow citizens .
Overwhelmingly they confirm the fact that the general mortality rate , infant mortality rate , epidemics , the disease rate — are less than in normal times .
There is but one explanation .
That is , that through an aroused sense of public responsibility , those in destitution and their children are receiving actually more adequate care than even in normal times .

[ Engineering ] is a great profession .
There is the fascination of watching a figment of the imagination emerge through the aid of science to a plan on paper .
Then it moves to realization in stone or metal or energy .
Then it brings jobs and homes to men .
Then it elevates the standards of living and adds to the comforts of life .
That is the engineer ’s high privilege .
The great liability of the engineer compared to men of other professions is that his works are out in the open where all can see them .
His acts , step by step , are in hard substance .
He cannot bury his mistakes in the grave like the doctors .
He cannot argue them into thin air or blame the judge like the lawyers .
He cannot , like the architects , cover his failures with trees and vines .
He cannot , like the politicians , screen his shortcomings by blaming his opponents and hope that the people will forget .
The engineer simply cannot deny that he did it .
If his works do not work , he is damned .
That is the phantasmagoria that haunts his nights and dogs his days .
He comes from the job at the end of the day resolved to calculate it again .
He wakes in the night in a cold sweat and puts something on paper that looks silly in the morning .
All day he shivers at the thought of the bugs which will inevitably appear to jolt its smooth consummation .
On the other hand , unlike the doctor his is not a life among the weak .
Unlike the soldier , destruction is not his purpose .
Unlike the lawyer , quarrels are not his daily bread .
To the engineer falls the job of clothing the bare bones of science with life , comfort , and hope .
No doubt as years go by people forget which engineer did it , even if they ever knew .
Or some politician puts his name on it .
Or they credit it to some promoter who used other people ’s money with which to finance it .
But the engineer himself looks back at the unending stream of goodness which flows from his successes with satisfactions that few professions may know .
And the verdict of his fellow professionals is all the accolades he wants .

The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover : The Great Depression , 1929 - 1941 ( 1952 ) [ edit ]
In the large sense the primary cause of the Great Depression was the war of 1914 - 1918 .
Without the war there would have been no depression of such dimensions .
There might have been a normal cyclical recession ; but , with the usual timing , even that readjustment probably would not have taken place at that particular period , nor would it have been a " Great Depression . " p. 2 : Lead paragraph Chapter 1 : The origins of the Depression .
Every collectivist revolution rides in on a Trojan horse of ' emergency ' .
It was the tactic of Lenin , Hitler , and Mussolini .
In the collectivist sweep over a dozen minor countries of Europe , it was the cry of men striving to get on horseback .
And ' emergency ' became the justification of the subsequent steps .
This technique of creating emergency is the greatest achievement that demagoguery attains ...
The invasion of New Deal Collectivism was introduced by this same Trojan horse .
p. 357
The recognition of Russia on November 16 , 1933 , started forces which were to have considerable influence in the attempt to collectivize the United States .

Herbert Hoover , 1874 - 1964 ( 1971 ) [ edit ]
Herbert Hoover , 1874 - 1964 : Chronology - Documents - Bibliographical Aids ( 1971 ) Edited by Arnold S. Rice
Economic depression can not be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement .
I would emphasize again that social and economic solutions , as such , will not avail to satisfy the aspirations of the people unless they conform with the traditions of our race , deeply grooved in their sentiments through a century and a half of struggle for ideals of life that are rooted in religion and fed from purely spiritual springs .
I am firmly opposed to the government entering into any business the major purpose of which is competition with our citizens ... for the Federal Government deliberately to go out to build up and expand ... a power and manufacturing business is to break down the initiative and enterprise of the American people ; it is the destruction of equality of opportunity amongst our people , it is the negation of the ideals upon which our civilization has been based .
On vetoing the " Muscle Shoals Bill " which was the seed for the later creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority
In no nation are the institutions of progress more advanced .
In no nation are the fruits of accomplishment more secure .
In no nation is the government more worthy of respect .
No country is more loved by its people .
I have an abiding faith in their capacity , integrity and high purpose .
I have no fears for the future of our country .
It is bright with hope .
In the larger view the major forces of the depression now lie outside of the United States , and our recuperation has been retarded by the unwarranted degree of fear and apprehension created by these outside forces .

The Uncommon Man [ edit ]
When we are sick , we want an uncommon doctor ; when we have a construction job to do , we want an uncommon engineer , and when we are at war , we want an uncommon general .
It is only when we get into politics that we are satisfied with the common man .

Quotes about Hoover [ edit ]
The day the stock market crashed - October 8 , 1929 - will forever be etched on the Etch a Sketch of American consciousness as " the day the stock market crashed , " or sometimes " Black Tuesday . "
For on that fateful day , the nation 's seemingly prosperous economy was revealed to be merely a paper tiger with feet of clay living in a straw house of cards that had cried " wolf " once too often .
Although this would not become clear for some time .
Oh , there had been warning signs .
Just a few weeks before Black Tuesday , there had been Mauve Wednesday , which was followed , only two days later , by Dark Navy Blue with Thin Diagonal Yellow Stripes Friday .
But most Americans paid little heed to these events , choosing instead to believe the comforting words of President Herbert Hoover Dam , who , in a reassuring nationwide broadcast , said , " Everybody STAY CALM , because there is NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT !
Do you HEAR ME ??
NOTHING !!
HA - HA - HA - HA - HA - HA - HA [ click ] . "

HA -HA - HA - HA - HA -HA -HA [ ] . "
And yet , as the weeks dragged into months and the economy continued to founder , it soon became clear that some economic " medicine " even more potent than THE HAWLEY - SMOOT TARIFF would be needed to get the nation " back on its feet . "
This paved the way for the historic election of 1932 .
The Republicans , showing the kind of sensitivity they are famous for , renominated President Hoover Dam , who pledged that , if reelected , he would flee to the Bahamas .
The Democrats countered by nominated President Franklin Delano Roosevelt , or , as he was affectionately known , " J.F.K . " - who ran under the slogan " Let 's Elect Another President Named Roosevelt and Confuse the Hell out of Future Generations of Students . "
The voters responded overwhelmingly , and Roosevelt was elected in a mammoth landslide t hat unfortunately left him confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life .
Dave Barry , Dave Barry Slept Here : A Sort of History of the United States ( 1989 ) , p. 115
He is certainly a wonder , and I wish we could make him President of the United States .
There could n't be a better one .

Hoover was hardworking , incorruptible , self - assured and self - reliant .
But he was also aloof , shy , wary of crowds , awkward at superficial social relations , and extremely sensitive to criticism .
" It was , " biographer David Burner has written , " perhaps the private man 's shrinkage from rough political contact , the predilection for working by himself , and the habit of perceiving problems as requiring rational , impersonal solutions that made Hoover uncomfortable with the rude , demanding Congress as well as with the press . "
Hoover was often curt with subordinates .
A model of efficiency himself , he expected the same of others .
Characteristically , he concentrated on detail rather than on the broader significance of a problem .
He was a dull speaker , rarely lifting his eyes from the prepared text .

The spectacle of the United States Army routing unarmed citizens with tanks and firebrands outraged many Americans .
The Bonus Army episode came to symbolize Hoover 's supposed insensitivity to the plight of the unemployed .
In fact the worst violence , resulting in two deaths , had come at the hands of the district police , not the federal troops , and the blame for the torching of Anacostia Flats was MacArthur 's , not Hoover 's .
But Hoover chose to ignore MacArthur 's insubordination and assumed full responsibility for the army 's actions .

To White House visitors , the President by this time seemed prematurely aged .
He kept up a punishing regimen of rising at six and working without interruption until nearly midnight .
His clothes were disheveled , his hair rumpled , eyes bloodshot , complexion ashen .
He grew increasingly testy and brittle .
" How I wish I could cheer up the poor old President , " wrote the venerable Stimson , Hoover 's senior by seven years .
Never temperamentally suited to the pelting and abuse of the political arena , a man naturally diffident and inordinately self - protective , Hoover was painfully bruised by blows from both the left and the right .
As early as 1919 he had conceded that " I do not ... have the mental attitude or the politician 's manner ... and above all I am too sensitive for political mud . "
By the fall of 1932 he had lost all stomach for political campaigning .
He took to the hustings only in October and seemed to campaign more for vindication in the historical record than for affection in the hearts of voters .
Just four years earlier he had won one of the most lopsided victories in the history of presidential elections .
Now he took an even worse drubbing than he had given Al Smith .
On November 8 , 1932 , Hoover won just six states .
The Great Engineer , so recently the most revered American , was the most loathed and scorned figure in the country .
All eyes now looked to his successor , Franklin D. Roosevelt .
David M. Kennedy , Freedom From Fear : The American People in Depression and War , 1929 - 1945 ( 1999 ) , p. 94
Hoover brought a corporate executive 's sensibility to the White House .
Roosevelt brought a politician's .
Hoover as president frequently dazzled visitors with his detailed knowledge and expert understanding of American business .
" His was a mathematical brain , " sad his admiring secretary , Theodore Joslin .
" Let banking officials , for instance , come into his office and he would rattle off the number of banks in the country , list their liabilities and assets , describe the trend of fiscal affairs , and go into the liquidity , or lack of it , of individual institutions , all from memory . "
Roosevelt , in contrast , impressed his visitors by asking them to draw a line across a map of the United States .
He would then name , in order , every county through which the line passed , adding anecdotes about each localities political peculiarities .
David M. Kennedy , Freedom From Fear : The American People in Depression and War , 1929 - 1945 ( 1999 ) , p. 94-95
Hoover 's application of " volunteerism " to manage natural resources ... proved no more successful than his application of " volunteerism " to stem the downward spiral of the Great Depression and rejuvenate the economy .
The complexity and urgency of the nation 's economic problems were too great for a solution based on voluntary cooperation .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The commodities bubble appears to have popped , but keep the champagne on ice .
Food and energy prices are coming down in part because of a global growth slowdown that could also cool the red hot U.S. export sector - the major bright spot in an economy still struggling with a massive housing bust .
The prices of energy , metals and food have tumbled this summer after a yearlong surge .
Crude oil , after racing toward $ 150 in July , recently fetched less than $ 110 a barrel , while the price of natural gas has tumbled 41 % over three months .
A big commodities trader , Ospraie Management , is shutting its biggest hedge fund after a 38 % loss tied to wrong - way bets on natural gas and other materials .
The commodities selloff is welcome news to consumers who have seen the prices of gasoline and milk slip back under $ 4 a gallon , easing fears that inflation is on the loose .
If prices keep sliding , year - over - year inflation numbers - after hitting a 17 - year high last month - could soon look much healthier , reducing fears that the Federal Reserve may have to raise interest rates to stamp out rising inflation expectations .
But if an ebb in inflation fears is welcome , the source of that shift could be more problematic .
' The brink of recession '
" Several major economies are on the brink of recession , " economists at Societe Generale wrote Wednesday .
They went on to say that the once popular notion of " decoupling , " which held that global growth was so strong that a U.S. slowdown need n't spread elsewhere , now looks dated .
As do the inflationary pressures that accompany rapid growth .
If the growth party is over around the world , the U.S. export boom will quickly fizzle .
Certainly it has become clear that the ills afflicting the American economy - a consumer burdened by heavy debt taken on in years of outspending current income - are far from unique to these shores .
The U.K. is seeing house prices tumble at a double - digit pace , prompting Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling to say the downturn in the British economy will be " more profound and long - lasting " than people expect .
South Korea has seen the value of its currency tumble amid rumors the nation could face a capital crisis this month , amid slowing growth that has led to a modest trade deficit .
Even in economies less troubled by outsize levels of household debt , there have been signs of stress .
Manufacturing activity has been contracting in China , and Japan appears headed for a recession .
A pullback by some of its overseas customers offers the latest bit of unhappy news for the U.S. economy , which this year has continued to grow - if only tepidly - in large measure thanks to slowing imports and rising exports .
The U.S. government said last week that gross domestic product rose 3.3 % in the second quarter , up sharply from an earlier estimate of 1.9 % growth .
But Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg notes that 85 % of the revision came from an upward estimate to net exports and a lower estimate for inventory liquidation .
The halo effect from exports could already be wearing off .
Rosenberg says the second - quarter GDP data showed U.S. corporate profits from foreign sources dropped 15 % from first - quarter levels , due to softer worldwide economic conditions .
He expects to see more of the same in coming quarters , as foreign profits slip under the pressure of a stronger dollar , which increases the price of U.S. goods overseas .
Meanwhile analysts at UBS note some of the recent export gains may be fleeting because the U.S. has been a major exporter of agricultural goods .
While the U.S. has benefited from higher prices of corn , wheat and other farm products , a slide in those prices could trim the gains .
" Food and beverage exports now account for 18 % of the growth in exports from the U.S. , " analysts at UBS wrote last week , " up from an average of little more than 2 % of export growth at the start of the decade . "
Stocks look expensive
One last factor complicating the prospects for a U.S. economic recovery is the outlook for stocks .
Blue - chip stocks indexed in the S&P 500 recently traded at nearly 26 times their reported profits over the past year , according to Bloomberg data .
That 's their highest valuation in five years , even as the recent surge in Treasury prices - 10 - year yields have dropped half a percentage point in six weeks , to a recent 3.7 % - suggests the fear trade is alive and well .
William Larkin , a fixed - income portfolio manager at Cabot Money Management in Salem , Mass. , notes that the move into Treasury securities comes just ahead of the start of third - quarter earnings season for financial firms such as Lehman Brothers ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) .
Any selloff in stocks , beyond the effects transmitted to other financial markets , could further depress consumer spending stateside .
" There 's a real disconnect out there , " says Larkin .
" Equity markets could be in flux for a while . "

Being a language fanatic , I was really excited when I met a really smart guy named Corey Kosak who gave me a tour of C# 's newest features .
I had heard a lot of good things about C# lately , including that it had been strongly influenced by Haskell , which makes sense since Microsoft actually funds research on Haskell .
Anyway , a lot of C# 's newest features are a lot more like Python than Java .
Let me show you some examples .
Here is a sample C# iterator :
In Python , I 'd write : C# also iterators that are similar to Python 's generators .
Here is the C# :
In Python , I 'd write : C# 's LINQ syntax is similar to Python 's generator expressions .
Here 's the C# :
In Python , I 'd write :
Here 's a pretty amazing example that ties a lot of things together .
It shows LINQ , a " group by " clause , an anonymous but strongly - typed class ( " new {...} " ) , and even some type inferencing ( " var item " and " item. FirstChar " ) Corey said that C# 's type inferencing is still pretty basic .
It can figure out the type of a local variable , but it 's definitely not as sophisticated as ML 's type system .
Also note that the anonymous class is more impressive that an inner class in Java because it did n't require you to use a name or an interface .
" Loosely translated " , in Python I 'd write : C# 's Select method can be used like map in Python .
Notice the use of an anonymous function !
In Python , I 'd write : The C# version runs lazily ( i.e. " on the fly " ) , which means it only computes as much as requested .
Python 's map function is n't lazy .
However , itertools.imap is .
The above example can also be written in LINQ style :
In Python I 'd write : Both the C# and the Python are lazy in this case .
If you do n't want newInts to be lazy , you can do : orIn Python , I 'd write : Since C# has anonymous functions , it should come as no surprise that it also has nested scopes and first - class functions ( i.e. you can return a function ) .
Although you can't nest named functions , it 's easy enough to fake with anonymous functions :
In Python , I 'd write : C# also has closures : Python has closures too .
( There 's a small caveat here .
You can modify a variable that 's in an outer scope , but there 's no syntax for rebinding that variable .
Python 3000 fixes this with the introduction of a nonlocal keyword .
In the meantime , it 's trivial to work around this problem . ) :
C# 's generics are a bit more powerful than Java 's generics since they do n't suffer from erasure .
I can't say I 'm an expert on the subject .
Nonetheless , I 'm pretty sure you can't easily translate this example into Java .
It creates a new instance of the same class as the instance that was passed as a parameter : Corey told me that while C# 's generics are stronger than Java 's generics , they still were n't as strong as C++'s generics since C++ generics act in an almost macro - like way .
Python has duck typing , so it does n't have or need generics .
Here 's what I would write in Python : Unfortunately , those are all the examples I have , but let me mention a few other things he showed me .
C# has a method called Aggregate that is the same as what other languages called inject or reduce .
C# has Lisp - like macros !
You can pass an AST ( abstract syntax tree ) around , play with it , and then compile it at runtime .
C# has an interesting feature called " extension methods " .
They 're somewhat like a mixin or reopening a class in Ruby .
Using an extension method , you can set things up so that you can write " 5. Minutes ( ) " .
Unlike a mixin or reopening a class , they 're pure syntax and do not actually affect the class .
Hence , the above translates to something like " SomeClass . Minutes ( 5 ) " .
Although " 5 " looks like the object being acted upon , it 's really just a parameter to a static method .
Another thing that impressed me was just how hard Visual Studio works to keep your whitespace neat .
It does n't just indent your code .
It also adds whitespace within your expressions .
Ok , that 's it .
As usual , I hope you 've enjoyed a look at another language .
I 'd like to thank Corey Kosak for sending me the C# code .
If I 've gotten anything wrong , please do not be offended , just post a correction in the comments .

Stuart Shepard of Focus on the Family says he was aiming at being “ mildly humorous ” in his video asking “ lots of people ” to pray for “ torrential ” rain two minutes before Obama gives his outdoor acceptance speech , an aim I think Shepard achieved :
Apparently , this video has gotten some people bent out of shape , but I think we ought to take Shepard up on it .
He says that even though some other people will be praying that the weather be clear and mild , “ it ’s not a contest . ”
Well , why not ?
Let ’s have a good old - fashioned Ba’al smackdown .
Let ’s all put on our prayer caps * , and if there is n’t a torrential rain exactly two minutes before Obama speaks , we ’ll know which side G -d is on .
Then , both sides can stop campaigning as the voters dutifully ratify G -d ’s will .
So , no torrential rain two minutes before Obama speaks means the Republicans have to acknowledge that the Creator prefers the Democrat .
I ’m ready to take that bet !
* Attire may vary by religion .
Consult your local priest , rabbi , imam , or Tom Cruise for details .
Children of G -d are ineligible to enter .
In case of dispute , whether the rain was “ torrential ” will be decided by an interfaith panel of meteorologists .
“ Two minutes before ” will be interpreted as meaning two minutes before Obama is standing on his network - assigned mark .
Given G -d ’s well - known punctuality , but factoring in the time it takes for rain to descend , there will be a 3 second grace period given , so to speak .
In case of tie , the winner will be decided by seeing whether the Republican convention is hit with a plague of lobbyists .

At the Department of Justice Amerithrax Investigation Press Conference August 6 , 2008 , the following question was asked :
QUESTION : “ Do you think there 's a connection between Ivins and what was known at the time of the Quantico letter ?
There was a letter sent in September of 2001 identifying an Arab - American scientist at Fort Detrick as a bioterrorist .
The letter also threatened a bioterror attack and also death to Israel .
Were you ever satisfied that you were able to run down that letter and the author of that letter ? ”
MR. TAYLOR : “ I 'm not aware of any connection .
To my knowledge , there 's no evidence linking the two . ”
Note that he does n’t answer this part of the question , “ Were you ever satisfied that you were able to run down that letter and the author of that letter ? ”
The Arab - American scientist being referred to is Ayaad Assaad , who the FBI cleared of any possible connection to the 2001 Anthrax attacks .
The letter portrayed him as a potential biological terrorist and revealed detailed knowledge of his work and personal life .
Although Assaad was allowed to read the letter during his interrogation by the FBI after they received it , the FBI is still blocking its release , although it has been requested under FOIA .
If there ’s no evidence linking Bruce Ivins to this letter , which was sent BEFORE the Anthrax outbreak , then who sent it ?
And why are the FBI and DOJ so uninterested ?
According to this report in the Hartford - Courant December 19 , 2001 :
“ FBI spokesman Chris Murray confirmed Tuesday that Assaad has been cleared of suspicion .
Murray also said the FBI is not tracking the source of the anonymous letter , despite its curious timing , coming a matter of days before the existence of anthrax - laced mail became known . ”
As Justin Raimond observes in an article on Antiwar.com , “ It is surely not implausible to suggest that whoever sent the letter had foreknowledge of or some connection to the anthrax attacks , and was trying to set up Dr. Assaad as the scapegoat .
The Courant article goes on to note that this mysterious missive , " which has intrigued federal agents and amateur sleuths on the Internet for years , " has nonetheless been officially discounted by the authorities : " Federal investigators have always maintained that the letter – while a startling coincidence – has no bearing on their hunt for the anthrax killer . "
This letter , like the Anthrax letters , falsely attempts to pin biological terror attacks in the US on Arabs and Muslims .
It ’s theoretically possible it ’s only a “ startling coincidence ” that this attempt to frame an innocent Arab man was done independently of the post 9/11 “ false - flag ” Anthrax attacks , and of the post - Anthrax attacks attempt by ABC and unnamed “ government scientists " to falsely pin the attacks on Iraq - but how did the Feds arrive at that conclusion ?
If they ’ve interviewed the person or people who sent the letter and cleared them of any connection , why do n’t they say so ?
Is it because they know who sent the letter , they are connected with the attacks , and they ’re being protected ?
Is there any connection between this person or people and the apparent foreknowledge in the White House that there would be an Anthrax attack in the US ?

SAN ANTONIO ( IndexRx ) -- I just finished a telephone conversation with a friend who works for a large brokerage firm .
He describes the typical mindset among his clients at the moment as one of panic and despair .
The average investor , it seems , is considering giving up on the stock market and burying his money under a mattress ( or in money - market funds ) .
Should you , too , be thinking about the exit ?
At times like these , I always turn to history .
By historical standards , Monday 's 504 - point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % was indeed large -- the 86th - largest one - day percentage loss since 1928 , and the 17th - biggest since World War II .
Does this mean it 's time to jump ship ?
To answer , let 's look at the 16 postwar declines that were larger and ask the following question :
What happened afterward ?
The answer may surprise you .
It should certainly prevent you from shouting panicked sell orders at your broker .
I calculated several averages for all 16 declines that were larger than Monday 's 4.4 % drop .
On average , the Dow was 10.4 % higher six months after the decline , 13.8 % higher one year after , 27 % higher two years after , and 45.6 % higher five years after .
By contrast , investing in the Dow on any random day from Jan. 2 , 1946 , through Monday 's decline would have yielded 37.9 % over on average over a five - year period .
Some would argue that Monday 's drop was not large enough .
In other words , the market had not " capitulated " and thus was likely to see further declines .
This may well be the case .
But , interestingly enough , if we again crunch some numbers for the 16 largest one - day declines , the correlation between the size of the initial decline and the size of the subsequent rise , though negative , was relatively low .
R-squared statistics are small ( 0.01 , 0.05 , 0.18 , and 0.05 for six - months , one - year , two - year , and five - year periods , respectively ) .
One way to interpret this is that , as long as the drop is large , it does n't seem to matter how large -- the market is likely to bounce back strongly in the near future .
So , if history is any guide , you would be foolish to succumb to panic .
In fact , you might even want to increase your holdings .
Notice that for periods of up to two years , the market has tended to perform far better than usual following large declines .
Given the worry that is all around , I doubt that most investors will be able to muster sufficient courage to follow this advice .
But for the few brave contrarians with the foresight to " buy when there is blood in the streets , " here 's a potential play : the Vanguard Real Estate Investment Trust Index VNQ , - 0.71 % .
That 's right .
Think about pouring some money straight into the sector that sparked the whole mess .
Following the dictates of our history - based trading algorithm , Index Rx recently purchased this fund with two of our model portfolios .
In the end , it 's a question of whom you 're going to trust -- the media , your own emotions or the guidance of history ?
I know which I 'm putting my money on .

ASP .NET : ASM to IL compiler Written by Bjarke Viksoe .
This article was submitted 8/25/2001 .
. NET vision .
Once again even respectable people are crying out that C++ and assembler programmers will become extinct dinosaurs .
My reaction to that is : " It 's not fair ! "
Why are they always picking on assembler programmers ?
We do n't do a lot of harm !
Just because we like to have total freedom and like to be close to our hardware does n't make us bad people .
Go pick on someone else ( like LISP programmers .
I do n't like them ) .

Frankly , I was getting a little tired of this whole discussion , so I decided to do something about it - by bringing x86 assembler programming into the .NET age .
Well , at least to allow ASP.
NET pages to be written in 80386 assembler .
To do just that , I 've written a compiler ( assembler ? ) that compiles 80386 assembler code into MSIL .
In other words , you get to write assembler programs that compiles into the same IL of the .NET 's Common Language Runtime that your fellow VisualBasic .
NET and C# developers are using .
So basically you can enjoy the thrill of low - level programming and still be compatible with your " oh , so modern " VB.NET friends .
What ?!
Yup , it 's true .
It 's really the x86 ( Intel 80386 actually ) instruction set that gets compiled into IL .
Literally it is an " 80386 Assembler scripting Language " for ASP .
NET .
Yup , it 's true .
It 's really the x86 ( Intel 80386 actually ) instruction set that gets compiled into IL .
Literally it is an " 80386 Assembler scripting Language " for ASP .
NET .
" Very Usefull " , you might think !
" Just the sort of thing you have been looking for " , I hear you say !
Thanks , I do my best to support my kindred spirits .
You use the compiler in ASP .
NET by replacing your usual VBScript .
NET script code with 80386 assembler instructions .
In addition you use the keyword Asm80386 as page language .
The compiler Short - term goal Because I did n't really want to spend too much time on this project , I set out a short - term goal : to create my first web - page in assembler .
That is , to be able to execute this ASP .
NET script : < %@ page language = " Asm80386 " %> <%
Str : DB " Testing ... " , 0 mov eax , - 2 cmp eax , 2 jle Label1 xor eax , eax Label1 : lea esi , Str push esi call " Response . Write ( string ) " pop esi %> < br>EAX : <%= eax %>
Instruction support
The following instructions are supported : NOP , MOV , LEA , CMP , TEST , ADD , SUB , XOR , NOT , NEG , INC , DEC , OR , AND , IMUL , IDIV , MUL , DIV , SAL , SHL , SAR , SHR , CBW , CWDE , CWD , CDQ , CLD , STD , CMC , STC , CLC , PUSH , POP , JMP , CALL , JE , JZ , JNE , JNZ , JS , JNS , JB , JNAE , JAE , JNB , JBE , JNA , JA , JNBE , JL , JNGE , JGE , JNL , JLE JNG , JG , JNL , JC , JNC , JCXZ , JECXZ Limitations
Not all operand constructs are supported .
Instructions , which are available in multiple forms ( such as IMUL ) only support 1 form .
Registers AL , AX and EAX types are supported - but AH and its friends are currently not .
There is no support for segments qualifiers , special 80386 + registers or any of the fancy prefix types ( REP or LOCK ) .
Since segment registers are not supported , a flat memory model is used .
The addressing form [ BX + SI ] is not supported .
The stack space is limited to 200 DWORD entries .
Use $ to denote hexadecimal .
ASP.NET debugging is awkward , but works .
The CALL instruction can handle CLS calls using quouted strings , but ordinary sub routines are not supported ( there is no RET support ) .
Plenty more limitations may apply .
How does it work Well , it basically compiles your ASM code into MSIL .
It 's not the entire story , but you 'll have to figure out exactly how it 's done yourself .
But what about ...
Direct memory access ?
Nothing has changed .
A security exception will tell you when you 're doing something wrong .
You 're only allowed access to your own data segment .
Pointers in .NET ?
Good point .
But pointers are not bad in .NET ( performance is , though ) .
Pointers are still there - they are just considered evil .
With 80386 scripting you can still generate memory exceptions and bring the web - server down .
It 's things like this that make assembler programmers feel powerful .
Access to the hardware ?
Yearh , well , you 'll just have to sacrifice something to be modern in the world we live in today .
Speed ?
Converting a language like 80386 assember to another low - level instruction set is , as you can imagine , not a healthy thing for code performance .
In other words , the performance suck big time .
What did you expect ?
This is what we have been trying to tell you guys for years and years and years .
Do the real thing - or you 'll just have to buy a faster computer .
Framework access ?
Like WinForms and stuff ?
Forget those .
They are high - level crap anyway .
There is basic access to some of the ASP.
NET object methods , but that 's all .
Is n't MSIL stackbased ?
Yes .
And that 's why this whole project will probably never become really popular amongst my fellow assembler programmers .
The generated code is simply too slow !
The future
The future still belongs to assembler programmer !
I 'm not sure I 'll ever get around to implement the entire instruction set or work out the details of how to manage classes and other .NET data - types ... but , well , who cares .

To the top
Mr. Paulson said on Friday that the problems were spawned by shaky and sometimes opaque real estate investments , driven by irresponsible lenders and borrowers .
Now , he said , vital streams of credit have been clogged , not just for big investors but also for families wanting to buy houses and cars and pay for tuition .

But if what Mr. Paulson told the lawmakers was similar to what he told the American public on Friday , he surely conveyed to them a sense of urgency , telling the legislators that the situation was too important for them to adjourn and go home to campaign , which many of them hoped to be doing by now .
President Bush and Mr. Paulson appealed for a bipartisan approach .
The president described this as “ a pivotal moment for America ’s economy ” and appealed to the collective resilience of the American people , which he said had sustained them over the last seven years through terrorist attacks , economic downturns and natural disasters .
“ We will weather this challenge too , and we must do so together , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ This is no time for partisanship . ”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Democrat of California , pledged on Friday that the House would act quickly , once it received the administration ’s proposal .
“ As I told the president this morning , we are committed to quick , bipartisan action while ensuring that we uphold key principles  insulating Main Street from Wall Street and keeping people in their homes by reducing mortgage foreclosures , restoring market confidence and protecting American taxpayers from incurring hundreds of billions of dollars of debt , ” Ms. Pelosi said in a statement .
Many members of Congress were looking forward to going home next week to campaign , but Ms. Pelosi said the legislators were prepared to stay in Washington if necessary to address “ this historic crisis . ”
What Mr. Paulson called the “ tactical steps ” taken by the government caused the markets to shoot up on Friday morning .
But deeper , long - range moves are necessary to address the causes of the crisis , he said .

Amazing revelations have emerged concerning already existing government plans to overhaul the way the internet functions in order to apply much greater restrictions and control over the web .
Lawrence Lessig , a respected Law Professor from Stanford University told an audience at this years Fortune ’s Brainstorm Tech conference in Half Moon Bay , California , that “ There ’s going to be an i - 9/11 event ” which will act as a catalyst for a radical reworking of the law pertaining to the internet .
Lessig also revealed that he had learned , during a dinner with former government Counter Terrorism Czar Richard Clarke , that there is already in existence a cyber equivalent of the Patriot Act , an “ i- Patriot Act ” if you will , and that the Justice Department is waiting for a cyber terrorism event in order to implement its provisions .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
During a group panel segment titled “ 2018 : Life on the Net ” , Lessig stated :
There ’s going to be an i-9/11 event .
Which does n’t necessarily mean an Al Qaeda attack , it means an event where the instability or the insecurity of the internet becomes manifest during a malicious event which then inspires the government into a response .
You ’ve got to remember that after 9/11 the government drew up the Patriot Act within 20 days and it was passed .
The Patriot Act is huge and I remember someone asking a Justice Department official how did they write such a large statute so quickly , and of course the answer was that it has been sitting in the drawers of the Justice Department for the last 20 years waiting for the event where they would pull it out .
Of course , the Patriot Act is filled with all sorts of insanity about changing the way civil rights are protected , or not protected in this instance .
So I was having dinner with Richard Clarke and I asked him if there is an equivalent , is there an i-Patriot
Act just sitting waiting for some substantial event as an excuse to radically change the way the internet works .
He said “ of course there is ” .
Watch Lessig reveal the details at 4.30 into the following video :
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Lessig is the founder of Stanford Law School ’s Center for Internet and Society .
He is founding board member of Creative Commons and is a board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and of the Software Freedom Law Center .
He is best known as a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on copyright , trademark and radio frequency spectrum , particularly in technology applications .
These are clearly not the ravings of some paranoid cyber geek .
The Patriot Act , as well as its lesser known follow up the Domestic Security Enhancement Act 2003 , also known as USA Patriot Act II , have been universally decried by civil libertarians and Constitutional scholars from across the political spectrum .
They have stripped back basic rights and handed what have been described by even the most moderate critics as “ dictatorial control ” over to the president and the federal government .
Many believed that the legislation was a response to the attacks of 9/11 , but the reality was that the Patriot Act was prepared way in advance of 9/11 and it sat dormant , awaiting an event to justify its implementation .
In the days after the attacks it was passed in the House by a majority of 357 to 66 .
It passed the Senate by 98 to 1 . Congressman Ron Paul ( R - Tex ) told the Washington Times that no member of Congress was even allowed to read the legislation .
Now we discover that exactly the same freedom restricting legislation has already been prepared for the cyber world .
An i-9/11 , as described by Lawrence Lessig , would provide the perfect pretext to implement such restrictions in one swift motion , as well as provide the justification for relegating and eliminating specific content and information on the web .
Such an event could come in the form of a major viral attack , the hacking of a major city ’s security or transport systems , or some other vital systems , or a combination of all of these things .
Considering the amount of unanswered questions regarding 9/11 and all the indications that it was a covert false flag operation , it is n’t hard to imagine such an event being played out in the cyber world .
However , regardless of any i-9/11 or i-Patriot Act , there is already a coordinated effort to stem the reach and influence of the internet .
We have tirelessly warned of this general movement to restrict , censor , control and eventually completely shut down the internet as we know it , thereby killing the last real vestige of free speech in the world today and eliminating the greatest communication and information tool ever conceived .
Our governments have reams of legislation penned to put clamps on the web as we know it .
Legislation such as the PRO - IP Act of 2007 : H.R. 4279 , that would create an IP czar at the Department of Justice and the Intellectual Property Enforcement Act of 2007 : S. 522 , which would create an entire ‘ Intellectual Property Enforcement Network ’ .
These are just two examples .
In addition , we have already seen how the major corporate websites and social networks are decentralizing and coming together to implement overarching identification , verification and access systems that have been described by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg as “ the beginning of a movement and the beginning of an industry . ”
Some of these major tech companies have already joined efforts in projects such as the Information Card Foundation , which has proposed the creation of a system of internet ID cards that will be required for internet access .
Of course , such a system would give those involved the ability to track and control user activity much more effectively .
This is just one example .
In addition , as we reported yesterday , major transportation hubs like St. Pancras International , as well as libraries , big businesses , hospitals and other public outlets that offer wi-fi Internet , are blacklisting alternative news websites and making them completely inaccessible to their users .
These precedents are merely the first indication of what is planned for the Internet over the next 5 - 10 years , with the traditional web becoming little more than a vast spy database that catalogues people ’s every activity and bombards them with commercials , while those who comply with centralized control and regulation of content will be free to enjoy the new super - fast Internet 2 .
We must speak out about this rampant move to implement strict control mechanisms on the web NOW before it is too late , before the spine of the free internet is broken and its body essentially becomes paralyzed beyond repair .

Comment on this article
Earlier I noted Andrea Mitchell ’s reference to reports that the McCain camp had just sent a team of GOP lawyers up to Alaska to do what I guess you ’d call a post-vetting of Sarah Palin .
Now George Stephanopoulos appears to have more .
George says the McCainers are sending a “ rapid response team of about ten operatives that includes lawyers ” to do the aforementioned deeper vet .
A lot of attention is being given to Gov. Palin ’s daughter ’s situation .
The much bigger deal is the expanding trooper - gate investigation , the fact that Palin lied in her Friday speech about her purported opposition to the Bridge to Nowhere , her apparent former membership in the secessionist Alaska Independence Party , and more .
Individually , you can come to your own judgment about how consequential these stories are .
What they show pretty clearly now — in addition to the news that the McCain campaign is only now sending in a vetting team — is that John McCain did n’t do any serious vetting of Palin before he invited her to join his ticket and , he hopes , become Vice President of the United States .
Fundamentally , of course , this is about John McCain .
And the real issue here is what this slapdash decision says about his judgment .
True agoraphobia is an invalidating disease but a paper by Giovanni A. Fava and associates of the University of Bologna , published in Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics , questions the excessive emphasis on panic which has been attributed in the past decade and the role of pharmaceutical industry in this attribution .
In studying the phenomenology of panic attacks , Argyle and Roth noticed that truly spontaneous attacks , not preceded by anxiety - provoking cognitions , were uncommon .
Patients meeting positive criteria for panic disorder suffered from the whole range of anxiety disorders , and a unique relationship with agoraphobia was not seen .
Indeed , other diagnoses ( particularly social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder ) frequently predated the onset of panic .
This was true also for agoraphobia .
If we conceptualize the onset of panic disorder as a stage of development of anxiety disorders ( whether agoraphobia or social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder ) and hypochondriasis , instead of a specific disease , we may increase our diagnostic sharpness and substitute undifferentiated treatment , which may leave substantial areas of non-response , with stage - guided therapeutic tools .
The staging method that Fava and colleagues applied to agoraphobia in their paper may also be appropriate for generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia and may yield a better longitudinal understanding than the cross-sectional definition of DSM .
Maj has recently raised concerns about differentiating true mental disorder and homeostatic reactions to adverse life situations .
The rise in the popularity of the diagnosis of panic disorder in the past 2 decades was largely due to marketing strategies ( e.g. , alprazolam ) ; research was frequently biased by conflict of interest and may qualify for disease mongering .

Being Poor
Being poor is knowing exactly how much everything costs .
Being poor is getting angry at your kids for asking for all the crap they see on TV .
Being poor is having to keep buying $ 800 cars because they ’re what you can afford , and then having the cars break down on you , because there ’s not an $ 800 car in America that ’s worth a damn .
Being poor is hoping the toothache goes away .
Being poor is knowing your kid goes to friends ’ houses but never has friends over to yours .
Being poor is going to the restroom before you get in the school lunch line so your friends will be ahead of you and wo n’t hear you say “ I get free lunch ” when you get to the cashier .
Being poor is living next to the freeway .

You do n’t have to be an overpaid political tele - pundit or campaign strategist to notice that the Republican Party wants to make oil the critical issue in the 2008 election .
From the onslaught of illogical television advertisements paid for by Republican presidential hopeful Senator John McCain that blame Barack Obama for high gas prices , to the GOP sit -in on the floor of the House , and the most recent calls to “ Drill , Baby , Drill , ” Republicans have made “ energy ” their raison d’etre in this prickly campaign season .
Republicans are hoping to use oil to create a so - called “ wedge issue ” and divide Democrats , bringing some extra votes to their side on November 4 .
Despite where your politics lie , you ’ve got to tip your cap to GOP cohesiveness on the oil issue – Republican leadership has all of their underlings following in lock - step – but the misdirected focus will be a fatal flaw for the Republicans if they stick to the “ oil or nothing ” strategy .
Here ’s why :
1. Demand for oil is down .
Demand for oil in the U.S. continues to fall , dropping by 891,000 barrels per day in May compared the same month a year ago , according to the latest Energy Information Agency numbers .
The U.S. Transportation Department reported that U.S. drivers logged 9.6 billion fewer vehicle miles in May — or 3.7 percent — compared to the same period last year , the biggest drop ever for the historically busy summer driving month .
And after a long telephone conversation with economist Jim Williams of WTRG Economics this morning , I ’m of the belief that consumption will continue to fall , triggering further declines in demand and , ultimately , prices of oil .
Also contributing ( however slightly ) to a drop in demand is an uptick in fuel economy .
For the fourth consecutive year , EPA is reporting an increase in the average fuel efficiency for cars and light duty trucks , to a projected 20.8 miles per gallon ( mpg ) for 2008 .
2. The Price of Oil is Down .
Concomitant with falling demand are falling oil prices .
When I first started working on this post back in August ( I shelved it for a little while ) , I planned on remarking on the falling price of oil .
In the early part of August I wrote about the sudden and rather surprising drop in the price of oil .
“ Light , sweet crude for September delivery fell to $ 122.84 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices have now fallen more than $ 25 from their high of $ 147.27 , reached July 11 , ” I wrote .
Little did I know back then that we would see a further collapse of global financial markets bringing the price of light sweet crude oil even lower .
As of yesterday , NYMEX price of Crude Oil Futures closed at $ 97.88 / barrel – dropping below the $ 100 mark – a figure some economists and energy analysts suggested we might never see again .
3. Democratic pragmatism .
The willingness of not small ‘ d ’ , but large ‘ D’ , Democrats to alter their position on political issues is not a detractor .
Since when is contingency a bad word ?
If a person ( or a party ) is so entrenched in the politics of conviction , then they must already know everything , right ?
Conviction only goes so far , what happens when someone ( or some people ) are convinced about something , refuse to alter their position on that thing , and then turn out to be wrong ?
Democrats should take ownership of their pragmatism , and not shy away when they are accused of “ flip - flopping .
” The swelling ranks in the bi-partisan coalition “ Gang of 16 ” give more credence to the notion that Democrats would be willing to discuss some increases in offshore drilling if renewable energy tax credits are part of the deal .
Recent public comments and actions from Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi suggest they would be open to discussing limited increases in offshore drilling .
4 . “ Drill here , drill now ” and “ Drill , Baby , Drill ” philosophies are turning people off .
I do n’t get it .
If Americans do n’t believe an uptick in domestic oil drilling will have any appreciable effect on consumer gas prices , why are Republicans hammering away with these catchphrases ?
PR professionals have roles to play in most any political campaign , but formulating energy policy should not be one of them .
may be perceived as a move to sate McCain ’s big oil donors that began fatten his campaign coffers earlier this summer .
The Washington Post reports Campaign contributions from oil industry executives Sen. McCain rose dramatically in the last half of June , after the senator from Arizona made a high - profile split with environmentalists and reversed his opposition to the federal ban on offshore drilling .
5. Climate change and carbon taxes .
I ’m really surprised I put this last , but that does not mean it is any less salient from my point of view .
At some point the reality of increasing production will come face - to - face with the very real possibility of a carbon tax .
Whether we see a true tax on carbon , or we see some sort of cap - and - trade ( even though former GOP presidential candidate and current McCain economic adviser Steve Forbes disparaged Sen. McCain ’s cap - and - trade plan ) , there will finally be a cost to pumping GHGs into the atmosphere , the question is how much will that cost be .
Regardless , it will add to the price of gasoline , making drilling for even more oil a questionable move , at best .

Have you seen those food memes making the rounds of the blogosphere ?
A meme is kind of a “ tag - you ’re - it ” of the blog world .
Someone posts about something , then links to a few other bloggers they know , who are then tagged to do the same thing .
It ’s usually a list of questions to answer or a list to check off .
These food memes are lists of 100 different food items that foodies of that persuasion should have tried , and bloggers identify which items they ’ve actually tried , then add up their score .

Wenn die Kids zu gut sind : Bitte nicht für Schüler engagieren
Eine bayerische Lehrerin fördert ihre Kinder so gut , dass sie exzellente Noten haben .
Grund genug für Schulämter und - leiter , zu fragen , was da falsch läuft .
MÜNCHEN taz Kurz vor Ende des bayerischen Schuljahres fasste Sabine Czerny einen Entschluss .
Die Lehrerin entschloss sich , ihren Lehrerkollegen zu erklären , dass nicht sie es ist , die falsch tickt , wenn 91 Prozent der Kinder ihrer Klasse sich für eine weiterführende Schule qualifizieren .
Sondern dass es das Schulsystem ist , das nicht ganz richtig sein kann , wenn es ein derart gutes Abschneiden als Problem darstellt .
Also verfasste die Lehrerin Sabine Czerny einen offenen Brief ans Kollegium .
Darin legte sie dar , warum sie alle darunter zu leiden hätten , wenn das System mittelmäßige Notenschnitte erzwinge .
Nur zu dem Zweck , damit Realschule und Gymnasium , aber auch die ungeliebte Hauptschule mit ausreichend Kindern im Alter von zehn Jahren bestückt werden können .
Die Geschichte von Sabine Czerny ist nicht nur deswegen ungewöhnlich , weil sie per offenem Brief mit ihren Kollegen in so wichtigen Fragen kommuniziert .
Die Geschichte der 36 - jährigen Lehrerin ist es vor allem deshalb , weil sie schief dafür angeschaut wird , dass sie ihren Job offensichtlich gut macht .
Seit einem halben Jahr ist die Pädagogin Anfeindungen ihrer Rektorin ausgesetzt , weil 25 SchülerInnen ihrer vierten Klasse in einer klassenübergreifenden Vergleichsarbeit in Mathematik einen Schnitt von 1,8 erreicht hatten .
In einer Heimat - und Sachkunde - Probe schafften sie kurz darauf sogar einen Schnitt von 1,6 .
Beinahe erleichtert notierte Czerny nach einer Prüfung in Deutsch eine 2 vor dem Komma - und ertappte sich dabei , zu bedauern , dass einer ihrer wenigen Fünferschüler wegen Umzugs die Klasse verlassen würde .
Aus dem Rektorat waren wegen der ungewöhnlich guten Notenschnitte Vorwürfe laut geworden .
Entweder sage sie Ergebnisse vor - oder sie korrigiere falsch .
Die Leiterin des zuständigen Schulamtes dementiert auf Nachfrage vehement , dass man von Amts wegen Notenschnitte vorgebe .
Aber sie vergisst nicht , gleich im nächsten Satz zu ergänzen , dass eine Schulleiterin die " verdammte Pflicht " habe , einem so ungewöhnlich guten Schnitt nachzuforschen .
Es gebe halt viele Möglichkeiten zu beeinflussen , direkt oder indirekt .
Solche mehr oder weniger offenen Unterstellungen kränkten Sabine Czerny zutiefst .
Die Grundschullehrerin hatte innerhalb der vergangenen zehn Jahre an mehreren Schulen unterrichtet , überall mit großem Erfolg .
Dafür hat sie hart gearbeitet .
Hat neben dem Schulalltag jahrelange Fortbildungen in unterschiedlichen pädagogischen , medizinischen und psychologischen Richtungen absolviert .
Sie wollte besser verstehen , wie man Kinder fürs Lernen begeistern kann .
Sabine Czerny weiß zahlreiche Eltern hinter sich , die sie als pädagogisch und fachlich herausragend loben .
Einmal sogar fuhr ein Vater ins Schulamt , um das Wort für die von den Kindern heiß geliebte Pädagogin zu ergreifen .
" Mit welchem Recht kommen Sie überhaupt hierher ? " , herrschte man ihn dort an .
Als sie selbst versuchte , ihre Pädagogik zu erklären , wies man sie an , sie solle nicht so " anmaßend " auftreten .
Czernys Erfolge machen offenbar nervös .
Schon an der Vorgängerschule hatten die auffälligen Lernzuwächse mit einer zweiten Klasse zur Konfrontation mit dem zuständigen Schulrat geführt .
" Sie haben sich an das Niveau der Parallelkollegen anzupassen ! " , wies der Mann seine Lehrerin an .
Für die brach in diesem Moment eine
Welt zusammen : Sich anzupassen - das hätte ja bedeutet , absichtlich schlechtere Resultate zu produzieren , nicht bessere .
Den Vorgesetzten aus dem Schulamt störte , dass sich die Eltern der Parallelklassen beschwert hatten .
Was lag da für den braven , bayerischen Schulbeamten näher , als mal eben für Ruhe zu sorgen ?
Czerny verwies einmal mehr auf ihre innovativen Methoden , ihre Hinwendung zu jedem einzelnen Kind , doch das nützte ihr nichts .
Im Gegenteil .
Fortan eilte ihr zuverlässig der Ruf voraus , aufsässig zu sein .
So sah sie sich zum Ende dieses Schuljahres gezwungen , einmal darzustellen , wofür sich bislang kaum jemand wirklich interessiert hatte : Warum ihre Kinder so gut gelernt hatten - und wie kontraproduktiv die gängige Benotungspraxis sei , die schon bei der Vermittlung einfacher Grundlagenstoffe notwendigerweise Verlierer produziere .
Es sei widersinnig , schrieb sie , wenn es " Sitzplätze gibt , die eine bestimmte Zahl tragen " .
Nämlich maximal drei Stühle mit der Ziffer 1 , höchstens sechs Stühle mit der Ziffer 2 , jeweils bis zu neun mit den Ziffern 3 und 4 und auch bis zu fünf Stühle mit den Ziffern 5 und 6 .
Denn sie , die LehrerInnen , seien dadurch gezwungen , die Kinder auf diese Stühle zu platzieren .
So aber breche man das Engagement jedes schwächeren Schülers , der könne lernen wie verrückt und bekomme doch wieder nur eine schlechte Note - weil eben der Schnitt stimmen müsse .
" Ein Fünferschüler bleibt ein Fünferschüler , einfach weil es Fünferschüler geben muss . "
In ihrem Plädoyer für eine andere Lern - und Bewertungskultur appellierte sie : " Bitte , machen wir uns bewusst , dass es hier keinen objektiven Maßstab gibt , der die tatsächliche Leistung misst !
Wir erstellen Proben mehr oder weniger bewusst von vornherein unter dem Gesichtspunkt , dass der Schnitt stimmen soll , bzw .
passen den Notenschlüssel im Nachhinein entsprechend an , das heißt , wir produzieren schlechte Kinder . "
Kinder im Grundschulalter aber identifizierten sich mit den Noten , viele , so schrieb sie , stellten irgendwann ihre Bemühungen ein , resignierten oder würden verhaltensauffällig .
Das gehe vor allem Kindern aus sozial schwachen oder problematischen Familien so .
Die bräuchten eher ihre Hilfe als Lehrerin und Aussicht auf sichtbare Erfolge statt ständiger demoralisierender Rückmeldungen wie von einer Richterin .
Auch das Vertrauensverhältnis zu den Eltern leide , wenn man denen einerseits erzähle , wie wichtig Förderung sei , andererseits aber genötigt werde , schlechte Noten zu vergeben .
Was Sabine Czerny da beschrieb , hat viel mit dem Namen Gauß zu tun - und mit einem System , das die nach dem Mathematiker benannte , , Normalverteilung " zur Norm erhebt .
Gauß hatte beobachtet , dass in der Natur Extreme selten sind , die breite Mitte dafür umso öfter auftritt .
Er hätte seine Beobachtung allerdings nicht unbedingt in einer Lerngruppe machen können .
Wie falsch es ist , Notengebung am Maßstab eines vermeintlich naturgesetzhaft sich ergebenden Mittelwerts auszurichten , dämmerte irgendwann auch der Kultusministerkonferenz ( KMK ) .
Die schrieb dementsprechend 1968 eine sogenannte kriterienbezogene Benotung vor statt der bis dahin gültigen Orientierung am Leistungsdurchschnitt der Klasse .
Benotet werden darf in allen deutschen Bundesländern seitdem nur , in welchem Maße ein Schüler die , , Anforderungen " erfülle .
In jüngster Zeit propagiert man sogenannte kriteriale Leistungsmessung , der Bewertungsmaßstab bleibt jedoch ebenso unklar .
Die individuelle Leistungsnorm , die den persönlichen Lernfortschritt zugrunde legt , wird gar nicht erst erwähnt .
Wer da dächte , dass der KMK - Beschluss von 68 immerhin ein gewisser Fortschritt sei , dem hält der Erziehungswissenschaftler Hans Brügelmann von der Universität Siegen entgegen : " Die soziale Norm ist nicht zulässig - sie wird aber um der Selektion willen erzwungen . "
Horst Bartnitzky , Vorsitzender des Grundschulverbandes , hat seinerseits beobachtet , dass Lehrer zwar selten so massiv attackiert werden wie die Pädagogin Sabine Czerny , erklärt dies aber auch mit vorauseilendem Gehorsam .
" Die Lehrer spüren den Druck " , sagt der Diplompädagoge und einstige Grundschulrektor , " und handeln ihm gemäß . "
Bartnitzky hat Brügelmann und einige weitere Forscher eine Expertise erarbeiten lassen , die unter dem Titel " Sind Noten nützlich - und nötig ? " erschienen ist ( www.Grundschulverband.de).
Darin weisen die Wissenschaftler nach , warum die scheinbar präzisen Schulnoten keineswegs objektiv seien .
Sie zitieren dazu unter anderem das Experiment des österreichischen Pädagogen Rudolf Weiss , der 153 Lehrer eine Mathematikaufgabe beurteilen ließ .
41 Prozent von ihnen gaben eine Zwei , 42 Prozent eine Drei , die Eins wurde von sieben Prozent vergeben , die Vier von neun Prozent und ein Prozent der Probanden sahen in der Arbeit sogar eine Fünf .
Es hänge eben stets davon ab , welchen Maßstab man anlege , um eine Anforderung etwa als ausreichend zu bewerten , sagt der Grundschulforscher Brügelmann .
Dieser Maßstab aber sei nicht klar definiert .
Nach den Regeln der Statistik sei es überdies eigentlich nicht zulässig , aus Noten , die nur Rangfolgen angäben , Mittelwerte zu errechnen .
Und doch werden etwa in Bayern und Baden - Württemberg in den Übertrittszeugnissen Gesamtnoten gemittelt , bis aufs Hundertstel genau .
Auch Sabine Czerny fühlt sich inzwischen genötigt , so zu unterrichten und Testaufgaben derart zu konstruieren , dass mit Sicherheit ausreichend Vierer , Fünfer und Sechser herauskommen und ihre Rektorin sie nicht weiterhin behandelt wie einen störrischen Esel .
Ihr ist schmerzlich bewusst , dass sie Versager produziert , wenn sie sich an die Anweisung ihrer Vorgesetzten hält .
Umso wütender macht sie der Satz , den sie schon so oft in Kollegien gehört hat : " Es gibt halt nun mal dumme Kinder . "
Wie leicht diese Grundannahme zu beweisen ist , erlebte sie bereits in ihrer Zeit als mobil eingesetzte Lehrerin in einer klassenübergreifenden Probearbeit zum Thema " Der natürliche Kreislauf des Wassers " .
Da wurde zu ihrer Überraschung der Wolkenname " Cirrocumulus " abgefragt .
Sabine Czerny protestierte : Das habe man doch im Unterricht gar nicht vermittelt , da müssten die Kinder ja mehr wissen , als sie wissen können .
Die KollegInnen erwiderten , man brauche doch Fragen , die kaum einer beantworten kann , und beruhigten sie : Der Begriff sei ja in einem Film gefallen , den man gemeinsam angeschaut habe .
Da sei man , , rechtlich abgesichert " .
Der Brief , in dem Sabine Czerny solche Zusammenhänge erklärte , hatte übrigens keine Konsequenz : Vor der Konferenz des kommenden Tages hatte sich die Rektorin krank gemeldet , und man hatte andere Dinge zu besprechen .
So behielt Sabine Czerny das Papier bei sich .
Und geht nun am 1 .
August mit dem deutlichen Gefühl in die sechswöchige Ferienzeit , dass ihre fachlichen Fähigkeiten und ihr Engagement nicht wirklich erwünscht sind .
Authorities are still searching for a Sydney couple who are in hiding after refusing to have their newborn baby vaccinated against hepatitis B .
The mother of the four - day - old baby boy has had the virus for several years and doctors say the child runs a high risk of contracting it unless he is immunised within days .
The New South Wales Department of Community Services has taken out a Supreme Court order to force the parents to immunise their child , but has so far been unable to locate the couple .
A DOCs spokeswoman says the department will have to go back to court tomorrow if the parents are not found .
The parents , who are from Croydon Park in western Sydney , believe the illness can be managed more effectively than any potential damage from the vaccine .
The couple believes aluminium in the vaccine could cause the baby more damage than contracting hepatitis B .
The parents have the support of the anti-vaccination group the Australian Vaccination Network .
The baby 's father , who is seeking an injunction against the court order , was adamant the family would stay on the run indefinitely .
One of the doctors who alerted state authorities to the couple 's refusal to have the baby vaccinated , Professor David Isaacs from Sydney 's Westmead Children 's Hospital , said yesterday that the child 's rights were being ignored .
" If you do not immunise a baby in this situation , you 're putting that baby 's life at risk , " he said .
He said if a baby gets hepatitis B at birth he or she will become a chronic carrier of the virus .
" About a third of those chronic carriers will die young from cancer of the liver or cirrhosis of the liver ... this is a horrible disease , " he said .
While vaccinations are not compulsory in Australia , New South Wales state health policy mandates that parents of all babies born to hepatitis B - positive mothers must be offered immunoglobulin for the child within 12 hours of birth and four doses of the vaccine over six months .
New South Wales Assistant Police Commissioner Frank Mennilli yesterday declined to say whether the parents would be charged once they were found .
" It 'll be something that 'll have to be assessed once that child is located , " he said .
JACKSON , Ga. , Sept. 17 ( UPI ) -- Jack Alderman , the longest - serving deathrow inmate in the United States , was executed in Georgia Tuesday for the slaying of his wife ..
Alderman , 57 , of Savannah , Ga. , gave no final statement as he was put to death by lethal injection at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison near Jackson , The Savannah ( Ga. ) Morning News reported Wednesday .
He had been on deathrow since 1975 for the slaying of his wife , Barbara Jean Alderman , the previous year .

Two juries , one in 1975 and another in 1984 , sentenced him to die , the newspaper said .
Last - minute appeals to the state Board of Pardons and Paroles and the Georgia Supreme Court failed , despite pleas from death penalty opponents in the United States and Great Britain .
Britain's Law Society and Bar Council had urged British Foreign Secretary David Miliband to use diplomatic channels to stay what they called the " obscene " execution of an innocent man .
They said Alderman was sentenced to die based solely on the testimony of a co-defendant who later said he had made a deal with prosecutors to implicate Alderman in his wife 's death .
The co-defendant , John Arthur Brown , was paroled after just 12 years in prison .
Prosecutors said Alderman instigated the crime .
According to Newsweek magazine , the McCains failed to pay property taxes on a condo they own in La Jolla , California for four years .
Notified of this by Newsweek , the McCains paid ( yesterday ) for the last four years , but are still late in their payments for this year .
UPDATE : The location of the condo in question was posted to The Jed Report .
From there , it is a simple exercise to find the building , and then look it up on Zillow .
Here it is .
Zillow lists the property taxes for 2007 as $ 11,229 — note that this is a unit in the same complex , and may not be the same unit owned by the McCains .
But the Newsweek article says that the total unpaid taxes for the last four years are $ 6,744.42 , with another $ 1,742 owed for 2008 .
Am I missing something ?
Why are the McCains paying around 15 % of normal taxes ?
UPDATE2 : As people have pointed out , due to Proposition 13 , property taxes in California are based on the purchase price of the property , not the current value .
The McCains simply must have purchased the condo from the Spanish before California became part of the USA .
But seriously , does someone know the exact unit owned by the McCains , so we can look up its purchase date and price ?

Mr Kadyrov was adamant that the republic was now loyal to Moscow Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov has accused the United States of emboldening Georgia to start a war in the Caucasus to test Russian resolve .
Mr Kadyrov , who is a keen supporter of the Russian government , said Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili had been dancing to Washington 's tune .
But he said that Russia had responded decisively during last month 's conflict and shown it was the stronger power .
Mr Kadyrov made the remarks in a speech at the presidential palace near Grozny .
After 1999 we found a common language with Russia and now we 'll stay in the Russian Federation
Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov
Profile : Ramzan Kadyrov Scars remain amid Chechen revival
The newly constructed complex outside the Chechen capital comes complete with a private race course , artificial lake and miniature mountain , as well as Mr Kadyrov 's personal zoo of panthers , leopards and bears .
The wild beasts , he said , had a calming influence on him , and he liked to talk and play with them in his spare time .
' Testing ground '
The small Russian republic of Chechnya has waged two brutal wars in the past 15 years against Russia , and Mr Kadyrov 's father , Akhmad , fought as a field commander before switching allegiance to the Kremlin .
But the 31 - year - old leader was adamant that the republic was now loyal to Moscow .
Mr Kadyrov confirmed Chechen units fought with the Russians in Georgia Therefore , Russia 's recent decision to recognise the independence of two other breakaway regions in the Caucasus , the Georgian enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , would not reopen the question of Chechen independence , he said .
Mr Kadyrov confirmed that Chechen units and paramilitaries had fought with Russians against Georgians in South Ossetia last month .
" We Chechens are obliged to be on the front line with Russia because we are warriors , and we know what war is , " he explained .
But he also went further to accuse the US of using the Caucasus as a testing ground to challenge Russia 's resolve .
Mr Kadyrov claimed Georgia 's President Saakashvili had been dancing to the US government 's tune , and that through Georgia the US had provoked a confrontation .
But he said that Russia had responded decisively and shown the US that it was the stronger power .
' Common language ' President Kadyrov also said he was not worried that escalating tensions in the neighbouring republics of Ingushetia and Dagestan could again destabilise Chechnya .
Chechnya 's president is a keen supporter of the Russian government " After 1999 we found a common language with Russia and now we 'll stay in the Russian Federation , " he said .
He added that after 1999 - the start of the second war with Russia - Chechens had realised they were being manipulated by foreign powers and had become a target for criminals from outside Chechnya who were largely responsible for the lawlessness and acts of terrorism of the time .
Mr Kadyrov said a turning point had been the death of the rebel Chechen commander , Shamil Basayev , in 2006 , allegedly the mastermind behind numerous large - scale terrorist attacks .
The president said he had greeted the news of Basayev 's death as a cause for celebration , but had been sad he had not been able to wreak vengeance on him personally for the thousands of deaths he had caused .

As for Chechnya 's prospects now , he said Moscow was helping to finance an intensive programme of reconstruction to bring peace and prosperity to the republic , and that funds were so plentiful it was difficult to spend them .
Mr Kadyrov said he was trying to persuade Akhmed Zakayev to return Already , the centre of Grozny , once a mass of ruins after repeated bombardments during the war years , has been completely transformed .
A giant mosque now dwarfs Grozny 's central square , surrounded by parks of flower beds and fountains .
New five and nine - storey blocks of flats line some of the main streets .
But behind them you can still see ruins of war - damaged houses left without windows or roofs , and bomb craters , now overgrown with grass and small trees .
President Kadyrov said he was now trying to persuade Chechens who had fled during the war years to return , including the former actor and prime minister of the rebel government , Akhmed Zakayev .
Mr Zakayev is currently resident in London , but is wanted by the Russian government on terrorism charges .
President Kadyrov however described Mr Zakayev as a valuable artist who would be welcome to return to help revive Chechnya 's cultural heritage .

CHESTERFIELD , S.C. ( AP ) 
The acting U.S. attorney for South Carolina says a teenager accused of planning to bomb his high school will face a federal charge of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction .
The charge carries a possible life sentence .
Prosecutor Kevin McDonald says 18 - year - old Ryan Schallenberger also will face two lesser federal charges stemming from his scheme to detonate explosives in a suicide attack on his high school in Chesterfield , a town in northeastern South Carolina .
The news came less than an hour before Schallenberger was to appear in court for a bond hearing .
Schallenberger was arrested Saturday after his parents called police because he had ordered 10 pounds of ammonium nitrate , which they retrieved after getting a delivery notice from the postal service , authorities said .
Police say they also discovered a hate - filled journal lauding the Columbine killers .
" We applaud these parents and we 're very thankful they chose to be concerned and they chose to get involved .
We feel like they saved a lot of life in our county , " Chesterfield County Sheriff Sam Parker said Tuesday on ABC 's " Good Morning America . "
Schallenberger 's parents had sought help from mental health experts even earlier in the week when he slammed his head into a wall , but the clinic offered no help , authorities said Monday .
His parents took him to a hospital but he was not badly injured , said prosecutor Jay Hodge .
Schallenberger was charged with making a bomb threat and was to be charged Tuesday with possession of bomb - making material , Hodge said .
The prosecutor said he would request at a bail hearing Tuesday that the teen undergo a mental health evaluation .
Schallenberger 's mother and stepfather are " heartbroken , " Parker said Tuesday .
" They were very concerned about his future education .
I kind of explained to them and told them we 've got to deal with two options here , we 've got to deal with his education or with his life , " the sheriff said .
Ammonium nitrate is a fertilizer that can be used as an ingredient in explosives and was employed in the deadly 1995 Oklahoma City bombing .
Authorities said Schallenberger bought the ammonium nitrate on eBay .
Police said that after they were called by his parents , they discovered a hate - filled journal lauding the Columbine killers , an audiotape to be played after Schallenberger died during his rampage and a year 's worth of plans for the bombing that included a hand - drawn map of the school .
" He 's just a soft - spoken little kid , " Hodge said .
" But he 's done something and threatened to do something that 's very violent . "
Schallenberger was assigned a lawyer , William Spencer , who did not return calls from the Associated Press .
Schallenberger 's mother and stepfather , John and Laurie Sittley , could not be reached for comment .
Their phone number was unlisted , they did not attend the hearing and their home about 10 miles from the school was blocked by " No Trespassing " signs .
Authorities said Schallenberger 's journal did not specify targets of an attack , or a date that he planned to carry it out .
Police Chief Randall Lear said Schallenberger was " just mad at the world . "
Authorities checked the school for bombs during the weekend , and students walked through newly installed metal detectors and past law officers on Monday .
Acquaintances said they were surprised by the allegations against the straight - A student .
" He would n't hurt a flea , " neighbor Carl Parker said .
" People just do n't know him like I do .
He 's a good kid . "
Students said Schallenberger often ate alone in the cafeteria .
" I never thought he'd be the dude to do something like this , " said James Ford , a 16 - year - old sophomore .
Chesterfield is a town of about 1,500 people in northeastern South Carolina near the North Carolina line .

Last night the long - awaited Wipeout HD was finally released on the PlayStation Network , and many of us here at Ars could n't download it fast enough .
Unfortunately , the game refused to launch on my PlayStation 3 after the game was downloaded and installed , and a quick search on Google showed that many people were having issues with the game crashing , freezing , or just plain not working .
Last night I was finally able to play by disconnecting the PS3 from my network , and there have also been reports around the Internet that people with large friends lists are also more likely to see problems .
Luckily , it looks like things have stabilized today as we have had no issues playing the game , but I 'm still getting some complaints in through e-mail .
Consider yourself warned .
While these early issues are annoying , and not be able to play online is a giant pain , the game itself is stunning .
It 's great to have Wipeout back on the big - screen , although we have n't minded the last portable release in the series .
The game is worth your $ 20 , but you may want to wait until the issues are ironed out before plunking down your cash .
So much for Sarah Palin the reformer :
The Alaska governor took home more than $ 25,000 in gifts during her less than two years in office , including “ honorific tributes , expensive artwork and free travel for a family member . ”
Bombshells like that are rocking the right wing , along with Palin ’s embarrassing interviews , which have prompted conservative columnist Kathleen Parker to declare , “ My cringe reflex is exhausted . ”
Washington Post :
The 41 gifts Palin accepted during her 20 months as governor include honorific tributes , expensive artwork and free travel for a family member .
They also include more than $ 2,500 in personal items from Calista , a large Alaska native corporation with a variety of pending state regulatory and budgetary issues , and a gold - nugget pin valued at $ 1,200 from the city of Nome , which lobbies on municipal , local and capital budget matters , documents show .

Kathleen Parker in the National Review :
Palin ’s recent interviews with Charles Gibson , Sean Hannity , and now Katie Couric have all revealed an attractive , earnest , confident candidate .
Who Is Clearly Out Of Her League .
No one hates saying that more than I do .
Like so many women , I ’ve been pulling for Palin , wishing her the best , hoping she will perform brilliantly .
I ’ve also noticed that I watch her interviews with the held breath of an anxious parent , my finger poised over the mute button in case it gets too painful .
Unfortunately , it often does .
My cringe reflex is exhausted .

It 's 2008 and sex seems to be everywhere .
So who holds the line between permissiveness and obscenity ?
What is obscene these days ?
And how do those people entrusted to make these calls cope with the harrowing work ?
" People think ' what a great job - you sit and watch porn all day ' , " says Inspector Andy Shortland , who heads the Metropolitan Police 's Obscene Publications Squad .
" I think to myself you really would not want to see this stuff .
It 's not top shelf magazine stuff or soft - core porn which you might hire at Blockbuster .
This is really horrible stuff .
And when I say that it usually stops them dead .
" But it 's just human nature to laugh about it , " he adds .
The squad , the only one of its type in the country , consists of 12 officers , including one woman .
Its role is threefold - to monitor what is on sale at licensed sex shops , to target and convict pedlars of illegal pornography and to advise other law enforcement agencies .
Lady Chatterley 's Lover was once considered obscene but certainly would n't be now
Inspector Andy Shortland
But what , in these more permissive times , is considered obscene ?
During the trial of American pornographer Larry Flynt in the 1970s , his lawyer Louis Sirkin observed : " One man 's obscenity is another man 's art . "
In England , the law is governed by a piece of legislation almost half - a- century old - the 1959 Obscene Publications Act .
It defines obscenity as " content whose effect will tend to deprave and corrupt those likely to read , see or hear " it .
It helpfully adds : " This could include images of extreme sexual activity such as bestiality , necrophilia , rape or torture . "
Insp Shortland says : " What was socially unacceptable 10 or 20 years ago may be acceptable now .
There is a moving line .
For example Lady Chatterley 's Lover was once considered obscene but certainly would n't be now .
" But bestiality , necrophilia , rape and torture would still be considered obscene , " he says , as would depictions of sexual gratification through lavatorial functions .
The Obscene Publications Squad works closely with the British Board of Film Classification ( BBFC ) , which is responsible for censoring and labelling all films released in the UK , whether they are movies for the cinema , videos and DVDs for the regular retail market or specialist sex shop material .
Straw dogs release Rape and torture scenes - sometimes in mainstream movies - have been problematic for both the police and the BBFC .
In America Larry Flynt fought a long fight to defend pornography " There is quite a high threshold , " says Insp Shortland .
" Some caning films can have bad injuries - which are not life - threatening - and that is considered to be obscene .
Some rape films are ' fake ' with actors portraying rape .
It is quite a difficult line to judge . "
The case of the 1971 film Straw Dogs , directed by Sam Peckinpah and starring Dustin Hoffman and Susan George , is well known to many film buffs .
Originally banned because of a horrific rape depiction , the BBFC passed a different edit of the film in 2002 - which included the scene .
It would be wrong to assume the decision was due to greater tolerance of sexual violence , says the BBFC 's senior examiner , Murray Perkins .
Far from it .
" Sexual violence is one of the areas where our position which has not changed much over the years , " says Mr Perkins .
" It 's still one of our main concerns .
The mixing of sex and violence is something which concerns people and rightly so .
" The makers of Straw Dogs had done their own edit and in the process the film gave the impression that the female character enjoyed the rape .
In the full uncut version , that was balanced by another event in the film which gave it context and that was why we were able to pass it . "
' They want to be here '
Viewing the scene is deeply unpleasant even for someone who appreciates the film 's artistic merit .
So how do those who must watch this sort of material for hours each week cope ?
DVDS RATED IN UK IN 2007 U certificate - 2,480 PG - 2,721 12A - 2,562 15 - 2,344 18 - 950 R18 - 1,159 ( 27 % of which were cut ) Rejected - 1 ( for drug references ) Source - British Board of Film Classification Insp Shortland admits it can be tough on his team , but says there are safeguards in place to ensure officers ' mental health is not endangered .
" They will not be monitored all the time .
If there is one officer dealing with all the material then they will be offered open access to the occupational health department .
" If someone comes to me and says ' I ca n't take any more of this ' I will listen to that .
But at the end of the day they are here because they want to be here .
They work as a team and are quite open about what they can and can't manage to watch .
Each person knows their limit and what they feel less comfortable with . "
The workload for Mr Perkins and his fellow examiners at the BBFC is less gruelling .
" Some people think it sounds like the best job in the world , " says Mr Perkins .
" But the way we do the viewing you are disengaged to a certain extent because you are making notes and are hyper - sensitive to the language and the context .
You are viewing it as a job and you 've got to be mindful of policy , guidelines and public expectation . "
But do examiners risk becoming desensitised ?
Legal defence " If you see something which is raw , misogynistic , aggressive and violent you do n't become desensitised to it .
What is not right is never right . "
The film Nine Songs , which came out in 2004 , contained real sex but was uncut Last year the BBFC issued 1,159 films with an R18 rating , meaning they could only be sold in licensed sex shops .
Of those , 27 % required cuts .
" The majority of the cuts were little sections rather than a whole scene .
It may be strong abuse , violent behaviour , temporary strangling , or it may be a reference to under - age sex , " Mr Perkins says .
While an R18 rating is not a legal defence for a pornographer , it would be very unlikely for the Obscene Publications Squad to take action over a film passed by the BBFC .
Insp Shortland says they have had very few trials as few pornographers are willing to pin their hopes on 12 jurors .
And he thinks pushing smut has become too easy nowadays .
" You just get a master DVD burner and make thousands of copies in your attic .
The overheads are very low . "
Back at the BBFC , there have been glimpses of more permissiveness in what it 's willing to license for mainstream distribution .
Films given a regular 18 certificate are only supposed to contain " simulated sex " but there are exceptions , such as Michael Winterbottom 's controversial 2004 movie Nine Songs .
The censors judged it to be " exceptionally justified by the context of the film " .
Surprisingly , perhaps , the only DVD rejected outright by the BBFC was a box set of season two of the TV series Weeds .
That was not because of sex or violence , but a scene was seen as promoting drug use .

Sex and elicit content within films should be cut down or significantly reduced .
I'm a youth worker and i have young people who are 13 /14 watching 18's because there friends are renting them for them or are downloading them from the internet .
There needs to be stronger regulations and film makers need to start taking more responsibility rather than trying to out do each other for the most realistic sex scene .
Tom , Amersham " If you see something which is raw , misogynistic , aggressive and violent you do n't become desensitised to it .
What is not right is never right . "
I 'll remember that quote next time someone claims that computer games , hip - hop ( or anything else the person does n't understand ) is desensitising the youth of today ...

Things are very relaxed these days with regard to nakedness in films .
I can't remember the last time I watched a film that did n't show a naked or semi naked woman .
If the male body was exhibited in the same context as the female body it would have been banned years ago .
It would be nice if we had equality in this respect
Lorraine , I worked in a multi-national corporate security department for many years in the late 90's .
One of our jobs was to follow up and enforce the company 's policies on computer use .
Take it from me , this is not a pleasant job - peadophilia , necrophilia , bestiality and images of violence were all being viewed by a minority .
Enforcement was obvious and police were involved where a case could be built .
But day in day out review of what is now considered acceptable porn depraved my view of women .
In order to do my job more effectively and trace and detect people for misuse , I had entered the mind of the pornographer .
What is now considered ' acceptable ' is still immensely damaging to society .
Jonathan , London Virgin Media has a load of series and sections to watch on its Virgin TV Section .
Recently they 've added a ' late night section ' .
Basically , it 's porn .
I did n't ask for it , I do n't want it , I do n't like it , but it 's just assumed that along with crime and music , I want porn .
I do n't object to porn , if that 's what you need , but I object to it being everywhere you go , whether I like it or not .

Of interest :
The definition of " Obscene " is likely to corrupt or deprave the viewer .
And the " expert " on the panel says " you do n't become desensitised to it .
What is not right is never right . "
So , by not being " depraved and corrupted " by watching the " Nasty stuff " , it proves it 's not obscene ?
Or do they believe everyone else is inherently more corruptable than them ?
Rather than have the lofty sounding ideals , why not simply state the law as " distasteful to the prevailing morality of society in its current state " ?
Just as fuzzy , and probably more accurate .
Rich , Bristol
As per usual this shows the Hypocrisy of governing bodies like this .
They claim that they can watch any type of movie and know their limits but the public can't .
Who are they to decide what is decent ?
If no one is breaking the law in front of the camera then it should be allowed .
What i find obscene and what they find absence might be completely different
kenneth campbell , Southend
The test should be that if it is legal to do it , it should be legal to view it .
That way age concerns are addressed as are other issues .
Not so prudish , Cheshire , UK
In the days of the internet I feel that BBFC and the OPS are fairly ineffective .
You can get anything you want on the internet including uncut versions of films and TV shows .
Refusing to clasify a film or show would only keep it from the casual viewer .
Ronnie , Edinburgh Funny how the officers watching illegal pornograohy are not affected or desensitised to it ?!
Or are they saying that other people I suppose vulnerable , impressionable , unstable adults or adolescents would be affected by this material and therefore it 's banned ?
Lisa , paris GK Chesterton once said something like " whenever we attempt to remove a fence we should always pause long enough to find out why it was put there in the first place "
Andrew , London
If the Obscene Publications Act 1959 defines obscenity as " content whose effect will tend to deprave and corrupt those likely to read , see or hear " it but Mr Perkins of the BBFC states that " if you see something which is raw , misogynistic , aggressive and violent you do n't become desensitised to it .
What is not right is never right . " , then on what authority exactly is most of the censorship legal ?
And in any case , I 've got broadband .
Michael , Dundee I can't understand why our attitude to pornography is a moving line !
If something is obscene why on earth do the watchdogs and public accept a slackening of the limits ?
Given the society we now live in , and try to bring up our children in , it 's time to say " you 've passed the line in the sand .
Move back and review the harm that 's been done and think again " .

What are these ?
The New York City area is at " substantially greater " risk of earthquakes than previously thought , scientists said Thursday .
Damage could range from minor to major , with a rare but potentially powerful event killing people and costing billions of dollars in damage .
A pattern of subtle but active faults is known to exist in the region , and now new faults have been found .
The scientists say that among other things , the Indian Point nuclear power plants , 24 miles north of the city , sit astride the previously unidentified intersection of two active seismic zones .
The findings are detailed in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America .
Shaky history
While earthquakes are typically thought of as a West Coast phenomenon in the nation , strong quakes do occur in the Eastern United States , just much less frequently .
Importantly , the geology of the East — lots of hard rock leftover from glacial times — makes any rumbling travel a lot farther and with greater intensity from the epicenter .
A 5.0 temblor in 1737 , for example , knocked down chimneys in New York City and was felt from Boston to Philadelphia .
A magnitude - 5.5 quake in 1884 did similar damage in a wider region around New York .
Another quake in this range struck in 1783 .
The new study involved an analysis of past quakes , plus 34 years of new data on temblors , most of them perceptible only by modern seismic instruments .
The scientists looked at 383 earthquakes from 1677 to 2007 in a 15,000 - square - mile area around New York City , using newspaper records in some cases to estimate temblor magnitudes .
" The evidence charts unseen but potentially powerful structures whose layout and dynamics are only now coming clearer , " the scientists said .
And even though eastern quakes are infrequent , the risk is high , because of the overwhelming concentration of people and infrastructure , said lead researcher Lynn R. Sykes of Columbia University 's Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory .
" The research raises the perception both of how common these events are , and , specifically , where they may occur , " he said .
" It 's an extremely populated area with very large assets . "
Based on history , the researchers say quakes at least 5.0 in magnitude should be expected , on average , about every 100 years .
" Today , with so many more buildings and people , a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention - getting , " said John Armbruster , also from the observatory .
" We 'd see billions in damage , with some brick buildings falling .
People would probably be killed . "
Even more serious quakes are possible .
The scientists said that the fault lengths and stresses suggest magnitude - 6 quakes , or even 7 — which would be 10 and 100 times bigger than magnitude 5 — are " quite possible . "
They calculate that magnitude - 6 quakes take place in the area about every 670 years , and magnitude - 7 temblors every 3,400 years .
Evidence mounts
Previous studies have hinted at the potential .
The New York City Area Consortium for Earthquake Loss Mitigation put the cost of theoretically possible large earthquakes in the metro New York area at $ 39 billion to $ 197 billion .
A separate 2001 analysis for northern New Jersey 's Bergen County estimated that a magnitude - 7 event could destroy 14,000 buildings and damage 180,000 in that area alone .
The new study revealed a significant previously unknown active seismic zone running at least 25 miles from Stamford , Conn. , to the Hudson Valley town of Peekskill , N.Y. , where it passes less than a mile north of the Indian Point nuclear power plant .
Several small quakes are clustered along its length .
It is " probably capable of producing at least a magnitude - 6 quake , " the researchers said in a statement .
Many eastern quakes are not visible at the surface , so a large quake could hit from a fault no one even knows about .
" The probability is not zero , and the damage could be great , " said study co-author Leonardo Seeber .
" It could be like something out of a Greek myth . "
LAS VEGAS , Nevada – Bike maker Craig Calfee has found a way to grow bicycle frames in a field , with sunlight and water .
He makes them out of bamboo .
" It 's like bonsai basically , " said Calfee , who is based in Santa Cruz ,
California .
" If you grow it in the shape you want it , it 's by far the strongest way to get it in the shape you want it . "
He 's been making bamboo bikes for awhile now , but because each bicycle is made to order , his workshop can turn out only limited numbers of the $ 2,700 frames .
To increase production and improve design , Craig is experimenting with growing bamboo into pre-formed shapes in the field .
By forcing the bamboo to grow through carefully placed barriers , the naturally straight plant grows with the bends and curves he needs for frames and other components .
Calfee said he 's experimenting with a limited number of plants , but can envision fields full of bamboo .
" It 's like mass production , " he said .
" A factory in a field .
You can have row after row of bamboo growing into the right structures for bike frames . "
According to Calfee , bamboo is an ideal material for bicycles :
It 's stronger and lighter than most metals , but absorbs road vibration much better .
" It 's tougher than metal , " he said .
" It takes impact very well . "
Calfee showed off one of his creations – a gorgeous bicycle with a bamboo frame with carbon fiber and titanium components .
It looks like a fast organic machine , a fascinating blend of natural and high - tech .
The bamboo frame tubes are held together with lugs made from a hemp epoxy composite ; long strips of hemp fiber soaked in epoxy that dry to create tough and durable lugs .
The bike is comparable in weight to an aluminum bike , Calfee said , but offers better performance .
Plus it appeals to consumers who want to buy green – a rapidly expanding market .
" Sales have been growing in double - digit numbers the last few years , " Calfee said .
" The bamboo is very much a green product .
People who buy it are making a statement as well as enjoying the ride quality . "

Commuters fume : Officials plan November return for all traffic signals Officials :
It could be November before all traffic lights restored
With darkened intersections leading to traffic snarls on freeways and city streets , officials are searching for at least some relief by putting more officers on traffic - directing duty and reopening high - occupancy vehicle lanes .
Traffic signals at about 1,200 Houston area intersections were not yet working Tuesday but should all have at least a flashing red light by the end of next week , said Mike Marcotte , the city 's director of public works and engineering .
" I 've been amazed with the courtesy our drivers have been showing , " Marcotte said .
" Our biggest issue at this point is going out and making repairs on the signals as well as waiting for power to be restored . "
Getting all the city 's traffic lights functioning at pre-Hurricane Ike levels could take until November , Marcotte said .
In some cases , it is not just a matter of getting the power restored , but also repairing equipment pummeled by Ike 's winds and rain , he said .
At least 90 percent of the city 's 2,500 intersections with traffic lights sustained damage from the storm , according to the city .
The pressure is on as some motorists report that their daily commutes are taking twice as long , and even pedestrians say they 're facing tougher times as they try to scramble and dodge their way across streets .
" More and more signals are being put in working condition every day , hour by hour almost , " said Harris County Judge Ed Emmett , who convened a meeting of transportation officials Tuesday afternoon to seek solutions to the problems .
" The flow in the community is getting better . "
All across Houston , informal rules seem to take hold at various intersections where the power is out .
Generally , the first car to stop is the first one to proceed , but in other instances , it seemed to be the biggest vehicle went first , or the motorist most willing to risk a dent .
" For the most part , Houston is behaving extremely well , " said Art Neely , who has driven a cab for 25 years .
Metro officials on Tuesday agreed to open high - occupancy vehicle lanes on U.S. 59 and U.S. 290 after traffic on many freeways came to a complete halt during the rush hour Monday , the first day many Houstonians went back to work after the storm .
The Gulf Freeway HOV , however , remains closed indefinitely because of storm damage .
Safety is a top priority
Metro Police Chief Tom Lambert said officers will be used to manually open HOV access gates and perform other duties that are normally done electronically .
" They are in a very precarious position and we are concerned about their safety , " he said of officers .
In an effort to keep those officers from being exposed during the dark hours , they 'll be open from 6 to 11 a.m. and from 2 to 7 p.m .
Officials urged HOV users to reduce their speed and drive with caution .
The Tidwell and Will Clayton ramps along the Eastex Freeway HOV and the Pinemont Park and Ride lot entrance ramp to the Northwest Freeway HOV will remain closed because of outages .
As far as the city streets go , Assistant Houston Police Chief Dorothy Edwards said with many emergency needs now out of the way , more officers will be dedicated to directing traffic and related transit issues .
Officers will be put primarily at major intersections without working traffic lights , she said .
Even with the frustrations on the city 's post - Ike congested roadways , police said they have n't noticed an upturn in the number of car accidents .
" We have n't been informed of any alarming numbers , which would indicate that the majority of motorists are abiding by the rules of the road , " Houston Police spokesman John Cannon said .
Chronicle reporters Mike Glenn and Todd Ackerman contributed to this story .

New Obama ad hits McCain 's computer illiteracy Nick Juliano
Published : Friday September 12 , 2008
Print This Email This Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has a pair of new television ads out Friday , including one that sharply portrays his Republican opponent John McCain as an out - of - touch product of Washington unfit to lead America in the 21st Century .
" Things have changed in the last 26 years .
But McCain hasnt , " an announcer says .
" He admits he still doesnt know how to use a computer , cant send an email . "
McCain pronounced himself " illiterate " on computer use in an interview earlier this year , and the admission has caused problems for the 72 - year - old candidate , particularly among younger voters some of whom have been online for more than half their lives .
The Obama ad also features footage of such 80s icons as the Rubik 's cube and a huge cell phone like the kind Michael Douglas 's character carries in the movie Wall Street .
A second Obama ad released Friday features a softer approach , with the candidate himself speaking directly to the camera about changing the country .
" Weve heard a lot of talk about change this year .
The question is , change to what ? "
Obama says .
" To me , change is a government that doesnt let banks and oil companies rip off the American people . "
He directs voters to his Web site for more details .
McCain also released a new ad Friday , continuing with his sneering " celebrity " attacks on Obama .
" He was the worlds biggest celebrity , but his stars fading .
So they lashed out at Sarah Palin , " an announcer says .
" Then desperately called Sarah Palin a liar .
How disrespectful . "
Aside from raising questions as to whether anyone at McCain headquarters has access to a thesaurus , the ad seems to suggest that calling a candidate on her lies is worse than the lies themselves .
As the Obama campaign , Democratic surrogates and scores of independent observers have noted , Palin and the McCain campaign have spread an array of untruths in recent weeks about Obama 's record and their own , particularly their oft - repeated lie about Palin telling the government " thanks but no thanks " on the Bridge to Nowhere .
FactCheck.org , which evaluates campaign statements for truthfulness , even said the latest ad itself of distorting quotes to make its case .
The three ads are reproduced below .
The Palm Jumeirah , the artificial island development in Dubai , claims it has three times the innovation , three times the ingenuity , and three times the ambition .
An ambitious engineering feat yes , but the Palm Jumeirah shows me nothing more the deep wallets and the pursuit of an illogical legacy for its developers .
I ca n’t even fathom the financial backing available in this area .
The potential for groundbreaking innovation in sustainable development is endless .
The desert / ocean ecosystem it was placed on appears ideal for potential capture of solar , hydro , and wind power , possibly capable of meeting all power needs using alternative energy sources , becoming a datum for further sustainable desert development .
This however is n’t the case .
Empty streets lined with the 2nd and 3rd homes of their prestigious owners lack people , landscape , and a sense of place .
The only prominent feature is the form of the man -made island , the palm , a form only experienced by angels and aviators .
A species which has ties with middle - eastern culture dating back thousands of years was significant enough to model a plan around but scarcely planted throughout the project .
Unfortunately , instead of money going into sustainable energy technologies it ’s pumped into the constant struggle to maintain its form against natural beach erosion and surf zone currents which continuously morph coastal geography .
Architecture , Landscape Architecture , and Engineering created the island .
All professions are typically serviced based and owe their livelihood to fees from such projects ( which had to of been astronomical ) and the clientele they keep .
As with Landscape Architecture , one of the professions ’ principles is that its practitioners are to be stewards of the land .
A concept since forgotten as sources of income for Landscape Architects became available for “ shrubbing up ” cookie cutter retail centers and model home developments across the U.S.
But when we ’re dependant on often misguided clients to fill our payrolls how can we steer them in the right direction why ’ll still maintaining the relationship ?
There are firms in the much earned and fortunate position of choosing clients that allow broad design freedom and pursue new avenues of innovation .
But what of the vast majority , what can be done to instill and educate the benefits to our clients of better land stewardship ?
With this kind of intervention between professional and client , Palm Jumeirah could of been different , it could of been something other then a phenomenal engineering feat , it could of been better , IMHO .
MUSIC NEWS - The UK press is reporting today that Led Zeppelin will reform for a major tour in 2009 !
Just last week , it was said that Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones were so determined to tour as Led Zeppelin , they were even considering hiring a new singer ( like YES and QUEEN ) .
According to the British , The Sun newspaper , such a shocker convinced singer Robert Plant to commit to a tour .
A source is quoted as saying : " The rest of the band had all but given up on Robert joining them , but they were determined to go ahead so had started to seriously explore other avenues .
" When Robert realized the band were serious about doing it without him , it made him think long and hard .
" He realized he could n't face the thought of not being involved .
The band were over the moon when he told them the news .
" They are now forging ahead with the tour plans and they can't wait to get on the road . "
The tour is rumored for summer 2009 ( can anyone say - STADIUMS ) , and follows on Led Zeppelin 's reunion show at London 's O2 Arena in December 2007 .
For most of 2008 , Plant had been concentrating on touring for his duet album with Alison Kraus , Raising Sand .
The band will be joined by drummer Jason Bonham , son of original drummer John Bonham ( who died at age 32 ) .
Bonham reported recently that the three members ( minus Plant ) had been working on new tunes , see related story here .
No word on a new Led Zep cd release yet .

MNN looks forward to an itinerary and ticket sale dates !!
UPDATE 12/22/08 - Robert
Plant has again said that the chances of a full Led Zeppelin tour with his involvement are still slim , despite the fact he still remains in regular contact with Jimmy Page .
In an interview broadcast yesterday ( December 21 , 2008 ) on BBC Radio Wales , Mr Plant said he was happy to keep working on music with Alison Krauss , who he has been touring with since 2007 .
He said : " I 'm doing very well with Alison and I 'm enjoying that .
I still see Jimmy quite a lot and he 's very complimentary and supportive of what I 'm doing .
But we are in different places now and you have to go on to do different things . "
UPDATE - 9/28/08 - Robert
Plant says NO to tour or album for new , see report here .

Yesterday in a local report on KTRK - TV in Houston , TX , reporter Wayne Dolcefino revealed that media have been blocked from covering Hurricane Ike ’s devastation .
In a press conference , Dolcefino pressed Gov. Rick Perry on why media are n’t even allowed to fly over parts of Galveston Island , noting that media access was far better in Mississippi and Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina .
Perry tried to brush off Dolcefino ’s concerns , but eventually passed blame to federal officials :
DOLCEFINO :
That is unprecedented and quite honestly not appropriate because it ’s our job to inform people .
Why ca n’t we go to Bolivar and West End ?
PERRY : I think when the local officials decide it was appropriate , whether it ’s the media or first responders or what have you .
The fact of the matter , that is actually a local decision , Wayne , that is made by the local county judge and by the mayor of those — DOLCEFINO :
They do n’t control that area .
PERRY : Last time , the state of Texas does n’t even .
DOLCEFINO : So it ’s the federal government ?
PERRY : I do n’t know .

UC researchers to study drug ’s effects on COVID - 19 patients
Researchers at the University of Cincinnati and UC Health will host a Phase 2 clinical trial ( NCT04511650 ) to examine the effects of a drug that targets blood vessel inflammation and injury in patients with COVID - 19 .
They will study the effects of razuprotafib , an investigational drug that activates a key pathway for stabilizing blood vessels in the lung and other organs in patients with moderate to severe cases of the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus SARS - CoV - 2 .
The drug may prevent and treat respiratory distress in COVID - 19 patients .
The Phase 2 clinical trial will assess safety , tolerability and efficacy of razuprotafib .
Four San Diego firefighters are suing the city government for damages because they were allegedly sexually harassed while participating involuntarily in the 2007 gay pride parade .
The four say they were ordered to drive their firetruck in the three - hour parade even though firefighters at previous parades had been subjected to catcalls and sexually suggestive comments by parade watchers .
The trial is scheduled to begin today .
The mandatory participation order was part of a policy by Fire Chief Tracy Jarman , according to the firefighters ’ attorney , Charles LiMandri .
Jarman , a lesbian , marched in the parade , which drew a crowd estimated at 150,000 to Hillcrest , a neighborhood with a large gay population .
“ This is not an anti-gay thing , ” LiMandri said .
“ These guys have served the Hillcrest community for years with dignity and honor .
They just feel firefighters should not be forced to participate in a parade where firefighters have been harassed in the past . ”

City Atty .
Michael Aguirre , who is representing the city and the Fire - Rescue Department , says the firefighters are “ required to serve the community without discrimination as to sexual orientation . ”
Riding on a firetruck during the gay pride parade is no different than other public - relations duties that firefighters perform as part of their job , such as taking firetrucks to schools , Aguirre argued in a court brief .
But one of the firefighters alleges that after protesting the parade assignment , he was given an unsatisfactory job rating by a “ lesbian battalion chief , ” LiMandri said .
The four , John Ghiotto , Chad Allison , Jason Hewitt and Alexander Kane , are seeking damages and reimbursement for therapy sessions and attorneys ’ fees .
Court papers do not mention a dollar figure , but published reports based on settlement negotiations suggest the four are seeking $ 3 million .

The parade is “ a sexually licentious event , where raucous and lewd behavior , conduct and dress is permitted , ” according to the firefighters ’ lawsuit .
To buttress that contention , pictures were submitted to the court showing men in skimpy clothing riding some of the floats .
The lawsuit includes a list of the taunts and sexually aggressive comments allegedly hurled at the firefighters .
The firefighters allege they were ordered to ride their truck in the parade when not enough firefighters volunteered .
Also in the parade were several dozen San Diego officials , police officers and other employees , including the city attorney .
Along with the sexual harassment contention , the lawsuit also alleges that the gay pride parade should be seen as a political event , “ designed to advocate for the civil rights of homosexuals , and in recent years to promote the controversial concept of gay marriage . ”
By forcing the firefighters to participate in the parade , the suit contends , the city was improperly recruiting them to support a political cause .

Aguirre , in a court brief , suggested that if the firefighters were feeling harassed , it was because of the negative reaction their lawsuit has garnered from the public and colleagues , including allegations the four are “ money - grubbers . ”
Among other cases , Aguirre cited a lawsuit by a comedy writer ’s assistant from the television show “ Friends ” who said the “ sexually coarse and vulgar language ” of the writers amounted to harassment .
The lawsuit failed , Aguirre said , because lewd talk alone is not sufficient to prove harassment .
The firefighters ’ case has been covered closely by both gay and Catholic publications .
Aguirre , locked in a tough reelection campaign , has told reporters he may represent the city in court .
The Michigan - based Thomas More Law Center , which is involved in numerous cases across the country involving religious issues , is backing the firefighters .
LiMandri of Rancho Santa
Fe is the center ’s West Coast director .

NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - A happily married couple in northern India got the shock of their lives when they learnt they had divorced 10 years ago , the Times of India reported on Tuesday .
Meena Verma , a mother of two children , tried to file a case against her in - laws for violence , only to be told by a court in Haryana state that she had been divorced for a decade .
Her husband Virender told the Times of India his brother , a lawyer , had apparently forged the divorce a decade earlier , when the couple were contemplating making a similar complaint .
“ It seems the divorce was doctored to defeat Meena ’s possible complaint , ” he said .
The couple filed a petition accusing Virender ’s brother , Surinder Verma , and four associates , of forgery .
Surinder denied the accusation .

DHS quietly expands border search policies Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday September 23 , 2008
Print This Email This The Department of Homeland Security quietly expanded its authorization to examine , copy and archive an array of documents and electronic files from citizens and visitors crossing US borders , according to reams of internal documents released Tuesday .
The changes implemented last year reverse a two - decade - old policy requiring border agents to have reasonable suspicion of a crime before reading documents someone is bringing into the country ; probable cause was required before documents could be copied .
Those standards have been thrown out the window in favor of lenient standards that allow Customs and Border Patrol agents to read or copy essentially anything they would like from a person entering the United States .
The new policies also make it easier for CBP to share documents it copies or confiscates with other law enforcement agencies .
Civil liberties advocates say the new standards raise troubling questions about protecting citizens '
First Amendment rights and could lead to customs agents serving as and end - run around the Fourth Amendment by conducting searches that would be prohibited from other agencies .
" For more than 20 years , the government implicitly recognized that reading and copying the letters , diaries , and personal papers of travelers without reason would chill Americans ' rights to free speech and free expression , " said Shirin Sinnar , a staff attorney with the Asian Law Caucus .
" But now customs officials can probe into the thoughts and lives of ordinary travelers without any suspicion at all . "
The ALC and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit against DHS to obtain more than 600 pages of internal documents outlining its policies concerning document collection and interviews conducted at the border .
The organizations obtained the documents this summer and published the documents Tuesday .
In an interview Tuesday , Sinar said she hoped the documents ' release would spur Congress to enact clearer and stricter standards governing border searches .
The documents themselves were heavily redacted , and the organizations are continuing to appeal for fuller disclosures , she said .
DHS does not reveal the procedures or equipment it uses to search electronic equipment .
Such disclosures could reveal its use of the CSI Stick , which allows for the quick and easy extraction of cell phone call logs , phone books , text messages and more information .
" We do n't know if customs is using that or other programs , " she told Raw Story , " but I suspect that they would be . "
According to an analysis of the documents ( pdf ) published by EFF and ALC , DHS reversed several key components of border search guidelines that were instituted in 1986 and updates to the policy made in 2000 .
Where customs officers previously could only " glance at documents to see if they were merchandise , " the latest policy allows officers to " review and analyze " any documents in a traveler 's possession with no suspicion at all .
Previous prohibitions on copying documents without a traveler 's permission or probable cause also were eliminated , allowing customs to " detain documents or copies for a ' reasonable period of time to perform a thorough border search . ' "
( Emphasis in original . )
DHS 's border search policies have come under scrutiny particularly as they relate to electronic devices and information .
Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) has raised concerns about the government 's ability to copy the contents of travelers ' laptops , cell phones , digital cameras and PDAs .
" The invasion of privacy represented by a search of a laptop differs by an order of magnitude from that of a suitcase , " Feingold said during a June hearing on the laptop searches . " I guarantee you this : neither the drafters of the Fourth Amendment , nor the Supreme Court when it crafted the ' border search exception , ' ever dreamed that tens of thousands of Americans would cross the border every day , carrying with them the equivalent of a full library of their most personal information . "
A Feingold spokesman said the senator would have no immediate comment on Tuesday 's release of the documents .
DHS refused to send anyone to face questions from Feingold during the June 25 hearing .
Instead the agency passed along some superficial prepared testimony from a deputy DHS commissioner in charge of customs .
The testimony included some anecdotes about stopping pedophiles at the border but did little to address the privacy concerns regarding the department 's extraordinary search authorities .
The department also provided the committee with a copy of its border search policy .
The policy provided in June , as well as the wider cache of documents made public Tuesday makes clear that DHS has wide latitude over how and when it can share the information it collects .
For example , customs agents can hand over collected documents or files if they need " technical assistance " to translate or decrypt computer files or to determine whether the documents provide reasonable suspicion of a crime .
The border search policy reads , in part : Officers may encounter information in documents or electronic devices that is not in a foreign language or encrypted , but that nevertheless requires referral to subject matter experts to determine whether the information is relevant to the laws enforced and administered by CBP .
Once the information is in the hands of another agency , that agency can keep a copy of it " to the extent that it has the independent legal authority to do so . "
Such a set - up makes it quite easy for other agencies to access copies of private documents from travelers .
" It 's quite easy to say you need technical assistance , " Sinnar said .
Once they see what 's in those documents they can rely on that information to decide whether they have the authority to hold on to them , she added .
DHS says its expanded authority is necessary .
An official justified the policy to the Washington Post , which reported on the new policies Tuesday .
DHS spokeswoman Amy Kudwa said the updating of policies reflects an effort to be more transparent .
In an e-mail , she wrote that the decision of U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) " to change some of the standards in its old policies reflects the realities of the post - 9/11 environment , the agency 's expanded mission and legal authorities , and developments in the law , including the Homeland Security Act of 2003 .
Although certain aspects of the policies have changed , the policies have always reflected the notion that officers have the constitutional authority to inspect information presented at the border " without requiring suspicion of a particular traveler .
Civil liberties groups like EFF and ALC , though , say too many innocent Americans are getting caught up when they try to enter the country .
Amir Khan , an IT consultant who lives in the Bay Area , says he has spent between 20 and 25 hours detained by customs agents when returning from five separate trips abroad .
Khan 's travels took him mostly to Europe for business and once to visit family in Pakistan .
He said a border agent demanded to examine files on his laptop and quizzed him on the books he was reading , including some religious texts .
" I asked many times , ' What can I do to resolve this ? ' " he told Raw Story .
" They told me there 's nothing I can do . "
What kind of person tells a self - aggrandizing lie , gets called on it , admits publicly that the truth is not at all what she originally claimed — and then goes out and starts telling the original lie again without changing a word ?
Sarah Palin is beginning to seem like quite an unusual woman , and I ’m not talking about her love of guns and “ snow machines , ” her faith , her family or any of the presumably non-elite attributes that we in the “ elite media ” are accused of savaging .
Wrongly accused , I should add ; reporters are doing nothing more sinister than trying to find out who she is , how she thinks and what she has done in office .
One deeply troubling thing we ’re learning about Palin is that , as far as she ’s concerned , unambiguous fact does n’t appear to rise even to the level of inconvenience .
I ’m sorry , but to explain my point I have to make another visit — my last , I hope — to the never - built , $ 398 - million “ Bridge to Nowhere ” that was to join the town of Ketchikan , Alaska , with its airport on the other side of the Tongass Narrows .
You ’ll recall that in her Republican convention speech , Palin burnished her budget - hawk credentials by claiming she had said “ thanks but no thanks ” to a congressional earmark that would have paid most of the cost .
A quick check of the public record showed that Palin supported the bridge when she was running for governor , continued to support it once she took office and dropped her backing only after the project — by then widely ridiculed as an example of pork - barrel spending — was effectively dead on Capitol Hill .
In her interview with ABC ’s Charles Gibson , Palin ‘ fessed up .
It was “ not inappropriate ” for a mayor or a governor to work with members of Congress to obtain federal money for infrastructure projects , she argued .
“ What I supported , ” she said , “ was a link between a community and its airport . ”
Case closed .
Except that on Saturday , days after the interview , Palin said this to a crowd in Nevada : “ I told Congress thanks but no thanks to that Bridge to Nowhere — that if our state wanted to build that bridge , we would build it ourselves . ”
That ’s not just a lie , but an acknowledged lie .
What she actually told Congress was more like , “ Gimme the money for the bridge ” — and then later , after the whole thing had become an embarrassment , she did n’t object to using the money for other projects .
I ’m not shocked to learn that politicians sometimes lie .
To cite an example that comes immediately to mind , John McCain ’s campaign ads attacking Barack Obama have taken such liberties that even Karl Rove says he wonders if they ’ve gone too far .
But it ’s weird for a politician — or anyone else , really — to maintain that an assertion is true after admitting that it is n’t true .
Maybe Palin cynically believes she can keep using the “ no thanks ” line and manage to stay one step ahead of the truth police .
Maybe she calculates that audiences would rather believe her than their lying eyes .
Or maybe she really believes her own fantasy - based version of events .
Maybe the Legend of Sarah Palin has become , on some level , more real to her than actual history .
And quite a legend it ’s turning out to be .
The Washington Post reported Sunday that as mayor of tiny Wasilla , Palin pressured the town librarian to remove controversial books from the shelves , cut funds for the town museum but somehow found the money for a new deputy administrator slot , and told city employees not to talk to reporters .
And The New York Times reported Sunday that as governor , Palin appointed a high - school classmate , Franci Havemeister , to a $ 95,000 - a- year job as head of the state Division of Agriculture .
Havemeister “ cited her childhood love of cows as a qualification for running the roughly $ 2 million agency , ” the Times reported , noting her as one of at least five schoolmates Palin has given high - paying state government jobs .
Nothing against cows .
Nothing against high - school BFFs and being true to your school .
But a different picture of Sarah Palin is beginning to emerge .
The McCain campaign would like us to see a straight - talking , gun-toting , moose - eviscerating , lipstick - wearing frontierswoman .
Instead , we ’re beginning to discern an ambitious , opportunistic politician who makes no bones about rewarding friends and punishing those who stand in her way — and who believes that truth is nothing more , and nothing less , than what she says it is .

While the Alaska State Troopers and most municipal police agencies have covered the cost of exams , which cost between $ 300 to $ 1,200 apiece , the Wasilla police department does charge the victims of sexual assault for the tests .
Wasilla Police Chief Charlie Fannon does not agree with the new legislation , saying the law will require the city and communities to come up with more funds to cover the costs of the forensic exams .
" In the past weve charged the cost of exams to the victims insurance company when possible .
I just dont want to see any more burden put on the taxpayer , " Fannon said .
While Sarah Palin was mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , the police department was charging rape victims for their own rape kits Implicit in Fannon 's comment is either a belief that most women who report rape are liars , or a genuine apathy that women are raped — because the taxpayers who suffer the " burden " of paying for rape kits have a vested interest in ensuring their community is free of rapists .
Only someone who thinks rapes do n't really happen , or does n't care , would ignore the value to every taxpayer of an investment in convicting rapists .
As regards then - Mayor Palin 's complicity , Bitch PhD quite correctly notes that it's fair to assume Palin supported the policy of charging victims ( or their insurance companies , when possible ) for the rape kits , considering that Fannon was a Palin appointee and " in a town of that size , the mayor does n't get to plead ignorance of policies or public statements of her own chief of police .
" Frankly , given that Palin does n't support legal abortion even in the case of a pregnancy resulting from rape , and that she raised the sales tax to pay for Wasilla 's clusterfucktastrophied $ 15 million sports complex while victims paid for rape kits , I 'm not inclined to believe that she has much sympathy for rape victims at all .
Making her a perfect running mate for a man who thinks rape is hilarious [ H/T to everyone in the multiverse . ]
Things are very much in flux on the Hill as both parties grapple with this massive bailout proposal .
From what we ’re hearing , things are in such a preliminary stage that members are still trying to figure out basics like where colleagues stand and what type of legislation the bailout will be packaged as , let alone what it will contain .
TPMmuckraker obtained a copy of the outline of an alternative bailout plan being floated by Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - CA ) that offers more oversight of the bailout , which is n’t hard to do , since the Administration ’s proposal is virtually oversight - free .

At least one Republican on the House Financial Services Committee considers the Paulson proposal is a no - go .
Many people love shopping at Costco because of the wide variety of items available including their organic items offered at a reasonable price and their store brand quality products , Kirkland .

Writing in the National Review Online , conservative columnist Kathleen Parker calls for Sarah Palin to bow out :
Palin ’s recent interviews with Charles Gibson , Sean Hannity , and now Katie Couric have all revealed an attractive , earnest , confident candidate .
Who Is Clearly Out Of Her League .
No one hates saying that more than I do .
Like so many women , I ’ve been pulling for Palin , wishing her the best , hoping she will perform brilliantly .
I ’ve also noticed that I watch her interviews with the held breath of an anxious parent , my finger poised over the mute button in case it gets too painful .
Unfortunately , it often does .
My cringe reflex is exhausted .
[ …]
When Couric pointed to polls showing that the financial crisis had boosted Obama ’s numbers , Palin blustered wordily : “ I ’m not looking at poll numbers .
What I think Americans at the end of the day are going to be able to go back and look at track records and see who ’s more apt to be talking about solutions and wishing for and hoping for solutions for some opportunity to change , and who ’s actually done it ? ”
If BS were currency , Palin could bail out Wall Street herself .
Gmail , Google ’s online email system has an interesting take on the storage it gives users .
Rather than give out a flat number , like say , 5 gigabytes , Gmail has a policy called “ Infinity + 1 . ” Basically , this means that the amount of storage you get is always growing .
Today , the amount of storage each Gmail user gets surpassed 7 gigabytes for the first time .
For some comparison , Microsoft ’s Windows Live Mail gives users 5 gigabytes of storage .
But Yahoo
Mail claims to give out an unlimited amount — as far as I know that claim has never been put to the test .
Google originally blew all of the other online email services out of the water when it launched in 2004 with 1 gigabyte of storage .
( Some even thought it was an April Fools ’ joke because it launched on April Fools Day . )
At the time some competing services offered as little as 10 megabytes of storage .
A year later , Google upped that storage to 2 gigabytes , free to all users .
Then it decided to put its ever - growing method for storage in place .
But users who require more than the current 7 GB can purchase more .
It ’s $ 20 a year for 10 GB , $ 75 for 40 GB , $ 250 for 150 GB and $ 500 for 400 GB .
But that storage can be used across many of Google ’s services , like its Picasa photo service , for example .
Some may think that Gmail ’s current 7,168 megabytes of storage equates to 7.1 gigabytes , but the conversion is not done in multiples of 10 .
Instead , there are 1,024 bytes in one Kilobyte ( KB ) and 1,024 KB in one Megabyte ( MB ) and so on …
Thus , 7.168 MB equals 7 GB .
There is much news today about the housing mess as well as soaring health care and education , fuel and food costs .
With very few exceptions , most politicians have plans to fix all this with greater government oversight and funding .
But wait a minute .
Is n't government oversight and funding why these issues are out of control in the first place ?
Wo n't more of the same certainly make it worse ?
Housing –
We all know what 's happening in the housing and financial markets but do we know why ?
We already know that “ public ” funds are at work .
The government has created trillions of dollars of indiscriminate funding via Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae .
This funding has driven the cost of housing out of reach of most folks without the help of Freddie and Fannie .
Government has removed personal responsibility from the equation .
Can we say “ Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 ” ?
Government has taught that housing is an entitlement .
Hmm .
Show me how .
Government has “ tax - incentivized ” housing through any number of instruments but the most obvious is the mortgage interest deduction , a huge incentive to borrow money to buy a house .
By the way , why can one taxpayer deduct thousands in mortgage interest from his income , while a neighbor in similar circumstances , but renting , cannot ?
The taxpayer is on the verge of taking over something like $ 5 trillion in debt from Freddie and Fannie .
Never mind the $ 300 billion created out of thin air for the foreclosure prevention act .
Never mind the rescue of failed institutions like IndyMac , Bear Stearns and others .
Most homeowners if they still have a house , have little , no , or negative equity in their largest and most emotional investment … their home !
Have we learned our lesson yet ?
Health Care –
Our health care expenditures currently represent about 17 % of our GDP ( around $ 2 trillion , or about $ 7,026 per person ) , and are on track to consume 20 % of our GDP in 2017 , doubling to around $ 4 trillion .
Prior to 1960 , health care consumed less than 5 % of our personal expenditures while food consumed more than 20 % .
Now food has been halved to about 10 % while health care has quadrupled to our largest single personal expenditure coming in at around 20 % !
Certainly health care has benefitted from technological advances , just like every other sector , including food , but technology should drive the cost down , not up .
That 's what technology does .
Take as an example , calculators .
When I started college in the mid 70's , a simple electronic calculator cost more than a well equipped personal computer costs today .
So why are health care costs so out of control ?
We already know that “ public ” funds pick up half of our National health care tab .
These indiscriminate funds have certainly driven up the cost of health care , just like they did the housing bubble , duh !
Government has removed personal responsibility from the equation .
“ Somebody else ” is paying for it .
Government has taught that health care is an entitlement .
Hmm .
Show me how .
Many say that health care is the responsibility of the employer .
Why ?
Government tells us that we need universal insurance to pay for health care .
Insurance is a big part of the problem and none of the solution .
If medical insurance is such a great idea , then why is it that employers can deduct it as an expense while an individual that purchases his own cannot ?
Government has tax - incentivized health care through various “ medical IRA ” instruments , creating even more funds to be spent on health care or not at all .
Some even have a “ use it or lose it ” provision FORCING one to purchase unnecessary health care !
Is “ inflationary ” the right word ?
By the way , if “ medical IRA 's ” or health savings accounts ( HSA 's ) are such a great idea , then why can't everybody have one ?
Why must we purchase a high deductible insurance policy to be able to take advantage of an HSA .
It is obvious that the real beneficiary of the HSA is the insurance companies .
And all for what ?
Are we healthier ?
Absolutely not .
Are we living longer ?
Yes , but at what cost and quality of life ?
Let 's see , if electronic calculators had gone the way of health care ?
Hmm . I wonder .
Education –
In 1977 the average cost of college tuition was $ 924 .
By 2006 , it was up to $ 7,601 , rising at twice the rate of inflation .
Graduates are entering the workplace with debts that they may never be able to repay , never mind purchase a house or pay for health care .
Why ?
We already know that “ public ” funds are at work here .
Like about $ 20 billion in Pell grants as just one example .
Almost half of the college tuition and fees is paid by grants or government backed loans .
Let 's see , we have government grants and loans to pay for tuition at government institutions .
Is there something wrong with this picture ?
Am I missing something ?
These indiscriminate funds have certainly driven up the cost of higher education , just like they did health care and housing , duh !
Government has removed personal responsibility from the equation .
“ Somebody else ” is paying for it .
Government is scrambling to find new and creative ways to forgive educational debt including government service .
This can be interpreted 3 ways .
Conscription .
Slavery .
Socialism .
No Thanks !
Government has taught that education is an entitlement .
Hmm .
Show me how .
Government has tax - incentivized education through various “ educational IRA ” instruments , creating even more funds to be spent on education or not at all .
By creating money out of thin air ( grants , loans , and tax - incentivized savings plans ) the cost of higher education has been driven to an unfortunate end where many graduates are entering the workplace in mediocre professions with mediocre skills and a debt that they may never be able to repay .
Y'know , miracle of miracles , I believe I see a pattern developing !
Three huge sectors of our society thoroughly corrupted and adulterated by similar government policies .
Can we stop this insanity ?
Food and fuel is a little different story .
Fuel – Oil has doubled in price in the last year .
Yeah , yeah , yeah , we can blame big oil and George Bush , but the real culprits are :
A fiscal policy of economic growth through deficit spending , ( see Housing , Health Care and Education above ) resulting in a weak , diluted currency .
The cost of everything we import ( like oil ) rises .
Increased demand for energy from developing countries .
Restrictions on domestic production .
Food – Agriculture is very energy intensive so a doubling in the cost of energy will certainly pressure food prices ( and everything else for that matter ) to rise accordingly .
Furthermore , our weakened currency makes what few exports we still have ( like food and fertilizer ) to be in higher demand overseas placing even more upward pressure on food costs .
Many blame ethanol for increased food costs , but I 'm afraid it is just not so…at least not now .
Food and fuel have not yet been as corrupted as housing , education and health care , but this year 's political wannabes plan to fix all of these problems with more of the very policies that created them in the first place !
Insane !
Most if not all of our problems can be laid squarely at the feet of government policy .
Many wish to tax the “ rich ” to pay for more failed policy and give the working man a break .
Here 's an interesting thought .
If we take from the “ rich ” and give to the “ poor ” wo n't the funds be spent such that the “ rich ” become richer ?

It was a great line :
Listening to [ Obama ] speak , it 's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or even a reform , not even in the state senate .
I guess we should thank Matt Scully for inserting the word " major . "
You can go look at Obama 's State Senate legislative record here .
And his US Senate record here .
At last count , sponsorship of 820 laws in Illinois , and authorship of 152 bills and co-sponsorship of 427 in Washington .
The 2007 Ethics Reform bill alone cannot be dismissed as simply non-existent .
And since part of Palin 's own claim to substance is an ethics reform bill , it seems extremely weird that she should believe that Obama 's record is a total zero .
At her first press conference , why not ask her why she said that Obama has never passed a single reform , when he passed the 2007 Ethics Reform , described by many as the most sweeping package of its kind since Watergate .
Of course , she does n't know .
She was given this speech .
But she should be asked to respond to the question of why she said something patently untrue to the entire country .
But you can see the idea here : to keep equating Palin 's experience with Obama's .
At one point , Rudy Giuliani claimed that after her first day as governor of Alaska , Palin had more executive experience than Joe Biden and Barack Obama combined .
So there 's your standard .
It 's fatuous and stupid .
But if you repeat it often enough , it might just work .

Here 's part two of Sarah Palin 's disastrous interview with Katie Couric .
Yesterday Palin could n't provide a single example of John McCain favoring market regulations , and today she tries to defend the foreign policy " experience " she gleaned from being Governor of a state that 's close to Russia .

It 's a well - known fact that the big three console manufacturers - Sony , Nintendo and Microsoft - all want your money .
Once you fork out a few hundred notes for a console , they have you in their mighty grip , and bleed you dry with their capitalist agendas .
In some cases , this can be as much as £ 300 over the next five years , not including essentials they do n't include with the console .
It 's similar to hidden bank charges , except Watchdog 's Nicky Campbell wo n't be fighting your corner - he 'll be kicking your a*se at Halo instead .
Before we begin tearing apart consoles for their economic crimes , the SKUs ( Stock - keeping Unit ) tested are the standard ones - the basic Wii bundle ( with Wii Sports ) , the 60 GB Premium Xbox 360 package , and the latest 80 GB PlayStation 3 with DualShock .
Prices are the RRP , but you can knock off a few quid here and there if you shop around .
Electricity Costs
Like any appliance , consoles will use up different amounts of power , and the difference between them is staggering .
The Wii , the simpleton of the bunch , will use up to ten times less power than its high - definition competitors , with the PS3 requiring the most electricity .
They were n't messing around when they said this is the most powerful generation yet .
Nuclear power station peripherals are yet to be confirmed .
Wii - 12.41 kWh - £ 1.98 a year
Xbox 360 - 120.45 kWh - £ 19.21 a year
PS3 - 204.40 kWh - £ 32.60 a year
The Wii is hands down the cheapest , but the PS3 will make those energy price rises your worst nightmare .
Figures are based on playing a game from a disc ( standby and movie playback differ ) for two hours per day for a year .
( Figures obtained from sust - it. net . )
Controllers
You 'll be screwed without them , and charitably each console comes boxed with one .
If you want to play with your mates then your wallet will have to take a gut punch , and in the case of recharging them , selling its kidney on the wallet black market .
PS3 - Technically there are no added extras , however early adopters missed out on the now - standard rumbling DualShock 3 .
This will set you back £ 40 .
Xbox 360 - There is no rechargeable option out of the box unlike the PS3 , but at least it has one - a Play & Charge kit retails for £ 15 , and additional wireless controllers are £ 30 a pop .
That 's £ 60 for two charge kits and an extra wireless pad .
However you can save by getting a Wired controller for £ 25 .
Wii - Comes with a Wii remote and Nunchuk , however an additional remote costs £ 30 , and Nunchuk £ 15 .
That 's £ 45 for one additional control set .
And to add insult to injury , there are no rechargeable options .
Hope you have a fresh supply of batteries .
The PS3 is hands down the cheapest , however the others differ according to what you buy .
Technically the Wii is the most expensive , considering it costs £ 45 for the extra control set without recharge .
The 360 is £ 60 for an extra pad and two recharge kits , but you can always make do with wired controllers or your own batteries .
Television Cables
Confusion sets in at this point , where many gamers are left stranded behind their television , adopting the foetal position and shaking in bewilderment .
All consoles come with connection cables , but the quality varies immensely , even between standard definition ( SD ) and high definition ( HD ) .
From plain awful to crystal clear the cables rank composite ( SD ) , RGB ( SD ) , component ( SD / HD ) , and HDMI ( HD ) .
Considering there are more HD sets than before , cables are as vital as anything else on this list .
Xbox 360 - Comes with component for HD out of the box , also doubling up as composite cables for those with normal tellies .
While there are better SD and HD options , these options will do you just fine .
Wii - Comes with a composite cable .
While it looks bad , on a standard definition set it is passable , but you should get either an RGB or component cable .
You need component for the best resolution on HDTV sets .
They each cost £ 20 .
PS3 - Just a composite cable ; no HD option in the box .
Your gorgeous new HD console will look like it 's being played back through an ' 80s VCR .
You need a component or HDMI cable , stat .
That 's £ 20 , thank you very much .
While all three consoles could have better cables , the 360 offers you a near - perfect solution out of the box that gives you decent HD and SD connections .
The Wii could do with an upgrade , while the PS3 needs one .
What 's cheaper , a HDMI cable or cataract surgery ?
You be the judge .
Connecting to the internet
If there is one big leap this generation , it 's that each console feeds on byte - sized information from the World Wide Web .
If you want to get the most from your new pride and joy , you need to connect to the internet .
PS3 - Comes with both Wi -Fi receiver and LAN port for both wireless and wired connections .
Perfect .
Wii - Wi -Fi receiver only .
If you want to connect via LAN port , you can buy one for £ 20 .
Xbox 360 - Ethernet port only .
If you want to get a plug in Wi -Fi receiver , it 'll set you back £ 60 .
While they all have a base covered , the PS3 hits a home run by being as flexible as an Olympian gymnast .
Considering many households own a wireless router , paying £ 60 to have the privilege to do so takes the metaphorical biscuit .
Bridge your internet connection to your 360 and spend that £ 60 on a pick - and - mix .
Other Additions
These are the little added extras that most people would purchase in their console 's lifetime .
Not surprisingly , Microsoft pushes these little additions .
Xbox Live subscription -
While the Wii and PS3 online services are free , full Gold membership costs £ 40 a year on the 360 .
Without it , you cannot play online with others or access certain content .
Downloadable Content -
This is subjective , as many games offer additional content that perhaps should be in the full product , but are not on the disc .
But when games such as Beautiful Katamari ( 360 ) ask you to pay to unlock things already on the disc , it reinforces the point that you have to be a millionaire playboy to get the most out of everything .
So when it boils down to it , which console is the most expensive ?
Brushing aside the base package , games and optional extras , the initial investment is about the same for all three systems , although the 360 is cheapest if you opt out of the recharge options .
However the on - going running costs of electricity and subscriptions might find your Xbox 360 finding a new home on eBay .
If you plan to keep it for the next five years , it could cost as much as £ 295 , compared to Wii 's paltry upkeep of £ 10 .
The PlayStation 3 is n't economically friendly either , coming in at £ 163 .
Eep .
Initial investment -
Wii - £ 65 ( television cable upgrade , extra Wii remote and Nunchuk )
PS3 - £ 60 ( television cable upgrade , additional DualShock 3 controller )
Xbox 360 - £ 30 ( extra wireless controller )
On - going investment ( per year ) -
Wii - £ 1.98 ( electricity )
PS3 - £ 32.60 ( electricity )
Xbox 360 - £ 59.21 ( electricity , Live subscription )
It should be noted that these are all optional costs - you do n't need to buy another controller , to purchase a Live subscription or run your console every day for the next few years .
But many people do , and if you are thinking of getting a new system for yourself or someone else these little costs add up to something fierce .
The Xbox 360 is the worst for those hidden costs , although the others are n't exactly innocent either .
When you consider this does n't include what you actually bought it for - the games - it shows that this hobby is a costly thing indeed .

The event may have been largely ignored by the mainstream media , but Ron Paul hosted a press conference today that featured all of the major third party candidates , with the exception of Bob Barr , who is still trying to get Paul ’s endorsement .
The point of today ’s event was to promote third party unity and call on Americans to reject the closed two party system .
“ Pretending that a true difference exists between the two major candidates is a charade of great proportion .
Many who help to perpetuate this myth are frequently unaware of what they are doing and believe that significant differences actually do exist .
Indeed , on small points there is the appearance of a difference .
The real issues , however , are buried in a barrage of miscellaneous nonsense and endless pontifications by robotic pundits hired to perpetuate the myth of a campaign of substance .
The truth is that our two - party system offers no real choice .
The real goal of the campaign is to distract people from considering the real issues , ” Paul said .
“ Today ’s coming together of third party candidates marks the beginning of the realignment of American politics .
While Congressman Paul and I do not agree on all things — such as health and safety regulations and health insurance systems and how to handle areas where the market fails or is not up to the task of getting the best outcomes for the American people — on the overriding foreign policy , reckless waste financed by deficit spending , and civil liberties issues of the day , we stand together .
He is a stalwart who has consistently stood up for what he believes in and never wavered when he is opposed by the legions of commercial interests and lobbyists that swarm the Capitol , ” Ralph Nader said .

Paul talked about how our current system does n’t represent most people , “ The system we have today allows a President to be elected by as little as 32 % of the American people , with half of those merely voting for the “ lesser of two evils ” .
Therefore , as little as 16 % actually vote for a president .
No wonder when things go wrong , anger explodes .
A recent poll shows that 60 % of the American people are not happy with the two major candidates this year . ”
Nader also made his pitch to Paul ’s supporters , “ Some unfairly paint the Nader / Gonzalez candidacy as being for big government .
Nothing could be more untrue .
Nader / Gonzalez supports a government of the people , by the people , for the people .
We agree with Congressman Paul that government is rife with waste and corporate demands , and needs to be scaled back in many areas — most of all the bloated , wasteful US military budget , which is half of the government ’s total operating budget .
We are also against big government doling out hundreds of billions in corporate welfare , subsidies , and bailouts to companies . ”
Dr. Paul called for a rejection of the two party system , and encouraged people to vote for anyone but the Big Two , “ The strongest message can be sent by rejecting the two - party system , which in reality is a one - party system with no possible chance for the changes to occur which are necessary to solve our economic and foreign policy problems .
This can be accomplished by voting for one of the non-establishment principled candidates – Baldwin , Barr , McKinney , Nader , and possibly others …
For me , though , my advice – for what it ’s worth – is to vote !
Reject the two candidates who demand perpetuation of the status quo and pick one of the alternatives that you have the greatest affinity to , based on the other issues . ”
If you look around this website you will see that we too have been caught up in writing articles about pigs in lipstick and other things that do n’t matter , but that is what people are conditioned to read about .
They love the horserace element of the campaign , not the issues .
Our federal election system is broken .
The Commission on Presidential Debates either has to be opened up to third parties or done away with .
I believe that true reform will come to our country when all ideas are heard equally , but the system will be changed only if the American people demand it .
I may not totally agree with Ron Paul on the issues , but I completely support his efforts to open up our political process .
One of the reasons that I support Obama is because he is the only viable option to get the nation away from neo -con rule .
If a guy like Ralph Nader had a chance in a fair system , he would be able to seriously compete for my vote .
This is the sad , but true , reality of our current electoral system .
In his presentation to the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas yesterday , Dan Reicher , director of climate and energy initiatives at Google.org , suggested that Enhanced Geothermal Systems , or E.G.S. , might well be “ the killer app ” of clean energy technology .
Coming from Google , those are big words .
If Mr. Reicher and the search giant are right , the implications could be profound .
Traditional geothermal systems have long been deployed in Japan , Europe and Australia , but its potential is limited to those spots on the planet where hydrothermal vents are already present and reachable .
E.G.S. advocates , on the other hand , highlight its global ubiquity .
Midway through the conference , which brought roughly 1,000 academics , politicians and curious onlookers to Nevada over the last two days , I had a chance to buttonhole Mr. Reicher and two other principals in the exploration of next - generation geothermal technology : Steven Chu , the Nobel laureate and director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , and Don O’Shei , whose company , AltaRock Energy , just received a $ 6.25 million investment from Google ( see yesterday ’s post . )
Excerpts from our low - budget video conversation follow :
Joyce Sequence
The sequence of numbers giving the number of digits in the three - fold power tower .
The values of for , 2 , ... are 1 , 16 , 7625597484987 , ... ( OEIS A002488 ; Rossier 1948 ) , so the Joyce sequence is 1 , 2 , 13 , 155 , 2185 , 36306 , ... ( OEIS A054382 ) .
Laisant ( 1906 ) found the term , and Uhler ( 1947 ) published the logarithm of this number to 250 decimal places ( Wells 1986 , p. 208 ) .
The sequence is named in honor of the following excerpt from the " Ithaca " chapter of James Joyce 's Ulysses : " Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places , e.g. , the 9th power of the 9th power of 9 , that , the result having been obtained , 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units , tens , hundreds , thousands , tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands , millions , tens of millions , hundreds of millions , billions , the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers .

Given FiveThirty
Eight 's origins , it is n't surprising that Quinn uses a sports analogy in describing the veep pick , when he says :
" [ McCain's VP Pick ] Is Not A Hockey Mom "
Hockey 's a great way to look at politics .
It has both finesse and brutality , and it take a bit of both to win .
But there 's a fundamental , unwritten rule to that brutality -- the person who hits back gets the penalty .
A smart team takes its licks , focuses on the puck , and understands that sooner or later the other team will get caught in its mistakes .
Sure , the Republicans are having a golden run of not getting caught .
But that is starting to turn .
And , as in hockey , that turn can be helped along .
But , as in hockey - - hitting back draws unwanted attention .
This is the case with the VP pick .
Quinn says ,
Initiators win , reactors lose .
Expect adversity , because it 's built in .
The fourth - line , no - scoring - talent , pest agitators ( or as we now call them , " energy guys " ) have a specific job .
Skate in , take a cheap shot , make it after the whistle .
Make it against the rules .
Stir something up .
Put a wet glove in the other guy 's face and rub it .
Get the outrage flowing .
Get the opponent not thinking about the game , get them thinking about your shenanigans .
And what happens ?
The " victimized " team loses its composure , hitting back .
The guy who hits second is always the guy who goes to the penalty box .
So true .
I remember the inestimable Chico Resch , of the New York Islanders .
He played goalie for many years , helping the Isles to the Stanley Cup in 1980 .
I had the honor of watching him , live , against the Flyers in the Stanley Cup playoffs in 1975 .
Great game .
He had a tactic he'd use on players as they skated past his box .
Every once in a while he take his stick and give the opponent a hit on the legs as they skated by .
Nothing hard , nothing to knock someone over .
But annoying .
I was a hockey newbie - - young - - back then .
The first time I saw that live I asked my Dad " why does he keep doing that ? "
And my Dad said " just watch . "
And sure as rain , eventually some idiot lost his cool and went after Resch , swinging .
Guess who ended up in the box ?
Watching [ McCain's VP pick ] this week , and the reaction to her by both sides , and all the talk of hockey mommery , I realized that this is who she is .
She skates into the corner , throws up an elbow , and the Democrats cry : " Foul ! " Hey !
She said Obama has never passed a major bill – this is an objective lie !
Hey !
She ridiculed community organizing the day after Service was the theme !
Technically people should punish her by not voting for her over this infraction !
It ’s whining , and whiners hit back second and go to the penalty box on top of it .
Think Craig Berube , .
Think Tie Domi but without the scoring skills .
Their purpose was to stir up trouble , not score goals .
Think politics .
In the hockey analogy , [ McCain 's VP pick ] would n’t get within a thousand miles of an NHL All - Star Game because she ’s not a scoring talent .
She ’s a role player , an emotion - rouser .
Emotion messes with the chalkboard - drawn game plan and thus achieves a specific strategic objective .
She can make game - changing agitation plays that rouse her home team and provoke the other side into counterattacks that – 100 % of the time – end up punishing the team who hits back .
Democrats would be smart to understand her as such , and I see a lot of reaction that does n't seem to grasp what [ McCain 's VP pick ] is doing and the value she 's providing .
I see a lot of Democrats taking a lot of bait .
Yes .
Yes , yes yes .
Alot of Democrats are taking cheap bait .
They 've taken an elbow to the face when the ref was n't looking , and have come back swinging .
Now the ref is looking .
Except :
This applies more to Democratic surrogates than it does to the top - ticket duo .
Joe Biden had the smart response yesterday – naming the behavior – expecting it , and then riding through without taking the bait : " It was about how well placed -- and boy she is good -- how a left jab can be stuck pretty nice .
It ’s about how Barack Obama is such a bad guy . "
And that ’s all he says of [ McCain 's VP 's ] antics .
Name the behavior , even praising the skill with which the agitation was attempted , and then back to focus .
It 's " the economy , stupid . "
As Quinn points out , though , a good enforcer plays tandem to a high - profile player .
I think of Marty McSorely and Wayne Gretzky , who are the classic examples .
McSorely made sure that nobody interfered with Gretzky getting to the goal .
Without one , it would be hard to have the other .
Understanding McSorely - Gretzky helps us know how to coach and play in this game .
Start by understanding that McCain 's VP choice is a goon and a thug [ but without the chops for being an enforcer ] .
McCain threw an elbow to take our eye off the puck , hoping he could advance that puck a bit down - rink .
So far , it 's worked .
Is McCain 's VP choice bad ?
Sure .
But we do n't need her to go to the penalty box in order to win the game .
McCain threw the elbow , now the American public is going to referee the follow - up .
Now that their attention is drawn to that corner of the rink , they 'll be watching to see what happens next .
Frankly , most Americans do n't give a rat 's ass about Troopergate , or any of the other scandals surrounding McCain 's VP pick .
Should they ?
Probably .
But the fact is they do n't .
Now , do we spend our energy trying to make them care ?
When most of them are trying to pay mortgages , pay for college , or just simply eat a decent meal ?
Or do we put our focus on the puck ?
Let 's make sure that what happens next keeps our focus where it should be .
I played water polo at a fairly high level for many years .
This analogy works there , too .
All kinds of cheap shots take place under the water .
After the first one happens , the ref turns hir head .
Let 's keep our eyes on the puck , and the goal .
We got thrown an elbow .
Americans will red that play based on how we react .
[ Update : Rec list !
Thanks . ]
Update II : Folks , the point here is n't " Do n't Hit back . "
It 's " Hit the right target . "
The Veep and her shenanigans are n't the right target .
McCain and his kooky policies are .
Update III : Again , focus on the target .
Do n't hit McCain's VP .
Hit McCain for what his VP does .
John McCain 's plan to build 45 new nuclear reactors could cost taxpayers hundreds of billions in defaulted loan guarantees .
The Republican presidential nominee wants the plants built in time to help the U.S. meet a 29 percent increase in electricity demand by 2030 .
Industry estimates put their cost at $ 7 billion each ...
Investment bankers , citing the industry 's cost overruns in the 1980s , say they wo n't finance its long - sought ``nuclear renaissance '' without federal backing .
``Loan guarantees get reactors built , simply put , '' said Kevin Book , senior vice president and energy specialist at the Friedman , Billings , Ramsey & Co. investment banking firm in Arlington , Virginia .
...
Taxpayers are on the hook only if borrowers default .
A 2003 Congressional Budget Office report said the default rate on nuclear construction debts might be as high as 50 percent , in part because of the projects ' high costs .
`` The nuclear industry has been aggressively going after taxpayer - backed loan guarantees because nuclear technology cannot stand on its own two feet in the marketplace , '' said Allison Fisher , an energy policy analyst for the nonprofit consumer group Public Citizen in Washington .
Indeed , rising construction costs hit nuclear plants doubly hard because of safety considerations - which means a new nuke plant costs two to four times as much per kilowatt generated as any other kind of power .
And with a total build cost at current prices of around $ 315 billion , defaults rates of 50 % and more would involve taxpayers in yet more corporate giveaways and deficit spending .
The potential costs in this plan alone outrun all the savings McCain says he can make by cutting earmark spending .
The only way to make it viable is for consumers to pay up to four times more for their power .
Is n't it about time John McCain came clean about the pitfalls of his nuclear energy plan and explained why , if simply getting away from using oil is his priority , he wo n't turn up for Senate votes on tax credits for renewable energy generation ?

I am happy to report that Fabled Enemies , went from number 2 on September 1st to number 1 on September 2nd .
Of course it was mysteriously gone from the top 100 all together by the 3rd , and comments and views seemed to freeze .
Oh well I guess its Loose Change Final Cut ’s turn to be number 1 today .
I wonder when they will freeze this one again .

America 's most senior soldier in Afghanistan has called for the Pentagon to investigate claims that more than 90 civilians were killed in an American airstrike , after harrowing video footage emerged showing the broken bodies of at least 11 children among the dead .
The grim , eight - minute clip , filmed on a mobile phone in the aftermath of the bombing , shows rows of shrouded bodies laid side by side in a make - shift morgue .
Among them are at least 11 children , many of them toddlers .
General David McKiernan , the commander of Nato 's International Assistance Force ( Isaf ) , ordered a fresh investigation led by a Pentagon general after footage was released on Sunday night .
In a statement he said : " In light of emerging evidence pertaining to civilian casualties ... I feel it is prudent to request that US Central Command send a general officer to review the US investigation and its findings . "

The top - level review comes just days after he admitted there were " large discrepancies " among accounts of the death toll .
American officials claim there were just seven civilians killed .
The United Nations , the Afghan government and human rights groups said that the body count was closer to 90 .
Locals said most of the dead were women and children .
The damning footage was shot by a doctor who visited the morgue , in a building normally used as a mosque , on the morning after the attack on 22 August .
At one point a blanket is pulled back to show the grey , lifeless face of an infant .
The dead child 's head is no bigger than a man 's hand .
A large section of skull is missing .
Women can be heard wailing in the background .
One mourner is heard crying for his mother .
The bombs were called in by American Special Forces after their patrol was ambushed in Azizabad , in Herat province , shortly before dawn on that day .
Officials said the American soldiers were trying to arrest a suspected Taliban commander .
Days after the attack , American officials remained adamant that just 30 Taliban insurgents had been killed , including their commander , despite detailed claims by Afghan officials that at least 76 people were killed , including 50 children .
Four days after the airstrike , on 26 August , the UN 's senior official in Kabul , Kai Eide , claimed he had " convincing evidence ... that some 90 civilians were killed , including 60 children , 15 women and 15 men " .
Hamid Karzai , Afghanistan 's President , said relations with the United States had " worsened " in the wake of the raid , which prompted a grovelling phone call from President George Bush .

There has been growing criticism of international troops for failing to curb civilian killings .
A report by Human Rights Watch , published yesterday , said civilian deaths as a result of airstrikes by the US and Nato tripled from 2006 to 2007 , which have sparked a public backlash .
Brad Adams , the group 's Asia director , said : " Mistakes by the US and Nato have dramatically decreased public support for the Afghan government and the presence of international forces . "
American officials eventually revised their initial body count , on 2 September , but they were still nowhere close to the numbers reported elsewhere .
A spokesman said : " The investigation found that 30 to 35 Taliban militants were killed .
In addition five to seven civilians were killed , two civilians were injured and subsequently treated . "
Mr Eide , the UN's Special Representative , summoned General McKiernon to his office in Kabul on Friday last week to see the evidence for himself .
General McKiernon was furious that the UN had released such an uncompromising statement condemning the raid .
But a source close to the Isaf commander revealed he was almost moved to tears when he finally saw the images for himself .
" He was shocked and humbled .
He left like a little boy , " the military aide said .
If the 90 dead are confirmed , it would be the worst incident of collateral damage in Afghanistan since US and UK forces invaded in 2001 .
Missiles fired by US drones killed 16 people , in an attack launched across the border into Pakistan yesteday .
The strike targetted a religious school founded by an old friend of Osama bin Laden , intelligence officials and Pakistani villagers said .
The US has increasingly used drones to make cross broder strikes on suspected Taliban targets in recent weeks .
The missile killed 16 people , most of them Pakistani and Afghan Taliban fighters , though four women and two children were also killed , according to a senior intelligence officer .

Marianne Oelund recently posted a sequence of images of a Nikon D3 shutter in action , over on the Digital Photography Review Nikon D3 forum .
With her permission , I have turned that sequence into a mini web movie application , such that you can animate the frames by sliding your mouse back and forth across the image .
I thought she had created the images with a high - speed camera , but it turns out that , lacking a high - speed camera , she went to great ( and ingenious ) lengths to create this sequence .
In her own words :
“ The setup used to create the images was rather simple ; anyone with basic macro equipment could do the same .
It just requires quite a bit of patience !
I took a total of about 200 frames , and selected 70 for the slides .
The imaging camera was another D3 ( but any camera could be used ) , with a Micro 60 mm lens , a white reflective collar around the lens , and a downward - firing SB - 900 mounted above .
Cable releases were used on both cameras , to avoid disturbing their positions .
What was n't quite as straightforward , was collecting the timing data .
This is the area where a little engineering knowledge and equipment comes in .
The “ subject ” D3 camera had an SB - 800 mounted , set to manual 1/128th power , and turned toward the rear .
A phototransistor detected this flash pulse , which was captured on an oscilloscope .
Another phototransistor was used to sense the imaging camera 's flash pulse , then the ' scope could give the precise time delay between the two .
From the timing data , one can calculate the mechanical velocities , and even accelerations .
It 's worth doing this , as the numbers are impressive , to say the least !
I love this kind of ingenuity !
A high - speed camera would have been so much easier , but hey , if you do n't have one , but do have an oscilloscope and a couple of phototransistors ( and the knowledge and patience to use them ) , Marianne shows you can get great results .
I took Marianne 's 70 images , converted them to grayscale , cropped and shrunk them , added the various annotations you see on them , and wrapped them all up in a mini web application similar to the Kyoto cherry - blossom timelapse that I posted in the spring .
In looking at the actual shutter ( between the mirror and the sensor ) , it seems that it takes about 3 milliseconds to drop the 26 or so millimeters it needs to expose the sensor .
That works out to an average speed of about 8.7 meters / second , or just over 19 mph .
That 's a lot of speed to accelerate to and from so quickly .
Wow .
Marianne has more timing analysis in her dpreview thread .
If you 'd like to know more about how a shutter works ( and , in particular , why the shutter design and operation has such an impact on how flash photography can be done ) , see Derek Miller 's excellent writeup on the topic , linked from my “ Flash Sync Speed and Other Mysteries “ post .

While Apple seems to finally have a handle on their MobileMe difficulties , it appears iPhone 3G issues persist despite the most recent firmware updates .
The two most notable issues include 3G reception problems and iPhone application crashing .
The issue with 3G connectivity has been previously covered and results in some customers experiencing frequently dropped calls .
It has been said that this issue is affecting 2 % of iPhone 3G owners and will be fixable with a software update .
Monday 's release of the 2.0.2 iPhone firmware brought some hope to affected users .
An Apple spokesperson officially stated that the 2.0.2 firmware " improves communication with 3G networks " .
Despite these fixes , the problem appears to remain for some users .
In fact , one woman is now suing Apple and seeking class action status due to dropped calls and " slower than advertised " speeds :
In a 10 - page complaint , Jessica Smith alleges that Apple 's latest handset is much slower than advertised and is prone to dropping calls .
Smith is seeking class - action status as these issues could potentially affect thousands of consumers , she said .
The other issue affecting some iPhone users is one where all 3rd party applications fail to launch and audio and video media disappear from the iPhone .
While some can recover from this problem with a firmware restore , others are finding they have to take more drastic measures .
Arstechnica details a method in which some users are downgrading to an earlier version of iTunes in order to fix this problem .
Purported emails from Steve Jobs have said that Apple is also aware of this problem and will be providing a software update in September to address it .
Whoops !

Conservation group World Wildlife Fund has blamed human carbon emissions for the fact that the coldest August has been recorded in Australia for more than 60 years .
The Sydney Morning Herald reports :
The freezing temperatures are proof of the urgent need to cut carbon pollution , according to WWF development and sustainability program manager Paul Toni .
“ We can expect more extremes in climate , ” Mr Toni said .
Mr Toni said if action was not taken , more volatile weather would be on the radar .
So now carbon emissions are not only responsible for the rapid heating of the Earth , but at the same time are the prime cause of global cooling , according to the WWF .
Which is it to be ?

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Glasgow scientists , working at CERN , have observed the first particles in the Large Hadron Collider during preliminary tests ahead of the switch - on next month .
The LHC , based at the European particle facility CERN near Geneva , is due to fully switch on its proton beams on 10 September but the LHC 's particle detectors have been recording hits from cosmic rays for several months and at 5 pm on Friday 22 August 2008 LHCb * , one of the four LHC experiments , reconstructed in its Vertex Locator ( VELO ) the first particles from the LHC .
It is the first time particle tracks have been reconstructed from a man -made event generated by the collider .
The observation was made during a synchronisation test of the accelerator when the particles passed through a short section of the new 27 km long LHC accelerator .
The LHC synchronisation test collided a beam of protons with a 28 tonne absorber 200 m away from LHCb , producing a shower of particles .
Some of these particles reached the LHCb experiment , where the tracks were observed by a small team of scientists .
The observation was made with one quarter of the LHCb VELO detector operational on Friday 22 August .
Given the success of this run , an additional sequence of beam collisions on the absorber were provided by the accelerator on Sunday morning and the full VELO detector was read out .
Professor Themis Bowcock ( University of Liverpool ) , VELO Project Leader , said : “ This achievement by the LHCb VELO – reconstructing the first tracks at the LHC - is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the team of scientists , who have worked on this detector for more than a decade . ”
The VELO is a precise particle - tracking detector that surrounds the proton - proton collision point inside the LHCb experiment .
At its heart are 84 half - moon shaped silicon sensors , each one connected to its electronics via a delicate system of more than 5000 bond wires .
These sensors will be located very close to the colliding LHC beams , where they will play a crucial role in detecting b quarks , to help in understanding tiny but crucial differences in the behaviour of matter and antimatter .
Dr Chris Parkes ( University of Glasgow ) , UK VELO Project Leader and VELO software co-ordinator , said : “ The particles were seen by the team of scientists within seconds , and from the very first collision !
This bodes well for the future operation of the experiment to explore the differences in behaviour of matter and anti-matter . ”
Dr Eddy Jans ( Nikhef ) , VELO commissioning coordinator , said : “ We had been preparing all week for this first chance to see tracks .
In order to see these particles we had to setup the electronics to take the data at just the right time – and we got it correct to within 25 billionths of a second . ”
The 27 km long LHC accelerator and its four large experiments at CERN , with over 5,000 collaborating scientists , are currently in their commissioning stages .
This observation of first particles from the beam , comes several weeks ahead of when the first collisions between the two beams are expected .
The first beams to circulate around the complete ring are expected for 10 September , when over 200 journalists are expected to attend at CERN .
Dr Eduardo Rodrigues , a research assistant in the Glasgow LHCb group , and the LHCb VELO data quality co-ordinator said : “ I had worked on the real - time monitoring plots which allowed us to see the particles traversing the detector .
I was overwhelmed when we saw the evidence of the particle tracks clearly appearing on the computer monitors in the control room ” .
Marco Gersabeck , a PhD student at the University of Glasgow , said : “ It 's working !
And it is providing me with the type of particle tracks that I will use to align its sensors to an accuracy of a few millionths of a metre . ”
UK scientists from the Universities of Glasgow and Liverpool have a major involvement with the Vertex Locator .
The individual modules were designed and assembled in the UK .
The reconstruction software used to observe these tracks was written by UK scientists .
Nikhef provided the mechanics , cooling and vacuum system .
Other collaborators are EPFL Lausanne , CERN , Syracuse University , Moscow State University , University College Dublin .
* LHCb - Large Hadron Collider beauty
The LHCb experiment will help us to understand why we live in a Universe that appears to be composed almost entirely of matter , but no antimatter .
It specialises in investigating the slight differences between matter and antimatter by studying a type of particle called the ' beauty quark ' , or 'b quark ' .
Instead of surrounding the entire collision point with an enclosed detector , the LHCb experiment uses a series of sub - detectors to detect mainly forward particles .
The first sub - detector is mounted close to the collision point , while the next ones stand one behind the other , over a length of 20 m .
An abundance of different types of quark will be created by the LHC before they decay quickly into other forms .
To catch the b-quarks , LHCb has developed sophisticated movable tracking detectors close to the path of the beams circling in the LHC .
Like all the detector experiments at CERN a worldwide team of scientists are involved in the design and construction of LHCb .
The experiment involves over 600 scientists from nearly 50 institutes and universities in 15 countries .
UK collaborators make up around 20 % of this .
The LHCb group at the University of Glasgow consists of : Dr Alison Bates , Dr Silvia Borghi , Mr Laurence Carson , Mr Fred Doherty , Dr Lars Eklund , Mr Marco Gersabeck , Dr Vava Gligorov , Ms Lena Haddad , Mr Franciole Marinho , Ms Fiona McEwan , Mr John J. Melone , Ms Michelle Nicol , Dr Chris Parkes , Dr Andrew Pickford , Mr. Barinjaka Rakotomiaramanana , Dr Eduardo Rodrigues , Dr Paul Soler , Dr Tomasz Szumlak .
The observation is reported on the Nature website : www.nature.com/news/2008/08082 … /news.2008.1061.html

A large - scale , multi-dimensional analysis of the genomic characteristics of glioblastoma , the most common primary brain tumor in adults , provides new insights into the roles of several genes and defines core biological pathways altered in tumor development [ 1 ] .
The new Cancer Genome Atlas study , published in the September 4th advanced online edition of the journal Nature , also reveals a link between the DNA repair enzyme MGMT and a hypermutation phenotype , and has potential implications for the diagnosis and treatment of glioblastoma .
Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive type of brain cancer .
Patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma have a median survival of approximately one year with generally poor response to therapy [ 2 ] .
Gene expression profiling studies suggest multiple subtypes of glioblastoma that , when fully defined , may allow for more personalized therapeutic approaches [ 3 - 4 ] .
The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) is an integrated network of clinical sites , core resources and specialized genome characterization and genome sequencing centers that work together to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer .
The TCGA was launched in December 2005 as a pilot program to determine the feasibility of a large - scale effort to systematically explore genomic changes in all types of human cancer [ 5 ] .
TCGA utilizes genome analysis technologies to catalog and discover major cancer causing genome alterations in large groups of human tumors through integrated multi-dimensional analyses .
Glioblastoma is the first type of cancer to be studied in the TCGA pilot .
Investigators from seven cancer centers and research institutions across the U.S. integrated multiple types of data , including genetic mutations , gene expression , large - scale changes in chromosome number ( amplification or deletion ) , epigenomics and clinical treatment .
The scientists evaluated 206 biospecimens for DNA copy number , gene expression and DNA methylation ( a chemical modification of DNA that reduces gene expression ) .
Of these , 143 samples had matched normal peripheral blood DNA ; 91 were selected for detection of somatic ( meaning cells that differentiate into various tissues and organs , as opposed to germline cells ( e.g. sperm and ova ) ) mutation in 601 selected genes .
Eight genes were identified as significantly mutated , three of which were not previously reported for glioblastoma :
Researchers then mapped the sequencing data with additional genome characterization information onto major biological pathways and identified a highly interconnected network of alterations .
By copy number data alone , three critical biological signaling pathways were identified : the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase / Ras/ Phosphatidylinositol 3 - Kinase pathway ( a.k.a. RTK / Ras /PI3 K pathway ) , which controls cell proliferation , cell survival and RNA translation ; the p53 signaling pathway , which controls senescence ( aging ) and apoptosis ( cell death ) ; and the Retinoblastoma ( RB ) signaling pathway , which controls cell cycle progression and cell division .
In a given tumor sample , it was likely that there was at least one aberrant gene from each of the three pathways .
In fact , 74 % of the samples had mutations in all three pathways , suggesting that deregulation of the three pathways is a requirement for glioblastoma pathogenesis .
Oncologists already know glioblastomas that have a methylated MGMT gene ( DNA methylation reduces gene expression ) respond better to temozolomide , an alkylating chemotherapy drug that is the current standard of care for glioblastoma patients .
By integrating methylation data , somatic mutation data and clinical treatment data , scientists identified a relationship between MGMT methylation and a hypermutator phenotype described previously [ 6 ] .
In patients with MGMT methylation , temozolomide treatment introduces a strong selective pressure to mutate genes that are essential for DNA repair .
Thus , patients who initially respond to temozolomide may evolve not only treatment resistance but also a hypermutator phenotype ( since DNA repair genes have been mutated ) .
Future selective therapies may therefore require targeting both DNA - repair - deficient cells and an alkylating agent .
National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Director Elias A. Zerhouni , M.D. said [ 7 ] :
These impressive results from TCGA provide the most comprehensive view to date of the complicated genomic landscape of this deadly cancer .
The more we learn about the molecular basis of glioblastoma , the more swiftly we can develop better ways of helping patients with this terrible disease .
Clearly , it is time to move ahead and apply the power of large - scale , genomic research to many other types of cancer .
The power of this study lies in the statistically robust number of samples evaluated , allowing for the identification of molecular subtypes that may otherwise be undetectable .
Additionally , multiple technologies were employed to identify genomic copy number alterations , which were used to validate the results from any one platform .
These approaches highlight the power of comprehensive integrative analyses .
This is an excellent example of how current genome characterization technologies can systematically explore the universe of genomic changes involved in cancer .
The TCGA is also studying lung and ovarian cancer .

November 2007 ***** The Hollywood Writer 's Strike Coverage *****
Recently I have begun reporting on the Hollywood writer 's strike picket lines .
It is the first strike I have ever reported on and I am sure for many americans around my age they have never been involved in a strike either .
It is an interesting experience I can tell you !
I am going to present a real inside look at it and you will be able to walk the picket lines with me .
The strike effort involves the WGA writers and is supported by SAG and many actors icluding the casts of many Hollywood TV shows including The Unit , Desperate Housewives , Big Love , Las Vegas and many more .
Television production is rapidly shutting on almost all the Tv shows although there are some movies still shooting .
I have photographed actors such as Bill Paxton , Gary Cole , Ray Ramono , Doug Savant , Minnie driver , Sara Silverman , Kathy Griffin , Eva Longoria , Robert Patrick and many more on the picket lines .
Most of these actors are people I know and I have worked with because I have been on about 100 productions in the last 2 or 3 years usually as a non speaking actor ( although I have gotten a few speaking parts lately ) .
I have interviewed some of these writers and actors and will be posting those videos here .
The first of several news stories and videos will be linked here .
The first video is a news photo essay called " The Writers Cause " can be watched for free on the internet on metacafe.com .
Please rate it highly with Metacafe and vote it up so it will gain more visibility for the writer 's cause !

Best Speech at the RNC : Cindy McCain
September 5 , 2008 by twitterpaters
by twit
via CBS News on September 4 , 2008 , this is a clip of Cindy McCain ’s speech :
I have been witness to great service and sacrifice – to lives lived with humility and grace .
In World War II , my father ’s B - 17 was shot down three times .
He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross .
But he was quiet about that … and never claimed to have done more than his small share .
This is the most beautiful thing said at the Republican National Convention .
Especially when this statement was followed by the line “ Just like my husband . ”
We all know that John McCain has built his presidential campaign on his military service .
We know that John McCain does n’t see his time as a prisoner of war as simply doing his “ small share . ”
Even in his speech at the Republican National Convention , John McCain described his time as a prisoner of war as a transformative experience :
I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else ’s .
I loved it not just for the many comforts of life here .
I loved it for its decency ; for its faith in the wisdom , justice and goodness of its people .
I loved it because it was not just a place , but an idea , a cause worth fighting for .
I was never the same again .
I was n’t my own man anymore .
I was my country’s .
Throughout the Republican National Convention , we were told repeatedly , often in graphic detail , about McCain ’s military service , particularly his time as a prisoner of war .
It is an inescapable part of his campaign , as Lt. General Robert G. Gard , Jr. ( Ret. ) points out on August 21 , 2008 :
We obviously honor and respect McCain ’s service and the five - and - a- half years of horror that he went through at the hands of the North Vietnamese ; but it ’s not an excuse for everything .
He has already used it to explain away his infidelities in his first marriage .
He ’s used it to defend his healthcare plan .
He just the other day used it to deflect accusations of having skirted the rules of the Saddleback forum .
It ’s time for the Senator to stop cheapening the war experiences of thousands of vets and his fellow POWs , and his own as well , by stretching the boundaries of logic to make his POW status a wild - card rebuttal to all accusations or an answer to all difficult questions .
It is clear that John McCain considers his experience as a prisoner of war to be far more than “ doing his small share . ”
Now that Cindy McCain has pointed out her father ’s humility and respect for his military service , it provides a stinging contrast with how John McCain presents his military service .
It is hard to critique a former prisoner of war and condemn John McCain for a lack of humility about his service .
I certainly do not mean to belittle John McCain ’s military service and the unimaginable hardships that he endured .
Cindy McCain called attention to how unbecoming it is use “ POW ” as a basis for a presidential campaign , and how dishonorable a tactic it is .
As TPM notes :
You would never know it from the media coverage but John McCain is not one of America ’s greatest war heroes .
He is a former POW who survived , heroically .
He deserves to be honored for that heroism .
But one thing distinguishes McCain from other war heroes , the kind whose heroism changes history rather than their life stories .
America ’s two greatest war heroes were Ulysses Grant and Dwight Eisenhower .
Grant saved the union .
And Ike saved civilization .
And neither one ever bragged about their experience .
The dishonorable tactics of the McCain campaign are not limited to its exploitation of the sacrifices made by our military .
As noted by TPM , This is a campaign that also chose to use footage of the September 11 attacks in a video at the convention :
ST .
PAUL —
One of the most enduring taboos in American politics , the airing of graphic images from the September 11 attacks in a partisan context , died today .
It was nearly seven years old .
The informal prohibition , which had been occasionally threatened by political ads in recent years , was pronounced dead at approximately 7:40 CST , when a video aired before delegates at the Republican National Convention included slow - motion footage of a plane striking the World Trade Center , the towers ’ subsequent collapse , and smoke emerging from the Pentagon .
The September 11 precedent was one of the few surviving campaign - season taboos .
Cindy is right .
John McCain ’s campaign has no honor .

Albert Einstein - The Einstein Memorial
By Richard E. Miller , June 08 1 . Albert Einstein - The Einstein Memorial Marker Panel 1 .

Albert Einstein - The Einstein Memorial . .
[ Panel 1 : ] Albert Einstein , March 14 , 1879 - April 18 , 1955 . . .
" As long as I have any choice in the matter , I shall live only in a country where civil liberty , tolerance , and equality of all citizens before the law prevail , " Albert Einstein . . .
Albert Einstein , probably best known for his theory of relativity , revolutionized scientific thought with new concepts of space , time , mass , motion , and gravitation .
His statement that energy and matter are interchangeable was the key to the development of atomic energy .
. .
Born in Ulm , Germany , in 1879 , Einstein grew up in Munich .
Unable to find a teaching job after graduating from a technical institute in Zurich , Switzerland , he accepted a post as examiner in the Swiss patent office .
He worked there from 1902 in 1909 , devoting only his spare time to his own scientific interests .
. .
The year 1905 was a turning point in Einstein 's life .
He received a doctorate in physics from the University of Zurich and published three scientific papers , each of which became the basis for a new branch of physics .
. .
The first paper described light as a stream of energy particles called " quanta . "
It explained the already observed photo - electric effect -- that beams of light cause metals to release electrons that can be converted into electric current .
It was for this work that , in 1921 , Albert Einstein received the Nobel Prize in physics .
. .
The second paper , on the electrodynamics of moving bodies , contained Einstein 's special theory of relativity .
The famous equation E=mc2 related mass directly to energy .
( A manuscript copy of the paper is housed in the Library of Congress in Washington , D.C. )
The third paper explained Brownian motion -- the irregular movement of particles suspended in a liquid or a gas -- and showed that such motion is the consequence of fundamental nature of matter .
. .
These papers earned for Einstein a series of professorships in Switzerland and Prague .
Then , in 1914 , he moved to Berlin as a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and director of the Kaiser Wihelm Physical Institute .
He was free to teach at the University of Berlin .
Despite anti-Semitism which grew steadily after World War I , Einstein held these positions until Hitler came into power .
. .
In 1933 , Einstein came to the United States and joined the newly formed Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton , New Jersey .
He became a citizen of the United States in 1940 , was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1942 , and remained affiliated with the Institute at Princeton until his death in 1955 .
. .
In his later years , Einstein worked actively on behalf of world government and world peace .
But he kept his allegiance to science .
In a discussion of his political activities , he once said , " ... politics is for the present , but an equation ... is ... for eternity . "

The Einstein Memorial . . .
" The right to search for truth implies also a duty ; one must not conceal any part of what one has recognized to be true , " Albert Einstein . . .
No more appropriate memorial could stand on the grounds of the National Academy of Sciences than one honoring Albert Einstein .
It commemorates the centennial of the birth of a scientist whose work led to a new understanding of this world and the universe and a man who believed that the worldwide fame which came from his work was " a solemn trust to be used for the common good . " . .
The memorial depicts Einstein resting on a semicircular three - step bench of white granite from Mount Airy , North Carolina .
At his feet , much of the visible universe -- Einstein 's laboratory -- is portrayed in a circular sky map .
This 28 - foot field of emerald pearl granite from Larvik , Norway , is embedded with more than 2,700 small metal studs .
. .
These represent the planets , sun , moon , stars ( to the sixth magnitude ) , and other celestial objects positioned as they were at noon on April 22 , 1979 , when the memorial was unveiled and dedicated at an Academy Convocation .
At that dedication , Professor John Archibald Wheeler eulogized the status as " a monument to the man who united space and time into spacetime ... a remembrance of the man who taught us ... that the universe does not go on from everlasting to everlasting , but begins with a bang . " . .
The figure of Einstein holds in its left hand a paper on which are shown the mathematical equations that summarize three of his most important scientific contributions : the photoelectric effect , the theory of general relativity , and the equivalence of energy and matter .
Behind the status , at the back of the bench , are three quotations that reflect not only Einstein 's integrity as a scientist but also his never - ending sense of wonder at the world and his passionate concern for social justice and ethical responsibility .
. .
The memorial is situated in a grove of elm and holly trees on the southwest corner of the Academy grounds .
It was financed by more than 5,000 contributions .
. .
The sculptor was Robert Berks , who has created more than 300 portraits of individuals in public and private life .
His works include statues of Enrico Fermi , Pablo Casals , Martin Luther King , Ernest Hemingway , Mary McLeod Bethune , and four presidents of the United States -- Abraham Lincoln , Harry S. Truman , John F. Kennedy , and Lyndon B. Johnson .
. .
From the top of its head to the tip of its feet , the Einstein figure measures 21 feet ; it weighs 7,000 pounds .
The statue was cast in bronze in 19 sections and then welded into its final form .
Ten months and the assistance of a crew of 25 were needed for its completion .
The monument is supported by a subbase consisting of 3 concrete caissons sunk to bedrock at a depth of 23 to 25 feet .
. . [ Photo caption ] : Albert Einstein at the age of 60 . . .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Miners in the southern African kingdom of Lesotho have found one of the world ’s largest diamonds , a near - flawless white gem weighing nearly 500 carats , mining group Gem Diamonds said on Sunday .
The diamond was discovered in the Letseng Mine on September 8 , the company said in a statement .
It has been analyzed by experts in Antwerp and found to weigh 478 carats , with very few inclusions and of outstanding color and clarity .
“ It has the potential to yield one of the largest flawless D color round polished diamonds in history , ” the company said .
Letseng is one of the most productive mines in history -- four of the world ’s 20 largest rough diamonds have been found at the mine , including the three largest found this century .
Before it is cut into gems it is hard to value the diamond , but a spokesman for Gem Diamonds said a similar weight stone with lesser - quality color and clarity had recently sold for $ 12 million ( around 5.5 million pounds ) .
“ Preliminary examination of this remarkable diamond indicates that it will yield a record breaking polished stone of the very best color and clarity , ” Clifford Elphick , the chief executive of Gem Diamonds , said in a statement .
The minister for natural resources in Lesotho , an impoverished mountain kingdom in eastern South Africa , praised the productivity of the mine , one of the highest in the world at more than 3,000 meters ( 10,000 feet ) .
“ Once again Letseng has proved its ability to produce extraordinary diamonds and continues to place Lesotho at the forefront of diamond producing countries , ” Monyane Moleleki said in a statement .
Letseng is 70 percent owned by Gem Diamonds and 30 percent owned by the government of Lesotho .
The world ’s largest diamond is the Cullinan , discovered in South Africa in 1905 .
It weighed more than 3,100 carats before it was cut into more than one hundred separate gems , many of which are part of the British crown jewels .
Scary , huh ?
On a side note , hello Planet , this is my first post that will actually get syndacated .
I excuse for giving you updates on what I work on just now , though I ’m really dumb about RSS feeds , so credits to Riddell for 1 ) adding me to the planet 2 ) showing me how to filter RSS by categories
Anyway , some of you might know what PowerDevil is , some might not ; well , for you who fear this is yet another attempt of threatening your lives , PowerDevil is a power manager for KDE4 , and it wo n’t kill you .
Credits to sandsmark for this beautiful name 😀
Being serious for a moment , PowerDevil takes a pretty different approach than all other KDE - based powermanagers until now .
PowerDevil is lightweight , and I mean for real , and it ’s fully integrated in your KDE Desktop .
This is because PowerDevil it ’s not the usual application you see in the tray , but just a KDED module , aka a daemon .
Right , everything happens in background and you do n’t have to care .
And , for your battery ’s sake , it does n’t poll your system .
I spent some time refining some existing algorythms , and I think I have reached the maximum level of efficency .
It is splitted in 2 main components : the daemon and a KCModule to configure it .
But let me show you something 🙂
This is the heart of PowerDevil .
Yes , it is profile based , and you can create them easily thanks to this interface .
Important : It really needs an usability review , consider this as a cry for help 🙂
But I was saying … Thanks to this , you can create your profiles , fit them to your needs , and assign them to the correct event , so that the right profile will kick in at the right time .
Now some bits on its architecture : PowerDevil is fully based on solid , and I mean 100 % .
It is also able to detect your system ’s capabilities , so that only supported configuration options will be shown to you .
Nice , is n’t it ?
You probably wonder how you ’ll get all those nice messages old powermanagers used to stream to you .
The answer is simple : KNotification !
PowerDevil streams every info you ’d like to hear through KNotification , like Kopete does 🙂
So you wo n’t miss a single bit of what ’s happening in your system .
Or you can simply disable them and enjoy a real background experience .
So far so good , though you probably wonder where to see system status , where to change profiles manually and so on .
The answer is easy , and it ’s Plasma .
PowerDevil , as I told you , is tightly integrated in your desktop , and this means with Plasma too .
The KRunner lets you do about everything you want : changing profile , governor , and so on .
Try some keywords like “ power profile ” , “ power governor ” , “ screen brightness ” , just to name some , and find out how fast and easy it is managing PowerDevil through KRunner .
Goodies are not over , and a Plasmoid is coming , letting you do everything the KRunner already does .
The engine in kdebase has already been extended , and sebas is working on the Battery applet to bring you another I - must - have - it plasmoid on your dashboard .
So , want to give it a shot ?
PowerDevil is , at the moment , in kdereview , but will be soon moved to kdebase and will be the default powermanager in KDE 4.2 .
It works cool on KDE4.1 too ( we kdemod guys are already using it ) , so you can already taste how it looks like .
Comments , help , feedback , insults and whatever are always welcome 🙂

There are people who spend their time arguing that being " pro-life " this year means voting for an obtuse ignoramus who thinks it ’s a laugh riot to sing , " Bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb Iran . "
A savage who jokes gleefully about the inevitable creation of widows and orphans — that ’s the person the official pro-life movement wants as its public face for four years .
Gee , a coherent , non-contradictory message like that is just the way to win people over .
I have not once gone wrong by taking what John McCain says about foreign affairs and assuming the exact opposite to be true .
( Here ’s a small sample of McCain ’s insights , and here ’s CBS News getting caught by MSNBC cutting and pasting bits of an interview in order to make him look better informed . )
No one can know for sure what McCain ’s combination of belligerence and ignorance means for the American people and the world , but we can take a good guess .
His only criticism of previous presidents ’ foreign adventures is that they did n’t expend more American forces and treasure .
McCain is " bellicose , " says Pat Buchanan , and putting Georgia on a fast track to NATO membership , as McCain favors , is " a fast track to war " — with a nuclear power .
True to the Orwellian script all major presidential candidates must read from , there is no propaganda line pursued by any previous administration that McCain has not dutifully adopted himself .
We ’ve just lived through eight embarrassing years of a sloganeering buffoon posturing as a conservative , blundering from one disaster to another , and mouthing the most excruciating propaganda the whole way — and if McCain ’s candidacy is any indication , that ’s just the way some Americans like it .
And this is the area — laughingly called " national security , " as if these wars had something to do with protecting you and me from the bad guys — in which McCain is supposed to be at his best , where he is most in his element .
Kind of like his crazy and ignorant foreign - policy adviser Max Boot , whose saving grace is supposed to be a vast knowledge of warfare and the military — but who ca n’t even get that right .
The more I ’ve thought and written about war these past eight or so years , the more the obvious has finally penetrated my thick skull : it is not " liberal " to describe war as a life issue .
War involves the taking of human life on a massive scale .
To make matters worse , the American political class , and John McCain in particular , support a string of wars that can be supported only on the basis of the crudest propaganda .
There was a time in my life when I thought accepting whatever the president and the TV told me about a foreign conflict was what made someone a good American .
( Only a " liberal " might be so impertinent as to ask a question . )
Many Americans think the same way .
In 1996 , then - Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she thought the price had been " worth it " when she was told the sanctions on Iraq had killed half a million children .
Had a Chinese premier said such a thing , we ’d never have heard the end of it .
An American official says it and the herd ’s first instinct is to deny she said it , then deny the statistic — and then , when the statistic turns out to be true , to explain why this atrocity really was n’t so bad .
And these are the people who lecture the world about moral relativism !
That ’s one of the reasons I decided to collaborate with a friend on the Left , Murray Polner , on a collection bringing together the most incisive antiwar writing in American history .
We Who Dared to Say No to War tears the lid off the lies , the phony emotional appeals , and the bipartisan , media - endorsed propaganda that have incited war fever among the American population since 1812 .
For every major war we have uncovered the most merciless and devastating denunciations and exposés .
Here ’s Russell Kirk , one of the intellectual architects of postwar conservatism in America , rebuking the future neoconservatives in 1954 : " A handful of individuals , some of them quite unused to moral responsibilities on such a scale , made it their business to extirpate the populations of Nagasaki and Hiroshima ; we must make it our business to curtail the possibility of such snap decisions , taken simply on the assumptions of worldly wisdom .
And the conservative can urge upon his nation a policy of patience and prudence .
A u2018 preventive ’ war , whether or not it might be successful in the field — and that is a question much in doubt — would be morally ruinous to us . "
Here ’s what Senator George Norris had to say , at the outset of U.S. involvement in World War I , about the economic prosperity we ’re told will accompany war :
To whom does war bring prosperity ?
Not to the soldier who for the munificent compensation of $ 16 per month shoulders his musket and goes into the trench , there to shed his blood and to die if necessary ; not to the brokenhearted widow who waits for the return of the mangled body of her husband ; not to the mother who weeps at the death of her brave boy ; not to the little children who shiver with cold ; not to the babe who suffers from hunger ; nor to the millions of mothers and daughters who carry broken hearts to their graves .
War brings no prosperity to the great mass of common and patriotic citizens .
It increases the cost of living of those who toil and those who already must strain every effort to keep soul and body together … .
By our act we will make millions of our countrymen suffer , and the consequences of it may well be that millions of our brethren must shed their lifeblood , millions of brokenhearted women must weep , millions of children must suffer with cold , and millions of babes must die from hunger , and all because we want to preserve the commercial right of American citizens to deliver munitions of war to belligerent nations .
And listen to Randolph Bourne , whose dictum " war is the health of the state " has become part of the American political lexicon :
The moment war is declared … the mass of the people , through some spiritual alchemy , become convinced that they have willed and executed the deed themselves .
They then , with the exception of a few malcontents , proceed to allow themselves to be regimented , coerced , deranged in all the environments of their lives , and turned into a solid manufactory of destruction toward whatever other people may have , in the appointed scheme of things , come within the range of the Government ’s disapprobation .
The citizen throws off his contempt and indifference to Government , identifies himself with its purposes , revives all his military memories and symbols , and the State once more walks , an august presence , through the imaginations of men… .
The herd coalescence of opinion which became inevitable the moment the State had set flowing the war attitudes became interpreted as a prewar popular decision , and disinclination to bow to the herd was treated as a monstrously antisocial act .
So that the State , which had vigorously resisted the idea of a referendum and clung tenaciously and , of course , with entire success to its autocratic and absolute control of foreign policy , had the pleasure of seeing the country , within a few months , given over to the retrospective impression that a genuine referendum had taken place .
When once a country has lapped up these State attitudes , its memory fades ; it conceives itself not as merely accepting , but of having itself willed , the whole policy and technique of war .
The significant classes , with their trailing satellites , identify themselves with the State , so that what the State , through the agency of the Government , has willed , this majority conceives itself to have willed .
All of which goes to show that the State represents all the autocratic , arbitrary , coercive , belligerent forces within a social group , it is a sort of complexus of everything most distasteful to the modern free creative spirit , the feeling for life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
War is the health of the State .
Only when the State is at war does the modern society function with that unity of sentiment , simple uncritical patriotic devotion , cooperation of services , which have always been the ideal of the State lover … .
It is n’t just that the contributors to our volume possess great insight into the subject of war .
They also cut through the propaganda behind every one of these wars , revealing the string of hidden truths that the regime distorted , papered over , or suppressed .
Nobody ever makes much money on an anthology , so appearances notwithstanding , this is n’t some crummy sales pitch .
These voices have been ignored long enough .
I ’d just like people to hear them .

STUDENTS are going to university in unprecedented numbers .
In 2006 , 56 % of school - leavers in industrialised countries went on to university , up from 37 % in 1995 , according to an OECD report published on Tuesday September 9th .
Nearly all of the 30 OECD countries have seen entry rates increase , and the extra cash needed has come from a variety of sources .
Some countries , such as Britain , charge tuition fees , whereas Nordic countries levy high taxes .
But America spends the most on each university student , thanks to a large pot of private financing .

No .
It is not .
The most important reason it is not is that Bernanke and Paulson are both focused like laser beams on not making the same mistakes as were made in 1929 .
They are also focused , but not quite as much , on not making the mistakes made by Arthur Burns in the 1970s .
And they are also focused , but not quite as much , on not making the mistakes the Bank of Japan made in the 1990s .
They want to make their own , original , mistakes ...
Firefox has been outperforming IE in every department for years , and version 3 is speedier than ever .
But tweak the right settings and you could make it faster still , more than doubling your speed in some situations , all for about five minutes work and for the cost of precisely nothing at all .
Here 's what you need to do .
1. Enable pipelining
Browsers are normally very polite , sending a request to a server then waiting for a response before continuing .
Pipelining is a more aggressive technique that lets them send multiple requests before any responses are received , often reducing page download times .
To enable it , type about : config in the address bar , double - click network.http.pipelining and network.http.proxy.pipelining so their values are set to true , then double - click network.http.pipelining.maxrequests and set this to 8 .
Keep in mind that some servers do n't support pipelining , though , and if you regularly visit a lot of these then the tweak can actually reduce performance .
Set network.http.pipelining and network.http.proxy.pipelining to false again if you have any problems .
2. Render quickly
Large , complex web pages can take a while to download .
Firefox does n't want to keep you waiting , so by default will display what it 's received so far every 0.12 seconds ( the " content notify interval " ) .
While this helps the browser feel snappy , frequent redraws increase the total page load time , so a longer content notify interval will improve performance .
Type about : config and press [ Enter ] , then right - click ( Apple users ctrl- click ) somewhere in the window and select New >
Integer .
Type content.notify .interval as your preference name , click OK , enter 500000 ( that 's five hundred thousand , not fifty thousand ) and click OK again .
Right - click again in the window and select New > Boolean .
This time create a value called content .
notify .
ontimer and set it to True to finish the job .
3. Faster loading
If you have n't moved your mouse or touched the keyboard for 0.75 seconds ( the content switch threshold ) then Firefox enters a low frequency interrupt mode , which means its interface becomes less responsive but your page loads more quickly .
Reducing the content switch threshold can improve performance , then , and it only takes a moment .
Type about : config and press [ Enter ] , right - click in the window and select New > Integer .
Type content.switch.threshold , click OK , enter 250000 ( a quarter of a second ) and click OK to finish .
4 . No interruptions
You can take the last step even further by telling Firefox to ignore user interface events altogether until the current page has been downloaded .
This is a little drastic as Firefox could remain unresponsive for quite some time , but try this and see how it works for you .
Type about : config , press [ Enter ] , right - click in the window and select New > Boolean .
Type content.interrupt.parsing , click OK , set the value to False and click OK .
5. Block Flash
Intrusive Flash animations are everywhere , popping up over the content you actually want to read and slowing down your browsing .
Fortunately there 's a very easy solution .
Install the Flashblock extension ( flashblock.mozdev.org ) and it'll block all Flash applets from loading , so web pages will display much more quickly .
And if you discover some Flash content that is n't entirely useless , just click its placeholder to download and view the applet as normal .
6 . Increase the cache size
As you browse the web so Firefox stores site images and scripts in a local memory cache , where they can be speedily retrieved if you revisit the same page .
If you have plenty of RAM ( 2 GB of more ) , leave Firefox running all the time and regularly return to pages then you can improve performance by increasing this cache size .
Type about : config and press [ Enter ] , then right - click anywhere in the window and select New >
Integer .
Type browser.cache.memory.capacity , click OK , enter 65536 and click OK , then restart your browser to get the new , larger cache .
7. Enable TraceMonkey
TraceMonkey is a new Firefox feature that converts slow Javascript into super - speedy x86 code , and so lets it run some functions anything up to 20 times faster than the current version .
It 's still buggy so is n't available in the regular Firefox download yet , but if you 're willing to risk the odd crash or two then there 's an easy way to try it out .
Install the latest nightly build ( ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/ ) , launch it , type about : config in the address bar and press Enter .
Type JIT in the filter box , then double - click javascript.options.jit.chrome and javascript.options.jit.content to change their values to true , and that 's it - you 're running the fastest Firefox Javascript engine ever .
8. Compress data
If you 've a slow internet connection then it may feel like you 'll never get Firefox to perform properly , but that 's not necessarily true .
Install toonel.net ( toonel.net ) and this clever Java applet will re-route your web traffic through its own server , compressing it at the same time , so there 's much less to download .
And it can even compress JPEGs by allowing you to reduce their quality .
This all helps to cut your data transfer , useful if you 're on a limited 1 GB - per - month account , and can at best double your browsing performance .

( CNN ) -- Summer is over in the northern hemisphere , but it 's been another chilling season for researchers who study Arctic sea ice .
Disappearance of Arctic ice cover may affect storm systems , storm tracks and crops , according to researchers .
" It 's definitely a bad report .
We did pick up little bit from last year , but this is over 30 percent below what used to be normal , " said Walt Meier , a research scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colorado .
This past summer , the Arctic sea ice dwindled to its second lowest level .
Arctic sea ice is usually 1 to 3 meters , or as much as 9 feet thick .
It grows during autumn and winter and shrinks in the spring and summer .
Scientists have monitored sea ice conditions for about 50 years with the help of satellites .
Changes in the past decade have been alarming to climate researchers and oceanographers .
" It is the second lowest on record .
...
If anything , it is reinforcing the long - term trend .
We are still losing the ice cover at a rate of 10 percent per decade now , and that is quite an increase from five years ago , " Meier said .
" We are still heading toward an ice cover that is going to melt completely in the summertime in the Arctic . "
Arctic ice helps regulate and temper the climate in many other parts of the world .
The less ice there is , the more dramatic the impact .
Huge sheets of ice reflect solar radiation , keeping our planet cool .
When that ice melts , huge expanses of darker , open ocean water absorb the heat instead , warming things up .
Although few humans live in the Arctic , the disappearance of this ice cover can have effects far beyond the few residents and the wildlife of this harsh region .
Ice cover loss can influence winds and precipitation on other continents , possibly leading to less rain in the western United States and creating more in Europe .
" That warming is going to spread to the lower latitudes , to the United States , and it 's going to affect storm systems and storm tracks , the jet stream ; that 's going to affect crops and all sorts of things , " Meier predicted .
So , just how much ice is disappearing ?
Less than 30 years ago , there would still be 7 million square kilometers or 2.5 million square miles of ice left at the end of an Arctic summer .
That 's now dropped by almost 40 percent .
See how much Arctic sea ice has disappeared »
" Seven million square kilometers roughly corresponds to an area of the lower 48 United States .
So back in the early 1980s , the lower 48 states would be covered in sea ice in the summer , " Meier said .
" Now we 've essentially lost sea ice east of the Mississippi River and even beyond .
So that 's a significant amount of area . "
The best known consequence of disappearing sea ice in the Arctic is the loss of the polar bear habitat .

" The Arctic sea ice melt is a disaster for the polar bears , " according to Kassie Siegel , staff attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity .
" They are dependent on the Arctic sea ice for all of their essential behaviors , and as the ice melts and global warming transforms the Arctic , polar bears are starving , drowning , even resorting to cannibalism because they do n't have access to their usual food sources . "

Scientists have noticed increasing reports of starving Arctic polar bears attacking and feeding on one another in recent years .
In one documented 2004 incident in northern Alaska , a male bear broke into a female 's den and killed her .
In May , the U.S. Department of Interior listed the polar bear as a " threatened " species under the Endangered Species Act .
In a news release , U.S. Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne stated , " loss of sea ice threatens and will likely continue to threaten polar bear habitat .
This loss of habitat puts polar bears at risk of becoming endangered in the foreseeable future , the standard established by the ESA for designating a threatened species . "
What is the future for Arctic sea ice ?
Some scientists believe that in just five years , the Arctic may be ice - free during the summer .
" The Arctic is kind of the early warning system of the climate , " Meier said .
" It is the canary in the coal mine , and the canary is definitely in trouble . "

In his eternal quest for the Republican presidential nomination , the supposed maverick John McCain has repeatedly reversed long - held positions and compromised purportedly core principles .
From the Bush tax cuts , the religious right and immigration reform to overturning Roe v. Wade , proclaiming Samuel Alito a model Supreme Court Justice and bashing France ( just to name a few ) , McCain changed sides as changing political conditions dictated .
But over the past two weeks , McCain 's rapid fire , acrobatic flip - flops have produced whiplash , at least for voters .
10 times since the beginning of June , McCain has retreated from , upended or just forgotten positions he once claimed as his own .
On Social Security , balancing the budget , defense spending , domestic surveillance and a host of other issues so far this month , McCain 's " Straight Talk Express " did a U - turn on the road to the White House .
1. Social Security Privatization .
John McCain has apparently learned the lesson that the more President Bush spoke about his Social Security privatization scheme , the less popular it became .
On Friday , Mr. Straight Talk proclaimed at a New Hampshire event , " I 'm not for , quote , privatizing Social Security .
I never have been .
I never will be . "
Sadly , McCain and his advisers like ousted HP CEO Carly Fiorina are on record declaring fidelity to the idea of diverting Social Security dollars into private accounts .
On November 18 , 2004 , for example , McCain announced , " Without privatization , I do n’t see how you can possibly , over time , make sure that young Americans are able to receive Social Security benefits . "
And in March 2003 , McCain backed his President , declaring , " As part of Social Security reform , I believe that private savings accounts are a part of it - along the lines that President Bush proposed . "
As they say , let 's go to the videotape .
2. Raising - and Slashing - Defense Spending .
As Steve Benen noted Friday , John McCain was also for boosting American defense spending before he was against it .
In the November 2007 issue of Foreign Affairs , McCain argued " we can also afford to spend more on national defense , which currently consumes less than four cents of every dollar that our economy generates - far less than what we spent during the Cold War . "
But facing the $ 2 trillion budgetary hole the McCain tax plan is forecast to produce ( a sea of red ink even the Wall Street Journal noticed ) , Team McCain changed its tune .
As Forbes scoffed in amazement :
" McCain ’s top economic adviser , Doug Holtz - Eakin , blithely supposes that cuts in defense spending could make up for reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 % to 25 % and the subsequent shrinkage in federal revenues .
Get that ?
The national security candidate wants to cut spending on our national security .
Wait until the generals and the admirals hear that . "
3. First Term Balanced Budget Pledge .
With its on - again / off - again / on - again promise to balance the budget by January 2013 , the McCain campaign executed that rarest of political maneuvers , the 360 .
During a February 15th rally in La Crosse , Wisconsin , " McCain promised he'd offer a balanced budget by the end of his first term . "
But just days later , McCain 's senior economic adviser Douglas Holtz - Eakin announced a deficit - ending target of 2017 .
In mid-April , Holtz - Eakin proclaimed , " I would like the next president not to talk about deficit reduction . "
McCain , too , signaled the retreat from his first - term balance budget commitment , explaining to Chris Matthews on April 15th that " economic conditions are reversed . "
Apparently economic conditions have improved dramatically since then .
On June 6 , Holtz - Eakin squared the circle , announcing , " That plan , when appropriately phased in , as it has always been intended to be , will bring the budget to balance by the end of his first term . "
4. The Media 's Treatment of Hillary Clinton .
No doubt , John McCain suffers from recurring bouts of selective amnesia .
And some episodes take only days to manifest themselves .
During his disastrous " green screen " speech on June 3 , McCain reached out to Hillary Clinton 's supporters by proclaiming , " The media often overlooked how compassionately she spoke to the concerns and dreams of millions of Americans , and she deserves a lot more appreciation than she sometimes received . "
But by June 7 , McCain denied to Newsweek that his media critique never passed his lips , " I did not -- that was in prepared remarks , and I did not -- I 'm not in the business of commenting on the press and their coverage or not coverage . "
5 . The Estate Tax .
Just days before his contortionist act on Social Security , John McCain reversed course on the estate tax as well .
On June 8 , 2006 , McCain on the Senate floor expressed his agreement with Teddy Roosevelt that " most great civilized countries have an income tax and an inheritance tax " and " in my judgment both should be part of our system of federal taxation . "
But after years of battling Republican colleagues dead - set on dismantling the so - called " death tax " and instead promoting a $ 5 million trigger , on Tuesday John McCain sounded the retreat .
Now , he insists , " the estate tax is one of the most unfair tax laws on the books . "
6. FISA , Domestic Surveillance and Telecom Immunity .
When it comes to the Bush administration 's program of domestic spying on Americans , McCain has performed similar logical gymnastics .
On December 20 , 2007 , McCain suggested to the Pulitzer prize - winning journalist Charles Savage that President Bush had clearly crossed the line .
As Wired 's Ryan Singel noted :
" I think that presidents have the obligation to obey and enforce laws that are passed by Congress and signed into law by the president , no matter what the situation is , " McCain said .
The Globe 's Charlie Savage pushed further , asking , " So is that a no , in other words , federal statute trumps inherent power in that case , warrantless surveillance ? "
To which McCain answered , " I do n't think the president has the right to disobey any law . "
But on June 2 , McCain adviser Holtz - Eakin put that notion to rest , telling the National Review :
" [ N ] either the Administration nor the telecoms need apologize for actions that most people , except for the ACLU and the trial lawyers , understand were Constitutional and appropriate in the wake of the attacks on September 11 , 2001 . "
Pressed to explain the glaring inconsistencies , John McCain on June 6 played dumb , deciding that cowardice is the better part of valor .
As the New York Times reported , McCain now believes the legality of Bush 's regime of NSA domestic surveillance is unclear and , in any event , is old news :
" It ’s ambiguous as to whether the president acted within his authority or not , " he said , saying courts had ruled different ways on the matter .
“ I ’m not interested in going back .
I ’m interested in addressing the challenge we face to day of trying to do everything we can to counter organizations and individuals that want to destroy this country .
So there ’s ambiguity about it .
Let ’s move forward . "
As for immunity for the telecommunications firms cooperating with the White House in what before August 2007 was doubtless illegal surveillance , there too McCain 's position has evolved .
On May 23 , campaign surrogate Chuck Fish announced that McCain would not back retroactive immunity " unless there were revealing Congressional hearings and heartfelt repentance from those telephone and internet companies . "
Subsequently , the McCain campaign swiftly backtracked , claiming its man supports immunity unconditionally .
7. Restoring the Everglades .
On June 5 , John McCain traveled to the Everglades to win over Floridians and environmentally - minded voters .
There he proclaimed , " I am in favor of doing whatever 's necessary to save the Everglades . "
Sadly , as ThinkProgress documented , McCain not only opposed $ 2 billion in funding for the restoration of the Everglades national park , he backed President Bush 's veto of the legislation in 2007 .
" I believe , " he said , " that we should be passing a bill that will authorize legitimate , needed projects without sacrificing fiscal responsibility . "
8. Divestment from South Africa .
During his June 2 speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , John McCain called for the international community to target Iran for the kind of worldwide sanctions regime applied to apartheid - era South Africa .
Unfortunately , McCain 's lobbyist - advisers Charlie Black and Rick Davis each represented firms doing business with Tehran .
Even more unfortunate , John McCain was frequently not among those offering " moral clarity and conviction " in backing " a divestment campaign against South Africa , helping to rid that nation of the evil of apartheid . "
As ThinkProgress detailed :
Despite voting to override President Reagan ’s veto of a bill imposing economic sanctions against South Africa in 1986 , McCain voted against sanctions on at least six other occasions .
9. Fighting Job Losses in Michigan .
During the run-up to the Michigan primary , John McCain cautioned workers there in January that he did n't want to raise " false hopes that somehow we can bring back lost jobs , " adding that it " was n't government 's job to protect buggy factories and haberdashers when cars replaced carriages and men stopped wearing hats . "
But after getting trounced in Michigan by Mitt Romney and watching the economy deteriorate further , McCain has had a change of heart .
As Bloomberg noted on June 5 :
Nowadays , the party 's presumptive nominee is singing a different tune , striking a populist pose and saying " new jobs are coming " ... ... Over the past few months , however , McCain has taken a lesson from Romney , acknowledging recently that " Americans are hurting . ''
Returning to Michigan last month , the Arizona senator told a local television station that he would fight for new jobs and the state would n't " be left behind . ''
Perhaps the good people of Michigan , as John McCain suggested to a Kentucky audience in April , can make a living on eBay .
10 . Opposing Hurricane Katrina Investigations .
During a June 4th town hall meeting in Baton Rouge , John McCain answered a reporter 's question regarding Hurricane Katrina and the failure of the New Orleans levees by announcing :
" I ’ve supported every investigation and ways of finding out what caused the tragedy .
I ’ve been here to New Orleans .
I ’ve met with people on the ground . "
As it turns out , not so much .
McCain 's revisionist history neglects to mention that in 2005 and 2006 he twice voted against a commission to study the government 's response to Katrina .
He also opposed three separate emergency funding measures providing relief to Katrina victims , including the extension of five months of Medicaid benefits .
And as ThinkProgress pointed out , " until traveling there one month ago , McCain had made just one public tour of New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina touched down in August 2005 . "
And so it goes .
As surely as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west each day , so too will John McCain change positions .
( Like that other law of nature , McCain 's flip - flops are literally becoming a daily occurrence .
Since this piece was originally drafted on Saturday , McCain added two new policy turnabouts - on phasing out rather than repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax and on requiring a litmus test for his judicial appointees - to his litany of reversals . )
As the Pew Research Center recently found , the word Americans now most frequently use to describe John McCain is not " maverick , " but " old . "
Given the dizzying pace of his reversals , " opportunist " may soon top that list .
Alter : Media giving McCain a ' free ride ' by ignoring Keating involvement Nick Juliano and David Edwards
Published : Tuesday September 23 , 2008
Print This Email This While John McCain and his aides can complain all they want about the treatment they 've received in the press over the last few days , the Republican presidential candidate should be thankful that one unfortunate episode from his past has n't reemerged on the nation 's front pages , says Newsweek 's Jonathan Alter .
McCain 's involvement in the Keating Five scandal , during the Savings & Loan collapse that wreaked havoc on the economy in the late 1980s , has gone virtually unmentioned as the Arizona Senator tries to argue he can get America out of its current fiscal funk .
" It 's crazy , but there has been very little about it in the press in the last few weeks , " Alter told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann Monday night .
" McCain thinks he 's getting a hard time , he 's really getting a free ride on the fact that he was in the middle of the last great financial scandal in our country . "
There have been passing references to McCain 's connection to Charles Keating , the financier and real estate mogul who operated from McCain 's home state , in dozens of newspaper articles from recent months , but little in depth examination of their relationship .
McCain participated in a 1987 meeting with four other senators who pressured federal regulators to forestal a takeover of Lincoln Savings and Loan , a subsidiary of Keating 's American Continental Corp .
Alter notes that even after barely savaging his political career following the Keating Five scandal , McCain continued to back the same kinds of deregulatory policies that led to the savings & loan collapse in the first place .
" He moved forward on campaign finance reform after being caught in that scandal but did nothing -- nothing -- to try to prevent another savings & loan crisis from happening down the road , " Alter said .
" He was missing in action when it came to even learning the basic lessons of a scandal that he said taught him all kinds of things that he would never forget . "
Earlier in the broadcast , Alter noted that McCain supported a 1999 law sponsored by his campaign adviser Phil Gramm that deregulated Wall Street .
" All that it did was turn the big casino into an even bigger casino in a very , very unhealthy way , " Alter said .
" There is no record of him voting for a regulation , increased regulation , going all the way back to the 1980s when he came to Congress . "
The McCain campaign 's current efforts to sell him as a champion of economic regulation are little more than a sham built on some linguistic trickery , the columnist said .
" He 's trying to confuse us ... on two words : reformer and regulator , " Alter said .
" He thinks that if he says reformer enough , people will believe that he also had faith in regulation . "

Planned Conspiracy To Prop Up The Dollar
The United States , Europe and Japan had planned to intervene and rescue a weak U.S. dollar in March , business newspaper Nikkei reported on Wednesday .
Officials from the U.S. Treasury Department , Japan 's Finance Ministry , and the European Central Bank reportedly drew up a currency contingency plan to be undertaken over the March 15 - 16 weekend , Nikkei reported , citing sources familiar with the situation .
The monetary officials also agreed on a framework for coordinating dollar - buying intervention , the report said .
No coordinated intervention took place , however , as the dollar began recovering shortly after U.S. authorities brokered the buyout of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase & Co .

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has submitted his resignation letter to the country 's President , Shimon Peres .
Mr Olmert may remain as interim prime minister for several weeks while his successor as leader of the Kadima Party tries to form a new government .
He is to be replaced by Israel 's Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , who has six weeks to gather a fresh coalition .
Mr Olmert announced he would step down in July after facing growing pressure over multiple corruption inquiries .
The BBC's Wyre Davies in Jerusalem says that forming a coalition will not be an easy task as Kadima does not have a majority in the Israeli parliament , known as the Knesset .
The same parties , particularly religious parties from the right , who joined the Olmert government will not necessarily support Ms Livni , our correspondent says .
It is a complicated process that may end in general elections at the start of next year , until when Ehud Olmert may remain as prime minister , our correspondent adds .
Corruption investigations Ms Livni , who is regarded as a moderate , won the leadership of the governing Kadima party on Thursday , beating Transport Minister Shaul Mofaz by just 431 votes , or 1.1 % .
According to the president 's office , Ms Livni will have up to 42 days to attempt to form a coalition representing at least 61 of the Knesset 's 120 seats from Israel 's mosaic of political parties .
If she fails , the president may give another member of the Knesset up to 42 days to try to form a government .
If still no government is formed , the president may mandate yet another member to try , or call elections , which must then take place within 90 days .
Mr Olmert has faced growing pressure over multiple corruption investigations during his less than three years in office .
He denies any wrongdoing in all cases .
Police have recommended he be indicted over two of the probes - allegations that he misused cash payments from a US businessman , and accusations that he double - billed government agencies for trips abroad .

WASHINGTON ( AP )  Congressional negotiators agreed Wednesday to allow some funding for construction next year on a site for missile defense interceptors in Poland but sharply reduced the Bush adminstration 's request .
The agreement between the Senate and the House of Representatives would also fully fund the request for a radar site in the Czech Republic , opening the door for the next U.S. presidential administration to begin building a European missile defense system .
The bill is a boost for a project that has been a serious source of tension in the deteriorating relationship between the United States and Russia .
Moscow opposes the deployment of U.S. military assets so close to its borders and has argued that the system undermines the deterrent of its massive nuclear arsenal , a charge the U.S. has dismissed as absurd .
In a concession by House Democrats , the bill would also allow the Defense Department to begin buying some parts for the interceptors planned for Poland .
It would however , require the Defense Department to demonstrate through a series of tests that the interceptors could work before they could be bought and deployed .
The concession could mitigate possible delays in deploying the system .
Some proponents of the system have warned that the testing requirement could cause the defense department to miss by years its goal of deploying the system by 2013 .
The Bush administration argues that a quick deployment is necessary to counter threats from Iran 's ballistic missile and nuclear enrichment programs .
The full House is expected to vote on the bill Wednesday .
It would also have to be approved by the Senate and signed by the president before it would take effect .
The bill would cut the administration 's 2009 funding request for the European project by almost $ 246 million out of $ 712 million .
It would also cut the request for construction of the Polish site by $ 90 million out a total of about $ 133 million .
However , the administration has projected that it could not begin construction of the Polish site until the end of next year , so the funds provided by Congress are likely to keep the project on schedule , according to Missile Defense Agency spokesman Rich Lehner .
Lehner said that the provision that would allow the purchase of some parts of the interceptors would help the agency meet its 2013 deadline .
The Bush adminstration had warned that some parts for the new interceptors could take several years to build .
The testing requirement , if enforced , could still cause delays .
The missile defense agency has has had a series of postponements in its testing program .
It says it hopes to begin testing the interceptors for the European project in 2010 .

The different parts of the music industry are in harmony today , at least when it comes to some online royalties .
In an agreement hailed as a " breakthrough that will facilitate new ways to offer music to consumers online , " groups representing songwriters , music publishers , record labels and digital music websites have ended a seven - year dispute over two types of music royalties .
Unfortunately , neither of those is the controversial performance royalty for Internet radio .
That remains the subject of a high - stakes stalemate between SoundExchange , which collects the fees for artists and record companies , and Internet radio sites such as Pandora and Live365 .
Today 's agreement resolves some contentious issues that were the subject of a six - month trial earlier this year before the Copyright Royalty Board , a group of judges charged by Congress with tackling these disputes .
The groups -- the Digital Media Assn. , the National Music Publishers ' Assn. , the Recording Industry Assn. of America , the Nashville Songwriters Assn. International , and the Songwriters Guild of America -- have agreed on so - called " mechanical royalties " for interactive streaming music and limited music downloads .
It 's all pretty complicated , but the groups said the deal should help lead to more cutting - edge music services .
" This agreement provides a flexible structure to support innovative business models in the digital music marketplace that will benefit music fans , creators and online services , " Mitch Bainwol , chief executive of the RIAA , said in a joint news release the groups issued today .
" The agreement demonstrates that our industries can work collaboratively to solve complex issues . ”
And there 's no doubt this is complex .
So here 's a quick glossary .
Let 's start with the mechanical royalty .
It is the fee paid to the songwriters , composers and publishers of the actual music ( like the one pictured above ) -- not the artists who perform it or the record companies that produce the recording .
Interactive streaming is different than most Internet radio .
It involves listeners choosing which specific songs they stream .
It 's a model that has yet to fully develop , in part because of the royalty concerns .
Limited music downloads are ones with significant restrictions attached , such as the songs disappearing from your device if you do n't continue paying a monthly fee .
As an example , iTunes downloads are not considered limited because you can listen to them as often as you want ( although there are some restrictions on how many computers you can load the songs on to ) .
But Napster To Go , which allows you to listen to songs you transfer to a mobile device as long as you connect to the service once every 30 days , provides limited downloads .
When both those models began emerging in 2001 , the music publishers and the RIAA cut a deal to allow them to operate without an agreed royalty rate .
According to the agreement announced today , the rate now will be 10.5 % of revenue as of Jan. 1 , 2008 , with a rate of 8.5 % of revenue applied retroactively from Dec. 31 , 2001 , until the end of 2007 .
The groups agreed that any performance royalties those services pay would be deducted from the mechanical rate .
There still are some big mechanical royalty issues to be resolved by the Copyright Royalty Board , which must rule by Oct.
2 . Among them : updating the 9.1 cents paid for each song on each physical CD sold ; creating a rate for the first time for regular digital downloads , such as iTunes , which has been using the CD rate ; and a rate for certain types of cellphone ringtones .
Everyone may not be so happy after that ruling .
But for now , the different industry groups are singing the same happy tune .

WASHINGTON , April 30  A Halliburton executive , facing withering criticism from Democratic lawmakers during a Senate hearing on Monday about the company ’s business dealings in Iran , insisted that the firm had not broken any laws .
The official , Sherry Williams , a Halliburton vice president and corporate secretary , said the company had consulted several law firms in 1995 after sanctions were imposed on Iran .
Officials of the company , which recently announced it was moving its chief executive from Houston to Dubai and establishing a corporate headquarters there , determined that it was legal for independent foreign subsidiaries of United States companies to do business there , she said .
“ We have followed U.S. law , ” she said .
“ We will continue to follow U.S. law . ”
Although the three Democratic senators on hand repeatedly suggested broader concerns than strict legality should have prompted the company to halt its business in Iran , Ms. Williams expressed no regret for the firm ’s work there .
From 1995 to 2000 , Vice President Dick Cheney was Halliburton ’s chairman ; at the time he spoke out against sanctions on Iran .
Noor Ahmad Gayezabi said a silent prayer while watching the small family TV with his 13 - year - old son .
" Help Nikpai .
Help Nikpai . Help Afghanistan . "
Then he watched his country win its first - ever Olympic medal .
Rohullah Nikpai defeated world champion Juan Antonio Ramos of Spain on Wednesday to earn the bronze medal in the men's under 58 - kilogram taekwondo competition , sparking applause , wide smiles and laughter in homes , restaurants and ice cream parlors around the country .
" When I saw that he won , I jumped up and hugged and kissed my son , " Gayezabi said .
" I was crying . "
President Hamid Karzai immediately called to congratulate Nikpai .
He also awarded him a house at the government 's expense , said Humayun Hamidzada , the president 's spokesman .
" I hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war , " Nikpai said .
The victory led all of Afghanistan 's evening newscasts .
" I am so happy .
I cannot express my feelings in words , " said Mohammad Akbar , 33 , who watched on a TV at his Kabul pharmacy .
" While I was watching the match I was clapping I was so happy . "
Nikpai , who is 21 , started learning the Korean martial art when he was 10 because his brother had found a club in Kabul to train .
Not only was it an escape from the daily rigors of life in a country that not been at peace since the 1970s , he turned out to be good at it .
Exceptionally good .
When Gayezabi met Nikpai , they were both living at a refugee camp in Iran during the years of war that embroiled Afghanistan in the 1980s and 1990s .
The two competed together on a refugee taekwondo team .
Nikpai came to Kabul four years ago , Gayezabi said .
In the mornings he lifted weights and in the evenings he practiced martial arts .
In between he earned money cutting hair as a barber .
With success came better training conditions .
After being selected for the national team six months ago , he was able to use a special gymnasium .
But in a country where sports take a distant place behind the realities of war , few resources are dedicated to training athletes .
" My training situation is a lot like the situation in my country , " Nikpai said .
" It 's not good . "
Gayezabi had a lucky few hours of electricity that allowed him to watch his former teammate 's victory .
He feared he would only be able to listen on the radio since Kabul averages about four hours of municipal electricity a day .
" I was crying because I was remembering back when we were both on the Afghan refugee taekwondo team in Iran , " Gayezabi said .
Only four Afghan athletes came to Beijing , representing a country that had never won an Olympic medal and is sinking ever deeper into war as the Taliban insurgency escalates .
Sprinter Robina Muqimyar — who in 2004 broke the gender barrier on the Afghan Olympic team — was last in a field of 85 women in the 100 meters , with a time of 14.80 .
She ran with a scarf covering her head .
Teammate Massoud Azizi finished 76th in the men's 100 .
He trains in Kabul 's National Stadium , where the Taliban once staged regular public executions , wearing jogging shoes because his spikes wo n't dig into the track 's cracked , concrete surface .
But Nikpai , who is 21 , has claimed a spot among his sport 's elite .
Afghanistan will get another chance at a medal in taekwondo .
Nesar Ahmad Bahave is competing in a heavier weight class .
Hussein Rachmati , a taekwondo teacher who works in the gym where Nikpai trains , said Nikpai prepared for the Olympics with a Korean teacher .
He placed second in the World Taekwondo Federation 's qualifying event in Vietnam last year .
Afghans gathered around an ice cream shop TV in Kabul broke out in wide smiles and passed around congratulations to one another after watching Nikpai 's win , said Abdul Wafi , a 28 - year - old university student .
" It is wonderful that an Afghan athlete can win a medal in the world Olympics , " said Wafi .
" It is a great achievement for Afghanistan . "
The top U.N. official in Afghanistan , Kai Eide , said the Olympic win shows that Afghanistan can compete on the global stage against the world 's best athletes .
" Young people should draw hope and inspiration from this Olympic win , " Eide said in a statement .
" Today , Afghanistan has demonstrated that it can and will succeed in the face of adversity with the determination , commitment and hard work of its most precious resource — the young people of Afghanistan . "
Along with the president 's offer of a house , Nikpai 's bronze medal comes with a cash prize .
Ehsanullah Bayat , chairman of the Afghan Wireless Communication Company , earlier announced that he would award any Afghan athlete who won an Olympic bronze $ 10,000 , along with $ 50,000 for a gold medal and $ 25,000 for a silver , said Khalid Andisha , a spokesman for AWCC .
" It is a great victory for Afghanistan , " said Mohammad Sukran , an 18 - year - old student .
" In a country like Afghanistan , the only thing we hear about all the time is violence and fighting .
This is finally good news for Afghanistan . "

It ’s just been publicly announced that the vitamin pill magnate Matthias Rath has pulled out of his gruelling legal case against me and the Guardian .
He bought full page adverts denouncing Aids drugs while promoting his vitamin pills in South Africa , a country where hundreds of thousands die every year from Aids under an HIV denialist president and the population is ripe for miracle cures .
I said his actions were highly worrying , in no uncertain terms .
I believe I was right to do so .
This libel case has drawn on for over a year , with the writ hanging both in my toilet , and over my head .
Although fighting it has been fascinating , and in many respects a great pleasure , it has also taken a phenomenal amount of my time , entirely unpaid , to deal with it .
For the duration of the case I have also been silenced on the serious issues that Rath ’s activities raise , the chapter on his work was pulled from my book , and I have been unable to comment on his further movements around the world .
This will now change , and I hope that other newspapers will have the sense to step outside of commercial allegiances and write about his activities , despite this single incident being one newspaper ’s tussle .
I genuinely believe that the madness of the South African government ’s approach to Aids is one of the most important stories of our time .
Usefully , it seems that Rath will now be responsible for the Guardian ’s legal costs .
Interim costs were awarded this afternoon at just shy of a quarter of a million , and we are seeking the full half a million pounds the paper has spent .
For my part , I will probably now write a swift book on Rath and South Africa , as a way to make all the fascinating extra information I ’ve had to dredge through useful to others , and to try and recoup something so that my time was not wasted .
It will be meticulously well referenced and carefully written .
I trust that this episode will act as a very strong cautionary note to the more vicious UK figures from the very corporate $ 50bn food supplement industry some of whom have used bullying , smears , and legal threats in their desperate bid to prevent people from examining their ideas : this goes to the very top of the industry , you should know by now that it will not work , and unless you change tack rapidly , some of you will have some very interesting surprises to come .
Play nicely now , they ’re only ideas .
I should also mention that I am extremely pleased and – cheesily – proud that the Guardian fought this case .
It ’s exactly the kind of thing I ’d have expected from them , it ’s the paper my grandparents bought , blah blah blah , and to me today everything they stand for is still very good indeed .
I do n’t think many other papers would tolerate a column as childish and wilfully geeky as mine , and for all the hassle , in a funny twist of reputation judo , the various corporate complaints about my work over the past few years have done me a world of good .
I was just some nerd who emailed in a column once a week , but once I was being chased by millionaires it was lagers with the bosses .
The editor txted me the other day .
To me that is some slightly weird shit .
So , more to follow no doubt , but here is my comment piece for tomorrow ’s paper , and below that , links to the triumphant Guardian coverage .
I recommend buying the paper on Saturday just so that you can stroke it and reward their valour .
It ’s good on Saturdays anyway , and the leader is particularly excellent .
Newspapers can be very good things , and today the Guardian is a very good one indeed .
With their money , myopia and abuses , these pill makers match big pharma
The food supplement industry likes to style itself as people ’s medicine , but the way it stifles debate is far from democratic
Ben Goldacre

Friday September 12 2008 19:00 BST
Matthias Rath today pulled out of a legal case against the Guardian which has cost the organisation £ 500,000 to defend .
I am proud that we fought it .
Rath is an example of the worst excesses of the alternative therapy industry ; UK nutritionists make foolish claims on poor evidence – they can make your child a genius with fish oils , or prevent heart attacks in the distant future – but Rath transplanted these practices into the world of HIV / Aids , where evidence really matters .
The potential consequences of his actions are outrageous , but he is by no means untypical .
This sector has engineered a beneficent public image for itself , a warm and friendly cottage industry ; but that fantasy is not borne out by the facts .
First , despite claims about the true evils of “ big pharma ” , presented as if they were evidence that vitamin pills are effective , there is little difference between the vitamin and pharmaceutical industries .
Key players in both include multinationals such as Roche and Aventis ; BioCare , the vitamin pill producer that media nutritionist Patrick Holford works for , is part - owned by Elder Pharmaceuticals , and so on .
The food supplement market , comprising products like vitamin pills and herbal supplements , is worth $ 50 bn worldwide ( against $ 600 bn for pharmaceuticals ) .
It has lobbied angrily and successfully against safety regulation , and the vitamin industry is also legendary in the world of economics as the setting of the most outrageous price - fixing cartel ever documented : during the 1990s the main offenders pleaded guilty and had to pay $ 1.5 bn , the largest criminal fine levied in legal history .
That ’s quite some cottage industry , and it is tightly linked to the “ nutritional therapists ” community .
Bant , their UK membership organisation , recently changed its code of conduct in accordance with the wishes of pill manufacturers , so that members can now take undisclosed financial kickbacks for the pills they prescribe to patients .
Doctors are struck off the GMC register for this activity , and rightly so .
Last year I went to a public meeting hosted by Matthias Rath in east London .
He spoke for three gruelling hours , and every time he mentioned the side - effects of a treatment prescribed by doctors , the people in the seats behind me growled the word “ murderers ” in a venomous tone .
Their hatred was intense , and it was unnerving to sit near them .
How do people become so extreme in their views ?
How have they been isolated from the realities of the miracle cure industries ?
A combination of wishful thinking , successful PR , and legal muscle .
When I attempted simply to write that the Dore miracle cure for dyslexia had not cured three people , we received several legal warning letters , delaying the piece by a month .
An academic who dared to criticise the evidence base for the programme received a threatening legal letter delivered by hand to her home address .
Gillian McKeith has made repeated legal threats against websites who have dared to discuss her work , and her lawyer husband has threatened an academic who suggested testing her ideas .
She also has a legal case hanging over the Sun that has seen little movement in three years .
When chiropractors had their practices challenged in the New Zealand Medical Journal they simply sent a threatening legal letter ( “ Let ’s hear your evidence , ” said the editorial in response , “ not your legal muscle ” ) .
A herbal pill entrepreneur – and academic – had Professor David Colquhoun ’s website removed from UCL servers after he dared to question her evidence .
The Society of Homeopaths had a blogger silenced by threatening his web host .
I could go on .
And of course , deterring dissent goes wider than the use of libel law .
There is also the bizarre smear operation against critics of the food supplement industry , and an elaborate campaign conducted by homeopaths against Professor Edzard Ernst , an academic who has simply dared to examine the evidence for their claims , which ended up with his employers at Exeter University being harassed to silence him .
Meanwhile the alternative therapists who run university BSc courses refuse to release their lecture notes , or let anyone see their exam papers , in a desperate attempt not to engage with critical appraisal from the worlds of scientific evidence of which they purport to be a part .
This is not just unpleasant , it is also unhealthy .
Ideas improve when they are challenged and questioned .
I am a doctor , journalist and academic .
I criticise the activities of doctors , journalists and academics in each of my jobs , and I welcome other people criticising my ideas .
Nothing could be more anti-democratic or stifling to debate than using money , law and power to regulate what can be discussed , and yet those who do it have the gall to represent themselves as the outsider , the little man , concerned with the medicine of the people .
In reality they behave like nothing more than commercial entities .
The food supplement pill industry is phenomenally powerful , extremely lucrative and incredibly influential , but it has shown itself to be philosophically and commercially incapable of critical self - appraisal .
Rath is its product .
It is inconceivable that any individual within that industry would be brave enough to stand up and criticise his activities – and for that , more than anything else , it should be condemned .

Prince Rupert's Drops are formed by dropping hot molten glass into cold water .
Stresses created in the process make the glass resistant to smashing with a hammer .
But they can also explode unexpectedly .
Image
Six years ago , I was looking out the window of a plane bound for England , admiring the sunlight illuminating the slightly pink clouds .
My British companion remarked that the clouds were just like candy floss — Britspeak for cotton candy .
Those sweet thoughts were rudely interrupted by a small popping noise from within my handbag , then another . . . and another .
Unfortunately it was n't candy .
My heart sinking , I discovered that the bottom of my bag was littered with powdered glass .
Three of the little Prince Rupert ’s drops I had so carefully made for a lecture at Oxford University had exploded .
I first came across Prince Rupert 's drops when I was reading an early " chymical " text at the British Library .
In it the drops were called " Greatricks glasses . "
After a week of trying to find out who Greatricks was — mostly by reading up on a seventeenth - century faith healer named Valentine Greatrakes — I e-mailed a desperate SOS out to my colleagues .
A kind soul informed me that " Greatricks " might have simply meant " great tricks " : King Charles
II of seventeenth - century England had used the drops as practical jokes after being introduced to them by his nephew , Prince Rupert of Bavaria .
Typical of " virtuosi " of this period , gentlemen who dabbled in everything and excelled at much , Prince Rupert had a varied career as an artist , military officer , and scientist .
His scientific curiosity focused on the great - trick glasses : teardrop - shaped beads formed by dropping molten glass into cold water .
The bulbous head can withstand hammering on an anvil , but breaking the curved , tapered tail shatters the entire drop into fine powder .
The king would have subjects hold the bulb end in their palms , and then he'd break off the tip , startling the victims with a harmless little explosion .
Science gets involved
Charles II , the founding patron of the Royal Society , directed its members to explain why the " chymical glasses " exploded .
So riveted was the Society by the glasses that in 1663 , an enterprising satirist wrote a ballad about the group 's obsession :
And that which makes their Fame ring louder With much adoe they shew'd the King To make glasse Buttons turn to powder , If off the[m ] their tayles you doebut wring .
How this was donne by soe small Force Did cost the Colledg a Month ’s discourse .
Robert Hooke , the Society 's Curator of Experiments , did the first detailed examinations of the drops : he coated them with a transparent glue , wrapped them in leather , broke off their tails , and then viewed the glass fissures under his microscope .
But it was not until 1994 that their secret was fully revealed .
Munawar M. Chaudhri of the University of Cambridge , England , and Srinivasan Chandrasekar of Purdue University in Indiana did high - speed photographic analyses of the drops , observing the cracks accelerating from the drop 's tail towards the head at more than 4,000 miles per hour .
The two engineers realized that when a drop is formed , the cold water rapidly cools and solidifies the molten glass on the outside .
The glass within , still hot , then gradually contracts , causing large compressive stresses on the surface as well as interior tension .
That inner tension is enough to blow the drop apart at the tiniest crack , making the thin tail vulnerable .
But that tension also accounts for the round head 's toughness , by pulling the outer layers of the head tight .
Give it a try
Finding some instructions for making Prince Rupert 's drops in The Art of Glass , written by a Florentine chemist , Antonio Neri , in 1662 , I decided to try myself .
Neri advised , " The best way of making them , is to take up some of the Metall [ molten glass ] out of the pot upon the end of an Iron rod , and immediately let it drop into cold water , and there lye till it cool . "
Using a crème brûlée torch on steroids , I heated up a glass rod , placing it very close to the surface of a beaker of ice water to catch the drops .
Some of the glass tears broke when I fished them out of the water , but soon I was armed with a dozen , carefully taped to an index card to take with me for my lecture .
Though a few drops did not endure the plane trip , because a change in air pressure can destabilize the glass , my audience was delighted with those that survived .
Recently , a video of exploding drops has even appeared on YouTube .
Prince Rupert had discovered a “ great trick ” indeed to entertain royals and Internet junkies alike .

Hi , everyone , I wanted to give you a heads up about PS3 firmware update ( v2.43 ) .
Unlike previous updates , firmware v2.43 is specific to the Japan region , and only PS3 users there will be required to
install the update .
PS3 users in all other regions will not be prompted to download v2.43 .
However , if you manually initiate a firmware update by clicking on “ System Update ” under the XMB ’s Settings icon , the v2.43 update will be available , regardless of where you are located .
Users outside of Japan do not need to perform this update if your PS3 system software is on version v2.41 or later .
However if you do perform the update , it will not cause any issues with your system or add any new functionality .
That is the paradox .
Hamas has provided the formerly lawless Gaza with security , which won the party the election over Fatah .
But Hamas now makes many Gazans feel insecure .
Majeda Alsaqqa is the woman running the Culture and Free Thought Association , the one held at gunpoint .
For the moment , she ’s back in business .
But Hamas not long ago took over the local library , and it stages plays about the lives of Palestinian soldiers killed by Israel , which are sometimes performed in the street just outside Ms. Alsaqqa ’s garden .
“ They use real explosives ! ” she said , laughing .
“ It used to be different here .
I used to ride around on a bicycle wearing a dress .
The raid on us was about imposing a different culture  about not liking our kind of theater , where men and woman mix .
These were brainwashed kids who came with the Kalashnikovs , who are taught not to like foreigners or summer camps , where we teach children not to take anything for granted .
For the first time , I ’m scared . ”
She ’s not alone .
Even so , Gazans can be stubborn .
These days , playing songs extolling Fatah in public is a direct provocation against Hamas .
The other night , a Fatah anthem sounded through the streets .
It turned out to be a bachelor party .
A rented bandstand with flashing lights had been erected in a square .
The men , heads skyward , danced with a mad intensity , escaping into the deafening music .
The inky sea was up the street , silent and shimmering .
There was no traffic , no movement on the sidewalks otherwise , but at the end of the block , several young , armed Hamas soldiers lingered in the shadows .
“ You never know , ” said Mr. Kihail , back at New Sound .
“ No direct threat has come , but you cannot joke with Hamas . ”
Next to the cash register  beside tapes bearing an image of the long - faced , white - bearded Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin  he nonetheless still stocks Fatah tapes with pictures of Samih Madhoun , the fighter whom Hamas last year elaborately executed .
When asked to play a selection from the tape , Mr. Kihail kept an eye on the door .
“ Arafat , you left , ” the singer wailed , “ but you left behind an earthquake that is Samih Madhoun . ”
Just then , a middle - aged woman in a head scarf wandered in , and fondled a CD by Mustafa Amar , an Egyptian singer in a dashing white scarf , standing before the Pyramids .
“ It ’s an escape , ” she said , making clear she meant the music , not the album cover .
Mr. Kihail asked her if she was also a fan of Abdel Halim , the Egyptian crooner , who died in 1977 and who remains universally beloved here .
He cued up a Halim song , one about a man abandoned by his lover , with a baleful melody .
She nodded .
Briefly , Mr. Kihail teared up .
“ I blame him , ” the woman said , about Halim , “ for being so romantic .
Life is not like that . ”
“ No , ” Mr. Kihail said , “ it is n’t . ”
This Hungarian Vizsla is either really sleepy or just spied its owner yawning .
Spying someone yawning often makes us yawn .
Now , a new study shows your canine buddy can catch yawns from you , too .
The results suggest domestic dogs have the capacity for a fundamental form of empathy , the researchers say .
The phenomenon , called contagious yawning , has been found only in humans and other primates such as chimpanzees and is thought to relate to our ability to empathize with others .
Past studies , however , involved yawning within one species at a time , so for instance chimps that triggered other chimps to yawn and humans prompting yawns in other humans .
Shaggy line - up
Researcher Ramiro Joly - Mascheroni , a psychologist at Birkbeck , University of London first tested the phenomenon in his dog , a Labrador .
Immediately upon yawning himself , Joly - Mascheroni 's dog immediately yawned .
And sure enough , tests on friends ' pups showed similar results .
For the new study , the furry cast included a wide range of dog breeds from a Greyhound to a Staffordshire Bull Terrier to a Dalmatian .
In total 29 dogs went through two testing scenarios each lasting five minutes , one in which a human ( not the owner ) called the dog over and while keeping eye contact with the dog he or she would act out yawns that included the vocal portions .
In the non-yawning scenario , the human went through similar motions , except he or she did n't yawn vocally and instead just opened and closed their mouths .
During the yawn sessions , 21 dogs ( or 72 percent of them ) yawned , while no dogs yawned during the non-yawning scenario .
That 's compared with 45 percent to 65 percent found from past studies in humans and 33 percent found for chimpanzees ( in chimp - to - chimp studies ) .
In addition to yawning , the dogs showed similar reactions to human yawns .
" In the yawning condition , we found the dogs reacted pretty much in the same way , " Joly - Mascheroni said .
" They all acknowledged the yawn in some way either by dropping their ears or turning their heads away . "
Catching the Z's
The researchers are n't sure why dogs catch the yawns from us .
In fact , scientists do n't yet understand contagious yawning in humans .
" There are theories that seem to think that we used to transfer this information of ' I am tired ' by yawning when we did n't have language , " Joly - Mascheroni told LiveScience .
In this same way , humans could be transferring sleep info to dogs .
" It would be interesting to find out what other information we transfer to dogs or to any other animals that we are not aware of , " he added .
In past studies , research team member Atsushi Senji , also of the University of London , has shown a possible link between empathy and contagious yawning in autistic children , the researchers said .
Autism is a developmental disorder in which individuals often show impaired social interaction , problems with communication and a lack of empathy , according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke .
This previous research showed that autistic kids do n't " catch " yawns from others , Senji said .
And so the new results in dogs , published online in August in the journal Biology Letters , could mean man 's best friend has the capacity for a basic level of empathy .
BusinessWeek is Bracing for Inflation .
Let 's take a look at an article written by John K. Castle , CEO of Castle Harlan , a New York private equity firm .
Growing evidence suggests American consumers , businesspeople , and political leaders should all be bracing for double - digit inflation , probably as early as 2009 .
The relative price stability of the past 15 years is giving way to worsening inflation , despite the recent softening of oil prices .
The Consumer Price Index for all items shows the inflation rate averaged 2.6 % a year from 1992 through 2007 but has doubled since January , reaching an annual rate of 5.6 % in July .
By next year , the monthly figure could hit double digits , and the inflation rate for 2009 overall could triple 2007's 2.85 % .
I say this not only because I have looked at a broad range of statistics that point in this direction .
I also run a private equity investment firm that owns companies in a number of industries — including restaurants , the manufacture of gardening tools , oil and gas exploration services , and distribution of entertainment products such as books and videos — that are already being forced to pass price increases on to the consumer .
The skyrocketing price of oil is obviously a central element in the accelerating price spiral .
But a sea change in China 's role is beginning to have a huge impact as well .

Magazine Cover Stories As Contrarian Indicators
When the music stops , in terms of liquidity , things will be complicated .
But as long as the music is playing , you ’ve got to get up and dance .
We ’re still dancing .
" The depth of the pools of liquidity is so much larger than it used to be that a disruptive event now needs to be much more disruptive than it used to be .
At some point , the disruptive event will be so significant that , instead of liquidity filling in , the liquidity will go the other way .
I do n't think we 're at that point . "
Oil And Magazine Covers
For those of us who believe in such things as contrary indicators , this suggests a short term top in Oil to me .
I would bet we do n't see new highs in Oil for the next 6 months , and perhaps even 12 months .
Excerpt :
Thirty - five years on , oil prices have quadrupled again , briefly soaring to a peak of just over $ 135 a barrel .
But , so far , this has been a slow - motion oil shock .
If the Arab oil - weapon felt like a hammer - blow , this time stagnant oil output and growing emerging - market demand have squeezed the oil market like a vice .
For almost five years a growing world shrugged it off .
Only now is it recoiling in pain .
One of my developers just sent me some truly incredible stats about Ruby 1.9 and its threading performance .
20 threads * 100,000 iterations
Ruby 1.9 = 1.54 s.
Ruby Enterprise = 3.01 s.
JRuby 1.1.2 = 5.82 s.
Jython 2.2.1 = 11.86 s.
Python 2.5.2 = 12.32 s.
Ruby 1.8.7 = 22.68
Since our attempt at testing Ruby as a crawler really was n’t all that much slower than Python it could be really interesting to see what will happen with Ruby 1.9 .

Two fresh episodes of the US hit series ' Heroes ' were released Monday night .
In the day that followed each episode was downloaded well over a million times by BitTorrent users all over the world , making it the busiest day ever on many torrent sites .
An example of the BitTorrent traffic boost was reported yesterday , as Mininova got 10 million downloads in a single da .
A record breaking figure , in part thanks to the debut of ‘ Heroes ’ and several other shows .
Other BitTorrent sites report a similar increase in traffic .
It ’s Heroes that breaks all the records though .
Our statistics show that , across all BitTorrent sites , the two episodes from Heroes ’ season opening were downloaded well over a million times each – in just one day .
The vast majority of the downloads come from outside the US ( 92 % ) , where shows usually air weeks , months or even years later .
The show was downloaded the most in the UK ( 15 % ) , where the official season opening is scheduled for October 1st .
Canada , France and Australia complete the top 5 .
Although most TV - broadcasters wo n’t be happy to read these figures , one could argue that BitTorrent has actually helped TV - shows to build a stronger , broader , and more involved fanbase .
Jesse Alexander , the executive producer of ‘ Heroes ’ told Torrent Freak that he thinks this is indeed the case .
“ People watching shows such as Lost and Heroes on BitTorrent is the present world reality .
TV networks have to recognize this , give their viewers more ways to interact with the shows , and find ways to generate revenue from every member of the global audience , ” he said .
Let ’s hope Alexander will be heard in Hollywood .
Below is the TV - show download chart of the past week , Heroes is not included in the list , but it will surely appear in next week ’s chart .

OPINION
: : : : : : : : : :
While visiting another blog ( hey , we do that sometimes ; how do you think we find such great stories ? ) , I came across a comment from another poster who made a logically false claim about political polling .
He said that “ If you get good representation among the respondents ( regarding , age , gender , race , education , home etc ) you can get accurate results with less than 2000 respondents regardless of how large the real population is . ”
( The site was Mudflats .
If you are interested in Alaskan politics – and who is n’t going to be these next two months ?
– this is the go - to guy .
But do n’t worry , we ’ll keep you up - to - date at The Zoo with any developments in the Sarah Palin Show . )
Well , those who know me can confirm that I do not believe political polls are a valid application of statistics and , at the end , I asked any statisticians out there to explain to me why I was wrong .
Surprisingly ( to me ) , a few posts later a statistician told me that I was correct not to believe polls .
I shall post a response of his , with a link to his explanation ( warning , it gets pretty heady in there ) at the end of my comments .
Every poll that you hear about comes with a “ Margin of Error ” .
While I admit that I do not know a lot about stastistics , I know that there is a formula they use based on the number of people sampled , without any regard for the size of the population sampled , to determine this Margin of Error .
Now , as I understand it , the Margin of Error is not how far up or down you can make each number and have the results be “ correct ” , but rather it is the probablility that the sample you took is not representative of the population as a whole ( from which the samples came ) .
Therefore , a 3 % Margin of Error does not mean that Obama ’s numbers or McCain ’s numbers can be adjusted up or down three points , but that there is a 3 % chance that the results cannot be trusted at all , that they are a complete abberation .
And there would be no real way to know unless the results were so wildly different than the ones released the day before .
( “ TV Announcer : “ In a stunning development , Republican Presidential nominee John McCain ’s support among blacks in America rose to 82 % , giving him a 37 - point lead over Democratic Presidential nominee Barack Obama . ” )
They just do n’t report those poll results .
They sit on them and do another round of polls to see if those results look like the ones from two days before .
Then they say , “ Whew , it was that 3 - out - of - 100 chance that we would get a bad sampling .
That must be the third time in three months that this has happened .
Who ’d have guessed it ? ”
Hmmm , third time in about a hundred days .
What are the odds of that ?
Statistical analysis of a “ population ” assumes some commonality among that population so that any 900 or so samples could “ represent ” the entire population .
But this is false thinking when applied to political polling .
You cannot say that the American people are all “ more or less ” the same , and that you could ask questions of any 900 people and get a good idea of what the entire country is thinking , because you could easily be getting 900 different opinions to start with .
This kind of analysis might work when analyzing probabilties about events ( such as car accidents or heart attacks ) , because those things either did or did not happen .
But you cannot properly apply this rationale to analyzing how people think , because those thoughts do not necessairly stay static .
They could change before the pollster finishes collecting the data .
And for now , we wo n’t even talk about the fact that they are basing the published results on a probability that a certain thing has happened .
( As I said , I do n’t know this stuff , but I heard from someone who does . )
Taking a poll of what is clearly an uninformed electorate is no way to determine public policy , or even what the public thinks .
The only way polls can be considered valid is if it was known that everyone in the country knew all the facts before announcing their opinion / decision .
Do you really think that the average American is “ informed ” on the issues ?
Take a look at the people you know in your neighborhood , your local stores , even your place of work .
Now , you ’re here reading this blog , so you must have some interest in what is going on in the world .
But do all of your friends , neighbors , and co-workers stay as informed as you ?
And yet , if you ’ve never been called by a pollster ( more on that later ) , there ’s a chance that someone else you know might have been .
Do you think he ’s the right guy to be asking which direction this country should be going ?
I know I would n’t trust some of the people I know .
( Do n’t worry , it is n’t any of you . 🙂 )
For these reasons , I believe that political polls are nothing but a waste of time and money .
Our tax money should never be used to fund such polls , as desired results can almost deliberately be obtained from the mere framing of the questions .
The easiest , and most relevant , examples would be “ Are you ‘ Pro - Life ’ ?
Or are you ‘ Anti- Choice ’ ? ”
“ Are you ‘ Pro - Death ’ ?
Or are you ‘ Pro- Choice ’ ? ”
How would you respond to a pollster who referred to those who share your beliefs with the “ offensive ” term when asking you a question ?
If you call yourself “ Pro-Choice ” , and the pollster asks you if you are “ Pro- Life or Pro- Death ? ” , how are you going to answer the rest of his questions , knowing he ’s “ one of them ” ?
I think it ’s a fair question , which works the other way around , too .
Of course , there ’s a nice little cottage industry for polling , and organizations like Gallup and Zogby ( among others , and I ’m just picking two of the more famous ones , simply as examples of the kind of groups I ’m talking about ) have staked their reputations on claiming their polls are useful .
But it is easy to demonstrate that pollsters ca n’t be getting an accurate assessment of political feelings in this country , because they do not call cell phones .
And young people often do not have land lines ( like grown - ups ) , so they probably never get called by pollsters .
How are their feelings measured in the poll ’s public results ?
It makes no sense that they could ignore the amazing increased voter registration among younger voters .
Yes , they did that four years ago and a lot of new younger voters did n’t vote .
But this time , there ’s a guy who ’s closer to their own ages , with kids younger than them ( kid sisters ) , so there ’s a connection that may not be quantifiable .
Without a valid way to be certain your polling sample matches what you need to have polled , its results have no meaning in the real world .
If political polling was exposed for the fraudulent representations of public opinion that it logically must be , the TV talking heads would n’t know what to think or say .
Much of their politial analysis and reporting is based on what pollsters tell them people think .
For that reason , they will never give them up , nor will they teach people why they should n’t waste their time answering political polls .
A thought occurred to me the other day .
I was watching MSNBC ( which should surprise no one ) , and they talked about the results of “ an NBC / Wall Street Journal ” poll .
And I thought to myself : Rupert Murdoch owns the Wall Street Journal .
He also owns Fox News Channel ( also known as FNC , which stands for a lot of more accurate descriptions than “ news channel ” ) , which has Bill O’Reilly regularly blasting NBC ( sometimes for things their parent company , GE , did in the weapons industry , as if NBC had a say in any of that ) for being “ ultra - liberal ” .
( For the record , besides being unsure what “ ultra - liberal ” means , if it means what I hear people like him say it means , I see no actual evidence of it in my viewing . )
So , if NBC is “ ultra - liberal ” , and the Wall Street journal is “ ultra - conservative ” , then what kind of questions do they ask people ?
Do they use words like “ pro-choice ” and “ anti-choice ” or “ pro-life ” and “ pro-death ” ?
It makes a difference .
( I realize that the specific questions they ask may not have anything to do with abortion ; that was just an example , what some folks would call “ a fer instance ” . )
My point is simply this :
How would the questions be framed in a poll conducted by two groups with ( allegedly ) ideologically opposing views ?
How would the media talking heads know what the American people think about an issue ?
Well , I ’m no journalist , nor am I a police detective , and I ’m not even a private dick ( though some say I ’m a public one ) , but I would start with asking each Member of Congress about the issues on which their constituents are writing them .
Sure , there are 435 Representatives ( when it is full ) , and 100 Senators ( when that body is full , and when has it been lately ? ) , but that ’s no reason to not pick up the phone and ask them .
I ’m not talking about how the pollsters should collect their data , I ’m talking about how the media that commissioned those polls can learn what the public is concerned about without using the polling organizations , whose methodolgy for collecting data cannot possibly prove accurate .
I ’m not saying that you can base percentages on how many letters a Member of Congress gets , because some are form letters , inspired by activist organizations ( both left and right ) , and some may be disproportionately from one town or district faced with a problem , and they were all encouraged to write their Congressman for help .
But at least you can learn whether the wars in Iraq are stillimportant to voters , or are many concerns about jobs and the economy ( Why is the price of gas so high ?
Answer : Phil Gramm , John McCain ’s “ former ” economic advisor , and the one touted as a possible Secretary of the Treasury in a McCain Badministration .
If that is n’t enough to keep you up at night worrying about how your family will get through the next four years , I ’m not sure what will .
And that was not a typo . )
Pollster John Zogby once told Jon Stewart that to get those 900 people that they sample ( and this was the specific number Jon used in his question ) , they have to call about 7,000 to 8,000 people .
This means they are only polling people willing to talk to pollsters , not Americans as a whole , which is another flaw in their thinking .
I find no logical reason to believe that a random sampling of 900 people willing to talk to pollsters ( about 10 % of the population ) can possibly tell you with any accuracy what a nation of 300,000,000 are thinking .
It is absurd to try to make believe that it can .
Whatever world these results apply to ( and being a sci - fi fan , I know that there exists an alternate reality in which these results are 100 % correct ) , it ai n’t this one .
As promised , the comment that confirmed my suspicions about why those political polls that tell us the race is neck - and - neck between Senators Obama and Mccain are a bunch of bullshit .
( And remember how they kept trying to convince us that Hillary and Barack were “ too - close - to - call ” , and then later , they all but admitted that they were pretty sure it would come down that way a long time before ? )

But Mr Rohrbacher insisted that Georgia was to blame : " The Georgians broke the truce , not the Russians , and no amount of talk of provocation and all this other stuff can alter that fact . "
Assembly Joint Resolution 51 , telling President Bush and Congress that California opposes lifting the moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling , has passed the California Legislature .
“ My assembly colleagues are sending a strong message today that California ’s coastline is an international treasure , and we ’re not going to sacrifice it by lifting the federal moratorium , ” said Assemblyman Pedro Nava , D - Santa Barbara , chairman of the Joint Committee on Emergency Services and Homeland Security .
“ I ’ve been fighting the Bush administration ’s attempts to spoil and soil our coast for many years .
Our beaches have been stained and marine life killed because of oil spills .
Offshore oil drilling will not reduce the price of gasoline any time soon , if at all .
It will put our coastline at risk , endanger tourism , fisheries and coastal recreation .
” AJR 51 expresses the California Legislature ’s strong opposition to any new federal energy policy and legislation that opens up the California coast to offshore drilling , and rejects President Bush ’s recent executive order to end the moratorium on new oil and gas drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf along the California Coast and the coastlines of other states .
Bush ’s recent action to rescind the moratorium overturns a policy that was implemented and expanded by his father through executive orders , former President George H.W. Bush .
President Bush ’s actions will lead to offshore drilling lease sales along the Northern and Southern California coast , and near shore at Santa Monica Bay , Palos Verdes Peninsula , La Jolla and the Orange County coastline .
Additional lease sales and drilling could occur in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico , along the Atlantic Coast , and off of Oregon and Washington .
A congressional moratorium on new oil and gas drilling has been in place since 1981 , and has been approved every year by Congress .
This year marks the 39th anniversary of the Santa Barbara oil spill .
More than 4 million gallons of crude oil choked 35 miles of California ’s coastline causing a path of destruction never before seen in the nation ’s history .
The carcasses of dolphins and seals washed ashore and countless birds , fish and other wildlife wore black shrouds .
The spill and its aftermath galvanized the country , raised environmental awareness and was the catalyst to the modern environmental movement in the United States .
In 1994 , the California Legislature established the California Coastal Sanctuary Act , creating a sanctuary stretching from the Oregon to the Mexican border .
This sanctuary prohibits future oil and gas leasing in state waters in perpetuity .

Before you sign up with DirectTV , please stop and look for an alternative way to get your television fix .
Even if you have to go sit in Circuit City at primetime to watch your favorite shows , do that instead of signing an agreement with DirectTV .
Seriously .
We tried the “ no TV route ” .
We tried the “ watch TV on the internet ” route .
Not because we needed to save money , but we wanted to do without the TV … but it did n’t work and we needed to sign up for service .
I looked at our local cable company , but they wanted a fortune for basic cable , and if I had wanted DVR service as well , then forget it – I would have had to have given them my first born child .
So I check out DirectTV – the rates were great , the DVR service was cheap , the installation was free – everything looked great .
The guy on the phone set everything up , told me my final price , the installation went smoothly and we were enjoying our first month of having TV in the house again … and then it all came crashing down when I got my first bill from them .
My $ 41.99 for 12 months is now $ 67.99 for 12 months … and they say I never got an offer for $ 41.99 , so too bad .
I know the first thing anyone is going to ask – “ Do you have it on paper ? ” … and no , I do n’t .
But when was the last time you called up the cable company to ask for a deal / discount / service set up and got anything in writing as to your deal ?
I have been paying for cable TV for 16 years now and not once have I gotten ( or needed ) anything in writing .
You call up , they tell you the deal , you get the deal .
Done .
Finished .
But not with DirectTV – with them you call up , get the deal , then they switch it and say it never existed .
And that is exactly what happened with me and I am not too happy with it .
I asked the woman to prove that I had signed up for anything that would cost $ 67.99 and she could n’t – they have nothing with my signature on it agreeing to this price .
But on the other hand , I do n’t have anything saying I should be paying $ 41.99 other than the two phone calls I had with reps when signing up .
Are we , as consumers , supposed to record our phone calls now ?
After 45 minutes of arguing with the woman on the phone , I gave up – but only with them .
I am now taking this to the next level , by filing complaints with the New Mexico Attorney General ’s office , the Better Business Bureau , and anyone else I can find to complain to .
And after a little digging , seems many people have similar complaints about DirectTV , so I know I am not alone nor wrong in this situation :
Consumer Affairs
DirectTV Idiocy
Pissed Consumer
Complaints Board
Rip - off Report
About.com
Do n’t know where any of this is going to take me , but I am going to do my best to try to complain as much as possible and let as many people know about this bait and switch that DirectTV has going on .
And to be fair , there are a ton of complaints against cable companies , but I never had one … and now I wish I had just gone with them in the first place as DirectTV has a contract you have to stay in .
Has anyone else had an experience like this ?
Any advice ?
Would love to hear from you !

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
In the largest bank failure in U.S. history , Washington Mutual Inc. , with about $ 310 billion in assets , succumbed Thursday to the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis , was seized by federal regulators and rapidly acquired by J.P. Morgan Chase for $ 1.9 billion .
The federal Office of Thrift Supervision said it closed WaMu WM , - 0.55 % on Thursday and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as receiver .
The FDIC in turn conducted the bidding process that led to the purchase by J.P. Morgan JPM , - 0.84 % .
" With insufficient liquidity to meet its obligations , WaMu was in an unsafe and unsound condition to transact business , " the Office of Thrift Supervision said in a press release posted on its Web site .
The move , coming on a Thursday , highlighted the severity of the credit crisis , coming even as efforts to agree on a financial rescue bill faltered in Washington .
See related story .
Continental Illinois National Bank &
Trust was , for more than 20 years , the largest bank failure in U.S. history .
It had $ 40 billion of assets when it failed in 1984 .
Federal officials said WaMu , which has some $ 900 billion in customer deposits , would be open for business Friday .
WaMu , long one of the nation 's largest mortgage lenders , was hit hard by the subprime crisis that has widened to threaten U.S. financial markets and led to the current crisis and the federal proposal to stabilize financial markets with a $ 700 billion plan to buy up bad debt .
WaMu had lost $ 16.7 billion in deposits since Sept. 15 , according to the Office of Thrift Supervision , and had been seeking a buyer over the past week .
Over the last three quarters , the firm 's losses totaled more than $ 6 billion as it wrote down billions of dollars of bad loans .
Its stock price had plummeted some 95 % to its close of $ 1.69 a share Thursday .
On Wednesday , a Standard & Poor 's ratings downgrade further pushed the bank toward collapse .
Option ARMs and other risky loans
Washington Mutual 's downfall was hastened by the collapse in real estate prices and exacerbated by its aggressive lending practices .
WaMu , as the company is commonly known , was the second biggest originator of home loans called " Option ARMs , " which were marketed to borrowers via low introductory rates and included various payment options .
Those loans often included the option to pay only interest , which caused the borrowers debt to grow with each payment , becoming negative amortization loans .
When housing prices began to fall just at the time rates were adjusting higher on those loans , borrowers began defaulting at alarming rates , leading to big losses for WaMu and others who had extended the credit or purchased securities based on the credits .
Since the subprime mortgage crisis began last year , the widespread credit crunch and economic malaise has claimed numerous victims , including large Wall Street brokerages such as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEHMQ , and insurance giant American International Group Inc. AIG , - 1.23 % .
The economic woes have also resulted in the failure of 12 banks so far this year .
Unlike those bank failures , however , J.P. Morgan 's purchase of Washington Mutual 's operations is n't expected to affect the FDIC 's insurance fund , The Wall Street Journal reported .
WaMu debt , equity not included , probably worthless
J.P. Morgan said the purchase included all of WaMu 's deposits , assets and some liabilities .
It said the purchase excluded senior unsecured debt , subordinated debt , and preferred stock of Washington Mutual 's banks .
J.P. Morgan said it would not be acquiring any assets or liabilities of the bank 's holding company .
" We believe the remaining value of the holding company is negative , eliminating value to the common and preferred shareholders and most of the debt holders , " analysts at Keefe Bruyette & Woods said in a research report Friday .
WaMu shares fell more than 90 % on Friday .
David Bonderman 's private equity firm TPG , which had led a consortium making a $ 7 billion investment in Washington Mutual , will likely lose most of their investment .
The Journal earlier reported that other potential suitors for Washington Mutual have included Citigroup Inc. C , - 2.12 % , Wells Fargo & Co. WFC , - 2.35 % , and private equity firms Carlyle Group and Blackstone Group BX , +0.09 % .
However , potential suitors including Spain 's Banco Santander STD , - 4.33 % and Toronto - Dominion Bank of Canada TD , - 1.43 % showed initial interest but then cooled to the idea of striking a deal , according to the Journal .
Swallowing a giant
J.P. Morgan said it is raising $ 8 billion in fresh capital via a common stock sale , and expects to post $ 1.5 billion in pretax merger costs , but expects the WaMu acquisition to add more than 50 cents per share in earnings in 2009 and bring annual pretax cost savings of about $ 1.5 billion by 2010 .
It said it will convert WaMu 's consumer banking , home lending and credit card businesses to the Chase brand over the next two years .
The move will leave the buyer with about $ 900 billion in customer deposits and make it number one in that category .
The WaMu branches it is buying will make J.P. Morgan the second largest in the U.S. in that category , with 5,400 branches in 23 states reaching 42 % of the population .
As of June 30 , Seattle - based WaMu had $ 307.2 billion in assets , 43,198 employees , and 2,239 retail offices in 15 states .

With Wall Street ’s fate hanging in the balance , and with Sarah Palin ’s incoherence sparking interest in Thursday ’s vice presidential debate , it was easy to overlook another major story Monday that got less attention than it deserved .
The Justice Department released a nearly 400 - page report with this jaw - dropping bottom line :
“ Our investigation found significant evidence that political partisan considerations were an important factor in the removal of several … U.S. attorneys . ”
Remember the controversy over the sudden dismissals of nine U.S. attorneys ?
Remember the allegation that the Bush administration had sullied the long - held principle that justice should be administered in an impartial , nonpartisan way ?
Remember the questions about what then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales knew and when he knew it ?
Remember Kyle Sampson , the Gonzales aide who played a key role in the firings ?
Remember Monica Goodling , the White House liaison who went so far as to ask prospective Justice appointees to wax eloquent about why they wanted to “ serve ” George W. Bush ?
The Justice Department conducted as thorough an investigation as it could , and concluded that there was evidence of White House political meddling in “ at least three of the removals . ”
The joint probe by the department ’s Office of Inspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility recommended further investigation to determine “ whether the totality of the evidence demonstrates that any criminal offense was committed . ”
The investigators reported being stonewalled by the White House , saying they were unable to look at all the evidence “ because of the refusal by certain key witnesses to be interviewed by us , as well as by the White House ’s decision not to provide internal White House documents to us . ”
In other words , as far as the team of investigators could determine from the limited evidence they were allowed to uncover , what we suspected and feared seems to have been true .
The Bush administration seems to have removed at least three federal prosecutors — who are supposed to be evenhanded and apolitical in the way they do their jobs — for partisan political reasons .
The report says “ it appears ” that Missouri U.S. attorney Todd Graves “ was told to resign because of a political dispute among Missouri politicians , not because of an objective assessment of his performance . ”
Specifically the dispute was between Republican Sen. Christopher S. “ Kit ” Bond and his brother , a Republican congressman .
Arkansas U.S. Attorney Bud Cummins “ was not removed for any performance reasons , ” the report says .
“ Rather , the evidence shows that the main reason for Cummins ’ removal was to provide a position for former White House official Tim Griffin . ”
The most egregious case , according to the report , was that of New Mexico U.S. Attorney David Iglesias .
The evidence showed that Iglesias was removed because of complaints from Republican Sen .
Pete Domenici and other GOP officials and party activists who believed he was not being aggressive enough in pursuing certain voter fraud and public corruption cases — by happenstance , cases against Democrats .
Gonzales and his deputies at Justice never looked into Iglesias ’ handling of those cases , and in fact never even asked him about them .
They just fired him .
The investigators wanted to ask White House political czar Karl Rove , White House counsel Harriet Miers , Goodling , Domenici and Domenici ’s chief of staff about any role they played in Iglesias ’ dismissal .
All refused to be interviewed .
In releasing the report , Attorney General Michael Mukasey announced that he had ordered a new investigation to “ pursue this case wherever the facts and the law require , ” including possible criminal charges .
By most accounts , Mukasey has taken pains to cleanse Justice of the partisan taint that Gonzales left behind .
Whatever ultimately comes of this disgraceful episode , however , we already know enough to put it in context .
The people who have been running our government for the past eight years have nothing but contempt for government .
They believe only in politics and ideology , in that order .
First , win elections by any means necessary .
Second , once in a position to act in the public good , govern with the ideological conviction that government is either irrelevant or harmful to the public interest .
You can draw a straight line between firing U.S. attorneys for political reasons and turning a blind eye to the ruinous excesses of Wall Street .
What ’s impartial justice against the possibility of gaining political advantage ?
Why shackle the hallowed free market with government oversight ?
And , if you want to draw the line a little farther , who cares if the prospective vice president appears to know nothing about anything ?
Eugene Robinson ’s e-mail address is eugenerobinson ( at) washpost.com .
The new post -Couric spin / CW among Palin sympathizers is that the protective shield around the Alaska governor has hurt more than helped and that she should have initially done more than just a handful of highly - anticipated network sit - downs .
It 's a feeling that is shared inside some quarters of the campaign , by figures on the right at National Review and the Weekly Standard and , according to Bill Kristol in his Times column today , by McCain himself .
Indeed , it has become a safe enough sentiment to express that even Mitt Romney , an otherwise disciplined and on - message surrogate , used an appearance today on " Morning Joe " to second - guess the approach .
" Holding Sarah Palin to just three interviews and microscopically focusing on each interview I think has been a mistake , " Romney said , per Politicker MA .
" I think they'd be a lot wiser to let Sarah Palin be Sarah Palin .
Let her talk to the media , let her talk to people . "

If one case encapsulates the disaster that is the Obama administration , it may be the dustup over the A.I.G. bonuses last March .
Recall that extreme gambling by A.I.G. Financial Products nearly crashed the world in 2008 , necessitating a taxpayer bailout of $ 182.3 billion ( and counting ) .
Following this , A.I.G. , now 80 percent government owned , rained more than $ 400 million in bonuses on Financial Products employees for their performance in 2008 .
The Obama administration , which knew of the bonuses for months , played defense for A.I.G. by unspooling a bloated Larry Summers to argue , “ The government cannot just abrogate contracts . ”
The problem was the feds had just demanded that auto workers abrogate their hard - won contracts before Detroit got a bailout .
United Auto Workers leaders complied , sacrificing “ job security provisions and financing for retiree health care , ” plus agreeing to cuts in base pay , overtime pay , break time , raises , skilled worker positions and chopping wages for many new hires in half to $ 14 an hour .
Far from failures or mistakes , these episodes illustrate how Team Obama , which surfed a tsunami of corporate money and savvy branding to victory , is doing exactly what it was elected to do : redistribute money upwards .
It ’s hard to think of a decision by this White House that would have not elicited cackling glee from the Bush administration .
The number of horrendous policies enacted by the Obama administration in barely a year boggles the imagination .
What follows is by no means an exhaustive list , just a few dozen of the worst .
EMPIRE’S BACKYARD
Even
Time magazine has concluded that “ Obama ’s Latin American Policy Looks Like Bush ’s . ”
While many hoped Obama would lift the 48 - year - old embargo against Cuba , Obama loosened a few restrictions only for Cuban Americans .
Last April , Obama declared the United States a “ full partner ” in Mexico ’s calamitous drug war .
Months later , the White House slapped Bolivia with economic penalties , allegedly for not being an enthusiastic drug warrior , but more likely for pursuing an independent agenda .
And there is the Honduran coup , which Obama endorsed by recognizing the rigged election in November .
Most ominously , his administration inked a deal in October for seven military bases in Colombia , convenient for launching new wars against socialist governments in the region .
GREEN JOB LOSSES
Before Van Jones was thrown under the bus , Obama promised to create five million green jobs in plug - in hybrids , weatherization , renewable energy , biofuels and clean coal .
Biofuels and clean coal ?
Okay , maybe it ’s a good thing this promise was snuffed .
But as Naomi Klein points out , between the stimulus , the auto bailout and the Wall Street rescue , Obama had the leverage and political capital to fund mass transit and a smart electrical grid , restructure government - owned automakers to focus on green technology and force bailed out banks to fund industrial restructuring and green infrastructure .
Instead , we get a White House vegetable garden the size of a New York apartment .
TOO BIG TO FAIL , TOO BIG TO JAIL
While the original Troubled Assets Relief Program was “ only ” $ 700 billion , the program ’s watchdog estimates taxpayer money at risk is a phenomenal $ 23.7 trillion .
The Obama administration has been more interested in defending obscene executive pay , blessing more of Wall Street ’s highrisk trading , stonewalling on how the TARP funds were used and abused , and resisting real regulation , rather than prosecuting Goldman Sachs and other banks that peddled risky mortgage - backed securities while secretly betting they would plummet in value — a textbook case of securities fraud .
But what do you expect from a candidate who raked in the most dough from Wall Street , real estate , commercial banks and hedge funds ?
A DREAM FORECLOSED
In comparison to the bank bailout , relief for homeowners is limited to a miserly $ 75 billion under Obama ’s Making Home Affordable program .
As of December , only 31,000 homeowners have received permanent mortgage modifications .
The real winners are loan servicers .
Of the top 25 participants , 21 were “ heavily involved in the subprime lending industry . ”
The parent companies of the lenders , which have vacuumed up more than $ 21 billion from the program , include Bank of America , Wells Fargo , JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup .
Homeowners in the program who do n’t get permanent help are left with wrecked credit scores while they continue to pay for homes they can’t afford , which may be lengthening the crisis .
Meanwhile , the number of homeowners with mortgage debt greater than the value of their homes was 23 percent as of September and could peak at 48 percent in 2011 .
Even modest measures , such as allowing bankruptcy judges to lower mortgages , were abandoned by the Obama administration .
HEALTH CARE DEFORM
There is a method to Obama ’s madness .
First , his economic philosophy is to subsidize private entities to provide public goods .
Second , his main tactic is to appeal to bipartisanship .
( Never mind that there was plenty of bipartisanship during the Bush era when Democrats surrendered to virtually every heinous decision . )
In the case of healthcare , a much simpler and more effective single - payer system was rejected because Republican support was supposedly needed .
The bipartisan tactic allowed the Obama administration to replace single payer with a fake public option that was then dropped .
As for the healthcare bill , it will skim $ 500 billion from publicly funded Medicare and Medicaid and use it to subsidize individuals who will be forced to buy for - profit insurance or pay a fine .
The bill does nothing to control costs , ensure quality coverage or prevent workers from losing job - related insurance .
It allows for wildly different rates based on age and region , and will deliver millions of new “ customers ” to insurance and drug companies and for - profit hospitals .
WAR IS THE HEALTH OF THE STATE
While President - elect , Obama was largely silent about the Israeli slaughter of 1,400 civilians in Gaza .
Three days after being inaugurated , Obama ordered Predator drone strikes inside Pakistan , expanding the illegal U.S. war .
Over the last year , Obama has committed another 64,000 soldiers to Afghanistan , effectively launching a new year .
There are still 115,000 U.S. troops in Iraq .
The use of private military contractors is surging , with 121,000 ( and growing ) in Afghanistan alone .
Obama has continued to threaten Iran over its uranium - enrichment program .
And many believe the White House is “ initiating a low - level war in Yemen . ” Author and Ret. U.S. Army Col. Andrew Bacevich writes that Obama has effectively signed on to “ perpetual war . ”
LABOR PAINS
Despite reportedly pouring $ 450 million into Obama ’s campaign and providing thousands of volunteers , organized labor has been unable to advance its main cause : a bill called the Employee Free Choice
Act that would make it easier for employees in a workplace to unionize .
The Obama administration says it is committed to passing the bill , but it has not put any muscle behind it .
That may be because wealthy Obama backers , including three Chicago billionaires who own hotels , vehemently oppose the bill .

Japanâ€™s largest shipping line , Nippon Yusen KK , has teamed with Nippon Oil Corporation in developing aÂ system of solar panelsÂ capable of generating 40 kilowatts of electricity for use on a 60,000 ton cargo shipÂ for Toyota Motor Corporation .
Unlike the solar panels soon to be offeredÂ on the tops ofÂ theÂ Toyota Priusthat I wrote about last week , these panels are designed to assist withÂ theÂ shipâ€™s motive power .
Â
Solar panels arenâ€™t new on ocean - going ships , but until now theyâ€™ve only been used to power crew cabins and living quarters .
This system will helpÂ reduceÂ diesel fuel consumption by up to 6.5 % and CO2 emissions by 1 or 2 % .
That doesnâ€™t seem like much , but in hard numbers and particles of pollution , every little bit helps and youâ€™ve got to start somewhere .
Fill â€˜er up
The average cargo ship gets about .008 miles per gallon .
Okay , letâ€™s look at it another way ; at that rate the ship is burning about 120 gallons of bunker fuel â€ “ Â nasty stuffÂ â€ “ per mile .
That means theÂ ship will burnÂ at leastÂ 720,000 gallons of fuelÂ carrying all those shiny new Priuses 6000Â across the ocean from Japan to the United States .
With the new solar power system in place the ship will burn about 46800 gallons lessÂ per voyage .
Thatâ€™s nearly the amount that was spilled into San Francisco bay last year when the pilot drove the Cosco Busan in the Bay Bridge .
Thus , the system saves one wholeÂ environmental disasterâ€ ™sÂ worth of fuel .
The point being that no matter how you slice it , making any inroads at all from the pollution caused by shipping is a good thing .
Research fromÂ Environmental Science and TechnologyÂ shows that emissions from shipping are a contributing factor for up to 60,000 deaths worldwide each year .
44 % of the sulphate in fine particulate matter along coastal cities comes from ship exhaust .
Cleaning up those ocean breezes
In response to those statistics , California regulatorsÂ approvedÂ the nationâ€™s strictest regulations for reducing emissions from ocean - going ships .
Starting in July of 2009 , ships coming into California ports will be required to switch to a cleaner burning fuel within 24 miles of shore .
These regulations are similar to international rules set to take effect in 2015 .
Working to clean up shipping is a good thing , of course , and innovators are hard at work all over the globe making it happen .
As weâ€™ve reported previously here in Triple Pundit , the German company Â SkySailsÂ has pioneered a kite sail able to offset up to 20 % of a ships fuel consumption ( depending on weather and windÂ conditions ) on its prototype MVÂ Beluga Skysail . Â
In Scandinavia , Â shipbuilderÂ Wallenius WilhelmsenÂ is working on aÂ ship designed to run onÂ solar , wind , and fuel cell energy .
Â
Nippon is investing $ 1.4 million to develop its solar system .
Â
The first ship outfitted with solar panels is scheduled for completion in December .
Nippon Oil Executive Vice President says he hopes full commercialization of the system will happen within three to five years .
TocqueDeville
Daily Kos
July 27 , 2008
So what if I told you that the powers of financial capitalism ( bankers etc. ) , had a far - reaching aim , nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands , able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole .
One simply cannot understand politics without understanding the significant role the ruling class plays in it – behind the scenes , and beyond the grasp of democratic oversight .
Quigley is an essential introduction to what I call the adult history of the world .
This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert , by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences .
The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basle , Switzerland , a private bank owned and controlled by the world ’s central banks which were themselves private corporations ?
TocqueDeville ’s diary
And what if I told you they had succeeded ?
Wow !
The most powerful bankers creating a world system of financial control , dominating the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole , with secret meetings .
Surely you would think Tocque has fallen under the spell of a wild conspiracy theory .
But you can put away the cat in the tinfoil hat .
Those are not my words .
And it ’s not a theory .
They are the words of one of the greatest , most eminent historians in modern times , the late Carroll Quigley – of Harvard , Princeton and the Georgetown Foreign School .
Here is Bill Clinton referring to his former college professor Quigley at the 1992 Democratic convention :
" As a teenager , I heard John Kennedy ’s summons to citizenship .
And then , as a student at Georgetown I heard that call clarified by a professor named Carroll Quigley , who said to us that America was the greatest nation in history because our people had always believed in two things : that tomorrow can be better than today and that every one of us has a personal moral responsibility to make it so . "
Quigley could write credibly about the far reaching aims of these ruling elites because he himself was a member of the ruling class and , as such , he was given unprecedented access to their private files and records .
When he published these words in his 1300 page tome , Tragedy & Hope : A History of the World in Our Time , not only was he adding to the historical record a previously untold story , he was making history himself in doing so .
The story I am about to share is critically important .
One simply cannot understand politics without understanding the significant role the ruling class plays in it – behind the scenes , and beyond the grasp of democratic oversight .
Quigley is an essential introduction to what I call the adult history of the world .
And it is only with this historical understanding that we can understand the forces shaping our world , and possibly hope to affect them .
The time for the common man , or at the very least the educated political class like us , to be let in on the secret has long since passed .
To take our country back , we must know who exactly we are taking it back from .
And we must know what their real agenda is , and their methods for achieving it .
It is simply unacceptable in this information age for so many to be oblivious to the real forces of political power , and to allow those forces to operate in secrecy .
These excerpts from Quigley are just the beginning .
And while his revelations are about the financial powers of the early 20th Century , they are essential for understanding the power structures that exist today .
Perhaps most importantly , his revelations help us recognize that there is indeed a power class , working behind the scenes , acting upon our government , the mass media and education to bring about a world that is very much contrary to the interests and aims of the public .
The Historian Spills the Beans
Tragedy and Hope is not a book about the ruling class , and it is certainly not a " conspiracy " book .
It is , as its title says , a history of the modern world .
Quigley has merely reinserted the role of the ruling powers back into the narrative where they belong for any accurate account .
But in the process , Quigley drops a number of bombshells .
And I do n’t mean two week press cycle bombshells .
I mean rewrite history bombshells .
Here is an incredibly brief synopsis of some of them , followed by the relevant excerptions .
( I have linked to the excerpt that corresponds to each item .
Just click the number to quickly scroll down . )
BOMBSHELL #1
Cecil Rhodes , the founder of De Beers and creator of the Rhodes ’ Trust ( of which the Rhodes ’ Scholarship is a part ) formed a secret society with some of the wealthiest and most powerful men in Britain and New York .
The primary goal of this group was to federate the English speaking world and to expand the British empire .
The structure of this society was an inner circle of " initiates " and outer circles of " helpers . "
The outer circles were called Round Table groups .
This was during the Gilded Age and it is difficult to even comprehend the wealth of these people ( I posted a pic of one of their houses just to convey ) .
And to truly understand their aims , you have to appreciate the reach of their industry .
These were the first globalists of the modern era and their vision was breathtaking in scope .
They sought to create a transnational trading system that would allow them unfettered access to markets and resources worldwide with minimal red tape .
In essence , they were the pioneers of globalization and national sovereignty and colonial unrest was their primary impediment .
It appears the specific goals of this group evolved over the years , and their dream of a world federation gave way to a softer , more subtle alignment .
But one can only describe their general aim of recalibrating the political environment , consisting of most major nations , into a global free trading system as being highly successful .
We are witnessing now the fruition of a plan set in motion over a century ago , conceived in secret , and implemented over multiple generations .
And while the modern world certainly differs from that imagined by these founders , they are truly the architects of what we may call the Anglo - American empire that thrives today .
They laid the foundation , both for the transnational banking and industrial system we have now , and for the methods of exerting the power to create that system .
Intermission
At this point , if this is n’t blowing your mind a bit , it ’s because you already know all about Carroll Quigley and his revelations , you have n’t been reading carefully , or you think I ’m off my rocker .
Let me assure you , I am not a conspiracy theorist .
I have zero interest in secret societies .
Skull and Bones bores me .
My only interest in the ruling class is their subversion , for their own aims , of American democracy , and the many crimes against humanity and nature they commit daily around the world .
It is only to the extent that they are a force in politics that I have any interest at all .
Through my involvement in the entertainment industry and academic associations I have known more than a few in the ruling class ( mostly their offspring ) and I can tell you unequivocally that they are not all evil , Bohemian Grove is not a cult but a fancy camping trip , and that almost all the conspiracy theories you will find on the interenet are wrong .
There is , as far as I know , no Illuminati or any other such bullshit .
And this is not the X - Files .
What we have is pluralism meets feudalism with a hefty amount of mafia thrown in .
The ruling class in the early 20th Century , as it is now , was not monolithic .
And in spite of their working together to bring about one globalized order , they often compete and work against each other , just like any other political bloc .
It is imperative to understand , this is not a conspiracy .
It was in its conception .
And the powerful certainly conspire and collude daily .
But " globalization " is a movement , not too unlike the progressive movement .
The difference is the globalists have literally trillions of dollars , euros , and pounds to throw around on their campaign .
BOMBSHELL #2
The Council on Foreign Relations was a front organization for this group .
This should n’t come as any surprise .
The CFR is known well now as a trade lobby .
And many also already have a pretty good idea of their role in empire maintenance .
But to discover their secret origins was one of Quigley ’s greatest finds .
And if one has any doubt about the power of the CFR , one merely has to read this bit of homespun wisdom spoken on the Senate floor from Senator Earnest Hollings ( D ) of South Carolina ( Congressional Record , June 30 , 1993 , S8315 ) :
If you ever run for President , you get very wonderful , embossed invitations from the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission , and you get the coffee and fine china , and , man , you are really a high muckety - muck .
And then what they do is get you to swear on the altar of free trade an undying loyalty and support — free trade , free trade .
That is all they want .
And they co-opt every one of these young Senators that want to run for President .
In England , the front is called the Royal Institute of International Affairs or Chatham House .
BOMBSHELL #3
Here Quigley describes the methods the group uses to implement its far reaching aims .
I ’m going to revisit this part in my next post .
But this should be of special interest to us all .
In fact , I place this as the most important of all of Quigley ’s revelations .
" The methods can be summed up under three headings : ( a ) a triple - front penetration in politics , education , and journalism ; ( b ) the recruitment of men of ability ( chiefly from [ certain universities ) and the linking of these men to the [ Group ] by matrimonial alliances and by gratitude for titles and positions of power ; and ( c ) the influencing of public policy by placing members of the [ Group ] in positions of power shielded as much as possible from public attention .
( Carroll Quigley – The Anglo American Establishment
Thus the title of this diary – Three Easy Steps .
This movement has penetrated every power structure civilized life – from politics of course , to journalism ( See bombshell # 4 ) , and even down to our schools and universities , all with the goal of facilitating their control .
BOMBSHELL #4
The group had significant control over the most powerful newspapers in the US and Britain , and infiltrated the Left - wing with such instruments as the New Republic :
The American branch of this " English Establishment " exerted much of its influence through five American newspapers ( The New York Times , New York Herald Tribune , Christian Science Monitor , the Washington Post , and the lamented Boston Evening Transcript )
Here begins the excerpt section .
It ’s a hard read with many unfamiliar names – and some you will know .
But I highly recommend reading it .
There is far more treasure in here than I outlined .
# 1 The Plot
This association was formally established on February 5 , 1891 , when Rhodes and Stead organized a secret society of which Rhodes had been dreaming for sixteen years .
In this secret society Rhodes was to be leader ; Stead , Brett ( Lord Esher ) , and Lord Milner were to form an executive committee ; Arthur ( Lord ) Balfour , ( Sir ) Harry Johnston , Lord Rothschild , Albert ( Lord ) Grey , and others were listed as potential members of a " Circle of Initiates " ; while there was to be an outer circle known as the " Association of Helpers " ( later organized by Milner as the Round Table organization ) … .
Thus the central part of the secret society was established by March 1891 .
It continued to function as a formal group , although the outer circle was , apparently , not organized until 1909 - 1913 .
Quigley describes the " outer " , Round Table group ’s formation thusly :
The Round Table Groups have already been mentioned in this book several times , notably in connection with the formation of the British Commonwealth in chapter 4 and in the discussion of appeasement in chapter 12 ( " the Cliveden Set " ) .
At the risk of some repetition , the story will be summarized here , because the American branch of this organization ( sometimes called the " Eastern Establishment ’ ) has played a very significant role in the history of the United States in the last generation .
The Round Table Groups were semi-secret discussion and lobbying groups organized by Lionel Curtis , Philip H. Kerr ( Lord Lothian ) , and ( Sir ) William S. Marris in 1908 - 1911 .
This was done on behalf of Lord Milner , the dominant Trustee of the Rhodes Trust in the two decades 1905 - 1925 .
The original purpose of these groups was to seek to federate the English - speaking world along lines laid down by Cecil Rhodes ( 1853 - 1902 ) and William T. Stead ( 1849 -1912 ) , and the money for the organizational work came originally from the Rhodes Trust .
By 1915 Round Table groups existed in seven countries , including England , South Africa , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , India , and a rather loosely organized group in the United States ( George Louis Beer , Walter Lippmann , Frank Aydelotte , Whitney Shepardson , Thomas W. Lamont , Jerome D. Greene , Erwin D. Canham of the Christian Science Monitor , and others ) .
The attitudes of the various groups were coordinated by frequent visits and discussions and by a well informed and totally anonymous quarterly magazine , The Round Table , whose first issue , largely written by Philip Kerr , appeared in November 1910 . …
Money for the widely ramified activities of this organization came originally from the associates and followers of Cecil Rhodes , chiefly from the Rhodes Trust itself , and from wealthy associates such as the Beit brothers , from Sir Abe Bailey , and ( after 1915 ) from the Astor family .
Since 1925 there have been substantial contributions from wealthy individuals and from foundations and firms associated with the international banking fraternity , especially the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust , and other organizations associated with J. P. Morgan , the Rockefeller and Whitney families , and the associates of Lazard Brothers and of Morgan , Grenfell , and Company .
The chief backbone of this organization grew up along the already existing financial cooperation running from the Morgan Bank in New York to a group of international financiers in London led by Lazard Brothers .
Milner himself in 1901 had refused a fabulous offer , worth up to $ 100,000 a year , to become one of the three partners of the Morgan Bank in London , in succession to the younger J. P. Morgan who moved from London to join his father in New York ( eventually the vacancy went to E. C. Grenfell , so that the London affiliate of Morgan became known as Morgan , Grenfell , and Company ) .
Instead , Milner became director of a number of public banks , chiefly the London Joint Stock Bank , corporate precursor of the Midland Bank .
He became one of the greatest political and financial powers in England , with his disciples strategically placed throughout England in significant places , such as the editorship of The Times , the editorship of The Observer , the managing directorship of Lazard Brothers , various administrative posts , and even Cabinet positions .
Ramifications were established in politics , high finance , Oxford and London universities , periodicals , the civil service , and tax - exempt foundations .
# 2 Expanding the Empire to the US – Council on Foreign Relations
At the end of the war of 1914 , it became clear that the organization of this system had to be greatly extended .
Once again the task was entrusted to Lionel Curtis who established , in England and each dominion , a front organization to the existing local Round Table Group .
This front organization , called the Royal Institute of International Affairs , had as its nucleus in each area the existing submerged Round Table Group .
In New York it was known as the Council on Foreign Relations , and was a front for J. P. Morgan and Company in association with the very small American Round Table Group .
The American organizers were dominated by the large number of Morgan " experts , " including Lamont and Beer , who had gone to the Paris Peace Conference and there became close friends with the similar group of English " experts " which had been recruited by the Milner group .
In fact , the original plans for the Royal Institute of International Affairs and the Council on Foreign Relations were drawn up at Paris .
The Council of the RIIA ( which , by Curtis ’s energy came to be housed in Chatham House , across St. James ’s Square from the Astors , and was soon known by the name of this headquarters ) and the board of the Council on Foreign Relations have carried ever since the marks of their origin .
Until 1960 the council at Chatham House was dominated by the dwindling group of Milner ’s associates , while the paid staff members were largely the agents of Lionel Curtis .
The Round Table for years ( until 1961 ) was edited from the back door of Chatham House grounds in Ormond Yard , and its telephone came through the Chatham House switchboard .
The New York branch was dominated by the associates of the Morgan Bank .
For example , in 1928 the Council on Foreign Relations had John W. Davis as president , Paul Cravath as vice - president , and a council of thirteen others , which included Owen D. Young , Russell C. Leffingwell , Norman Davis , Allen Dulles , George W. Wickersham , Frank L. Polk , Whitney Shepardson , Isaiah Bowman , Stephen P. Duggan , and Otto Kahn .
Throughout its history the council has been associated with the American Round Tablers , such as Beer , Lippmann .
Shepardson . and Jerome Greene .
The academic figures have been those linked to Morgan , such as James T. Shotwell , Charles Seymour , Joseph P. Chamberlain , Philip Jessup , Isaiah Bowman and , more recently , Philip Moseley , Grayson L. Kirk , and Henry M. Wriston .
The Wall Street contacts with these were created originally from Morgan ’s influence in handling large academic endowments .
In the case of the largest of these endowments , that at Harvard , the influence was usually exercised indirectly through " State Street , " Boston , which , for much of the twentieth century , came through the Boston banker Thomas Nelson Perkins .
The American Group and the CIA
Closely allied with this Morgan influence were a small group of Wall Street law firms , whose chief figures were Elihu Root , John W. Davis , Paul D. Cravath , Russell Leffingwell , the Dulles brothers ( Alan Dulles was head of CIA ) and , more recently , Arthur H. Dean , Philip D. Reed , and John J. McCloy .
Other nonlegal agents of Morgan included men like Owen D. Young and Norman H. Davis .
Roots of the Anglo - American alliance
On this basis , which was originally financial and goes back to George Peabody , there grew up in the twentieth century a power structure between London and New York which penetrated deeply into university life , the press , and the practice of foreign policy .
In England the center was the Round Table Group , while in the United States it was J. P. Morgan and Company or its local branches in Boston , Philadelphia , and Cleveland .
Some rather incidental examples of the operations of this structure are very revealing , just because they are incidental .
For example , it set up in Princeton a reasonable copy of the Round Table Group ’s chief Oxford headquarters , All Souls College .
This copy , called the Institute for Advanced Study , and best known , perhaps , as the refuge of Einstein , Oppenheimer , John von Neumann , and George F. Kennan , was organized by Abraham Flexner of the Carnegie Foundation and Rockefeller ’s General Education Board after he had experienced the delights of All Souls while serving as Rhodes Memorial Lecturer at Oxford .
The plans were largely drawn by Tom Jones , one of the Round Table ’s most active intriguers and foundation administrators .( cont. below )
# 3 . The Triple Front
THE MILNER GROUP could never have been built up by Milner ’s own efforts .
He had no political power or even influence .
All that he had was ability and ideas .
The same thing is true about many of the other members of the Milner Group , at least at the time that they joined the Group .
The power that was utilized by Milner and his Group was really the power of the Cecil family and its allied families such as the Lyttelton ( Viscounts Cobham ) , Wyndham ( Barons Leconfield ) , Grosvenor ( Dukes of Westminster ) , Balfour , Wemyss , Palmer ( Earls of Selborne and Viscounts Wolmer ) , Cavendish ( Dukes of Devonshire and Marquesses of Hartington ) , and Gathorne - Hardy ( Earls of Cranbrook ) .
The Milner Group was originally a major fief within the great nexus of power , influence , and privilege controlled by the Cecil family .
It is not possible to describe here the ramifications of the Cecil influence .
It has been all - pervasive in British life since 1886 .
This Cecil Bloc was built up by Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne - Cecil , Viscount Cranborne and third Marquess of Salisbury ( 1830 - 1903 ) .
The methods used by this man were merely copied by the Milner Group .
These methods can be summed up under three headings : ( a ) a triple - front penetration in politics , education , and journalism ; ( b ) the recruitment of men of ability ( chiefly from All Souls ) and the linking of these men to the Cecil Bloc by matrimonal alliances and by gratitude for titles and positions of power ; and ( c ) the influencing of public policy by placing members of the Cecil Bloc in positions of power shielded as much as possible from public attention .
# 4 . Controlling the Media
The American branch of this " English Establishment " exerted much of its influence through five American newspapers ( The New York Times , New York Herald Tribune , Christian Science Monitor , the Washington Post , and the lamented Boston Evening Transcript ) .
In fact , the editor of the Christian Science Monitor was the chief American correspondent ( anonymously ) of The Round Table , and Lord Lothian , the original editor of The Round Table and later secretary of the Rhodes Trust ( 1925 - 1939 ) and ambassador to Washington , was a frequent writer in the Monitor .
It might be mentioned that the existence of this Wall Street , Anglo - American axis is quite obvious once it is pointed out .
It is reflected in the fact that such Wall Street luminaries as John W. Davis , Lewis Douglas , Jock Whitney , and Douglas Dillon were appointed to be American ambassadors in London .
… This group wielded great influence because it controlled the Rhodes Trust , the Beit Trust , The Times of London , The Observer , the influential and highly anonymous quarterly review known as The Round Table ( founded in 1910 with money supplied by Sir Abe Bailey and the Rhodes Trust , and with Lothian as editor ) , and it dominated the Royal Institute of International Affairs , called " Chatham House " ( of which Sir Abe Bailey and the Astors were the chief financial supporters , while Lionel Curtis was the actual founder ) , the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust , and All Souls College , Oxford …
Infiltrating the Left- wing and the New Republic
More than fifty years ago the Morgan firm decided to infiltrate the Left - wing political movements in the United States .
This was relatively easy to do , since these groups were starved for funds and eager for a voice to reach the people .
Wall Street supplied both .
The purpose was not to destroy … or take over but was really threefold : ( 1 ) to keep informed about the thinking of Left - wing or liberal groups ; ( 2 ) to provide them with a mouthpiece so that they could " blow off steam , " and ( 3 ) to have a final veto on their publicity and possibly on their actions , if they ever went " radical . "
There was nothing really new about this decision , since other financiers had talked about it and even attempted it earlier .
What made it decisively important this time was the combination of its adoption by the dominant Wall Street financier , at a time when tax policy was driving all financiers to seek tax - exempt refuges for their fortunes , and at a time when the ultimate in Left - wing radicalism was about to appear under the banner of the Third International .
The best example of this alliance of Wall Street and Left - wing publications was The New Republic , a magazine founded by Willard Straight , using Payne Whitney money , in 1914 .
Straight , who had been assistant to Sir Robert Hart ( Director of the Chinese Imperial Customs Service and the head of the European imperialist penetration of China ) and had remained in the Far East from 1901 to r9l : , became a Morgan partner and the firm ’s chief expert on the Far East .
He married Dorothy Payne Whitney whose names indicate the family alliance of two of America ’s greatest fortunes .
She was the daughter of William C. Whitney , New York utility millionaire and the sister and co-heiress of Oliver Payne , of the Standard Oil " trust . "
One of her brothers married Gertrude Vanderbilt , while the other , Payne Whitney , married the daughter of Secretary of State John Hay , who enunciated the American policy of the " Open Door " in China .
In the next generation , three first cousins , John Hay ( " Jock " )
Whitney , Cornelius Vanderbilt ( " Sonny " )
Whitney , and Michael Whitney ( " Mike " ) Straight , were allied in numerous public policy enterprises of a propagandist nature , and all three served in varied roles in the late New Deal and Truman administrations .
In these they were closely allied with other " Wall Street liberals , " such as Nelson Rockefeller .
The New Republic was founded by Willard and Dorothy Straight , using her money , in 1914 , and continued to be supported by her financial contributions until March 23 , 1953 .
The original purpose for establishing the paper was to provide an outlet for the progressive Left and to guide it quietly in an Anglophile direction .
This latter task was entrusted to a young man , only four years out of Harvard , but already a member of the mysterious Round Table group , which has played a major role in directing England ’s foreign policy since its formal establishment in 1909 .
This new recruit , Walter Lippmann , has been , from 1914 to the present , the authentic spokesman in American journalism for the Establishments on both sides of the Atlantic in international affairs .
His biweekly columns , which appear in hundreds of American papers , are copyrighted by the New York Herald Tribune which is now owned by J. H. Whitney .
It was these connections , as a link between Wall Street and the Round Table Group , which gave Lippmann the opportunity in 1918 , while still in his twenties , to be the official interpreter of the meaning of Woodrow Wilson ’s Fourteen Points to the British government .
A final word
Please use caution when reading this .
There is a broader context to this that I am unable to address in this space .
Quigley ’s Tragedy and Hope is over 1300 pages and these citations are scattered seamlessly throughout .
The point is not to assert that there is a secret group who is pulling the strings of the modern world .
It is far more complex .
It is possible that there still exist the inner circle of " initiates . "
But I have no evidence for it .
In fact , the evidence strongly suggest that after 1910 or so , the whole organization took on a new character .
And it certainly got uglier .
The point is to draw light on this hidden part of our history and the inner workings of the one percent of one percent .
They love the shadows and secrecy .
They control the flow of information to a horrifying extent .
They have untold influence over our government in ways most people can’t imagine .
And they have a perilous vision for our world .
Who has jurisdiction over a transnational economy .
Who can regulate it ?
What democratic institution can even stand up to it ?
This is the central downfall of the globalization idea .
As David Rothkopf observes in this Newsweek column , having a global economy is great for the pirates , but is devasting for democracy , sovereignty , and justice .
The current financial crisis is another such example , producing serious questions about the influence of the superclass .
Of the world ’s elites , none has strutted the world stage for the past decade like global investment bankers .
Masters of money , they created something new : global markets and a constantly evolving array of securities that were both beyond the reach and the comprehension of regulators .
Now , the value of some of the complex investment vehicles they created is proving to be illusory .
As a consequence , the world economy was set for the crisis that is currently unfolding .
There was no effective global regulator to keep the system in check , and there was no real voice for the average Joe .
The Federal Reserve stepped in to stabilize the burnout of one of these major market makers — even though they have no jurisdiction over investment banks , even though many of those supporting the bailout / buyout were the same who have long clamored for " self - regulation , " even though many were the ones who had cited the moral hazard of helping to bail out homeowners and encouraging their bad borrowing behavior .
And so you have a financial leadership structure that bails out investment bankers worldwide , but not homeowners .
I ’ll leave you with this video clip I excerpted from the publisher of Harper ’s and Texaco heir Lewis Lapham ’s movie , The American Ruling CLass
" The ruling class is so able to manipulate our democracy that they really control democracy , I feel . "

Sharp contractions in the money supply and recession are two spokes on the same wheel .
When the money supply shrinks , there 's less economic activity , and the economy slows ; it 's as simple as that .
An article in this week 's UK Telegraph by Ambrose Evans - Pritchard shows that the country is sliding inexorably into the jaws of a deep recession .
From the UK Telegraph :
" The US money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history , heightening the risk of a Wall Street crunch and a severe economic slowdown in coming months .
Data compiled by Lombard Street Research shows that the M3 ' ' broad money " aggregates fell by almost $ 50bn in July , the biggest one - month fall since modern records began in 1959 .
" Monthly data for July show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed , " said Gabriel Stein , the group 's leading monetary economist . "
( Ambrose Evans - Pritchard , " Sharp US Money Supply contraction points to a Wall Street crunch ahead " , UK Telegraph )
The Telegraph confirms what many of the doomsayers have been saying for more than a year now ; we 're facing a severe bout of deflation .
The persistent credit - drain from rising foreclosures and deleveraging financial institutions is shrinking the money supply .
Now it 's visible in the data .
Bernanke 's low interest rates have n't stopped the hemorrhaging ; deflation is spreading like Kudzu .
According to Evans - Pritchard , " The growth in bank loans has turned negative " ( while ) " the overall debt burden in the US economy is currently at record levels , raising concerns that a recession - if it occurs - could set off a sharp downward spiral . "
The under - capitalized banking system has slowed its lending and consumers have stopped borrowing ; all the main economic indicators are pointing down .
In fact , according to the Conference Board , " weakness among the leading indicators continues to be widespread " and dropped more than 0.7 % in July alone .
The report is a composite of selected indicators that show the overall direction of the economy .
At present , they 're all in negative territory .
The Fed lowered interest rates to 2 per cent hoping to help recapitalize the banks and stimulate consumer spending , but it has n't worked .
The banks still do n't have the capacity to lend , so the main artery for credit distribution remains clogged and GDP is dropping off .
A python has wrapped itself around the financial system and is gradually cutting - off the oxygen supply .
Naturally , when the credit system is broken , the money supply contracts .
That 's true here , too .
What 's troubling is the speed at which it is all of this is taking place .
It 's " the biggest one - month fall since modern records began in 1959 " .
The process is accelerating and will require the Fed to slash rates at its September meeting .
Economist Nouriel Roubini puts it like this :
" Over time inflation will be the last problem that the Fed will have to face as a severe US recession and global slowdown will lead to a sharp reduction in inflationary pressures in the U.S. : slack in goods markets with demand falling below supply will reduce pricing power of firms ; slack in labor markets with unemployment rising will reduce wage pressures and labor costs pressures ; a fall in commodity prices of the order of 30 % will further reduce inflationary pressure .
The Fed will have to cut the Fed Funds rate much more as severe downside risks to growth and to financial stability will dominate any short - term upward inflationary pressures .
Leaving aside the risk of a collapse of the US dollar given this easier monetary policy the Fed Funds rate may end up being closer to 0 % than 1 % by the end of this financial crisis and severe recession cycle . "
Interest rates are going down not up as the futures market believes .
Federal Reserve chief Bernanke understands the problem , but has no way to fix it .
The market is simply correcting from massive credit imbalances .
The economy needs time to cool off and rebalance .
Bernanke 's various " auction facilities " were created to keep the banking system afloat while the government delivered " stimulus checks " to working people .
The plan was designed to bypass the dysfunctional banking system and give money directly to taxpayers .
Unfortunately , the strategy failed and added to the bulging fiscal deficits .
Martin Feldstein summed it up like this in the Wall Street Journal :
" Recent government statistics show that only between 10 % and 20 % of the rebate dollars were spent .
The rebates added nearly $ 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than $ 20 billion to consumer spending ....
Here are the facts .
Tax rebates of $ 78 billion arrived in the second quarter of the year .
The government 's recent GDP figures show that the level of consumer outlays only rose by an extra $ 12 billion , or 15 % of the lost revenue .
The rest went into savings , including the paydown of debt .... Consumer outlays increased to $ 36 billion from $ 24 billion .
So the additional $ 12 billion of consumer spending was less than 16 % of the extra $ 76 billion of disposable personal income .
By comparison , savings rose by $ 62 billion , or five times as much .... This experience confirms earlier studies showing that one - time tax rebates are not a cost - effective way to increase economic activity . "
The whole " stimulus " plan backfired .
Americans did the responsible thing and used the money to pay off debts or stash it in savings instead of than wasting it Walmart or Target on more useless knick - knacks .
It just goes to show that average working people can change their spending habits and making prudent choices when they see that times are tough .
The culture of consumerism is the result of Madison Ave. saturation - campaigns and propaganda ; there 's nothing inherently wrong with the American people .
Workers are constantly being blamed for " living beyond their means " , but the real problem originates from flawed monetary policy and destructive commercialism .
It 's the prevailing " sicko " corporate culture that has created a nation of spendthrifts and speculators .
Ordinary people are not at fault .
Fiscal stimulus can work if it is used properly , like if it was applied to the payroll tax .
That would be the same as giving every working man and woman in America a sizable raise in pay that could used to give the economy a boost .
( Couples making under $ 70,000 per year spend 100 % of their earnings .
They represent 50 % of total GDP )
The problem , however , is that that would violate a central tenet of neoliberalism which dictates that the payroll tax be used in the General Fund as a de facto flat tax levied against the poor and middle class to ensure that the ruling elite do n't not have to pay their fair share for the maintenance of the empire .
Bush and his ilk would rather run the economy off a cliff than compromise on their core values .
The real reason we are faced with the current economic downturn is because wages have not kept pace with production which means that workers have had to increase their borrowing to maintain their same standard of living and keep the economy growing .
If wages are flat the economy can't grow ; it 's as simple as that .
That 's why banking elites have lowered standards for lending ; it 's just a way to generate profits and create growth without giving workers the raise they deserve .
It has the added benefit of pushing people into a life of debt - peonage .
Americans are deeper in debt than anytime in history and are struggling just to make the interest payments on their loans .
As a result , more and more homeowners are walking away from their mortgages and leaving the banks with huge , unanticipated debts .
The architects of America 's debt - slavery system are turning out to be its biggest victims .
Currently , billions of dollars are disappearing in the secondary market where bets were placed on mortgage - backed securities that are now virtually worthless .
As market volatility increases , frazzled investors are moving into cash .
Credit is being wrung from the system while the money supply continues to contract .
Mike Shedlock of Mish 's Global Economic Trend Analysis gives this technical analysis :
" The recent plunge in M3 ( ed.--M3 is the broadest measure of money used by economists to estimate the entire supply of money ) makes it likely that credit lines have been fully tapped and / or banks have simply turned off the spigot .
Liquidity shrinks by the day .
Banks scrambling to refinance long - term debt are going to have a very tough go of it .
Weekly unemployment claims are soaring .
Consumers out of a job are going to have a tough time paying bills .
Those looking for a bottom in these conditions are simply barking up the wrong tree . "
The prospects of a deep and protracted downturn are now greater than ever .
Financial institutions are either pulling back and preparing for the storm ahead or taking advantage of existing credit lines while they last .
The herky - jerky market action suggests that a growing number of CEOs and CFOs can see that the walls are closing in on them .
The crash - alert flag is about half - way up the pole .
Author Ellen Hodgson Brown 's new book " The Web of Debt " , points out some of the parallels some between our present predicament and events leading up to the Great Depression :
" The problem began in the Roaring Twenties when the Fed made money plentiful by keeping interest rates low .
Money seemed to be plentiful , but what was actually flowing freely was ' credit ' or ' debt ' .
Production was up more than wages , so more goods were available than money to pay for them ; but people could borrow .
... Money was so easy to get that people were borrowing just to invest , taking out short - term , low interest loans that were readily available from the banks " .
Sound familiar ?
Brown continues : " The Fed began selling securities in the open market , reducing the money supply by reducing the reserves available for backing loans ..
The result was a huge liquidity squeeze --- a lack of available money .
Short - term loans suddenly became available only at much higher interest rates , making buying stock on margin much less attractive .
As fewer people bought , stock prices fell , removing the incentive for new buyers to purchase stocks bought by earlier buyers on margin ... The stock market crashed overnight . "
The money supply contracted dramatically during the first few years of the Great Depression .
Free - market guru , Milton Friedman , went so far as to blame the Central Bank for the disaster .
He said , " The Federal Reserve definitely caused the Great Depression by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one - third from 1929 to 1933 . "
As a result , interest rates rose and credit became scarcer .
To some extent , these things are taking place already .
Long - term interest rates and LIBOR have been rising and are headed higher .
These are much more accurate gages of the " real " price of credit than the Fed 's artificial Fed Funds Rate ( 2 per cent ) which is just a give - away to the banks .
Brown does a good job of connecting the dots and showing how the Federal Reserve engineered the Depression with their failed monetary policies and serial bubble making .
In another chapter , she quotes Louis T. McFadden , Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee , who is explicit in his condemnation of the Fed :
( The Depression ) was not accidental .
It was a carefully contrived occurrence .
... The international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all " .
( Ellen Hodgson Brown ; " The Web of Debt " , page 146 )
Whether the present economic crisis was deliberate or not is irrelevant .
The ultimate responsibility for our economic woes lies with the Fed ; that 's who created the speculative bubble that is now wreaking havoc on the broader economy .
Millions of people will lose their homes , trillions of dollars of equity will be wiped out , and hundreds of banks will fail .
Eventually , there will be more consolidation among the banks and greater concentration of wealth among fewer people .
An self - regulated system run by unelected businessmen naturally gravitates towards monopoly and , yes , tyranny .
Charles Lindbergh summed up the role of the Federal Reserve like this :
" The financial system has been turned over to ... a purely profiteering group .
The system is private , conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other people 's money . "
( Ellen Hodgson Brown ; " The Web of Debt " )
The impending global recession has nothing to do with crafty mortgage lenders , opportunistic loan applicants , dodgy rating agencies , or crooked home appraisers .
That 's like blaming Lindy England for Abu Ghraib .
The source of the troubles is the Federal Reserve and monetary policies that are designed to rob people of their life savings .
Abolish the Fed .

The Conservative government 's " clear anti-abortion hidden agenda " has led to an erosion of a woman 's right to the procedure , a coalition of women 's rights activists said Thursday .
The groups — including the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada , the Canadian Labour Congress and the Ottawa Coalition to End Violence Against Women — held a news conference in Ottawa on Thursday to call on all party leaders and candidates to openly state their views on the topic .
The groups issued a scathing criticism of the federal Conservatives ' past 2 ½ years in power , citing several examples they see as the party 's attempt to reduce women 's reproductive rights .
" There is a clear anti-abortion hidden agenda at work that is putting women 's health at risk , " said Carolyn Egan of the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada .
" We refer to it as anti-choice by stealth . "
One of the groups ' key concerns is a private member 's bill introduced by Conservative backbencher Ken Epp last year that they believe would have enshrined fetal rights .
The draft Unborn Victims of Crime Act , bill C - 484 , sought to toughen punishments when a fetus is injured or killed during an attack on a pregnant woman .
In August , Justice Minister Rob Nicholson said he would replace it with new legislation — which ultimately was never tabled in the House of Commons — to allow judges to consider a victim 's pregnancy when determining a sentence , but that " leaves no room for the introduction of fetal rights . "
Barbara Byers of the Canadian Labour Congress said she was " suspicious and cynical " that Prime Minister Stephen Harper understood the implications of bill C - 484 , since he 's known for the tight control he keeps over his MPs .
" Do n't tell me and try to convince me that he did n't realize that [ Epp 's bill ] would be chipping away at women 's rights and was n't a backdoor way to get what he wants , " Byers said .
The groups also questioned why the federal government wo n't enforce the Canada Health Act after a New Brunswick clinic refused to pay for abortions .
New Brunswick remains the only province in Canada that wo n't pay for abortions done in clinics .
In a 1988 Supreme Court of Canada ruling , the high court struck down Canada 's abortion law as unconstitutional , allowing abortion to be treated like any other medical procedure .
" If they are in truth supportive of women 's access to abortion , why will they not act and enforce the Canada Health Act ?
I find it very cynical that they are unwilling to do it , " Egan said .
Asked by reporters about his stance , Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion said he is pro-choice but added that all leaders but one have been clear on their position on the issue .
" [ Harper ] has to make his view clear , because Canadians have the right to know , " Dion said .
The federal election takes place on Oct. 14 .
Bill would ban suspicionless laptop searches Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 29 , 2008
Print This Email This Bill would require ' reasonable suspicion ' before DHS electronics search
Any customs agent who wants to go poking around your laptop 's hard drive is going to need a legitimate reason to do so , if legislation proposed Monday is adopted .
As it stands , the Department of Homeland Security has virtually unfettered authority to search , copy and archive the contents of laptops , cell phones and digital cameras travelers carry into the US .
Sen .
Russ Feingold wants to change that .
Feingold ( D - WI ) , who has criticized DHS 's policy , introduced the Travelers Privacy Protection Act along with Sen. Maria Cantwell ( D - WA ) and Rep. Adam Smith ( D - WA ) .
 Most Americans would be shocked to learn that upon their return to the U.S. from traveling abroad , the government could demand the password to their laptop , hold it for as long as it wants , pore over their documents , emails , and photographs , and examine which websites they visited  all without any suggestion of wrong - doing ,  Feingold said .
" Focusing our limited law enforcement resources on law - abiding Americans who present no basis for suspicion does not make us any safer and is a gross violation of privacy .
This bill will bring the governments practices at the border back in line with the reasonable expectations of law - abiding Americans . 
Last year , DHS reversed a two - decade old policy that required reasonable suspicion before Customs and Border Patrol agents could search a travelers ' documents , including the contents of laptops , cell phones , digital cameras and other devices .
The new policy also made it easier for DHS to share information it collected with other law enforcement agencies , a provision civil liberties advocates could let those agencies use DHS to conduct warrantless searches on their behalf and subvert the Fourth Amendment .
Feingold 's legislation would require " reasonable suspicion of illegal activity " before DHS agents could search travelers ' electronics , and it would prohibit the agency from holding onto the electronics or copies of files for more than 24 hours without a warrant .
It also limits what DHS could share with other agencies .
Civil liberties advocates hailed the legislation 's introduction .
 Congress cannot allow DHS and CBP to turn our borders into Constitution - free zones ,  added Timothy Sparapani , ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel .
 Americans have the constitutional right to privacy , and that includes the sensitive and personal information we keep on electronic devices .
DHS has been rolling back these privacy safeguards , and doing so without proper oversight and public review .
Senator Feingolds much - needed bill seeks to restore our fundamental protections .
Furthermore , it allows for overdue congressional oversight and a public discussion concerning our border security . 
The bill also would prohibit profiling visitors based on their race , ethnicity , religion or country of origin .
Amir Khan , an American citizen of Pakistani descent , previously told Raw Story that he has been singled out for additional screening every single time he has returned to the US from trips to Europe or Pakistan .
The California resident estimates he has been detained for at least 20 hours , during which his laptop and books were examined by border agents .
" I asked many times , ' What can I do to resolve this ? ' " he said .
" They told me there 's nothing I can do . "
DHS revealed the expanded authority granted to Customs and Border Patrol Agents earlier this summer in documents released in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by two civil liberties groups .
The agency also previously released its border search policy following to a subcommittee hearing on the laptop searches this summer .
No one from the agency would show up to explain the policy during the hearing before the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution , which Feingold chairs .
WHEN the erotic lesbian magazine On Our Backs filed for bankruptcy in May , Susie Bright could not help but feel a sense of loss .
Not only because , as the first editor of the magazine , she had put six years of time and effort into it before leaving in 1991 , Ms. Bright said recently , but because , to her , On Our Backs symbolized a rebellious assertion of female sexuality that she sees as lacking in today 's lesbian publications .
'' On Our Backs was very defiant , saying , ' We 're queer and we 're sexual , ' '' she said .
'' I do n't get the political hit from the current spate of lesbian magazines that I did from On Our Backs .
You do n't have that kind of revolutionary vision of , ' My God , we 're changing the world . ' ''
On Our Backs has been given a second life : in October , it was bought by HAF Enterprises , which also publishes Girlfriends , a two - and - a - half - year - old lesbian magazine published every other month in San Francisco .
Heather Findlay , the editor in chief of Girlfriends , said she and her mother -- Erin Findlay , the publisher of Girlfriends -- expect to resume publication of On Our Backs in 1998 .
Although more established gay publications like Out and The Advocate are aimed at both men and women , the readers of these magazines remain largely male .
Indeed , most gay publications are still geared to a gay male audience .
As a result , it is still relatively new for lesbians to have magazines of their own .
'' Because lesbians have been underserved in the national gay press , women have not known to even look for themselves in those magazines , '' Sarah Petit , the editor in chief of Out magazine , said .
'' There is a whole market of women out there who have the same niche potential that these gay men do . ''
Jewish leaders in the US today predicted a big turnout among Jews in the November presidential election in favour of Barack Obama in spite of suspicion about his views on Iran and the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Ira Forman , executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council , an advocacy group with strong links to the Democratic party , said : " I think Obama will win the Jewish vote by a large margin .
The question is how much ? "
Rabbi David Saperstein , director of the Religious Action Centre of Reform Judaism , said American Jews ' traditional political affinity with African Americans , born of a shared experience of discrimination and the struggles of the civil rights era , could outstrip concerns among some Jewish voters that Obama is not pro-Israel enough .
" There is a great deal of pride and excitement about this moment in history as we see this real possibility of seeing a black president , " he said .
Obama 's visit to Israel is partly to counter criticism from his Republican rival , John McCain , that he lacks foreign policy experience but it is also to shore up support among Jews in the US .
Although they make up only 3 % of the electorate , Jews have been historically important , mainly as activists in the Democratic party and as generous donors .
Unlike young voters and African - Americans who have in the past turned out in low numbers - but are both predicted to turn out in large numbers for Obama this time - Jews are dependable about casting their ballots .
Jews tend to be overwhelmingly Democrats , with 65 % identifying themselves as Democratic or leaning Democratic , according to a June survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , compared to 23 % who identify as Republican or leaning Republican .
A Gallup poll in April put Obama on 61 % to 32 % for McCain .
Forman said that while Jews are concentrated in places such as New York and California , which both vote Democratic anyway , there were also large numbers in states where the outcome is not as predictable : Florida , Ohio , Colorado , Pennsylvania , Nevada , Michigan and Wisconsin .
Forman acknowledged that African Americans and young voters are likely to defy past experience by turning out in large numbers for Obama but his campaign team would still be looking for Jewish votes .
" When you are running a political campaign , you always make the assumption it will be a close race and you have to turn out all your constituencies heavily , " Forman said .
Saperstein said Obama has been able to diffuse some of worries about his commitment to Israel , in part through his speech last month at a conference in Washington of the American Israel Political Affairs Committee , in which he promised that Jerusalem would be the undivided capital of Israel , even though he qualified this the next day to say this would be dependent on final negotiations with the Palestinians , who also claim it as their capital .

TERRE HAUTE , Indiana ( Reuters ) - Presidential nominees John McCain and Barack Obama will appear together on Sept. 11 in New York at the site where the World Trade Center collapsed after being hit by hijacked planes in 2001 .
“ All of us came together on 9/11 -- not as Democrats or Republicans -- but as Americans .
In smoke - filled corridors and on the steps of the Capitol ; at blood banks and at vigils -- we were united as one American family , ” the two senators said in a joint statement issued on Saturday .
“ On Thursday , we will put aside politics and come together to renew that unity , to honor the memory of each and every American who died , and to grieve with the families and friends who lost loved ones . ”
The event will mark the first time McCain , the Republican nominee , and Obama , the Democratic one , will appear together since they were nominated to run in the November 4 presidential election .
The two have rarely appeared together during the campaign .
McCain had challenged Obama to a series of town hall meetings but the details could not be worked out and they were never held .
The two briefly were on the same stage at Saddleback Church in California last month but the moment lasted just long enough for a few pictures to be taken .
The two men will join on Thursday in an anniversary commemoration at Ground Zero , the site where the World Trade towers once stood .
Nearly 3,000 people died on Sept. 11 in hijacked airplanes that were crashed into the World Trade Center , the Pentagon and in an Pennsylvania field .
“ We will also give thanks for the firefighters , police and emergency responders who set a heroic example of selfless service , and for the men and women who serve today in defense of the freedom and security that came under attack in New York City , at the Pentagon , and in Shanksville , Pennsylvania , ” the statement said .
The CDC yesterday updated their report on recent cases of measles .
In 2000 , thanks to the aggressive vaccination program , measles was declared eradicated from the US .
There continued to be on average 63 cases per year from 2001 - 2007 due to imported cases from outside the US .
To ironically quote Jim Carrey from the aptly titled , A Series of Unfortunate Events – “ Then the unthinkable happened . ”
The anti-vaccination movement was given a boost by actress Jenny McCarthy , who was convinced that vaccines were responsible for her son ’s apparent autism .
She was later joined in her crusade by her boyfriend , Jim Carrey .
The movement had already been gaining some traction over false fears that thimerosal in vaccines ( although mostly removed by 2002 ) was linked to autism .
Such fears had already caused a drop in vaccination rates in the UK with subsequent measles outbreaks .
Now these irrational fears were coming to the US , helped along by scientifically - illiterate pretty - people .
Due to the high - profile nonsense being spread by the antivaccinationists and the “ mercury militia , ” vaccination rates in the US have now dipped also ( although not nearly as much as in the UK ) .
Overall rates remain high , but there are pockets of low vaccination rates in communities where vaccine fears have spread .
Such communities have dropped below the herd immunity level of vaccination and are susceptible to outbreaks .
The latest numbers from the CDC show that 131 cases have been reported in the US so far this year – extrapolating that is about 4 times the rate of the previous seven years .
Of these cases 15 were hospitalized and no deaths were reported .
Most importantly , 91 % of the cases were in those who were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status .
Only 9 % were in those known to be vaccinated .
These statistics show two things – it is clearly the drop in vaccination rates that is resulting in the return of this disease ; and because the vaccine is not 100 % effective , even those who do get vaccinated are at increased risk of infection because of those who choose not to .
We all depend upon and benefit from herd immunity – so the Jenny McCarthy brigade has caused harm to innocent bystanders .
The idiocy of antivaccinationists partly rests upon the modern luxury of never having had to live through the horrible epidemics of the past .
I wonder how much the current generation will have to suffer through before they get it .
And I will say it again – if Jenny McCarthy is going to put her own “ mommy instinct ” before the consensus of scientific opinion , and exploit her dubious celebrity to champion anti-science , then she is going to have to take responsibility for her actions .
The way I figure it , so far there are at least 68 measles cases on her tally sheet , and the number is growing .

Need you ’re help
Bright Greetings Dear American :
I need to ask you to support an urgent secret business relationship with a transfer of funds of great magnitude .
I am Ministry of Treasury of the Republic of America .
My country has had a crisis that has caused the need for a large transfer of funds of 700 billion dollars US .
If you would assist me in this transfer , it would be most profitable to you .
I am working with renowned Mr. Phil Gram , lobbyist for UBS , who will be my replacement as Ministry of Treasury in January .
As a Senator , you may know him as the leader of the American banking deregulation movement in the 1990s .
This transactin is 100 % safe .
This is a matter of great urgency .
We need a blank check .
We need the funds as quickly as possible .
We cannot directly transfer these funds in the names of our close friends because we are constantly under surveillance .
My family lawyer advised me that I should look for reliable and trustworthy person who will act as a next of kin so the funds can be transferred .
Please reply with all of your bank account , IRA and college fund account numbers and those of your children and grandchildren to wallstreetbailout@treasury.gov so that we transfer your commission for this transaction .
After I receive you ’re information , I will respond with detailed information about safeguards that will be used to protect the funds .
Wonderful salutations to you cherish friend from Republic of America .
Yours Faithfully Minister of Treasury Paulson

ANCHORAGE , Alaska --
An informal adviser who has counseled Gov. Sarah Palin on ethics issues urged her in July to apologize for her handling of the dismissal of the state 's public safety commissioner and warned that the matter could snowball into a bigger scandal .
He also said , in a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal , that she should fire any aides who had raised concerns with the chief over a state trooper who was involved in a bitter divorce with the governor 's sister .
In the letter , written before Sen . John McCain picked the Alaska governor as his running mate , former U.S. Attorney Wevley Shea warned Gov. Palin that " the situation is now grave " and recommended that she and her husband , Todd Palin , apologize for " overreaching or perceived overreaching " for using her position to try to get Trooper Mike Wooten fired from the force .
Mr. Shea was acting on his own in writing the letter , with no official capacity .
In late 2006 , Gov. Palin asked him to co-write an ethics report for Gov. Palin with then - House Democratic leader Ethan Berkowitz that recommended new financial - disclosure rules for elected and appointed officials in the statehouse .
That report served as a key document for the ethics bill she later signed into law .
After his initial letter in July , Mr. Shea followed up with another letter , dated Aug. 4 , in which he told Gov. Palin that she probably could n't legally shun a legislative investigation into the firing of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan .
Esquire 's October edition , featuring the e-ink cover we , ahem , covered in July , has hit the newsstands .
Blogger Ryan Joseph found one in Borders , snapped it up and posted a video so those of us unlucky enough to miss out on the 100,000 print run can enjoy the annoying ad - platform of the future .
So how does it look ?
Actually , terrible .
Instead of a full e-ink cover , we get a small rectangle with some blinking text .
Inside , the magazine 's sponsor , Ford , has similarly defaced a regular print - ad with a rectangle of mis-matched colors .
The " moving " car picture we were expecting turns out to be nothing more than a blinking highlight which moves in three stages across the image .
Way to go , Esquire .
If you want to fight off the inevitable death of the print magazine at the hands of the internet , do n't do it by emulating the worst aspect of the web – Flash banner ads .
Esquire's E Ink Cover A 21st Century Flop [ Wired - Epicenter ]
Esquire October 2008 E - Ink Issue ! [ Dastardly Report via Engadget ]
Imagine you wrote a new Web server that did n't support concurrency and could n't do multiple things at the same time .
Consequently , each new Web request would run serially .
Sure , it would be simple to implement , but a single , long - running request could block the entire Web server !
A request involving a query against the database that takes two minutes to complete would mean that no one else could access the Web server during those two minutes .
When thinking of concurrency , it 's useful to distinguish between I/O throughput and CPU throughput .
Does the problem involve lots of concurrent requests , or does it involve lots of data to crunch ?
This distinction is important because some techniques work better for one than the other .
However , sometimes this distinction is blurred .
Threads try to address both of these problems .
In this article , I focus on I/O throughput .
Approaches to Multitasking
Let 's start with some basics .
The kernel clearly needs to support concurrency in order to run multiple applications at the same time .
Operating systems use time slicing to share one CPU among many programs .
If each program gets a small slice of the CPU 's time , the question is , how do they take turns ?
In non-preemptive schedulers , each program must explicitly " yield " the CPU to the other programs .
This is called " cooperative multitasking " because the programs have to cooperate with each other by yielding the CPU .
Macintosh OS 9 used a non-preemptive scheduler .
These days , most GUI libraries and JavaScript use this same technique to share the CPU among many " things " competing for it .
One downside to this technique is that if one program gets wedged in an infinite loop , the whole system goes down .
On the other hand , because the programs yield to each other in predictable ways , it 's easier to reason about cooperative multitasking ; that is , it 's more deterministic .
Kernels that use preemptive schedulers simply interrupt ( I 'm mostly using the English meaning of the term " interrupt " , not the computer science meaning ) when it 's time for one program to be replaced by another .
The interruption is caused by a hardware timer .
By and large , the program can be completely unaware that it was even interrupted .
UNIX and Windows NT use this technique .
Hence , so do Linux , OS X , and Windows XP .
Unlike non-preemptive schedulers , preemptive schedulers can interrupt a program even if it 's wedged in an infinite loop .
Consequently , a wedged program can't bring down the whole system .
Locking
Imagine some ancient banking software with multiple programs trying to write data to a single file .
Example 1 is what I like to call the canonical " race " condition .
Process
A sees that John 's balance is $ 25 Process B sees that John 's balance is $ 25 Process A deducts $ 25 and sets balance to $ 0 Process B deducts $ 25 and sets balance to $ 0 John gets a free $ 25 .... which he promptly loses on a horse race ;)
Clearly , when you have multiple programs accessing the same data , some additional cooperation is required .
This is done via locking .
In the pre-Python 2.5 days , using a lock required a try / finally statement to acquire and release the lock .
These days , Python 2.5's with syntax makes this task really convenient ; see Example 2 .
with lock : if balance > amt : deduct ( amt ) else : raise ValueError ( ' Insufficient funds ' )
By the way , it 's easy to wrap this technique in a function decorator called synchronized to write Java - esque code ; see Example 3 .
@synchronized def update_account (... ) : ...
Once you introduce locks to protect shared data , the question becomes :
What should you protect , and how many locks do you need ?
If you use a single lock that wraps everything , then no concurrency is possible .
Clearly , it can get better than that .
Using a single lock to protect all the critical sections is called " coarse - grained locking . "
FreeBSD 4 and Python both use this technique .
In FreeBSD 4 , the lock was called " giant " , and in Python it 's called the " global interpreter lock " ( the " GIL " ) .
Using multiple locks that each protect a specific resource during critical sections is called " fine - grained locking . "
FreeBSD 5 and up use fine - grained locking .
BeOS was famous for how fine - grained its locking was .
Thanks to its careful fine - grained locking , BeOS was well suited to high concurrency .
It was far better than other operating systems of its time at doing things such as playing multiple videos concurrently .
While fine - grained locking has some real benefits , it 's harder to implement .
Furthermore , it can be more expensive to constantly acquire and release a bunch of small locks than to simply acquire and release a single large lock .
By the way , there has been research done on " lockless data structures " .
Usually , if you wish to update a hash atomically , you need to use a lock or else a race condition can lead to malformed data .
However , there exists a hash implementation that can be updated atomically without the use of a lock .
It 's possible that these techniques may be increasingly important in the future .
Since somewhere in 2013 , Valve made some backward - incompatible changes to the way Source Mods work .
Thanks to Hardtimes and d10 sfan on steamcommunity.com , there is now a hotfix / patch to make the mod playable again .

Discontinued support
Sorry for the inconvenience but support for Portal : Prelude is no longer provided .
We are aware that there is some problems running the game with the free version of Portal on Windows but there 's nothing we can do .
Valve replied to someone by saying : No Source mods are included with the free Promotional Offer [...]
These mods are only included with Valve games purchased through Steam or from a retail store .
You must purchase a Source game included in this list .
There might be a solution here and there , but it 's a bit tricky .
If you 're looking for help , head over the forums which are still working and up to date !
This mod was released in 2008 and we all moved in favor of other projects or totally stopped working around modding .
This website itself is no longer maintained since Google dropped most of the features of Blogger in May 2010 and we can't update it anymore without a major overhaul ( which is not going to happen ) .
Mac users , read this !
Portal : Prelude was never supposed to work on Mac .
Valve ported their Source Engine under Mac OS without telling anyone and especially not me ( which seems fair anyway ) .
Now I do n't have the time , motivation and knowledge to port the game to Mac myself , but I can provide you with a zipped version and instructions on how to make it work .
The free Mac version of Portal suffers from the same problems than the free Windows version ( see above ) .
It 's a bit tricky but so far it worked when we tested it on a Macbook .

Happy Birthday Portal : Prelude !
Posted by Nicolas ( permalink )
Today , it 's been exactly one year since we first released Portal : Prelude .
It was a hell of a year , but even if there 's still some people discovering or playing the mod for the first time right now as I write , things highly cooled down .
We tried to calculate the total download count , but this is just too hard to do after one year .
Some websites have gone down , some websites do n't count downloads , some others resetted their counters and some did n't even changed for a few months .
There was an approximate additionnal 200,000 downloads during the last 25 weeks , which means people still download the mod on an average basis of 1150 times a day .
That 's still a good score .
According to statistics and extrapolations , the mod was approximately downloaded 1,000,000 times since the release .
But that still does n't count magazines , sharing websites and peer to peer softwares , which probably represent at least 50 % more players .
I guess you , people , liked what we did .
So , thanks , and if you do n't get what I 'm talking about , refer yourself to the ' Reminder ' article .

Reminder Posted by Nicolas ( permalink )
For the few of you that are still arriving on this website for the first time , welcome !
Take your time to understand what 's going on via the links on the right and feel free to download the mod if you wish .
Dont forget that there 's a FAQ answering most if not all of the most common questions I received by e-mail during the last months .
Remember , to play the game , you need Portal , this is not a standalone game , and the mod wo n't appear in your Steam games list if :
You do n't own Portal at all .
You never launched Portal from Steam .
You 're using a pirated version of Portal .
You did n't install the mod properly ( unlikely since it 's automated )
Anyway , thanks for passing by and feel free to talk about the mod in the forums if you wish .
But please , be polite , be efficient .
It 's been almost 9 months since the mod was first released and I 'm now working on something else .
Sorry if it takes me a while to do some support or reply to your messages .

Cheaters aboard !
Posted by Nicolas ( permalink )
A week ago , I praised our new player , Stimich , who managed to break almost all the time trial records on Portal : Prelude .
Today , it has come to my hears that there could be a problem .
Some fellow speedrunners warned me about some suspicious details on Stimich 's videos and I decided to give it a little investigation .
After a few hours of research on the Internet with my friend Google and with the help of one of the former Prelude record holder , I indeed found quite a few suspicious details .
First , this guy is commenting out on a video named " How To Cheat In Portal Without Cheating " where he actually states that he 's trying to cheat .
Then you can find all of his Portal time trials on some weird website named " Cheat Grabber " .
And finally , when you take the time to download and decode his time trial videos , there 's a problem .
Here 's a random part of his video where he 's just moving his aim from the ceiling to the ground in order to shoot a portal .
As you can see , in a normal situation , it takes something like 8 to 10 frames to move like this .
But at the beginning of his video of the 12th room , there 's a little problem .
On this section , he 's moving the same way almost 4 times during half the time needed .
He 's even changing his aim from front to behind in one frame .
I slowed it down to 1 fps and one of the shots he turned and shot in 1 fps and then the next frame he was aiming directly back where he was before .
This is just impossible to achieve , even with superhuman powers .
This cheat can be categorized as a Tool Assisted Speedrun and it's such a shame that people are trying to cheat us for no reason on a free mod .
That 's not like if there was some prize for the winner .
On this Youtube page , you can find a demonstration of a Tool Assisted Speedrun , and as you can see it 's perfectly invisible for the game , but not for the eye .
As a conclusion , all of Stimich 's scores are going to be deleted from the ladder and replaced with the previous ones .
Stimich is also banned from any future ladder entry , unless he proves his innocence .

A challenger appears !
Posted by Nicolas ( permalink )
For those of you who are n't really fond of scores and speed runs and do n't regularly follow our challenges ladder either , be advised that there was some huge changes recently .
During the last months , the scores were somewhat freezed and nothing changed significantly .
But a newcomer appeared two week ago and now , he 's slowly crushing every score , beating 10 time trials out of 14 .
As you can see , Stimich seems to know how to think with portals more than anyone else .
This run is particularly impressive .
If you think you can stand up to him , feel free to try , but I think we reached some physical limits around these scores .
I do n't think someone will be able to do much better , apart if we 're talking about some bots playing Portal : Prelude , of course .
