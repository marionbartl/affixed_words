Once again everyone is hyperventilating over " secret " moves to trade oil in currencies other than the US dollar .
Please consider
The demise of the dollar by Robert Fisk .
In the most profound financial change in recent Middle East history , Gulf Arabs are planning – along with China , Russia , Japan and France – to end dollar dealings for oil , moving instead to a basket of currencies including the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan , the euro , gold and a new , unified currency planned for nations in the Gulf Co-operation Council , including Saudi Arabia , Abu Dhabi , Kuwait and Qatar .
Secret meetings have already been held by finance ministers and central bank governors in Russia , China , Japan and Brazil to work on the scheme , which will mean that oil will no longer be priced in dollars .
The Americans , who are aware the meetings have taken place – although they have not discovered the details – are sure to fight this international cabal which will include hitherto loyal allies Japan and the Gulf Arabs .
Against the background to these currency meetings , Sun Bigan , China 's former special envoy to the Middle East , has warned there is a risk of deepening divisions between China and the US over influence and oil in the Middle East .
" Bilateral quarrels and clashes are unavoidable , " he told the Asia and Africa Review .
" We cannot lower vigilance against hostility in the Middle East over energy interests and security . "
Ten Simple Facts

Iran announced late last month that its foreign currency reserves would henceforth be held in euros rather than dollars .

How Different Age Groups Celebrate Halloween
A comic about how everyone celebrates Halloween .
A curious experiment has given scientists an unprecedented look into the human brain as it goes about a vital and everyday task : processing and speaking words .
The study , published in Science , found that the brain carries out three steps of the task in about half a second , and that all the activity happens sequentially in the same small brain region , known as Broca 's area .
The researchers took advantage of a rare procedure
in which epilepsy patients allow doctors to implant dozens of electrodes directly into their brains .
While they are awake , the patients answer questions so that doctors can determine which parts of the brain are necessary to maintain language and which parts can be safely removed to treat epileptic seizures [ Los Angeles Times ] .
Three such patients agreed to take part in the language experiment , were given long lists of verbs , and were asked to change some of them to the past or present tense before saying them out loud .
The electrodes picked up regular pulses of activity in the brain region
called Broca 's area , which lies beneath the left temple .
The area of the brain is named after a 19th century physician named Pierre Paul Broca , who became famous for his study of two patients who could n't speak [ NPR News ] .
While neuroscientists have long believed Broca 's area plays an important role in speech , they 've previously had little luck in determining exactly what goes on inside the brain region , since standard brain scans like fMRIs do n't have enough resolution .
Electrical activity spiked 200 milliseconds , 320 milliseconds and 450 milliseconds after being presented with a new word .
The researchers concluded that those peaks corresponded to the times when the brain decided on the appropriate word to use , picked the proper grammatical form , and figured out how to pronounce it [ Los Angeles Times ] .
The findings negate a previous theory that Broca 's area is involved only in speaking , and another region , Wernicke ’s area , handles reading and hearing .

The yellowish orange Indian spice turmeric , used to flavor curries , contains a remarkable phytochemical known as curcumin -- and this natural substance is the target of feverish research across a spectrum of medical disciplines .
The reason ?
Curcumin has shown remarkable promise in helping the human body in a wide variety of ways .
For example , as NaturalNews has previously reported , it may prevent Alzheimer 's Disease ( https://www.naturalnews.com/026861_curcumin_v... ) and type 2 diabetes ( https://www.naturalnews.com/024644.html ) as well as fight breast and colorectal malignancies ( https://www.naturalnews.com/020527_cancer_cur... ) .
Now research just released at the 2009 American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation ( AAO - HNSF ) annual meeting in San Diego shows curcumin may block nicotine - induced head and neck cancers , even in people who smoke .
According to the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , the majority of head and neck cancers start in cells that line the mucosal surfaces such as the mouth , nose , and throat .
Normal mucosal cells viewed through a microscope look like scales ( squamous ) , so head and neck cancers of this type are labeled head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( HNSCC ) .
However , some head and neck cancers begin in other types of cells ; adenocarcinomas , for example , originate in glandular cells .
In all , the NCI web site states , head and neck cancers account for three to five percent of cancers in the US , with about 40,000 new cases diagnosed each year .
The vast majority , approximately 85 percent of these cancers , are linked to tobacco use .
In a study presented at the AAO - HNSF meeting , researchers pointed out that HNSCC is a serious problem , taking the lives of about 13,000 Americans annually .
What 's more , even if the cancers are successfully treated initially , they often recur because many people continue to smoke .
While nicotine itself has not been shown to directly cause cancer , the scientists noted it can trigger the process that turns normal cells into cancerous ones .
So the researchers looked for a safe food compound that could be used as a bioactive agent to both prevent cancer and to also block the harmful effects of nicotine .
They investigated the effects of curcumin on malignant growths by using a variety of head and neck cancer cell lines .
The HNSCC cells were pre-treated with curcumin in the laboratory and then exposed to nicotine .
Additional curcumin research is also in the news .
Scientists from the Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas in Mexico City published a review in the journalrecently pointing out that along with documented anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidant , anti-fungal , anti-bacterial and anti-cancer properties , curcumin also appears to have the ability to heal liver injuries .
And researchers at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta just reported in the journalthat curcumin " could provide a novel , non-toxic therapy , which could lead to improved survival for patients with triple negative breast cancer . "
Currently , this type of breast cancer is only treated by traditional western medicine with cytotoxic chemotherapy -- and when this treatment fails , as it often does , no other mainstream therapy is available .

Public Record
A number of new articles have been published recently that have highlighted evidence of illegal human experimentation on U.S. - held “ terrorism ” prisoners undergoing torture .
These articles followed the release of a “ white paper ” by Physicians for Human Rights [ PHR ] , A number of new articles have been published recently that have highlighted evidence of illegal human experimentation on U.S. - held “ terrorism ” prisoners undergoing torture .
These articles followed the release of a “ white paper ” by Physicians for Human Rights [ PHR ] , Aiding Torture : Health Professionals ’ Ethics and Human Rights Violations Demonstrated in the May 2004 Inspector General ’s Report
This report looks at those recent charges , and reveals that experiments by a CIA researcher on human subjects undergoing SERE training went unreported in the legal memos the Bush administration drafted to approve their torture program .
It will also connect major military and intelligence figures to the SERE experiments , and tie some of them to major science and “ experimental ” directorates at the CIA and Special Operations Command .
An article by veteran journalist William Fisher , looking at PHR ’s white paper , asks , “ Did physicians and psychologists help the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency develop a new research protocol to assess and refine the use of waterboarding or other harsh interrogation techniques ? ”
A column at Scientific American quotes PHR ’s medical advisor on the subject :
[ PHR ] also raises questions about the ethics of medical note - taking during some of the interrogations .
“ Medical doctors and psychologists colluded with the CIA to keep observational records about waterboarding , which approaches unethical and unlawful human experimentation , ” Scott Allen , lead study author and PHR medical advisor , said in a prepared statement .
Finally , a story in Wednesday ’s UK Guardian discussed the significance of the charges of unlawful human experimention :
Human experimentation without consent has been prohibited in any setting since 1947 , when the Nuremberg Code , which resulted from the prosecution of Nazi doctors , set down 10 sacrosanct principles .
The code states that voluntary consent of subjects is essential and that all unnecessary physical and mental suffering should be avoided .
The Geneva conventions also ban medical experiments on prisoners and prisoners of war , which they describe as “ grave breaches ” .
After describing how “ [ h ] ealth professionals in the Office of Medical Services and psychologist contractors engaged in designing and monitoring ” torture , as “ selecting and then rationalizing ” the use of various harmful interrogation techniques , the PHR report goes on to say :
By requirement , all interrogations were monitored in real - time by health professionals .
Previous reports , including the ICRC report , document allegations that a medical device called a pulse oximeter ( a device to measure oxygen saturation in a subject ’s blood ) was placed on the finger of a detainee to monitor the effectiveness of his respiration during waterboarding .
In this way , medical professionals were used to calibrate physical and mental pain and suffering ….
The possibility that health professionals monitored techniques to assess and improve their effectiveness , constituting possible unethical human experimentation , urgently needs to be thoroughly investigated .
An Experimental “ Battle Lab ”
The CIA ’s Office of Medical Services was supposed to be in charge of monitoring “ detainee ” health under interrogation .
However their instructions , described in an annex to the CIA Inspector General report , exemplifies the dual nature of the “ monitoring , ” as this example from the report shows :
If there is any possibility that ambient temperatures are below the thermoneutral range , they should be monitored and the actual temperatures documented .
[ 2 or 3 redacted lines ]
At ambient temperatures below 18 [ degrees ] C/64 [ degrees ] F , detainees should be monitored for the development of hypothermia .
[ Four redacted paragraphs ]
Rather than make changes to ambient temperatures , to prevent harm to prisoners , medical professionals are instructed to monitor and document the situation .
The torture techniques used by SERE are known to cause endocrine and metabolic disorders ( see section on CIA research below ) , prisoners tortured and subjected to cold are at higher risk of hypothermia , which for a normal person can set in at an ambient temperature of 60 degrees F .
The monitoring in this case seems to be as much about experimentation as it is any concern for a prisoner ’s health .
( For what other possible reason could this section be mostly redacted ? )
Parallels to the experiments on hypothermia by Nazi scientists at Dachau are chilling , as is the fact that some of these scientists were later imported , along with their data , to the United States .
Questions were raised around possible human experimentation in an article last May at Firedoglake on “ The Zubaydah Torture ‘ Experiment " , noting , “ Of the many fascinating details coming out of [ the May 2009 Senate ] Judiciary hearing … the references to the application of an experiment by the ex-SERE CIA contractor , most likely James Mitchell , seemed especially important . ”
The experimentation was not limited to “ high - value ” CIA prisoners .
Last April , another article at Firedoglake reported how the Senate Armed Services Committee report ( PDF ) on prisoner abuse described the creation of an experimental “ battle lab ” at Guantanamo , demonstrating support for the torture program from the main Army intelligence school at Ft. Huachuca .
According to the Levin report , in August 2002 , “ COL John P. Custer , then - assistant commandant of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center and School at Ft. Huachuca , Arizona ” conducted a review of interrogations operations at Guantanamo .
Custer called Guantanamo “ America ’s ‘ Battle Lab ’ ” in the war on terror , and recommended combining FBI and military techniques to extract “ information by exploiting the detainee ’s vulnerabilities . ”
The “ Battle Lab ” label stuck , though some , like Colonel Britt Mallow , of the Criminal Investigative Task Force , objected .
MG Dunlavey and later MG Miller referred to GTMO as a “ Battle Lab ” meaning that interrogations and other procedures there were to some degree experimental , and their lessons would benefit DOD in other places .
While this was logical in terms of learning lessons , I personally objected to the implied philosophy that interrogators should experiment with untested methods , particularly those in which they were not trained .
Later , Dunlavey denied using the term , and Miller testified he could n’t remember .
Pre -9/11 Experiments on SERE Torture
The experiments on the effects of SERE - torture techniques began even earlier — upon SERE trainees themselves .
An April 2009 AlterNet article reported on the history of experimentation on soldier subjects undergoing SERE training .
( SERE is a military program , the acronym standing for Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape . )
The article explained how the Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) and the CIA “ ignored a wealth of other published information about the effects of SERE ’ stress inoculation , ’ ” citing a June 2000 article , “ Assessment of Humans Experiencing Uncontrollable Stress : The SERE Course , ” in Special Warfare ( PDF ) .
Special Warfare is “ The Professional Bulletin of the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School ” ( emphases added to following quote ) :
Results
As shown in the charts on page 7 , SERE stress caused significant changes in students ’ hormone levels .
Recorded changes in cortisol levels were some of the greatest ever documented in humans .
In some cases , the changes noted among the trainees were greater than the changes noted in patients undergoing heart surgery … .
Changes in testosterone levels were similarly remarkable :
In some cases , testosterone dropped from normal levels to castration levels within eight hours .
The Alternet article also quoted from a May 2000 article in Biological Psychiatry , Hormone profiles in humans experiencing military survival training ( emphasis added ) :
Conclusions :
The stress of military survival training produced dramatic alterations in cortisol , percent free cortisol , testosterone , and thyroid indices .
Different types of stressors had varying effects on the neuroendocrine indices .
The degree of neuroendocrine changes observed may have significant implications for subsequent responses to stress .
Looking beyond more than physiological symptoms , other studies have looked at purely psychological data .
Consider this oft - quoted study from the August 2001 edition of the American Journal of Psychiatry , which looked at dissociative symptoms , such as depersonalization , derealization , psychic or emotional numbing , and general cognitive confusion , produced in military subjects exposed to SERE torture techniques ( emphasis added ) :
The current study was designed to assess the nature and prevalence of dissociative symptoms in healthy humans experiencing acute , uncontrollable stress during U.S. Army survival training .
METHOD : In study 1 , 94 subjects completed the Clinician - Administered Dissociative States Scale after exposure to the stress of survival training .
In study 2 , 59 subjects completed the Brief Trauma Questionnaire before acute stress and the dissociative states scale before and after acute stress .
A randomly selected group of subjects in study 2 completed a health problems questionnaire after acute stress .
RESULTS : In study 1 , 96 % of subjects reported dissociative symptoms in response to acute stress .
Total scores , as well as individual item scores , on the dissociation scale were significantly lower in Special Forces soldiers compared to general infantry troops .
In study 2 , 42 % of subjects reported dissociative symptoms before stress and 96 % reported them after acute stress .
Other research results include the effects of SERE - style torture upon the immune system and other biological markers .
The findings regarding high levels of cortisol upon subjects was corroborated by a SERE psychologist at the Navy Brunswick , Maine , SERE school , who — according to an unclassified , undated Talking Paper from the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency — found “ empirical medical data … [ of ] elevated levels of cortisol in the brain stem caused by stress levels incurred during water - boarding . ”
The Brunswick school subsequently discontinued waterboarding as part of its SERE training , as it created a “ negative learning environment . ”
The other Navy SERE school , in North Island , California , refuses to eliminate exposure to waterboarding as part of its training program , despite the opposition of JPRA and the other SERE schools , which believe it can induce a “ learned helplessness ” state in students .
SERE Research and the Development of the Torture Program
One of the lead researchers in a number of these studies is Yale psychiatrist Charles A. Morgan , III .
According to one source , “ Over the past 10 years , Dr. Morgan has served as a Subject Matter Expert to the US Special Operations Command . ”
But at a June 2004 symposium on “ The Nature and Influence of Intuition in Law Enforcement , ” sponsored by the U.S. Department of Justice , the Behavioral Analysis Unit of the FBI , and the American Psychological Association , Dr. Morgan is listed as affiliated with “ Behavioral Science , CIA . ”
Additionally , in the Information Science Board ( ISB ) document , Educing Information — which was heavily drawn upon by President Obama ’s task force on interrogations , for recommendations on the interrogations issue — Dr. Morgan is identified as a member of the 11 - person “ Government Experts Committee , ” and listed as affiliated with the Intelligence Technology Innovation Center ( ITIC ) .
According to Intelligence Online , ITIC is “ a research organization under the CIA ’s authority , ” which “ answers directly to the CIA ’s Science and Technology directorate . ”
The Obama Interrogations Task Force recently made clear they found a lot to value in the ISB study ( emphasis added ) :
The Task Force concluded … that the United States could improve its ability to interrogate the most dangerous terrorists by forming a specialized interrogation group , or High - Value Detainee Interrogation Group ( HIG ) , that would bring together the most effective and experienced interrogators and support personnel from across the Intelligence Community , the Department of Defense and law enforcement .
The creation of the HIG would build upon a proposal developed by the Intelligence Science Board .
Whatever the fate of the HIG , what is noteworthy here is that the Office of Technical Services ( OTS ) , which was cited in the recently released 2004 CIA Inspector General report as having vetted the aggressive SERE interrogation techniques , is , along with the ITIC , also a part of the Science and Technology directorate .
OTS , formerly the Technical Services Division ( or Technical Services Staff ) , was the branch of the CIA in charge of torture and assassination .
It was also in charge of the experimental mind control and interrogation program known as MKULTRA .
Dr. Morgan ’s online profile states that between 1998 and 2002 he received over $ 400,000 in research grants from the Army and the Office of Naval Research ( ONR ) for studies on “ Psychobiological Assessment of High Intensity Military Training ” and “ Neuro endocrine assessment of Survival School Training . ”
A 1977 Washington Post expose — those were the days of scandalous revelations surrounding the CIA ’s MKULTRA program — describes CIA use of ONR to funnel funds for secret experiments in the 1950s and 1960s .
The same relationship was also explored during a 1977 Senate Intelligence Committee hearing .
This is not evidence that Morgan ’s research was paid for by the CIA , but along with his institutional affiliation , it is suggestive of possible CIA involvement .
While it is unknown to what degree the CIA was directly involved in the SERE research ( outside of Dr. Morgan ’s affiliation ) , Special Operations Command reportedly was a major supporter .
The co-author of the Special Warfare article referenced above , and working with Dr. Morgan on a number of other SERE research papers looking at physiological and psychological effects of SERE techniques , was Gary Hazlett , a clinical psychologist with the Psychological Applications Directorate at U.S. Army Special Operations Command .
Moreover , Morgan and Hazlett cited “ the approval and support [ for their research ] of Lieutenant General William Tangney , Major General Kenneth Bowra , Major General William G. [ B ] oykin and many others … ”
Maj . Gen. Bowra retired from the military in 2003 , after serving as Commanding General of Army Special Operations Command South , U.S. Southern Command .
Following the military , he went to work as Senior Program Director with Oak Ridge National Laboratory , serving as national laboratory liaison to U.S. Joint Forces Command , J9 Directorate .
Another source states that currently Bowra is senior mentor / concept developer at USJFCOM J9 for Joint Urban Operations and Homeland Security experimentation .
J9 stands for the Joint Concept Development and Experimentation Directorate ( JCD&E ) .
It “ leads the development of emerging joint concepts , conducts and enables joint experimentation , and coordinates DoD JCD&E efforts in order to provide joint capabilities to support the current and future joint force commander in meeting security challenges . ”
The possible involvement of USJFCOM ’s J9 in research upon SERE follows upon the revelation , discussed above , that CIA ’s OTS , part of CIA ’s Science and Technology directorate , was heavily involved in the implementation of the SERE techniques for use by the CIA .
While the use of the term “ experimentation ” appears to have a broad meaning in military usage , beyond that of conducting scientific experiments , given the charges surrounding human experimentation upon torture victims , any connections between these secretive “ experimental ” directorates and the SERE torture program , or research upon it , is worrisome .
Maj . Gen. Boykin was the controversial former commander of Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , who resigned over statements that indicated he saw the “ war on terror ” as a religious war .
At the time he was Special Operations commander at Fort Bragg , according to a recent New York Times article , SERE psychologist James Mitchell was completing his last military assignment as “ psychologist to an elite special operations unit in North Carolina . ”
Boykin previously served as CIA Deputy Director of Special Activities , and in June 2003 , became Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence under Donald Rumsfeld right - hand man , Stephen Cambone .
Lt. Gen . Tangney is yet another former commanding general at Army Special Operations Command .
Also retired from the military , he is currenly Senior Vice President for Intelligence , Security , and Special Operations , at Future Technologies , Inc. , a supplier of , among other things , a “ well - developed global network of experienced intelligence , security and special operations professionals ” working with Special Operations , the Defense Intelligence Agency , and other military customers .
While Dr. Morgan appears to be well - connected among the military and intelligence elite , it is important to remember that there is no reason to conclude that Dr. Morgan or his co-researchers have ever been involved in torture or experiments meant to be used for torture .
( We cannot say the same for CIA or military medical or psychological personnel , however . )
In fact , it is possible that Dr. Morgan ’s research has led him to oppose coercive interrogation techniques , as his published research documents the debilitating effects of SERE torture , which utilized against a prisoner could only be considered cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment , if not torture .
( Although , at the 2007 convention of the American Psychological Association , Dr. Morgan indicated he was against the idea of removing psychologists from national security interrogations , which was being considered in a motion before APA at that time . )
A 2007 New York Times article quotes Dr. Morgan :
Many SERE veterans were appalled at the “ reverse engineering ” of their methods , said Charles A. Morgan III , a Yale psychiatrist who has worked closely with SERE trainers for a decade .
“ How did something used as an example of what an unethical government would do become something we do ? ” he asked .
Dr. Morgan ’s comments appear to put him at odds with other members of the CIA ’s Science and Technology directorate , particularly those who work for OTS , as well as individuals within the Pentagon and Special Operations Command , who have been tied to elements of the U.S. torture program .
The Suppression of Research on SERE in the OLC Memos
What is clear is that the CIA and the Pentagon had plenty of experimental evidence from the peer - reviewed , published research of Dr. Morgan and his associates ( and possibly others ) , both before and after 9/11 , that SERE techniques had serious , debilitating effects on individuals subjected to them .
As this research is never cited in any of the Office of Legal Counsel memos issued to the CIA around their torture program , it appears such research was deliberately withheld from government attorneys as the CIA sought approval for the use of SERE - style torture .
Nor was this obscure research , but had been funded by the government at a minimum of hundreds of thousands of dollars , and promoted by some of the Pentagon ’s highest generals .
The frenzied search for data on waterboarding , sleep deprivation , isolation , confinement in a small box , etc. , to submit to OLC attorneys making legal determinations on whether proposed interrogation techniques constituted torture , was a kabuki organized by the CIA .
The OLC attorneys involved — John Yoo , Stephen Bradbury , Jay Bybee , and others — were witting or unwitting partners in suppression of CIA research on torture ( as future investigations will disclose ) .
Given the participation of members of the Office of the Vice President , particularly David Addington and Vice President Cheney himself , in the promulgation of the torture program , and the composition of the memos , it seems likely they were also involved in the suppression of this material .
As a result , the memos produced authorizing the “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” were composed as the result of fraud and bad faith , the result of a criminal conspiracy to implement illegal torture techniques .
The public response to the recent “ white paper ” by Physicians for Human Rights shows there is great interest in following up on charges of human experimentation upon torture victims of the U.S. government .
The Congress and Department of Justice should move swiftly to initiate full , open investigations and charges against those involved .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Cisplatin is one of the most powerful and effective drugs for treating a wide variety of cancers , but serious side effects ultimately limit the drug 's use and effectiveness .
Now , however , researchers have developed a nanoparticulate formulation of cisplatin that may be able to eliminate or reduce platinum - associated toxicity while boosting cisplatin's tumor - killing activity .
Reporting its work in the Journal of the American Chemical Society , a team of investigators led by Stephen Lippard , of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and Chad Mirkin , of Northwestern University and principal investigator of the Northwestern Center for Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence , describes its development and characterization of gold nanoparticles as a delivery vehicle for a non -toxic form of platinum known as platinum ( IV ) .
The gold nanoparticles are coated with short pieces of nucleic acid to which the investigators chemically attach platinum ( IV ) .
This construct can circulate safely through the blood stream and readily enter tumor cells , which take up the nanoparticles and their payload by engulfing them in tiny pockets of cell membrane called endosomes .
The acidic environment inside the endosome is such that platinum ( IV ) undergoes a chemical reaction that converts it into platinum ( II ) , the highly toxic form of this element .
When administered to four different kinds of tumor cells , the nanoparticle - platinum ( IV ) construct was more toxic than an equivalent dose of cisplatin .
But more importantly , the platinum ( IV ) compound itself , unattached to a nucleic acid - decorated gold nanoparticle , was unable to kill any of the treated cancer cells .
The investigators then showed that the nanoparticle - delivered platinum ( IV ) compound killed the treated tumor cells in the same way that cisplatin does .

Remember the Danish " Muhammad cartoons " that set off riots by offended Muslims more than three years ago ?
The debate pitted freedom of press and speech against notions of freedom from insult of one 's religion .
It rages still – but now in a forum with international legal implications .
For years , Islamic nations have succeeded in passing " blasphemy " resolutions at the United Nations ( in the General Assembly and in its human rights body ) .
The measures call on states to limit religiously offensive language or speech .
No one wants their beliefs ridiculed , but the freedom to disagree over faith is what allows for the free practice of religion .
The resolutions are misguided , but also only symbolic , because they 're nonbinding .
Symbolism no longer satisfies the sponsor of these resolutions – the Organization of the Islamic Council .
Under the leadership of Pakistan , the 57 - nation OIC wants to give the religious antidefamation idea legal teeth by making it part of an international convention , or legally binding treaty .
Members of the UN Human Rights Council are passionately debating that idea in Geneva this week .
The United States under Barack Obama recently joined the UNHRC , maligned for years as the mouthpiece for countries that are themselves flagrant human rights abusers .
A " new " council formed in 2006 .
President Obama 's hope is that as an engaged member , the US can further reform – and its own interests .
This case will test his theory .
Consider the wording put forth by Pakistan , written on behalf of the OIC .
It proposes " legal prohibition of publication of material that negatively stereotypes , insults or uses offensive language " on matters regarded by religious followers as " sacred or inherent to their dignity as human beings . "
This gives broad latitude to governments to decide what 's offensive .
Countries such as Pakistan already have national blasphemy laws , but a global treaty would give them international cover to suppress minority religious groups with the excuse that these groups offend mainstream beliefs .
And what about unpopular , even " insulting " dissenters within a majority religion – such as women who seek to interpret Islamic sharia law so that they may gain more rights ?
Besides , international treaties are meant to protect the rights of people , not ideas .
A legal defense of dignity – how a person is viewed – is not on par with a defense of a person 's inherent identity and rights .
And treaties already aim to protect individuals from discrimination and violence based on religion .
As a newcomer to the Human Rights Council , the US is vigorously arguing against the OIC 's latest push , as are European countries .
They may not get very far in changing minds in the governments of Egypt or Saudi Arabia .
But human rights advocates such as Freedom House and the US Commission on International Religious Freedom say Latin American and sub-Saharan African countries could be persuaded to resist the OIC 's push .
These largely non-Muslim countries have typically voted as a bloc on the nonbinding religious defamation resolutions .
But the trend has shifted so that more of them are now either abstaining or voting against the resolutions .
Chile , for instance , recently switched from abstain to " no " at the March Human Rights Council vote ; Liberia switched from " yes " to " no " at the last General Assembly meeting .
These are democracies that understand that suppression of speech in the name of religion can come with a negative effect – suppression of people and theological fault lines that at some point will erupt .
It is , conversely , open debate , interfaith dialogue , and righting of misconceptions that will allow religion to flourish – including Islam , whose many followers feel so maligned at the moment .
" Some claim that the best way to protect the freedom of religion is to implement so - called antidefamation policies that would restrict freedom of expression and the freedom of religion .
I strongly disagree , " said Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton this week .
She went on to argue that the best antidote to religious intolerance is enforcement of antidiscrimination laws , government " outreach " to minority religious groups , and " the vigorous defense of both freedom of religion and expression . "
The US is now in a position to persuade along these lines from inside the Human Rights Council .
It should proceed with the vigor that Ms. Clinton talked about .
One gay man , two lesbians , a three - legged cat and a poisoned curry plot
A gay man tried to poison his lesbian neighbours by putting slug pellets into their curry after he was accused of kidnapping their three - legged cat .
Gary Stewart , 37 , had been at loggerheads with Marie Walton and Beverley Sales for months .
But things looked brighter when he made a peace offering of some curry , claiming he had ordered too much from the Indian takeaway .
Neighbours at war : Marie Walton and Beverley Sales claim Stewart kidnapped their three - legged cat
When the women started to eat , they found the curry studded with slug pellets .
They called the police and Stewart was arrested .
He appeared before magistrates in Manchester where he admitted attempting to poison the two women on September 22 .
He denied a further charge of making threats to kill .
Last night it emerged that Miss Walton , a full - time mother , and Miss Sales , a goods vehicle driver , had been the victims of an apparent hate campaign by Stewart at their home in Denton , Manchester .
Stewart is even alleged to have kidnapped the family 's three - legged cat , Amber , and dumped her in a village miles away .
The cat was eventually found after posters were put up with her photograph .
She was found three miles away being cared for by a woman who had taken her in .
Last night neighbours said the alleged harassment had left Miss Walton and Miss Sales distraught .
The attempt to poison them with slug pellets was the final straw .
' It has been nothing short of a nightmare and I hope this brings things to an end because what those two girls have had to endure these past years has been horrendous , ' one neighbour said .
' He was abusive to them and made their lives a misery .
' And to cap it off , he kidnapped their cat and dumped it on the streets . '
Poisoned olive branch :
In an apparent peace offering Stewart offered the lesbian couple some of his leftover curry , but it contained slug pellets
Slug pellets - which normally contain the chemical metaldehyde - can be extremely dangerous to animals and children .
But the chemical is classed as being ' moderately hazardous ' by the World Health Organisation and would not normally kill an adult .
Residents said that when Stewart had initially moved in with his partner , Paul Kleisier , several years ago they had been perfect neighbours .
But over time they became ' vindictive ' and began arguments with residents over petty matters .
Stewart 's partner , 43 , is thought to have become seriously ill and died this summer .
Stewart is due to appear again before Manchester magistrates at a later date .
Gauging politicians and pundits ’ various reactions to President Obama winning the Nobel Peace Prize last week was amusing .
Even more amusing was the reaction from American conservatives .
Wrote Rush Limbaugh in an e-mail to the Politico :
This fully exposes the illusion that is Barack Obama …
And with this ‘ award ’ the elites of the world are urging Obama , THE MAN OF PEACE , to not do the surge in Afghanistan , not take action against Iran and its nuclear program and to basically continue his intentions to emasculate the United States …
They love a weakened , neutered U.S and this is their way of promoting that concept .
Said Texas Congressman Ron Paul :
His policy is not exactly pro-peace .
Right now it looks like the war will continue over there , Obama wants more troops into Afghanistan and more bombing in Pakistan , it looks like Pakistan is going to be the front of the war , there ’s been no significant troop reduction in Iraq .
Limbaugh and Paul ’s reactions represent two , polar - opposite views on the same subject , and yet both men are generally perceived as right - wing conservatives , completely opposed to President Obama ’s agenda .
But on foreign policy , only Paul truly opposes this president .
Limbaugh might rail against Obama all day , every day , but once you get past the rhetoric , both Rush and Barack essentially agree that it is the United States ’ mission to be the world ’s policeman .
As officer Obama continues to patrol Bush ’s old beat , even expanding into new neighborhoods , it is Paul who ’s demanding the U.S. fully and finally turn in its world ’s police badge — while Rush would simply prefer a different sheriff .
ATLANTIC CITY --
A woman who placed second in a woman 's only poker tournament at the Borgata is upset because a man took the top prize , a report on Philly.com said .
Diagnosed with breast cancer , Nicole Rowe , 40 , of West Windsor , N.Y. , was hoping to win the top prize in the Ladies No -Limit Texas Hold ' Em tournament to pay for living expenses while she recuperated from a mastectomy she expects to have later this month , according to the report .
But Abraham Korotki , 65 , of Ventnor City , took the top prize of $ 20,982 , the report said .
Joe Lupo , the gaming hall 's senior vice - president , told Philly.com the gaming hall is required by law to allow anyone over 21 the opportunity to participate , even if the event is intended for women only .
Korotki said he only joined the game because he was earlier eliminated from another tournament .
Borgota officials told Philly.com Korotki was the only man they saw play in the tournament .

In concept , at least , the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards , form a useful and necessary layer of protection , well - designed for the specific task of repelling thieves from getting their mitts on credit - and debit- card account numbers and PINs .
Now comes the Ponemon Institute and tech security firm Imperva with results of a survey underscoring what cyber criminals — and merchants and banks know all too well — PCI is having only a limited effect .
PCI is a set of voluntary requirements established by Visa and MasterCard to help organizations protect cardholder information .
Merchants and financial firms that do n’t comply with PCI rules can be fined by VISA and MasterCard .
Ponemon and Imperva surveyed more than 500 companies globally that cumulatively generate annual revenues of $ 5.6 billion and found :
• 71 % of companies do not treat PCI compliance as a strategic initiative , yet 79 % have experienced a breach .
• 55 % only focus on credit card information and do not secure Social Security numbers , driver ’s license numbers , and bank account details .
• Consumers are more at risk doing business with smaller companies : only 28 % of these comply with PCI as opposed to 70 % of companies with 75,000 or more employees .
Verizon ’s forensics show similar pattern
Imperva ’s findings fit hand - in - glove with Verizon ’s 2009 Data Breach Investigations Report .
LastWatchdog highly recommends anyone curious about commonalities in actual database breaches to read Verizon ’s 2009 report and it ’s predecessor , the 2008 Data Breach Investigations Report .
Verizon closely examined patterns in more than 590 data breach cases from 2004 through 2008 , in which 515 million records — mostly payment card data — were ripped off .
In each of these cases , Verizon was hired to do a CSI - like forensic probe .
It ’s crack investigators found , among other things , that 81 % of the companies breached in 2008 did not comply with PCI .
TJX , parent company of TJ Maxx and Marshalls , was famously not in compliance with PCI rules in 2007 , when hackers extracted some 94 million cardholder records over the course of approximately eight months , then a record .
But Hannaford Brothers grocery store chain was in compliance when it lost 4.2 million cardholder records .
So , too , was Heartland Payment Systems when it ignominiously broke TJX ’s record , losing 130 million payment card records over a period of 13 months .
Alberto Gonzalez of Miami has plead guilty to playing a role in the TJX hack , and faces charges related to the Hannaford and Heartland hacks .
Going through the motions
Heartland “ went through the motions without actually implementing a meticulous and rigorous data security program , ” says Imperva CEO Shlomo Kramer .
“ Companies that do n’t use PCI as a strategic initiative will cover only credit card numbers and not other data that ’s equally problematic to lose like Social Security numbers . ”
Kramer notes that the PCI rules only require companies to focus on payment card data ; other data - such as social security numbers , birth dates and driver ’s license numbers - are n’t covered .
Still , PCI is having a positive impact by “ bringing security to the table and forcing companies to think about data protection , ” says Kramer .
“ Many companies - 27 % in our survey - have used PCI to force data security high onto the executive and corporate priority list . ”

The streets of no shame :
The shocking picture that epitomises Britain 's ladette culture
Maybe she thinks it 's the drink that is preventing her from putting one foot in front of the other .
Or perhaps she knows the vulgar truth and is merely trying to impress her friends .
Either way , the sight is certainly not an edifying one .
This shrieking ladette was photographed staggering through Cardiff city centre late on Friday night .
Stripped of dignity : Ladette antics in Cardiff , where drinking in the street has just been banned
Such scenes are not uncommon , which is why Cardiff - one of the country 's worst cities for binge drinking - has just banned boozing on the streets .
The crackdown is aimed at late night revellers , targeting rowdy hen and stag parties and generally trying to make the streets safer after dark .
Police can use the new powers to confiscate alcohol or arrest anyone who defies them .
The ban has been a success in trials in small areas but will spread across the entire city in time for Christmas and the New Year .
High antics : Female students appear to wrestle on the ground in Sheffield earlier this month
Yesterday it was hailed as a big step towards ' reclaiming the streets ' from drunken yobs .
Cardiff Central MP Jenny Willott said : ' Late night alcohol - fuelled crime and anti-social behaviour is a huge problem on the streets .
' People deserve to have a night out without the fear of intimidation or facing violence as a result of excessive alcohol consumption .
' This ban should help the law - abiding and responsible majority to reclaim the streets . '
The Designated Public Place Order - a power introduced by the Home Office - does not make drinking in public illegal .
But police can order people to stop drinking on the streets and can confiscate their alcohol .
Anyone failing to comply will be arrested .
It is believed to be the first time the orders has been brought in to cover an entire city .
Excessive drinking :
It all gets too much for one fresher on last week 's Cardiff pub crawl
The measures follow the revelation that drink was responsible for more than half the violent assaults in the city centre in the past 12 months .
Cardiff Council deputy leader Judith Woodman said : ' It gives police the right to confiscate alcohol where people are behaving in a rowdy and disorderly way and causing problems to residents and those around them . '
The move could now be followed by other cities .
It comes as experts warned that British schoolgirls are the worst for binge drinking in Europe .
The problem is likely to become worse as it becomes more socially acceptable , a conference heard .
Some 648 children under ten were admitted to hospital due to drink between 2003 and 2008 .
Professor Ian Gilmore , president of the Royal College of Physicians , said : ' We are more than double our nearest rivals when it comes to women binge drinking .
We stand out like sore thumbs . '
He added that many career women were drinking to ' hold their own ' with male colleagues at after - work drinking sessions .
Binge drinking among young women hit the headlines again last week when university students across the country took part in organised marathon pub crawls .
Many familiar scenes of debauchery were seen , including half - naked women collapsing on the street .
( CNN ) --
A six - month - old baby had a miraculous escape after his stroller rolled off a railway station platform and into the path of an incoming train .
The stroller rolling towards the edge of the platform .
The incident , which happened Thursday at Ashburton railway station in Melbourne , Australia , was captured by CCTV .
The footage shows the baby 's mother momentarily letting go of the stroller , which then rolls over the edge of the platform .
Second later , a train pulls in to the station .
The stroller and baby were dragged 30 meters ( 33 yards ) further up the track before the train came to a halt .
John Rees , a spokesman for train operator Connex , told Australia 's Channel 7 television station : " It 's a miracle this baby was n't killed .
The baby managed to escape with just a cut to the forehead , I 'm told .
It 's a complete miracle . "
The baby boy was quickly reunited with his distraught mother .
He was taken to Melbourne 's Royal Children 's Hospital but was later discharged .
Channel 7 said the incident came just a day after the launch of a public awareness campaign warning of the dangers of strollers on platforms .
Victoria state police sergeant Michael Ferwerda told Channel 7 : " Parents especially need to be vigilant especially with toddlers . "
Analysis :
He won , but for what ?
The awarding of the Nobel Peace Price to President Barack Obama landed with a shock on darkened , still - asleep Washington .
He won !
For what ?
For one of America 's youngest presidents , in office less than nine months — and only for 12 days before the Nobel nomination deadline last February — it was an enormous honor .
The prize seems to be more for Obama 's promise than for his performance .
Work on the president 's ambitious agenda , both at home and abroad , is barely underway , much less finished .
He has no standout moment of victory that would seem to warrant a verdict as sweeping as that issued by the Nobel committee .
Like most presidents in their first year , Obama 's scorecard so far is largely an " incomplete , " if he 's being graded .
He banned torture and other extreme interrogation techniques for terrorists .
But he also promised to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , a source of much distaste for the U.S. around the world , a task with difficulties that have Obama headed to miss his own January 2010 deadline .
He said he would end the Iraq war .
But he has been slow to bring the troops home and the real end of the U.S. military presence there wo n't come until at least 2012 , and that 's only if both the U.S. and Iraq stick to their current agreement about American troop withdrawals .
Meantime , he 's running a second war in the Muslim world , in Afghanistan — and is seriously considering ramping that one up .
He has pushed for new efforts to make peace between the Israelis and Palestinians .
But he 's received little cooperation from the two sides .
He said he wants a nuclear - free world .
But it 's one thing to telegraph the desire , in a speech in Prague in April , and quite another to unite other nations and U.S. lawmakers behind the web of treaties and agreements needed to make that reality .
He has said that battling climate change is a priority .
But the U.S. seems likely to head into crucial international negotiations set for Copenhagen in December with Obama - backed legislation still stalled in Congress .
And what about Obama 's global prestige ?
It seemed to take a big hit exactly a week ago when he jetted across the Atlantic to lobby for Chicago to get the 2016 Olympics — and was rejected with a last - place finish .
Perhaps for the Nobel committee , merely altering the tone out of Washington toward the rest of the world is enough .
Obama got much attention for his speech from Cairo reaching out a U.S. hand to the world 's Muslims .
His remarks at the U.N. General Assembly last month set down new markers for the way the U.S. works with the world .
But still ... ?
Obama aides seemed as surprised at the news as everyone else , not even aware he had been nominated along with a record 204 others .
Awoken by press secretary Robert Gibbs about an hour after the vote was announced , the White House says the president responded that he was humbled to be only the third sitting U.S. president to be able to put the prestigious Nobel laureate title before his name .
It 's not necessarily a slam - dunk win for Obama in the tricky U.S. political arena .
It 's good news after a string of difficulties .
And he won last year 's election in no small part because voters had grown so weary with the U.S. 's battered image overseas and were attracted to his promise to make a new start for America .
But Republicans have never been shy about criticizing Obama as being too much celebrity and too little action , and may seize on this praise — from Europeans , no less — to try to bring him down a peg in the eyes of U.S. voters .
For Nobel voters , though , the award could be as much about issuing a slap at Obama 's predecessor as about lauding Obama .
Former President George W. Bush was reviled by much of the world for his cowboy diplomacy , Iraq war and snubbing of European priorities like global warming .
Remember that the Nobel prize has a long history of being awarded more for the committee 's aspirations than for others ' accomplishments — for Mideast peace or a better South Africa , for instance .
In those cases , the prize is awarded to encourage those who receive it to see the effort through , sometimes at critical moments .
Obama likely understands that his challenges are too steep to resolve — much less honor — after just a few months .
" It 's not going to be easy , " the president often says of the tasks he sets for the United States and the world .
The Nobel committee , it seems , had the audacity to hope that he 'll eventually produce a record worthy of its prize .

Earlier this month Mark Cuban not scored a rare victory against the SEC , having a judge dismiss the insider trading case against him .
Now he ’s going for the extra-points by attempting to force the SEC to pay for the costs of his lawyers .
Lawyers at Dewey & LeBoeuf , Cuban ’s law firm , filed a motion on Friday asking the judge to order the SEC to pay their attorneys ' fees and costs .
Andrew Lonstreth at Law.com reports :
In their motion for fees , the Dewey team -- Ralph Ferrara , Stephen Best , Lyle Roberts , Henry Asbill , and Christopher Clark -- write that they 're not seeking the money simply because Judge Fitzwater dismissed the suit .
Instead , they write : " Mr. Cuban and the court never should have been forced to address this suit .
The SEC 's insider trading claim against Mr. Cuban is wholly unsupported by the facts . "
Cuban ’s lawyers argue that the SEC improperly pressured witnesses .
The entire case , they say , was built on the hope that Cuban himself could be pressured into settling .
" The SEC apparently gambled that Mr. Cuban would be pressured into an early settlement , " the Dewey team writes .
( Media - Newswire.com ) - WASHINGTON  American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. and its subsidiary Pharmacia & Upjohn Company Inc. ( hereinafter together " Pfizer " ) have agreed to pay $ 2.3 billion , the largest health care fraud settlement in the history of the Department of Justice , to resolve criminal and civil liability arising from the illegal promotion of certain pharmaceutical products , the Justice Department announced today .
Pharmacia & Upjohn Company has agreed to plead guilty to a felony violation of the Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act for misbranding Bextra with the intent to defraud or mislead .
Bextra is an anti-inflammatory drug that Pfizer pulled from the market in 2005 .
Under the provisions of the Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act , a company must specify the intended uses of a product in its new drug application to FDA .
Once approved , the drug may not be marketed or promoted for so - called " off- label " uses  i.e. , any use not specified in an application and approved by FDA .
Pfizer promoted the sale of Bextra for several uses and dosages that the FDA specifically declined to approve due to safety concerns .
The company will pay a criminal fine of $ 1.195 billion , the largest criminal fine ever imposed in the United States for any matter .
Pharmacia & Upjohn will also forfeit $ 105 million , for a total criminal resolution of $ 1.3 billion .
In addition , Pfizer has agreed to pay $ 1 billion to resolve allegations under the civil False Claims
Act that the company illegally promoted four drugs 
Bextra ; Geodon , an anti-psychotic drug ; Zyvox , an antibiotic ; and Lyrica , an anti-epileptic drug  and caused false claims to be submitted to government health care programs for uses that were not medically accepted indications and therefore not covered by those programs .
The civil settlement also resolves allegations that Pfizer paid kickbacks to health care providers to induce them to prescribe these , as well as other , drugs .
The federal share of the civil settlement is $ 668,514,830 and the state Medicaid share of the civil settlement is $ 331,485,170 .
This is the largest civil fraud settlement in history against a pharmaceutical company .
As part of the settlement , Pfizer also has agreed to enter into an expansive corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services .
That agreement provides for procedures and reviews to be put in place to avoid and promptly detect conduct similar to that which gave rise to this matter .
Whistleblower lawsuits filed under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act that are pending in the District of Massachusetts , the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Eastern District of Kentucky triggered this investigation .
As a part of todays resolution , six whistleblowers will receive payments totaling more than $ 102 million from the federal share of the civil recovery .
The U.S. Attorneys offices for the District of Massachusetts , the Eastern District of Pennsylvania , and the Eastern District of Kentucky , and the Civil Division of the Department of Justice handled these cases .
The U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts led the criminal investigation of Bextra .
The investigation was conducted by the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , the FBI , the Defense Criminal Investigative Service ( DCIS ) , the Office of Criminal Investigations for the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , the Veterans Administrations ( VA ) Office of Criminal Investigations , the Office of the Inspector General for the Office of Personnel Management ( OPM ) , the Office of the Inspector General for the United States Postal Service ( USPS ) , the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units and the offices of various state Attorneys General .
" Todays landmark settlement is an example of the Department of Justices ongoing and intensive efforts to protect the American public and recover funds for the federal treasury and the public from those who seek to earn a profit through fraud .
It shows one of the many ways in which federal government , in partnership with its state and local allies , can help the American people at a time when budgets are tight and health care costs are increasing , " said Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli .
" This settlement is a testament to the type of broad , coordinated effort among federal agencies and with our state and local partners that is at the core of the Department of Justices approach to law enforcement . "
" This historic settlement will return nearly $ 1 billion to Medicare , Medicaid , and other government insurance programs , securing their future for the Americans who depend on these programs , " said Kathleen Sebelius , Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services .
" The Department of Health and Human Services will continue to seek opportunities to work with its government partners to prosecute fraud wherever we can find it .
But we will also look for new ways to prevent fraud before it happens .
Health care is too important to let a single dollar go to waste . "
" Illegal conduct and fraud by pharmaceutical companies puts the public health at risk , corrupts medical decisions by health care providers , and costs the government billions of dollars , " said Tony West , Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division .
" This civil settlement and plea agreement by Pfizer represent yet another example of what penalties will be faced when a pharmaceutical company puts profits ahead of patient welfare . "
" The size and seriousness of this resolution , including the huge criminal fine of $ 1.3 billion , reflect the seriousness and scope of Pfizers crimes , " said Mike Loucks , acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts .
" Pfizer violated the law over an extensive time period .
Furthermore , at the very same time Pfizer was in our office negotiating and resolving the allegations of criminal conduct by its then newly acquired subsidiary , Warner - Lambert , Pfizer was itself in its other operations violating those very same laws .
Todays enormous fine demonstrates that such blatant and continued disregard of the law will not be tolerated . "
" Although these types of investigations are often long and complicated and require many resources to achieve positive results , the FBI will not be deterred from continuing to ensure that pharmaceutical companies conduct business in a lawful manner , " said Kevin Perkins , FBI Assistant Director , Criminal Investigative Division .
" This resolution protects the FDA in its vital mission of ensuring that drugs are safe and effective .
When manufacturers undermine the FDAs rules , they interfere with a doctors judgment and can put patient health at risk , " commented Michael L. Levy , U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania .
" The public trusts companies to market their drugs for uses that FDA has approved , and trusts that doctors are using independent judgment .
Federal health dollars should only be spent on treatment decisions untainted by misinformation from manufacturers concerned with the bottom line . "
" This settlement demonstrates the ongoing efforts to pursue violations of the False Claims Act and recover taxpayer dollars for the Medicare and Medicaid programs , " noted Jim Zerhusen , U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky .
" This historic settlement emphasizes the governments commitment to corporate and individual accountability and to transparency throughout the pharmaceutical industry , " said Daniel R. Levinson , Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services .
" The corporate integrity agreement requires senior Pfizer executives and board members to complete annual compliance certifications and opens Pfizer to more public scrutiny by requiring it to make detailed disclosures on its Web site .
We expect this agreement to increase integrity in the marketing of pharmaceuticals . "
" The off - label promotion of pharmaceutical drugs by Pfizer significantly impacted the integrity of TRICARE , the Department of Defenses healthcare system , " said Sharon Woods , Director , Defense Criminal Investigative Service .
" This illegal activity increases patients  costs , threatens their safety and negatively affects the delivery of healthcare services to the over nine million military members , retirees and their families who rely on this system .
Todays charges and settlement demonstrate the ongoing commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and its law enforcement partners to investigate and prosecute those that abuse the governments healthcare programs at the expense of the taxpayers and patients . "
" Federal employees deserve health care providers and suppliers , including drug manufacturers , that meet the highest standards of ethical and professional behavior , " said Patrick E. McFarland , Inspector General of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management .
" Todays settlement reminds the pharmaceutical industry that it must observe those standards and reflects the commitment of federal law enforcement organizations to pursue improper and illegal conduct that places health care consumers at risk . "
" Health care fraud has a significant financial impact on the Postal Service .
This case alone impacted more than 10,000 postal employees on workers  compensation who were treated with these drugs , " said Joseph Finn , Special Agent in Charge for the Postal Services Office of Inspector General .
" Last year the Postal Service paid more than $ 1 billion in workers  compensation benefits to postal employees injured on the job . "

" The Cult of Schneier "
If there ’s actually a cult out there , I want to hear about it .
In an essay by that name , John Viega writes about the dangers of relying on Applied Cryptography to design cryptosystems :
But , after many years of evaluating the security of software systems , I ’m incredibly down on using the book that made Bruce famous when designing the cryptographic aspects of a system .
In fact , I can safely say I have never seen a secure system come out the other end , when that is the primary source for the crypto design .
And I do n’t mean that people forget about the buffer overflows .
I mean , the crypto is crappy .
My rule for software development teams is simple : Do n’t use Applied Cryptography in your system design .
It ’s fine and fun to read it , just do n’t build from it . [… ]
The book talks about the fundamental building blocks of cryptography , but there is no guidance on things like , putting together all the pieces to create a secure , authenticated connection between two parties .
Plus , in the nearly 13 years since the book was last revised , our understanding of cryptography has changed greatly .
There are things in it that were thought to be true at the time that turned out to be very false … .
I agree .
And , to his credit , Viega points out that I agree :
But in the introduction to Bruce Schneier ’s book , Practical Cryptography , he himself says that the world is filled with broken systems built from his earlier book .
In fact , he wrote Practical Cryptography in hopes of rectifying the problem .
This is all true .
Designing a cryptosystem is hard .
Just as you would n’t give a person — even a doctor — a brain - surgery instruction manual and then expect him to operate on live patients , you should n’t give an engineer a cryptography book and then expect him to design and implement a cryptosystem .
The patient is unlikely to survive , and the cryptosystem is unlikely to be secure .
Even worse , security does n’t provide immediate feedback .
A dead patient on the operating table tells the doctor that maybe he does n’t understand brain surgery just because he read a book , but an insecure cryptosystem works just fine .
It ’s not until someone takes the time to break it that the engineer might realize that he did n’t do as good a job as he thought .
Remember : Anyone can design a security system that he himself cannot break .
Even the experts regularly get it wrong .
The odds that an amateur will get it right are extremely low .
For those who are interested , a second edition of Practical Cryptography will be published in early 2010 , renamed Cryptography Engineering and featuring a third author : Tadayoshi Kohno .

( CNN ) --
It was a moment vividly depicted in the movie about her life : 7 - year - old Helen Keller , holding one hand under a water pump as her teacher spelled " W - A - T - E - R " into her other hand .
The statue of Helen Keller will be " a wonderful addition " to the National Statuary Hall , one expert said .
In that moment , Keller , an Alabama native who lost her sight and hearing to illness as a toddler , understood that meanings were hidden in the manual alphabet shapes her teacher , Anne Sullivan , had taught her to make with her hands .
The moment was shown in the play -- later made into a movie -- " The Miracle Worker . "
On Wednesday , a statue commemorating her 1887 breakthrough will be unveiled in the U.S. Capitol 's National Statuary Hall , the first statue in the Capitol of a person with a disability , as well as the first of a child , according to the Alabama governor 's office .
" It 's always good to realize how much of an impact people with disabilities have made on the history and landscape of our country , " said Nancy Starnes , director of external affairs for the Washington - based National Organization on Disability .
" I 'm excited that they 're going to be doing this .
I think it 's going to be a wonderful addition . "
In 1997 , a Franklin Delano Roosevelt memorial that opened near the National Mall drew complaints from disability advocates because its statue of the former president , who had polio , did not show Roosevelt in a wheelchair .
In 2001 , former President Clinton unveiled an addition to the memorial including a new statue of the four - term president sitting in a wheelchair .
Keller , born in Tuscumbia in northwest Alabama , learned to speak at the age of 10 by putting her hands on Sullivan 's mouth when she talked .
She eventually graduated from Radcliffe College , then the women 's branch of Harvard University , and became a prolific author and speaker who was endowed with numerous honors , including the Presidential Medal of Freedom .
She died in 1968 .
Since 1864 , each state has been allowed to place two statues in the Capitol .
In 2002 , Congress changed the law to allow states to change their statues .
Then - U.S. Rep. Bob Riley , now Alabama 's governor , suggested that the state place a statue of Keller , and the state Legislature passed a resolution asking Congress to accept a statue of Keller as a gift .
" Helen Keller was an extraordinary Alabamian who showed us the power of a determined human spirit can overcome any obstacle , " Riley said in a statement issued by his office Monday .
" The remarkable moment at the water pump , so vividly captured by this statue , will inspire countless others and remind them there truly are no limits to what people can accomplish . "
A committee , with Alabama first lady Patsy Riley as honorary chairman , raised private donations for the statue and selected Utah bronze sculpture artist Edward Hlavka to create the piece .
The 600 - pound statue is made of bronze with a base of Alabama marble , Riley 's office said .
" I hope we will continue to acknowledge that disability does n't equate with inability in this country , " Starnes said .
She said there are many opportunities each year , such as Women 's History Month , to recognize those with disabilities .
" Disability really is an overlay over any discussion about people in this country , " she said .
" It 's just time to take it off the shelf that 's labeled ' special . ' "
Andy Imparato , president and CEO of the American Association of People with Disabilities , noted that the statue will be seen by schoolchildren visiting the Capitol .
" She was a real pioneer , as a woman , as a person with a disability , as an educator , " he said of Keller .
" We see it as helping to raise awareness that people with disabilities can do anything , and our history as a movement is a lot longer than some people assume . "
Keller 's statue will replace one depicting Jabez Curry in the Capitol Gallery .
Curry was a Georgia native who served as president of Howard College , which later became Samford University in Birmingham .
The Curry statue , which has represented Alabama in the Capitol since 1908 , is being sent back to Alabama for display at the university .
The other statue representing Alabama in the Capitol is of Joseph " Fightin ' Joe " Wheeler , a Confederate general during the Civil War who , three decades later , volunteered to serve in the Spanish - American War at age 62 and attained the same rank in the U.S. Army .
He was the only one of 425 Confederate generals to do so , according to a biography posted on the Fort Sam Houston Museum 's Web site .
His statue was donated by the state in 1925 , Riley 's office said .

You'd be forgiven for thinking that Europe 's new Earth observation satellite was some kind of " space helicopter " .
Satellites have a reputation for being dull , functional boxes .
However , the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity ( Smos ) spacecraft is anything but routine .
Its looks , of course , are a consequence of the job it has been asked to do .
Smos will map of the variation in the wetness of the land and of the quantity of salts dissolved in sea water .
These are key parameters that can tell scientists how water is cycling around the planet - from the surface to the atmosphere and back again .
" These two variables have never been measured from space before ; that means never measured globally , " says Dr Yann Kerr , a lead investigator on the mission from the Center for the Study of the Biosphere from Space ( Cesbio ) , Toulouse , France .
Dish problem Evaporation , transpiration , precipitation - these are all stages on the grand wheel of water .

As the Sun heats the ocean and water vapour rises skyward , the sea surface becomes a little more saline as salts are left behind .
When the clouds move across the land and it rains , the precipitation will soak the earth .
Smos will see these changes ; and putting some more precise numbers on the variations over time will assist scientists as they seek to make better weather forecasts and understand key features of the climate system .
The European Space Agency ( Esa ) satellite works by measuring the natural emission of microwaves coming up off the planet 's surface .
Variations in the sogginess of the soil or the saltiness of the ocean will modify this signal .
But this is long wavelength radiation , in the L - band .
Its detection demands a big antenna ; and to get the sort of wide and timely coverage scientists want over both the land and the ocean would ordinarily have required a moveable dish some 20 m across .
There is no rocket in existence that can put such an object in space .
Radio astronomy has pioneered interferometry to study long wavelength light
So , the Smos team has borrowed a trick from radio astronomy .
For decades , researchers in that field have been linking together arrays of smaller telescopes to synthesise the type of image that might be acquired using a single , giant receiver .

Spanish engineers have spent 14 years , at cost of 70 m euros , turning this concept into a practical space - borne instrument to study the Earth rather than the stars .
The result is Miras ( Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis ) .
Sixty - nine small antennas are positioned on a central box and along the lengths of three extending arms .
The whole mechanism is folded for launch to fit inside a modest Russian Rockot vehicle .
The amount of water retained in soils varies between about 5 % and 50 %
This will cover most conditions from ' bone dry ' to ' mud bath '
Smos sees the entire range with an accuracy of 4 % at the 50 km scale Natural salinity in water covers the range from near zero to 30 %
Drinking water might be one extreme ; salt lakes would be the other extreme Smos is seeking sea waters which are typically in the 3 - 3.5 % range
This needs high accuracy ( 0.01 - 0.02 % ) .
Maps are at the 200 km scale
The spacecraft is then hurled into orbit , where the 3.5 m - long arms can be unpacked to give Smos its rotor appearance .
The arms do not turn , however .
The satellite merely sweeps around the Earth , using its Y - shaped instrument to map a 1,000 km - wide swath , or track .
Critically , the antenna arrays can synthesise images that have detail at a scale down to 50 km for soil moisture ; and at 200 km for ocean salinity .
" With our technology , we get a global picture with reasonable spatial resolution within three days everywhere on the Earth , " explains Achim Hahne , the Esa Smos project manager .
The wetness of soils is really one of those must - have components in temperature , humidity and precipitation forecasts .
Meteorologists see huge value in the data to improve their short and medium - term outlooks .
Modelling done following the great European heatwave in 2003 showed that if more had been known about the relative dryness of soils in the springtime , meteorologists would have been in a much better position to predict the extreme conditions that followed a few months later .
" Likewise , for hydrologists : if you see that your soils are already very wet and there is a forecast for precipitation , you know there is a potential danger of flooding because the soils are already saturated and they will not be able to take up any more water , " explains Smos mission scientist Dr Matthias Drusch .
Pulled together Ocean salinity on the other hand is a key variable , along with temperature , in driving global ocean circulation patterns .
Please turn on JavaScript .

The amount of salt in the water will help determine its buoyancy - the degree to which it tends to float or sink relative to other water around it .
The phenomenon is particularly important at high latitudes .
" This is the push - me , pull - you of the global thermohaline circulation , " says Dr Mark Drinkwater , who leads Esa 's mission science division at its technical centre in Noordwijk , Holland .
EUROPE'S SMOS SPACECRAFT 1 - Solar - array panels for power 2 - Antennas for communications
3 - Thrusters for positioning 4 - GPS antenna for location info 5 - Sun sensors for orientation 6 - Interface with launch rocket 7 - Star trackers for positioning 8 - Antenna for data downlink 9 - Payload central structure " Dense water masses that dive into the abyssal ocean drive this large - scale circulation and this helps to moderate the climate on a global basis .
We 'd like to understand better how salt and the availability of fresh water helps regulate this circulation . "
Smos only sees the top few centimetres of soils and ocean water .
There is quite a bit of noise introduced into the signal as microwaves scatter across rough ground or choppy waters .
This means the information sent down from the spacecraft will need a lot of processing .
Additional datasets , such as those from floating buoys in the case of ocean salinity , will be required to understand what might be happening below those top few centimetres .
Smos is scheduled to launch on its Rockot vehicle from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia at 0450 local time ( 0150 GMT ) on Monday .
Although an Esa mission , Smos is a major venture for France and Spain .
The instrument was built by EADS Casa Espacio in Madrid ; the spacecraft itself was assembled by Thales Alenia Space in Cannes .
SEEING WET SOILS AND SALTY WATER
Both moisture and salinity strongly affect the electrical properties of matter
All matter emits energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation The Smos signal is detected in the microwave portion of the spectrum Long wavelength reception generally requires large antenna set-ups

On September 17 , in the midst of the publicity blitz for his cinematic takedown of the capitalist order , Moore talked with Nation columnist Naomi Klein by phone about the film , the roots of our economic crisis and the promise and peril of the present political moment .
To listen to a podcast of the full conversation , click here .
Following is an edited transcript of their conversation .- - The Editors
Naomi Klein :
So , the film is wonderful .
Congratulations .
It is , as many people have already heard , an unapologetic call for a revolt against capitalist madness .
But the week it premiered , a very different kind of revolt was in the news : the so - called tea parties , seemingly a passionate defense of capitalism and against social programs .
Meanwhile , we are not seeing too many signs of the hordes storming Wall Street .
Personally , I ’m hoping that your film is going to be the wake - up call and the catalyst for all of that changing .
But I ’m just wondering how you ’re coping with this odd turn of events , these revolts for capitalism led by Glenn Beck .
Michael Moore :
I do n’t know if they ’re so much revolts in favor of capitalism as they are being fueled by a couple of different agendas , one being the fact that a number of Americans still have n’t come to grips with the fact that there ’s an African - American who is their leader .
And I do n’t think they like that .
NK :
Do you see that as the main driving force for the tea parties ?
MM :
I think it ’s one of the forces–but I think there ’s a number of agendas at work here .
The other agenda is the corporate agenda .
The healthcare companies and other corporate concerns are helping to pull together what seems like a spontaneous outpouring of citizen anger .
But the third part of this is–and this is what I really have always admired about the right wing : they are organized , they are dedicated , they are up at the crack of dawn fighting their fight .
And on our side , I do n’t really see that kind of commitment .
When they were showing up at the town - hall meetings in August–those meetings are open to everyone .
So where are the people from our side ?
And then I thought , Wow , it ’s August .
You ever try to organize anything on the left in August ?
NK :
Was n’t part of it also , though , that the left , or progressives , or whatever you want to call them , have been in something of a state of disarray with regard to the Obama administration –that most people favor universal healthcare , but they could n’t rally behind it because it was n’t on the table ?
MM :
Yes .
And that ’s why Obama keeps turning around and looking for the millions behind him , supporting him , and there ’s nobody even standing there , because he chose to take a half measure instead of the full measure that needed to happen .
Had he taken the full measure–true single - payer , universal healthcare –I think he ’d have millions out there backing him up .
NK :
Now that the Baucus plan is going down in flames , do you think there ’s another window to put universal healthcare on the table ?
MM :
Yes .
And we need people to articulate the message and get out in front of this and lead it .
You know , there ’s close to a hundred Democrats in Congress who had already signed on as co-signers to John Conyers ’s bill .
Obama , I think , realizes now that whatever he thought he was trying to do with bipartisanship or holding up the olive branch , that the other side has no interest in anything other than the total destruction of anything he has stood for or was going to try and do .
So if [ New York Congressman Anthony ]
Weiner or any of the other members of Congress want to step forward , now would be the time .
And I certainly would be out there .
I am out there .
I mean , I would use this time right now to really rally people , because I think the majority of the country wants this .
NK :
Coming back to Wall Street , I want to talk a little bit more about this strange moment that we ’re in , where the rage that was directed at Wall Street , what was being directed at AIG executives when people were showing up in their driveways –I do n’t know what happened to that .
My fear was always that this huge anger that you show in the film , the kind of uprising in the face of the bailout , which forced Congress to vote against it that first time , that if that anger was n’t continuously directed at the most powerful people in society , at the elites , at the people who had created the disaster , and channeled into a real project for changing the system , then it could easily be redirected at the most vulnerable people in society ; I mean immigrants , or channeled into racist rage .
And what I ’m trying to sort out now is ,
Is it the same rage or do you think these are totally different streams of American culture –have the people who were angry at AIG turned their rage on Obama and on the idea of health reform ?
MM :
I do n’t think that is what has happened .
I ’m not so sure they ’re the same people .
In fact , I can tell you from my travels across the country while making the film and even in the last few weeks , there is something else that ’s simmering beneath the surface .
You ca n’t avoid the anger boiling over at some point when you have one in eight mortgages in delinquency or foreclosure , where there ’s a foreclosure filing once every 7.5 seconds and the unemployment rate keeps growing .
That will have its own tipping point .
And the scary thing about that is that historically , at times when that has happened , the right has been able to successfully manipulate those who have been beaten down and use their rage to support what they used to call fascism .
Where has it gone since the crash ?
It ’s a year later .
I think that people felt like they got it out of their system when they voted for Obama six weeks later and that he was going to ride into town and do the right thing .
And he ’s kind of sauntered into town promising to do the right thing but not accomplishing a whole heck of a lot .
Now , that ’s not to say that I ’m not really happy with a number of things I ’ve seen him do .
To hear a president of the United States admit that we overthrew a democratically elected government in Iran , that ’s one of the things on my list I thought I ’d never hear in my lifetime .
So there have been those moments .
And maybe I ’m just a bit too optimistic here , but he was raised by a single mother and grandparents and he did not grow up with money .
And when he was fortunate enough to be able to go to Harvard and graduate from there , he did n’t then go and do something where he could become rich ; he decides to go work in the inner city of Chicago .
Oh , and he decides to change his name back to what it was on the birth certificate–Barack .
Not exactly the move of somebody who ’s trying to become a politician .
So he ’s shown us , I think , in his lifetime many things about where his heart is , and he slipped up during the campaign and told Joe the Plumber that he believed in spreading the wealth .
And I think that those things that he believes in are still there .
Now , it ’s kind of up to him .
If he ’s going to listen to the Rubins and the Geithners and the Summerses , you and I lose .
And a lot of people who have gotten involved , many of them for the first time , wo n’t get involved again .
He will have done more to destroy what needs to happen in this country in terms of people participating in their democracy .
So I hope he understands the burden that he ’s carrying and does the right thing .
NK :
Well , I want to push you a little bit on this , because I understand what you ’re saying about the way he ’s lived his life and certainly the character he appears to have .
But he is the person who appointed Summers and Geithner , who you ’re very appropriately hard on in the film .
And one year later , he has n’t reined in Wall Street .
He reappointed Bernanke .
He ’s not just appointed Summers but has given him an unprecedented degree of power for a mere economic adviser .
MM :
And meets with him every morning .
NK :
Exactly .
So what I worry about is this idea that we ’re always psychoanalyzing Obama , and the feeling I often hear from people is that he ’s being duped by these guys .
But these are his choices , and so why not judge him on his actions and really say , “ This is on him , not on them ” ?
MM :
I agree .
I do n’t think he is being duped by them ; I think he ’s smarter than all of them .
When he first appointed them I had just finished interviewing a bank robber who did n’t make it into the film , but he is a bank robber who is hired by the big banks to advise them on how to avoid bank robberies .
So in order to not sink into a deep , dark pit of despair , I said to myself that night , That ’s what Obama ’s doing .
Who better to fix the mess than the people who created it ?
He ’s bringing them in to clean up their own mess .
Yeah , yeah .
That ’s it .
That ’s it .
Just keep repeating it : “ There ’s no place like home , there ’s no place like home … ”
NK :
And now it turns out they were just being brought in to keep stealing .
MM :
Right .
So now it ’s on him .
NK :
All right .
Let ’s talk about the film some more .
I saw you on Leno , and I was struck that one of his first questions to you was this objection –that it ’s greed that ’s evil , not capitalism .
And this is something that I hear a lot –this idea that greed or corruption is somehow an aberration from the logic of capitalism rather than the engine and the centerpiece of capitalism .
And I think that that ’s probably something you ’re already hearing about the terrific sequence in the film about those corrupt Pennsylvania judges who were sending kids to private prison and getting kickbacks .
I think people would say , That ’s not capitalism , that ’s corruption .
Why is it so hard to see the connection , and how are you responding to this ?
MM :
Well , people want to believe that it ’s not the economic system that ’s at the core of all this .
You know , it ’s just a few bad eggs .
But the fact of the matter is that , as I said to Jay [ Leno ] , capitalism is the legalization of this greed .
Greed has been with human beings forever .
We have a number of things in our species that you would call the dark side , and greed is one of them .
If you do n’t put certain structures in place or restrictions on those parts of our being that come from that dark place , then it gets out of control .
Capitalism does the opposite of that .
It not only does n’t really put any structure or restriction on it .
It encourages it , it rewards it .
I ’m asked this question every day , because people are pretty stunned at the end of the movie to hear me say that it should just be eliminated altogether .
And they ’re like , “ Well , what ’s wrong with making money ?
Why ca n’t I open a shoe store ? ”
And I realized that [ because ] we no longer teach economics in high school , they do n’t really understand what any of it means .
The point is that when you have capitalism , capitalism encourages you to think of ways to make money or to make more money .
And the judges never could have gotten the kickbacks had the county not privatized the juvenile hall .
But because there ’s been this big push in the past twenty or thirty years to privatize government services , take it out of our hands , put it in the hands of people whose only concern is their fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders or to their own pockets , it has messed everything up .
NK :
The thing that I found most exciting in the film is that you make a very convincing pitch for democratically run workplaces as the alternative to this kind of loot - and - leave capitalism .
So I ’m just wondering , as you ’re traveling around , are you seeing any momentum out there for this idea ?
MM :
People love this part of the film .
I ’ve been kind of surprised because I thought people are n’t maybe going to understand this or it seems too hippie - dippy – but it really has resonated in the audiences that I ’ve seen it with .
But , of course , I ’ve pitched it as a patriotic thing to do .
So if you believe in democracy , democracy ca n’t be being able to vote every two or four years .
It has to be every part of every day of your life .
We ’ve changed relationships and institutions around quite considerably because we ’ve decided democracy is a better way to do it .
Two hundred years ago you had to ask a woman ’s father for permission to marry her , and then once the marriage happened , the man was calling all the shots .
And legally , women could n’t own property and things like that .
Thanks to the women ’s movement of the ’60s and ’ 70s , this idea was introduced to that relationship –that both people are equal and both people should have a say .
And I think we ’re better off as a result of introducing democracy into an institution like marriage .
But we spend eight to ten to twelve hours of our daily lives at work , where we have no say .
I think when anthropologists dig us up 400 years from now –if we make it that far–they ’re going to say , “ Look at these people back then .
They thought they were free .
They called themselves a democracy , but they spent ten hours of every day in a totalitarian situation and they allowed the richest 1 percent to have more financial wealth than the bottom 95 percent combined . ”
Truly they ’re going to laugh at us the way we laugh at people 150 years ago who put leeches on people ’s bodies to cure them .
NK :
It is one of those ideas that keeps coming up .
At various points in history it ’s been an enormously popular idea .
It is actually what people wanted in the former Soviet Union instead of the Wild West sort of mafia capitalism that they ended up with .
And what people wanted in Poland in 1989 when they voted for Solidarity was for their state - owned companies to be turned into democratically run workplaces , not to be privatized and looted .
But one of the biggest barriers I ’ve found in my research around worker cooperatives is not just government and companies being resistant to it but actually unions as well .
Obviously there are exceptions , like the union in your film , United Electrical Workers , which was really open to the idea of the Republic Windows & Doors factory being turned into a cooperative , if that ’s what the workers wanted .
But in most cases , particularly with larger unions , they have their script , and when a factory is being closed down their job is to get a big payout–as big a payout as they can , as big a severance package as they can for the workers .
And they have a dynamic that is in place , which is that the powerful ones , the decision - makers , are the owners .
You had your US premiere at the AFL - CIO convention .
How are you finding labor leadership in relation to this idea ?
Are they open to it , or are you hearing , “ Well , this is n’t really workable ” ?
Because I know you ’ve also written about the idea that some of the auto plant factories or auto parts factories that are being closed down could be turned into factories producing subway cars , for instance .
The unions would need to champion that idea for it to work .
MM :
I sat there in the theater the other night with about 1,500 delegates of the AFL - CIO convention , and I was a little nervous as we got near that part of the film , and I was worried that it was going to get a little quiet in there .
Just the opposite .
They cheered it .
A couple people shouted out , “ Right on ! ” “ Absolutely ! ” I think that unions at this point have been so beaten down , they ’re open to some new thinking and some new ideas .
And I was very encouraged to see that .
The next day at the convention the AFL - CIO passed a resolution supporting single - payer healthcare .
I thought , Wow , you know ?
Things are changing .
NK :
Coming back to what we were talking about a little earlier , about people ’s inability to understand basic economic theory : in your film you have this great scene where you ca n’t get anybody , no matter how educated they are , to explain what a derivative is .
So it is n’t just about basic education .
It ’s that complexity is being used as a weapon against democratic control over the economy .
This was Greenspan ’s argument –that derivatives were so complicated that lawmakers could n’t regulate them .
It ’s almost as if there needs to be a movement toward simplicity in economics or in financial affairs , which is something that Elizabeth Warren , the chief bailout watchdog for Congress , has been talking about in terms of the need to simplify people ’s relationships with lenders .
So I ’m wondering what you think about that .
Also , this is n’t really much of a question , but is n’t Elizabeth Warren sort of incredible ?
She ’s kind of like the anti-Summers .
It ’s enough to give you hope , that she exists .
MM :
Absolutely .
And can I suggest a presidential ticket for 2016 or 2012 if Obama fails us ?
[ Ohio Congresswoman ] Marcy Kaptur and Elizabeth Warren .
NK :
I love it .
They really are the heroes of your film .
I would vote for that .
I was thinking about what to call this piece , and what I ’m going to suggest to my editor is “ America ’s Teacher , ” because the film is this incredible piece of old - style popular education .
One of the things that my colleague at The Nation Bill Greider talks about is that we do n’t do this kind of popular education anymore , that unions used to have budgets to do this kind of thing for their members , to just unpack economic theory and what ’s going on in the world and make it accessible .
I know you see yourself as an entertainer , but I ’m wondering , do you also see yourself as a teacher ?
MM :
I ’m honored that you would use such a term .
I like teachers .
From next month , potentially thousands of teenagers at schools and colleges throughout the UK will start lessons that deal with telepathy , psychokinesis , psychic healing , near - death experiences and talking to the dead .
Surely the minds of the nation 's youth will be corrupted by all this mumbo-jumbo ?
Do n't panic .
I believe this is a development to be warmly welcomed , although I should declare a vested interest .
From September , anomalistic psychology will be offered as an option on the A2 psychology syllabus for A - level students from the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance , the largest of the three English exam boards .
For several years I have been teaching a course on anomalistic psychology at Goldsmiths , University of London , as part of our BSc in psychology .
I have also been trying , along with others , to raise the academic profile of the discipline through the work of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths and am therefore delighted by this latest development .
What exactly is anomalistic psychology and why should it be taught in our schools and colleges ?
This is the definition offered on our website :
Anomalistic psychology may be defined as the study of extraordinary phenomena of behaviour and experience , including ( but not restricted to ) those which are often labelled " paranormal " .
It is directed towards understanding bizarre experiences that many people have without assuming a priori that there is anything paranormal involved .
It entails attempting to explain paranormal and related beliefs and ostensibly paranormal experiences in terms of known psychological and physical factors .
Given its focus upon ostensibly paranormal events , it is important to distinguish anomalistic psychology from the closely related discipline of parapsychology .
This is the scientific investigation of the " paranormal " – phenomena that cannot be explained in terms of currently accepted scientific theories .
Most parapsychologists focus on three main areas : extrasensory perception ( ESP ) , psychokinesis and evidence relating to the possibility of life after death .
Alleged ESP includes telepathy ( direct mind - to - mind contact ) , clairvoyance ( picking up information from remote locations without the use of the known sensory channels ) and precognition ( foretelling the future ) .
Psychokinesis is the alleged ability to influence the outside world by willpower alone – everything from subtle effects upon random events at a subatomic level through psychic healing to spoon - bending and levitation .
Anomalistic psychologists are interested in claims relating to all of these areas , but they are also interested in attempting to explain beliefs and experiences that fall outside this strict definition of paranormal , including alien abduction claims , astrology , the Bermuda triangle , dowsing and so on – in other words , all things weird and wonderful .
Another difference between parapsychologists and anomalistic psychologists is that , in practice , the former tend to focus most of their efforts upon trying to produce evidence in support of the existence of paranormal forces whereas the latter tend to be sceptical regarding the very existence of such forces , mainly focusing instead upon non-paranormal explanations of ostensibly paranormal events .
So why should psychologists expend any effort attempting to explain such experiences ?
The most obvious reason is that if psychologists cannot explain such phenomena , they will have nothing to say about an important aspect of the human condition .
These beliefs are widespread and deep - seated .
An opinion poll published by Readers Digest in 2006 , for example , found that of 1,006 British adults surveyed , 43 % claimed to have experienced telepathy , more than half said they had experienced precognition , a fifth said they had seen a ghost , and 29 % believed near - death experiences were evidence that there was an afterlife .
Similarly high levels of belief and experience are found all over the world and throughout recorded history .
To me , this can mean only one of two things .
It might be an indication that , contrary to accepted scientific opinion , paranormal forces really do exist .
If this is the case , then the scientific community must learn to overcome its prejudice towards paranormal claims and embark upon the serious and sustained investigation of paranormal forces .
But what if conventional scientists are right to reject paranormal claims ?
If so , psychologists can learn much of value by exploring the ways in which people often believe they have experienced a paranormal event when in fact they have n't .
The challenge facing anomalistic psychologists is to explain the full range of ostensibly paranormal experiences in purely psychological terms .
It is important to realise that at this stage we cannot say with certainty whether paranormal forces exist or not .
But until parapsychologists produce a robust and replicable demonstration of paranormal effects , it is perfectly legitimate for the wider scientific community to express scepticism regarding such claims .
Even if parapsychologists ultimately succeed in producing proof of such phenomena , anomalistic psychologists would still have performed a valuable service by helping them to sort the genuine psychic stuff from the stuff that simply is n't .
Personally , I 'm not holding my breath .
After well over a hundred years of systematic research into allegedly paranormal phenomena , I do not get the sense that ultimate proof of the paranormal is anywhere nearer than it was at the outset .
Chris French is a professor of psychology at Goldsmiths , University of London , where he heads the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit .
He also edits the [ UK ] Skeptic magazine
Next month , Professor French explains how studying anomalistic psychology can help hone critical thinking skills , and challenges the " intellectual snobbishness " of some of his fellow psychologists
Revealed :
The flash nobody saw when Nasa 's £ 49 million ' bomb ' crashed into the Moon in a quest to discover water
It was billed as one of the most ambitious missions in the history of space exploration - two spacecraft smashing into the surface of Moon and creating a six - mile high cloud of dust visible from telescopes on the Earth .
Instead there was disappointment for millions as live pictures relayed back from the Moon showed no sign of an impact .
Now , however , Nasa has released a photograph showing the flash of light as its massive Centaur rocket struck the lunar surface .
[ caption ]
No wonder it was hard to spot - it looks like a pinprick made by the proverbial needle in a haystack .
But an enlargement reveals much more - the shapes of craters on the pitted lunar landscape as a brilliant blaze of light casts sudden new shadows .
The picture was released after an embarrassing day for the space agency as its scientists analysed the data and images sent back to the Earth to find telltale traces of ice in the debris .
Millions of people had watched live on the internet as the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite and its two - tonne Centaur rocket approached the Moon 's south pole as part of Nasa 's £ 49 million science experiment .

The rocket was first to crash , plunging into the pitch - black Cabeus crater at 12.31 pm yesterday .
Nasa hoped it would blast 350 tonnes of rock and dust into a cloud , leaving behind a dimple the third the size of a football pitch .
Travelling faster than a bullet , it was supposed to hit with the force of 1.5 tonnes of TNT and create a mini-crater about half the size of an Olympic pool .
The second crash , caused by the smaller LCROSS probe , was to be about one - third as strong .
[ caption ]
[ caption ]
The first crash was filmed by the LCROSS probe , which had detached from the rocket the night before .
It beamed live information to Earth from its five cameras and four scientific instruments as it flew above the impact zone before it too smashed into the surface four minutes later .
Scientists hoped to find evidence of ice at the bottom of dark craters at the Moon 's poles , where temperatures are lower than minus 170C .
However , the big spectacle Nasa had promised failed to happen .
[ caption ]
The webcast images of the crater loomed larger and larger as the satellite approached on its collision course , but still showed no sign of a flash or a cloud of debris .
Nasa officials said their instruments were working , but the planned live photos were missing .
The only evidence of an impact was a small heat signature picked up by the LCROSS probe 's infra-red camera .
Expectations by the public for live plume video were probably too high and based on pre-crash animations , some of which were not by Nasa , said project manager Dan Andrews .
Nasa 's director at the Ames Research Centre which monitored the mission Michael Bicay admitted : ' We did n't see a big splashy plume like we wanted to see . '
Prior to impact some scientists had claimed that there was chance that it would be clear within an hour of the collision whether there was water on the Moon .
Now Nasa say it will probably be two weeks before they have an answer .
Another issue regarding the impacts was the poor lighting , said Mr Andrews .
Experts said the images could be essentially ' grey against black ' .
' What matters for us is :
What is the nature of the stuff that was kicked up going in ? ' he said .
' All nine instruments were working fine and we received good data . '
The image on the left was taken moments before the rocket tank hit the Moon and , right , a heat - sensitive camera shows up in green the heat generated by the impact

Mr Andrews said the science team was poring over the information - including what are supposed to be good images from ground - based telescopes on Earth - to answer the big question :
Is there some form of water under the moon 's surface that was dislodged ?
It will probably be two weeks before scientists will be certain about the answer , he said .
Before the crash , mission scientists said there was a chance that if it was really moist under the crater , they 'd know about water within an hour .
That 's not the case now , Mr Andrews said .
People who got up before dawn to look for the crash at Los Angeles ' Griffith Observatory exchanged confused looks instead .

Jim Mahon called the celestial show ' anticlimactic ' .
' I was hoping we'd see a flash or a flare , ' he said .
A British expert who helped the American space agency Nasa pick the location near the Moon 's south pole said the lunar surface may not have reacted as expected .
But Dr Vincent Eke , from the University of Durham , stressed it was still too early to know if the mission had been a success or failure .
' If it turns out to be as dull as it looked , I 'd imagine the soil just did n't respond as was hoped to being hit , ' said Dr Eke .
' It might mean we do n't get sufficient data , which would be a shame . '

Dr Eke 's team discovered strong evidence of hydrogen - a key component of water - within cold permanently shadowed craters at the Moon 's poles , where temperatures fall to minus 200C .
Finding water , which could be used for drinking , making fuel and providing oxygen , would have major implications for the future of moon exploration .
A ready supply of water would make it far more practicable to build lunar bases or launch missions to Mars from the Moon .
Dr Eke , who led a study of data from Nasa 's 1998 Lunar Prospector mission which revealed hydrogen concentrated in darkened craters , said : ' There 's absolutely no doubt that they hit the place they were aiming for , but how material gets thrown out from the surface depends on whether it 's rocky or loose .
If you hit a sponge , you 're not going to see anything .
' It sounds like they got an infrared signal , but its too early to predict yet what they 're likely to get . '
Last month new findings from three spacecraft , including India 's Chandrayaan - 1 probe , showed that small amounts of water might be chemically bound up with the Moon 's soil .
Anthony Colaprete , principal investigator for the mission , cautioned : ' We do n't anticipate anything about presence or absence of water immediately .
It 's going to take us some time . '
If hydrogen is present as water ice , then the data would imply the top metre of the surface in these craters holds about 200,000 million litres of water in total .

Preparation for impact comes as stunning thermal images of the far side of the Moon have been revealed for the first time .
The British - made Thermoteknix camera is onboard the LCROSS , and will be one of the instruments that will study the first plume of debris before crashing itself .
' The camera has worked flawlessly for nearly 100 days , and counting , in interplanetary space , ' said Mr Colaprete .
' It provided the first thermal images of the far side of the moon and also images of Earth and the Moon from distances as great as 560,000 km and 850,000 km away , respectively . '

The MIRICLE camera was developed by pioneering thermal imaging company Thermoteknix Systems , based in Cambridge .
Dr Richard Salisbury , managing director of Thermoteknix , said : ' We are delighted to have been selected to play a critical part in Nasa 's important mission to find water on the Moon , which is vital for the future of longterm space exploration .
' We are all very proud of this achievement . '

If you are a scientist and KDE user , you may already have been impressed by the range and quality of specialist software available for your use .
But you may not be aware of the scientific graph plotting applications LabPlot ( stable KDE 3 release with a KDE 4 version in progress ) and SciDAVis ( Qt4 ) .
The two projects have announced a collaboration to share common backend code to accelerate their development .
We contacted the developers to get their take on their applications , the collaboration and the future of their projects .
Read on to find out about the future of free software plotting .
SciDAVis 0.2.3 in action SciDAVis 0.2.3 in action
The core developers we interviewed were extremely helpful in replying to a long list of questions we sent them in great detail and the following is a heavily edited summary of their responses .
If you 'd like to see exactly what they said then read the full interview .
LabPlot was started back in 2001 by Stefan Gerlach ( a scientist , lecturer and IT administrator in the department of theoretical physics at the University of Konstanz ) because he “ needed a good plotting program and could n't find any ” .
In 2006 he realized it “ was time to take the next step [...] to really open up the project ” and started working on the KDE 4 LabPlot 2 .
Stefan has another claim to fame in starting the liborigin project , a library used to import projects from the proprietary Origin program .
Alexander Semke ( working in theoretical hadron physics at GSI in Darmstadt ) joined the LabPlot project in 2008 .
He 'd previously used Grace , but “ was never happy and comfortable with this motif - based piece of software ” .
LabPlot , though not everything he wanted , “ had the biggest potential ” .
So , he joined the project : “ I contacted Stefan and offered my help .
There were no objections :-) ”
Stefan describes LabPlot as a free KDE data analysis and visualization program that “ tries to combine most of the features needed for advanced data analysis and high - quality plots under a user friendly GUI ” .
Alexander wants SciDAVis and LabPlot to be “ the plotting application the Linux users thinks of first ” .
Tilman Benkert ( a former scientist now working as a software developer in Stuttgart ) joined QtiPlot development after having to use Origin for his PhD thesis and publications due to a lack of a comparable free software alternative .
He and Knut Franke ( currently working on his diploma thesis in theoretical physics near Cologne ) forked QtiPlot in 2007 to start the SciDAVis ( Scientific Data Analysis and Visualisation ) project and they were joined by Roger Gadiou , QtiPlot 's documentation writer at the time .
As Knut puts it , the fork happened because they had “ different ideas [ than Ion Vasilief , QtiPlot 's founder and main developer ] about many things , including design goals , management of community resources and the right way to make money from a free software project ” .
Extensive sharing of code between QtiPlot and SciDAVis in the future is unlikely – Tilman explains that “ SciDAVis 0.2.0 already features an almost complete rewrite of the table and matrix code to make ( among other things ) the undo/ redo functionality possible ” .
However , Knut sees some libraries used in QtiPlot that may have an application in SciDAVis : “ namely liborigin2 ( an improved version of the liborigin project [ ... ] ) and libraries for exporting graphics from Qt to TeX and to EMF ” .
Tilman describes SciDAVis as “ an interactive cross- platform data analysis and visualization program [...] aimed at high - quality plotting of scientific data ” and says it “ strives to combine an intuitive , easy - to - use graphical user interface with powerful features ” .
Knut agrees with this and explains his ultimate vision for SciDAVis as being “ simple in contrast to completely script - driven tools like GNUPlot or matplotlib and [...] badly designed GUI tools such as Origin and Grace ” .
Additionally , SciDAVis is “ powerful , because you can write Python scripts for automating tasks ” .
However , he modestly states that “ in practically all regards , we have n't reached these grand goals yet , which is reflected by the pre-1.0 version number .
Still , SciDAVis is already usable for many tasks ” .

None of the developers get paid for working on the projects , so why do they contribute and make their work available as free software ?
There 's a general sense that it 's something they enjoy and that they want to make a contribution to the free software community .
As Knut puts it : “ I 'm using the application myself , it is rewarding to see your work being useful to other people and it's a chance to give back something to the free software community that has provided me with so many great tools ” .
Stefan also wants to “ give something back ” and Tilman enjoys “ creating something useful , practicing my coding skills and being an active part of the free software community ” .
For Alexander it 's a mixture of scratching his own itch - “ a stable and feature complete plotting software for linux for my own use ” - and giving something back .
He 's been using Linux for about ten years and “ from the very beginning [...]
I wanted to be a part of this community , but the time elapsed and nothing happened due to the lack of time ” but the “ community can only survive , if a certain amount of developers participate actively in it [...] there always was a feeling of guilt – you can help , you do have the knowledge for it [...] but you do n't contribute anything ” .
Stefan started LabPlot as free software with the aim of “ working together without any limitations ” .
He also had a desire to “ be part of this community that created software with a quality that proprietary applications hardly ever reach ” .
For SciDAVis , forking from GPL QtiPlot code meant there was never going to be a debate over the licence to use .
However , Knut “ would n't want to change the license ” .
He acknowledges that they may “ have fewer resources than a comparable commercial project , so whether it 's the best way of ' getting things done ' is probably arguable .
It is a great way of getting the right things done , though ; because you have no deadlines , marketing requirements or hierarchies that influence decisions .
If you want something changed , you just do it ” .
Equally , “ compared with selling an application as a freelance developer , you get more contributions from other people , enabling you to create something larger than what you could possible do on your own ; and you get free promotion by being included in Linux distributions , and by being featured on the dot . ;-) ” .
Tilman summarises : “ It 's basically because of the four freedoms of the free software definition ” .
The developers have n't generally been involved heavily in other projects ( except for Stefan 's work on liborigin ) , mainly due to a lack of time .
Tilman would like to be involved in other projects “ if a day had at least 48 hours . ;-) ”
Surface plots in the KDE 3 version of LabPlot Surface plots in the KDE 3 version of LabPlot
So how did the projects come to work together and what can we expect from the collaboration ?
When starting SciDAVis Tilman already knew about LabPlot but back then “ there was only version 1.x which is using Qt3 .
Since SciDAVis used Qt4 right from the start and LabPlot 1.x also did n't have an architecture similar to what we wanted , it was n't very well suited for a collaboration at first ” .
The collaboration grew out of the rewrite of LabPlot for KDE 4 and a user suggesting sharing their efforts .
As Tilman recalls , “ some time after the LabPlot guys started the KDE 4 / Qt4 - based rewrite ( version 2.x ) , a SciDAVis user pointed out that we seem to pursue similar goals .
So we contacted the labplot - devel mailing list , found out that he was right , and the collaboration started ” .
Alexander has high hopes for the collaboration : “ The hope is that this [...] will lead to the best plotting software the world has ever seen :-) ” .
Agreed is that “ a big part of the code ( primarily placed in the backend ) will be used in both projects ” and Stefan hopes this may be “ made available as libraries some day ” .
Knut comments that such a library “ could also be used for creating other ( possibly special - purpose ) interfaces and for stand - alone scripts ” .
The collaboration has stopped short of merging the projects for a few reasons .
There are ( presently at least ) different approaches to the user interface .
Alexander notes that “ SciDAVis , being a fork of QtiPlot , provides an Origin like way of doing plotting .
LabPlot has a different approach .
Both programs have their own user basis .
This fact justifies the development of two UIs supporting different workflows ” .
Knut agrees with this but sees a bigger obstacle in the choice of pure Qt or KDE in the applications : “ SciDAVis is expressly cross-platform , and the practical viability of KDE on Windows and Mac OS X remains to be proven .
LabPlot on the other hand puts some emphasis on its integration with KDE ” .
Tilman also believes that “ Mac OS and Windows users would be discouraged to use SciDAVis if they have to install KDE as a dependency ” .
Further unification down the line is not ruled out however – Alexander ponders the possibility that “ maybe we 'll rethink the current designs and end up with a common interface .
In this case we 'll still provide a KDE version of the program to better fit into the desktop ” while Stefan says “ if it turns out that no one is using the KDE frontend anymore I would of course help to support the Qt frontend ” .
In any case , Alexander argues that “ a big part of the code will be used in both projects so concentration of resources on the common goals is already achieved ” .
An early preview of a KDE 4 version of LabPlot An early preview of a KDE 4 version of LabPlot
The respective choices of Qt and KDE follow similar reasoning .
SciDAVis came from a fork of the Qt QtiPlot and so the simplest thing was to keep it Qt. For Stefan “ the main platform for LabPlot always was the free software desktop .
KDE has some nice things that are not available in Qt ( like standard dialogs , icons , communication between application , application configurations , etc. ) ” .
He 's also excited about the possibilities KDE 4 will open up : “ now that KDE 4 is supported on Mac and even on Windows platforms we may be able to have these features available there too ” .
For Alexander it was simple : “ KDE is my favorite desktop .
That 's it :-) ” .
The developers also acknowledge several other projects whose technology they put to good use : the GNU Scientific Library for math , muParser , SIP and PyQt for scripting , QwtPlot3D for 3D plotting , and Qwt for 2D although Tilman says they are “ working on replacing Qwt , as it is focused on widgets rather than export quality and has a couple of limitations due to it's backward compatibility to Qt3 ” .
Stefan hopes for more import / export libraries .
Both projects have seen a lot of rewriting of code they inherited from their predecessors .
Stefan began a direct port of LabPlot from KDE 3 to KDE 4 “ but soon realized that it would be less work and produces cleaner code to start from scratch ” .
Alexander traces these major changes back to the collaboration with SciDAVis : “ there was a very vivid discussion on labplot - devel about the future plans and it became very soon clear that it is worth rewriting the application completely .
The SciDAVis guys brought a lot of code into the LabPlot project [...] so we did n't need to start from scratch . ”
He wants to move away from the dialog based interface of LabPlot 1.x - “ the problems with dialogs are apparent – they cover the important information but they make the user click the ' Ok ' or ' Apply ' buttons all the time .
This problems can be solved by using dock widgets like in Koffice2 ” .
Tilman says that in SciDAVis too there have been a lot of changes from the QtiPlot code - “ we have been and will be replacing a lot of code completely to overcome limitations of the Qt3 heritage and the inflexible architecture ” .
With all these changes taking place , you might wonder about the current stability of the applications .
Knut says “ SciDAVis is pretty stable ; fixing bugs has been a major focus of our work but the common development code ( LabPlot 2.0 alpha ) is neither particularly stable nor anywhere near feature - complete ” .
Tilman also gives SciDAVis a vote of confidence : “ the stable SciDAVis branch is maintained separately from the bleeding edge development code and new features are merged only slowly into the stable version to keep it stable and usable at all times ” .
For LabPlot , Stefan states : “ LabPlot 1.6 is stable since 2006 ” and Alexander also believes it is “ quite usable but has some issues with stability and broken layouts at different locations in the UI [ ...]
The alpha version of LabPlot 2 is not usable at the moment ” .
Nonetheless , the brave can check out the current development code of LabPlot 2 from the project 's SVN .
Do the developers use their own applications in their daily work ?
Tilman does n't need such an application day to day , while Stefan uses GNUPlot and Grace mainly .
Knut is using SciDAVis and Alexander uses mostly a combination of Mathematica and Grace .
Using built - in data analysis tools in SciDAVis Using built - in data analysis tools in SciDAVis
LabPlot 1.6 and SciDAVis 0.2 are the releases for getting work done at the moment - but when can we expect to see LabPlot 2 and SciDAVis 0.3 arriving ?
The consensus was “ when they are ready ” although Tilman offered that it depends on when “ the 50 developers come along who help us finish them in no time ;-) ” .
There is a need for contributors then .
Tilman is glad that “ SciDAVis benefits from several contributors who write documentation , prepare binary packages , provide translations , report bugs , and suggest features .
Most needed are developers , though ” .
Stefan 's current wishes for LabPlot are “ help regarding the website and the documentation of LabPlot needs to be written someday .
Of course developers are always welcome , but also non-coders can send us bug - reports and ideas in various ways ( bug tracker , mailing lists , etc. ) ” .
Knut has a catalogue of potential jobs waiting for you : “ bugfixing / feature implementation tasks [...] documentation writing , creating packages for Linux distributions that do n't have one ( e.g. Ubuntu ) [...] translations [...] extending the web pages and / or creating wiki content .
Apart from that , if you think you can make the application or the project better / prettier / friendlier in some other way , do let us know ” .
Outside LabPLot and SciDAVis , the core developers are all using KDE on Linux , although Tilman also uses Windows for gaming and in his job .
Mostly they are on KDE 4 , except for Stefan who mainly uses KDE 3 .
When asked for their favourite KDE applications Kmail / Kontact , Amarok , Krusader , K3B , Konsole , Okular , Dragon Player , Kdevelop , Kate , Kile , Digikam , Konqueror and Kopete all got honorable mentions .
Knut admires Kmail as an example of an advanced application with an intuitive interface , something he hopes to replicate in SciDAVis : “ it is usable even for novice users , although it has some rather advanced features ” .
Reflecting on the strengths of KDE , Knut would also “ like to mention the nifty Plasma desktop at this point :-) ” .
Not too much seems to be lacking from their ideal desktop , but Stefan would like to see “ a nice application for organizing scientific papers ” .
Any final words from the four interviewees ?
Well , Stefan wanted to “ thank all people working on SciDAVis and LabPlot .
It is really nice to work with you on this project .
Hopefully we can sort all things out soon and will be able to deliver an application that was never available before :-) ” .
All seemed keen to take advantage of the opportunity for a little promotion .
If you produce graphs in your daily work ( or just for fun ) and find that KOffice and OpenOffice do n't quite do it for you and the likes of GNUPlot are a little scary then LabPlot and SciDAVis are both well worth checking out .
They 'll both give you publication quality plots of your data – so then all you 'll need is some publication - ready data .
PHILADELPHIA  A bronze statue of the Phillies ’ first World Series most valuable player , Mike Schmidt , guards the main gate to Citizens Bank Park .
The team has yet to erect a statue of the second , Cole Hamels .
His date with immortality may have to wait until the end of a career that took a dispiriting turn this season .
The Phillies are still trying to solve the enigma that is Hamels , who will oppose Andy Pettitte in Game 3 of the World Series on Saturday night in a matchup of contrasting styles .
No one is steadier than Pettitte , who has lasted at least six innings in 10 consecutive postseason starts .
No one is more inconsistent than Hamels , whose wobbly regular season has bled into the playoffs .
“ Every time he goes out and pitches , it ’s an adventure , ” Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel said of Hamels , who in three playoff starts is 1 - 1 with a 6.75 earned run average .
“ But I know he has the talent to shut them down , and I ’ve got a lot of confidence in him . ”
Manuel finished setting the Phillies ’ rotation Friday , announcing that Joe Blanton would start Game 4 on Sunday night  not Cliff Lee , the Game 1 starter , on short rest  in a move with ramifications for Hamels .
On September 30th , the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) added 76 new items to its " List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity " , for safeguarding and preservation .
The " Intangible " list is a companion to UNESCO 's World Heritage list , which focuses on physical sites worldwide .
Submitted jointly by member states Argentina and Uruguay , the " symbolic universe " of tango was among the traditions added to the list .
Tango is a deep - rooted tradition of dance , poetry and song , tied closely to the Rio de la Plata region of the two countries , and remains popular in competition , for pleasure , and for health - doctors worldwide are experimenting with tango as dance therapy to treat problems ranging from Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's disease to phobias and marital breakdowns .

Rejoice , because you are alive :
An asteroid named 2009 TM8 just passed only 216,000 miles from Earth , racing at 18,163 mph .
That 's closer than the moon .
But do n't worry , there 'll be plenty of opportunities to panic , says the JPL :
If it 's typical density , it would create a 4 kiloton explosion in the Earth 's atmosphere if it were to hit , which of course it wo n't .
You 'd expect an object of this size to fly within the orbit of the moon every few days or so .

That 's what Don Yeomans — manager of the Near - Earth Object Program Office at Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , California — said talking about 2009 TM8 and the other 7 million objects in the near - Earth space which , " needless to say we have discovered only a small fraction of them . "
Great .
At 30 feet , something like 2009 TM8 is not as big as the killer Apophis or as the superkiller that can destroy everything on Earth .
But who cares about destroying everything when this thing is large enough to annihilate Brooklyn .

Ah well , as if I needed any excuses to celebrate after this sodding Friday .
Zacapa rum , here I come . [ MSNBC ]
In the video , the married family - values crusader talks in graphic detail about women he said he slept with -- at least one of whom appeared to be a lobbyist with business before the utilities committee on which Duvall sat as vice chairman .
The sudden scandal was one more bruise for Sacramento as it lurches toward Friday , the end of a particularly unproductive legislative year , with unfinished work on such major issues as the prison crisis and the state 's wobbly water infrastructure .
And the speed with which Duvall was pushed out the door was small comfort to Capitol watchers who say the case shows the persistence of anything - goes behavior in the Legislature .
"
The use of sexual favors is just one more example of the tactics that energy companies and lobbyists have used to win favorable laws from lawmakers , " said Kathay Feng , president of California Common Cause .
As TV camera crews chased lawmakers through Capitol corridors for comment on the scandal Wednesday , the place was abuzz with gossip : other lawmakers with lobbyist mistresses , inappropriate invitations to romantic dinners , married legislators and industry officials canoodling at fundraisers and after - hours mixers .
Duvall , some said , just happened to get caught .
His remarks were videotaped during a hearing of the Assembly Appropriations Committee and aired on a KCAL television news program Tuesday night .
In the video , the socially conservative Duvall tells fellow Assemblyman Jeff Miller ( R - Corona ) in uninhibited detail about trysts with two women , neither his wife .
The KCAL report says one of the women is a lobbyist for a major utility with business before Duvall 's committee .
In the video , Duvall says her birthday is July 6 .
That matches the birth date of a Sacramento lobbyist for the San Diego - based energy firm Sempra .
Sempra issued a written statement saying that it is investigating the matter , but that its " employee has denied the speculative media reports .
"
On the tape , Duvall describes the " little eye - patch underwear " worn by one of the women .
He refers to the age gap between her and him , after a recent birthday made them 18 years apart .
" Now , you 're getting old , man , I am going to have to trade you in , " he said he told her .
And he mentions a second woman , in less detail .
" Cher , Shar , Shar -- oh , she is hot .
I talked to her yesterday .
She goes , ' So are we finished ? ' " Duvall says , adding that he replied no .
He continues : " And I go , ' You know about the other one , but the other one does n't know about you . '
" The Capitol Resource Institute , a conservative , self - described " pro-family " advocacy organization that had given Duvall a 100 % score for his voting record on issues of concern to the group , denounced the lawmaker in a statement .
" It is always disappointing when a champion of traditional values does not practice the same in his private life , " said Karen England , executive director of the institute .
Some GOP leaders were relieved by the resignation .
" Sticking around for a while would have just prolonged the agony , and he would have had the same result , " said Scott Baugh , Orange County Republican Party chairman .
Gov .
Arnold Schwarzenegger now has 14 days to call a special election to fill Duvall 's seat , which could be held as soon as the first week in November .
Orange County officials say that election will cost taxpayers between $ 330,000 and $ 440,000 .
Assembly Speaker Karen Bass ( D - Los Angeles ) said the Legislature plans to aggressively investigate Duvall and any conflicts of interest that may have resulted from affairs he boasted about .
One member of the legislative ethics panel that will oversee the inquiry said privately that there may be efforts to broaden it to include other lawmakers alleged to have intimate relations with lobbyists .
California Atty . Gen. Jerry Brown declined to comment on calls from consumer advocates that he launch a criminal investigation .
Duvall 's " votes on utility issues should be investigated to determine whether they were compromised , " said Doug Heller , executive director of Consumer Watchdog in Santa Monica .
Duvall joined other Republicans in voting several times this year against renewable energy measures opposed by Sempra Energy .
The measures would require utilities to derive significantly more electricity from solar , wind , geothermal and other renewable energy sources by 2020 .

Jordan Lapp is a writer who has won the first prize of the prestigious Writers of the Future ( WotF ) contest .
Â
Only writers very early in their career are eligible : Â after a few publications you are disqualified .
Â
Do n’t let the fact that the entrants are mostly unpublished lull you into thinking that winning is easy .
Â
Competition is fierce , and winning is a major event which can often act as a launching point for a writer ’s career .
Â
Past winners have included Nina Kiriki Hoffman , David Wolverton , K.D. Wentworth , Eric Flint , Patrick Rothfuss , J. Kathleen Cheney , and countless others whose careers have all grown in leaps and bounds after winning .
Â
Keep your eye out for Jordan .
Besides winning the Writers of the Future contest , Jordan is also the editor of Every Day Fiction , which publishes a new flash fiction story , Â 1000 words or fewer , every day .
He has also recently attended the Clarion West writer ’s workshop , which is an accomplishment in itself .
ÂÂ Jordan has blogged about both Clarion West and the Writers of the Future workshop and awards ceremony on his site Without Really Trying .
David Steffen :
In your own words , could you tell us a bit about “ After the Final Sunset , Again ” , your winning story ?
Jordan Lapp : Certainly .
The central character of “ After the Final Sunset , Again ” is a creature called the Phoenix , who is a kind of demi - god that exists to further humanity ’s goals from the grandest scale right down to the personal level .
Every morning a new Phoenix is birthed from the ashes of its predecessor , assembling a personality by copying and internalizing memories from surrounding humans , and is then sent into the world to accomplish specific goals .
On this particular day , one of the humans who is “ donating ” memories dies at the moment of the Phoenix ’s conception , thus giving her a sense of her own mortality , something no other Phoenix has ever had to confront .
Thus , she eschews her “ duties ” in favour of finding a way to survive past sunset , thus setting the story in motion .
David : I always like to hear story origins .
Â
What triggered the idea for this particular story ?
Jordan : Mortality is a recurring theme in my work .
I ’m fascinated by the tale of the ant and the grasshopper .
In the fable , the ant works hard all summer storing away supplies for the winter , while the grasshopper spends the days dancing and playing on his fiddle .
When winter arrives , the ant is safe in his home with plenty of food , while the grasshopper is left to starve in the cold .
I always ask myself , what if the ant had died at the end of the summer ?
Would he have envied the grasshopper ?
In this particular tale , I asked “ how exactly can we achieve true immortality ” ?
To answer myself , I created a character with the shortest possible lifespan and had her wrestle with the question .
David :
With this huge milestone reached , now what ?
Â
What are your goals , hopes , dreams ?
Jordan : I spoke a lot about this with the judges at Writers of the Future , all of whom are award - winning writers .
Universally , their advice was to write a novel .
Not a one suggested I keep writing shorts .
I ’ve now got enough credit to attract some attention , so I should capitalize on it by writing a novel , they said .
When people like Rob Sawyer and Dave Wolverton tell you to write a novel , you pretty much have to do it .
David :
The last winner , Patrick Lundrigan , submitted 21 times before winning .
Â
How many times did you submit before you won ?
Â
How were your results –had you made semi-finalists and finalist before ?
Jordan : My 1st place winner was my 7th entry to the contest .
Previously , I had one non-placer , three Honorable Mentions , and two Semi-Finalists .
Interestingly enough , KD Wentworth identified the same weakness in both of my Semi-Finalist critiques ( unsympathetic protagonist ) .
I worked on this aspect of my craft , and won not long after .
I believe my non-placing entry was because I failed to follow one of the unspoken ( and unwritten , unless you know where to look ) rules of the contest :
You must have speculative content on your first page or two .
David :
When you dropped this story in the mailbox , could you tell that it was different than your previous entries , or did it feel the same ?
Jordan : I actually made myself cry at the end of this story .
And I still do every time I read it .
This is what we call a Good Sign .
I knew it was better than anything I ’d written before by a fairly significant margin , but of course , I did n’t have any idea it would place .
In fact , when I re-read it after Joni called me to tell me it was a finalist , all I could see were the flaws .
Goes to show you that writers are their own worst critics .
David :
Has winning opened new doors ?
Â
Do you get more positive responses on short story submission ?
Â
Have publishers or agents approached you ?
Jordan : Yes and no .
“ After the Final Sunset , Again ” was really a bit of a fluke in terms of story quality .
Until recently , I was n’t sure how to duplicate it .
It took a stint at Clarion West to show me where I needed to shore up my craft .
I ’m only now turning out pieces that I feel equal it in quality .
Attending the workshop has opened more doors for me than the actual story .
First , I ’m discussing doing a graphic novel with Luke Eidenschink , the illustrator of Matt Rotundo ’s story “ Gone Black ” .
When his illustration was revealed , I commented that it was very true to the style you see in graphic novels .
He confessed that he wanted to produce one , and he ’d written a few stories , but he was n’t enthusiastic about them .
I mused that it would be nice if he could team up with a writer .
He asked if I knew any , and the rest is history .
I also had the pleasure of meeting Steve Savile at the workshop , a previous winner .
Steve has written 23 novels in the six years since he won , and offered to take a look at our novels once we ’d written them .
If he likes them , he ’s offered to introduce us to a few editors .
Many of the other judges made the same offer .
David :
At what point in your life did you know you wanted to be a writer ?
Jordan : I suppose I always knew I wanted to be a writer .
When did I know I wanted to give it a serious go ?
About four years ago I met Andy LeBlanc , a friend of a friend , and a brilliant writer .
At the time , I thought I was good .
Andy showed me what good was supposed to be .
I ’ve spent the last four years trying to equal him .
At this point , I still think I have a ways to go .
David :
Do you think being the editor of Every Day Fiction gave you insight into how to improve your own writing ?
Jordan : Yes and No . Yes , you learn what not to do from stories that you reject in the first paragraph .
However , there comes a point where reading slush actually hurts you .
For instance , there have been a few ideas that I would have liked to develop that I ’ve shelved because I ’ve seen similar work in the slush .
If I had n’t edited EDF , I would n’t even have known those stories existed and thus been free to develop those ideas on my own .
Also , I ’m a strong advocate of learning from writers who are better than you .
If you do n’t know any , read “ Best - Of ” Anthologies .
As a slush editor , the vast majority of the submitted work is unpublishable , and therefore of little good to my development as a writer .
On the other hand , if you ’ve never done it , I recommend reading slush .
It shows you how you stack up as a writer , gives you an eye on the competition .
It also shows you how common vampire stories really are , and that you should NEVER EVER WRITE ONE .
My recommendation is to read slush for a year or two , learn all you can , then leave it behind .
David :
Now that you ’ve been through both the WotF workshop and the Clarion workshop , how has your writing changed ?
Â
What ’s the most significant difference ?
Â Attitude ? Â Skill ?
Jordan : I was the first writer ever to win Writers of the Future and THEN attend Clarion West .
Usually it works the other way around .
At the time , I knew that the Phoenix was a fluke and that there was a definite weakness in my writing , but I did n’t know what it was .
Turns out my characterization was weak .
“ After the Final Sunset , Again ” had won because the Phoenix was such a strong character .
Since Clarion
West , I ’ve been turning out stories with very strong characters , and I think my writing has improved dramatically as a result .
David :
How did you react when you found out you were a finalist ?
Â
When you found out you ’d won ?
Jordan : I was on my honeymoon with my wife when I got Joni Labaqui ’s message .
I made a beeline for my hotel room and screamed my brains out .
Apparently , those rooms are n’t soundproof .
I found out that I won while I was at work an interminable month later .
I ’d practically gone nuts figuring out my odds of placing ( 37.5 % ) , and evaluating and re-evaluating my story .
When Joni finally phoned , I screamed my brains out .
Apparently , my office is n’t soundproof either .
David :
You also attended Clarion West in the past month or two , an application - based writer ’s workshop .
Â
Any advice for getting in ?
Jordan :
This is a fairly tough question .
My application story was my Writers of the Future winning story , so that certainly did n’t hurt my application ( though they did n’t know it had won when I submitted it ) .
They also ask for an application essay , but admission is judged solely on the basis of that story .
What they ’re looking for are writers that are at a place where they know the basics , but need a small push to send them over the edge .
To that end , write a challenging story .
Have a unique voice .
Have something to say .
Fantasy is the perpetually undiscovered country .
Blaze a trail into the wilderness and stake a claim .
David :
Are there any stories coming up in Every Day Fiction that you ’re particularly looking forward to ?
Jordan :
To be honest , Camille Gooderham Campbell has taken over most of the day - to - day responsibilities at EDF .
Between Clarion West and Writers of the Future I ’ve been run off my feet with writerly responsibilities .
My role has become more promotional .
To that end , I ’m working on a few ideas that I hope will really boost the magazine ’s profile .
David :
Is there anything you ’d like to see more in the slush pile of Every Day Fiction ?
Jordan : Original work .
Lord , do n’t send us another vampire story .
You know , we never get enough genre work , or rather , what we do get is generally of poor quality .
I suppose this is because , with the amount of space that must be devoted to setting , writing sympathetic characters becomes an exercise in word management .
Because of this , a well - written horror , fantasy , or science fiction piece jumps off the page at us .
David :
If you could only give one piece of advice to aspiring writers , what would it be ?
Jordan : Find writers who are better than you are and learn from them .
In person is better , but if you do n’t know any and live someplace remote , study Best - Of anthologies .
Finish everything you write , send your work out , and never give up .
David :
What ’s your favorite thing to do that ’s not related to writing ?
Jordan : Spending time with my wife .
I was lucky enough to meet a loving , supportive woman who encourages me to pursue my passions .
When I ’m not writing , we ’re generally bike riding , watching movies , renovating our house , and generally laughing our way through life .
David :
If you could meet any fictional character in person , who would it be ?
Jordan : I ca n’t think of a single one .
The problem is that if a writer is doing a good job , what they ’ve created on the page can never be equaled by a face to face meeting .
On the page you have direct access to a character ’s innermost thoughts and emotions .
After that kind of experience , a direct meeting would feel so limiting .
David :
What was the last book you read ?
Jordan : I ’m halfway through dozens of books , mostly by Clarion West instructors or Writers of the Future judges .
Of course , the last book I ’ve read–as of this interview–is Writers of the Future XXV itself .
To be honest , I ’ve read several previous volumes and always found a couple of stories that I flat out would n’t have picked to be in the anthology , but that ’s not so this time .
Of course , I ’m probably biased , but this year is the strongest one I ’ve read .
My prediction is that at least one story will find its way into a Best - Of anthology .
David :
Your favorite book ?
Jordan : I ’ve been reading a lot of shorts these days .
Of those , “ The Monkey ” by Stephen King is the only story I ’ve ever read that scared the daylights out of me .
It was in the anthology “ Dark Descent ” edited by David G Hartwell which should be required reading for any writer of short fiction .
In terms of novel length works , Lloyd Alexander ’s “ Taran Wanderer ” will always hold a special place in my heart .
Heinlein ’s Starship Troopers , Card ’s Ender ’s Game , and The Scar by China Mieville are all excellent for different reasons .
David :
Who is your favorite author ?
Jordan : I do n’t really have “ favourite authors ” so much as favourite stories .
I suppose the last writer to absolutely blow my mind was Stephen King with his Gunslinger novels .
One of the greatest things about the first book in King ’s opus was the opening line , “ The man in black fled across the desert , and the gunslinger pursued . ”
That , perhaps , is the most powerful first line I ’ve ever read .
The whole novel is contained in that line .
David :
What was the last movie you saw ?
Jordan : Ugh .
It was “ Public Enemies ” starring Johnny Depp .
The movie was terrible in terms of both the writing and the cinematography .
As far as good movies , it was “ Once Upon a Time In the West ” .
Andy LeBlanc and I are making a study of classic films to see what made them work , and perhaps incorporate those qualities into our own writing .
I have a feeling you ’ll be seeing Western influences in my upcoming work .
David :
What is your favorite movie ?
Jordan : I have several favourite movies .
The Last Unicorn is amazing because I enjoyed it for the artwork and fantasy elements as a child , and now love it as an adult because of its incredible depth .
The book , by Peter S. Beagle is an absolute masterpiece .
I also liked TRON ( I took up a career as a video game programmer because of this movie ) , The Prestige , The Sixth Sense , and Watership Downs ( though the book is far , far better .
Maybe the best ever written in the English language ) .
Generally I love movies that are challenging in terms of theme , or that have excellent kung - fu .
I suppose in that Venn Diagram , the Matrix lies squarely in the middle .
David :
Do you have any works in progress that you ’d like to tell us about ?
Jordan : I ’m currently adapting my winning Writers of the Future story into a novel ( in the outlining stages ) .
I ’ve also placed work in the Time in a Bottle Anthology , and recently written the foreword of Michael Ehart ’s excellent novel “ Tears of Ishtar ” .
Michael is a good friend and excellent writer of Sword and Sorcery a la Howard or Moorcock , and I was flattered to receive the invitation to write the foreword .
David :
Thank you for taking the time for the interview , Jordan .
Â
I ca n’t wait to read the new volume of Writers of the Future .
Also , thank you to Frank Dutkiewicz and Anthony Sullivan for your contributions to this interview .
The impulse to focus on the house 's signature shade of hot pink was a good one , and that 's how the collection began , with a tight minidress draped over one shoulder .
There were a lot of minidresses in this show , many of them so short , they seemed to be inviting a TMZ crotch shot .
The second design element was the heart , in a repeating sequin pattern on one jacket and repeating cutouts with sequins peeking out from underneath on another .
These were partytime clothes -- ruched leggings in bright blue and purple ( Lohan has her own line of leggings too -- 6126 ) , pink harem pants and bandeau bikini tops with heart - shaped charms nestled between the breasts .
But by far the worst offense were the glittery heart - shaped pasties worn under suit jackets .
In a word , why ?
They were just begging to be laughed at .
A larger version of the heart pasties also turned up on some of the models ' heads .
Nothing in the collection evidenced any real skill or discernible design work .
In fact , you could probably find a lot of it already on the shelves at Kitson .
I did hear someone remark that they liked the shoes , which had narrow , stair - step heels .
Still , there 's really no defending this misguided collection , other than as a desperate bid for attention from a house that has n't mattered since its founder retired in 2004 .
I just do n't think it 's the kind of attention they had in mind .

Foursquare went live in St. Louis last week , and it seems to me it ’s people are using it as an extension of Twitter , rather than its own separate social network .
The concept is great , but I do n’t think some people “ get it ” .
Foursquare has a very open platform , but has a much more specific use that separates itself from other social networking tools , therefore users must use their own discretion .
I ’ve put together my personal preferences and some suggestions to other users .
Obviously there are exceptions to these , they are just suggestions .
Who I friend :
My rule of thumb is this , If I ’m not interested on hanging out with you , I ’m not your “ friend ” .
Do n’t take that the wrong way .
Where I check in :
Places of interest .
I ask myself , “ Does anyone care that I ’m here or would anyone want to come here ? ” .
If the answer is no for both , then I do n’t post it .
I ’m sure no one cares if I visit a gas station , grocery store , McDonald ’s , home or work ( Unless work is someplace you spend your free time or want visitors ) .
My suggestions to users :
Do n’t check it at your work or home .
Tag venues so others know what to expect .
Suggest tips on good dishes and drink specials .
Do n’t check in at the same place twice in one visit to say something site specific .
Either add a tip , tag it or use the “ Shout ” function .
Foursquare is a completely unique social service , and should be treated as such .
I do n’t want 100 +
Foursquare friends and I do n’t want to know their every move .
Obviously you can make up your own mind and do whatever you want , but this is how I find value in it , and might be why I ’m not your “ friend ” .
How do you use Foursquare ?
What are your pet peeves ?
Am I taking this too seriously ?
Working - class gay men , police stand off in Guangzhou
THERE’S THE RUB
Police say they ’re not against gay men , but oppose sex in public restrooms .
Young gay men say they do n’t have many other options
AP
When the police descend on People ’s Park and shoo away the gay men gathered there , the men usually scatter to avoid trouble .
But recently , about 50 or so confronted five officers who began a sweep and finally forced a police retreat after a heated but nonviolent standoff .
“ I told them they might not like us , but they ca n’t stop us from coming here , ” said AIDS activist Xiao Mu , who was handing out condoms and pamphlets about safe sex when the police arrived on Aug. 25 .
“ We have a right to be in the park . ”
Though mostly ignored by state - run media , news of the incident in the southern city of Guangzhou — also known as Canton — spread quickly on the Internet and became a hot topic in gay chat forums nationwide .
Some in China ’s gay community see it as a sign of a new sense of empowerment and a burgeoning awareness of their rights .
Members of the community have had minor confrontations with the authorities before in other cities .
But usually the disputes play out in a low - key way , without much resistance to sweeps , said Lu Jun , founder of a Beijing - based group that fights discrimination against people with hepatitis B .
“ I ’ve never heard of something like this happening anywhere else , ” Lu said about the Guangzhou incident .
“ I think what happened marks great progress for homosexuals . ”
Gay activist Dao Dao in Shanghai also applauded those in Guangzhou for standing up for their rights .
But he said he doubted it was the right long - term strategy .
He favors striving for wider acceptance by being model citizens , rather than being outspoken and confrontational .
“ We do n’t do any harm to the society .
I think that ’s the best way to show all the people that we are good people and nothing different , ” said Dao Dao , who works in finance and also helps organize gay parties , sporting events and other activities .
Gay rights have come a long way since the years just after the 1949 communist revolution when homosexuality was considered a disease from the decadent West and feudal societies , and gay people were persecuted .
China waited until 1997 to decriminalize sodomy .
Homosexuality was finally removed from the official list of mental disorders in 2001 .
But still , there are no widely accepted estimates of the number of gay people in China .
This year has already been an eventful one for gay rights .
In June , the first gay pride festival was held in Shanghai , the nation ’s commercial capital .
Later in the month , the five - day Beijing Queer Film Festival was held — an event that police blocked in 2001 and 2005 .
But as those cities showed signs of being more tolerant , Guangzhou authorities were starting to crack down in People ’s Park — a shady oasis of trees and gazebos in the middle of the muggy , traffic - congested city .
The park is popular with youngsters who play badminton or retirees practicing their ballroom - dancing moves to stereos blasting out tunes like Sukiyaki , the Japanese ballad that became a hit in the US in the 1960s .
For years , the park has also been a favorite hangout for gay men , especially among the young or working - class who ca n’t afford the bars and restaurants around town that cater to the community .
The men — many dressed in tank tops and tight jeans — stroll around the park or sit together on a long line of stone benches .
Nearby is a public restroom , where some men have sex — a source of much of the friction with the police .
On Aug. 25 , the police moved in .
“ They told us , ‘ You just leave and do n’t come back .
This is People ’s Park , not Homosexual Park , ’ ” said Xiao , who is a short and thin and wears large black - framed glasses .
“ That made me extremely mad .
He was saying gays are n’t human . ”
Xiao said several men quietly walked away , but he stood his ground and people gathered around as he argued with police .
Some who left wandered back after a few minutes , and Xiao estimated the crowd swelled to about 100 people , including several heterosexual passers - by who supported him .
The police declined to be interviewed .
An officer at the front desk of the neighborhood ’s main police station grew agitated when asked about the incident , and with a loud voice he ordered a reporter to leave the station .
A park policeman , who declined to give his name because he ’s not authorized to speak to the media , denied the police were unfair or discriminating against gays .
“ The problem is that they do things in the public bathroom .
Some of them will grope each other on the park benches , ” the policeman said .
“ People see them doing these things and it makes them feel uncomfortable .
Then they call the police . ”
The officer added that those who have been asked to leave the park or have been taken to the station for questioning are repeat offenders who constantly cause trouble .
But gay activist Ah Qiang disagrees with the police .
He said in March police started rounding up random groups of men in the park .
They were marched to the police station where they would be forced to write a statement about their activities before being released without being charged , he said .
Police often called the men gay lao or ji lao — a pejorative term in the local Cantonese dialect , he said .
However , the activist acknowledged that some people do misbehave in public .
But he added : “ The police should deal with individual cases .
They should n’t punish a whole group of people . ”
There ’s a deep division within the gay community about who is to blame .
Shi Heng , a gay hotel worker who hangs out at the park , found himself in the middle of a fierce debate with younger men during a recent afternoon when he insisted that the cause of the trouble is the men who have sex in the restrooms .
“ People are being too crude .
We simply can’t behave like this in a public place , ” said the 47 - year - old man .
But another man in his 20s disagreed with Shi and said young men like him had few options .
“ We ca n’t afford to rent a room , and many of us live with our parents , ” said the man , who declined to be named because he feared it would cause trouble at home and work .
“ Where are we supposed to have sex ? ”
Kurt Cobain died in 1994 of a self - inflicted gun shot wound Former Nirvana members Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl have said they are " dismayed and very disappointed " at how Kurt Cobain is used in a video game .
They do not agree that the band 's late frontman can be used to play songs by other artists in the new Guitar Hero .
In a joint statement , they said they " did n't know " Cobain 's character in the game could be used to play any kind of song the player wants .
Game makers Activision said permission had been granted by Cobain 's estate .
Legal action
The company said Cobain 's widow , Courtney Love , had provided a written agreement which allowed the singer 's likeness as a fully playable character in the fifth game of the series .
Along with the two Nirvana hits , Smells Like Teen Spirit and Lithium , Cobain 's character can also be selected to play 85 tracks by other artists .
" While we were aware of Kurt 's image being used with two Nirvana songs , we did n't know players have the ability to unlock the character , " said Novoselic and Grohl .
" This feature allows the character to be used with any kind of song the player wants .
We urge Activision to do the right thing in ' re - locking '
Kurt 's character so that this wo n't continue in the future . "
Love has also criticised the game on Twitter and has threatened to sue Activision .
The star said she " never signed " off the game and claimed , " there 's been four breaches of a very strict contract " .
She added : " This trust are my employees , but whatthey [ sic ] are tryong [ sic ] to do is sickening , and they need to be fired , and repairations [ sic ] need made . "

( CNN ) --
The girlfriend of former NFL quarterback Steve McNair had grown frustrated with their relationship and was struggling with financial difficulties in the days before she killed him and herself in July .
Steve McNair , former NFL quarterback , was a married father of four when he was killed last summer .
Details of their relationship were revealed in a case summary released by Nashville police Monday .
McNair , 36 , and Sahel Kazemi , 20 , were found fatally shot in a condominium in downtown Nashville on July 4 .
Police have since ruled their deaths a murder - suicide .
" My life is just s--- and I should end it , " Kazemi said the night before the couple were found dead , according to Sonya New , her shift manager at a Dave & Busters restaurant .
New also said Kazemi was not her usual self and seemed down .
Though McNair was a married father of four , he was seeing Kazemi and at least one other woman , Leah Ignagni , according to Nashville police .
McNair had spent the night at Ignagni's apartment on July 2 , two nights before he was killed , Ignagni told police .
On the morning of July 4 , Kazemi texted McNair , saying she was stressed and needed money to pay bills .
" Baby I might have a break down im so stressed , " Kazemi said in one text message .
" baby i might need to go to the hospital .
baby whats wrong w( ith ) me i can hardly breath( e ) . "
Chris Wall , who provided security for McNair and his family , told police he knew about McNair 's relationship with Kazemi .
McNair was tired of her calling when he was with his family , Wall said .
Kazemi continued to text McNair throughout the day , asking for money and when she could see him next .
" baby what are u doing , " Kazemi asked .
" At the pool with the kids .
I got the guy transferring the money , " McNair replied .
At 4:04 p.m. on July 3 , Kazemi said , " baby I have to be w( ith ) u 2nite .
I dnt care where . "
The messages continued for more than eight hours before McNair said he was on his way to the condo .
He had told Kazemi earlier that he would n't leave the house " til the kids fall asleep . "
McNair and Kazemi exchanged a final series of messages early July 4 , when he asked her to leave the front door to the condo open for him .
A final message , sent at 1:14 a.m. , simply said , " its open . "
About 12 hours later , a friend of McNair 's found their bodies .
All About Murder and Homicide
We ’ve reported before about the legal spat between Mobigame , makers of fine indie game Edge , and Tim Langdell , who appears to make his money by suing anyone daring to use the name Edge in a videogame , and makes rather spurious claims regarding how he ‘ spawned ’ almost any major property with the word ‘ Edge ’ in its title , including Edge magazine by Future Publishing , Marvel comic Edge , and , er , 1997 Anthony Hopkins movie turkey The Edge .
( He ’s also laughably stated in the past how he has come to an ‘ understanding ’ with a guitarist of a very popular rock band . )
TIGSource has a great overview of the madness .
Edge returned to the App Store recently , and Langdell will next year be battling EA , a company that ’s had enough .
Rather than just dealing with issues relating to EA game Mirror ’s Edge — Langdell started advertising a game called Mirrors ( a game by ) Edge , which still does n’t exist , and yet was in no way an effort to promote mark confusion — EA ’s aiming to have Langdell stripped of all his Edge - related marks .
EA ’s documentation cites numerous examples of Langdell filing out - of - date and falsified specimens , and the fact Edge Games is n’t a viable commercial concern .
( ChaosEdge offers running commentary regarding Langdell ’s so - called commercial concerns — a Mythora ‘ reissue ’ they bought from Edge Games was a home - made burned disc ; and despite Langdell claiming its game Racers had sold out , the second purchase ChaosEdge made days later had an order number only one higher than their pre-Racers order . )
Last month , company spokesman Jeff Brown said : “ While this seems like a small issue for EA , we think that filing the complaint is the right thing to do for the developer community . ”
Sadly , Langdell still wo n’t back down .
We today heard Mobigame ’s Edge is again under threat , with Apple giving the company five days to respond to yet another threat from Langdell .
If you ’ve an iPhone or iPod touch , get in there fast , because chances are that Edge is about to vanish yet again , and it may take an EA battering in court next year for Langdell to finally stop harassing indie developers .
Edge is available on the App Store for $ 4.99 .
It ’s really good , so go and buy it before it ’s too late .
A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS
There is a figure of Moses which was used as the centerpiece of Pope Julius ’ II tomb .
The artist Michelangelo , sculptured that statue and the Catholic Church proudly displays it now in the Church of St. Peter in Rome .
What makes this statue so different is that Michelangelo put horns on top of Moses ’ head .
This is but one of many statues and pictures of Moses portraying Moses with horns .
Why did people 450 + years ago make this assumption ?
In the Jewish Exodus story , Moses comes down from the mountain after getting the second set of tablets , the Ten Commandments , from god ― the Invisible Man in the Sky .
The bible story relates that Moses did n’t know that his face was radiant because he had spoken to God .
" ... when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses ' hand , when he came down from the mount , that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him .
( Exodus 34:29 KJV )
And it came to pass when Moses descended from Mount Sinai , and the two tablets of the testimony were in Moses ' hand when he descended from the mountain and Moses did not know that the skin of his face had become radiant while He had spoken with him ( Exodus / Shemot 34:29 Judaica Press Complete Tanach )
In Hebrew , the word for “ radiant ” is heban .
קָרַן , an expression meaning horns ( קַרְנַיִם ) .
According to Rashi ( 1040 - 1105CE ) , the Jewish preeminent biblical commentator , this word was used because " light radiates and protrudes like a type of horn . "
Jews claim that when the Hebrew bible was translated into Latin ( not Greek ) , the translation was that Moses ’ face “ was horned . ”
In fairness , this explanation seems stretched , because a man 's face is large , round or oval in shape .
If radiant , the whole face would glow , not in two separate protrusions column - like horns .
Specifically , the Septuagint or Greek version of the Hebrew bible ( 3rd - 1st century BCE ) translates this phrase as " his face was glorified . "
Conversely , Saint Jerome 's Latin Vulgate translation ( 5th century CE ) was cornuta esset facies sua " his face was horned . "
The Christian New Testament has a reference to Moses appearance :
" ... Moses , which put a veil over his face , that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished . "
( 2 Corinthians 3:14 KJV )
" Moses , who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away . "
( 2 Corinthians 3:14 NIV )
A visual representation of Moses with horns may have contributed to people 's fears that Jews have horns , just like artist representations of the mythical Christian devil .
The words in the New Testament are where non-Jews get the impression that Jews are born from the devil and belong in hell ( another Christian invention ) .
For example , the book of John has Jesus saying :
“ Ye are of your father the devil ... " ( John 8:44-45 KJV )
" Men in general are quick to believe that which they wish to be true . " - Julius Caesar ( 100 BCE - 44 BCE ) , De Bello Gallico

Texas Teacher Stabbed to Death by Student in Classroom Todd Henry , 50 , worked as a music therapist in Texas public school .
Sept. 23 , 2009  -- A
Texas teacher who helped children with special needs by playing them the guitar was stabbed to death by a juvenile student at a high school in Tyler on Wednesday morning , authorities said .
Todd Henry , 50 , was stabbed in the neck and shoulders in a classroom at John Tyler High School a little before 9 a.m. CDT , according to police .
The attacker , who is in custody , has not yet been identified .
Police have n't said whether the suspect was a special - needs student or what led up to the attack .
Henry was in the classroom with a paraprofessional and three students , one of whom is the alleged killer , said Randy Reed , superintendent of the Tyler Independent School District .
Following the incident , Henry was rushed to a local hospital .
The school was placed on lockdown and the student was taken in to custody by school district police .
Reed said the attack was " not gang related or racially motivated .
All reports suggest this was a random act by a single student . "
Henry , a father and a grandfather , was an " accomplished and respected guitarist " who worked as a music therapist with special - needs students at the school , his brother Jody Henry told the Associated Press .
Classes were cancelled at 10:45 a.m. , when many parents arrived to pick up students from the building .
Local police are cooperating with the school district's own police force , Don Martin , spokesman for the Tyler Police Department told ABC News.com .
The accused student " has been taken to Smith County Detention Center , a juvenile facility , " Martin said .
The local Tyler Morning Telegraph reported the police scanner chatter " indicated that a fight escalated to the point that [ school district ] police had to call for backup from Tyler Police . "
Locals in Tyler were reeling from the shock , some of them seeking solace in New Life Community Church across the street from the high school .
" He was a very good friend of mine and we all loved him very much .
Him and his family are in my prayers , as well as the student and the student 's family that was involved in the altercation , " Tiffany Channon told ABC News affiliate KLTV .
Washington , DC , October 18 , 2006 - The CIA 's reliance on high - level informants including the President of Mexico for " intelligence " about the student protest movement in 1968 that culminated in the infamous Tlatelolco massacre misled Washington about responsibility for the repression , according to documents obtained by journalist Jefferson Morley and posted today on the Web by the National Security Archive at George Washington University .
The declassified U.S. documents reveal CIA recruitment of agents within the upper echelons of the Mexican government between 1956 and 1969 .
The informants used in this secret program included President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz and future President Luis Echeverría .
The documents detail the relationships cultivated between senior CIA officers , such as chief of station Winston Scott , and Mexican government officials through a secret spy network code - named " LITEMPO . "
Operating out of the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City , Scott used the LITEMPO project to provide " an unofficial channel for the exchange of selected sensitive political information which each government wanted the other to receive but not through public protocol exchanges . "
This posting also includes the article " The CIA 's Eyes on Tlatelolco , " written by Morley and published in the October 1 , 2006 edition of Proceso magazine .
The article uses first - hand accounts from former associates , friends and family of Winston Scott , detailing how Scott relied on his friendships with Díaz Ordaz , Echeverría and other senior Mexican officials to inform Washington about the student movement whose demands challenged the government 's monopoly on power .
The newly - declassified U.S. government documents and interviews shed new light on the CIA reporting on the terrible events of 1968 .
Winston Scott 's reliance on powerful government officials for information led to one - sided reporting on the student movement of 1968 , ending in the 2 October massacre in Tlatelolco .
Scott relied on the government 's version of the Tlatelolco killings , reporting as " intelligence information " its fictional accounts of the events .
" When the Tlatelolco crisis exploded , the CIA 's Mexico station could not deliver the goods , " said Kate Doyle , Director of the Archive 's Mexico Project .
" Jefferson Morley 's important research reveals that instead of independently collecting information and analyzing what happened , the agency served as stenographer for its friends and allies in the Mexican government .
As a result , the CIA helped protect Mexico 's ruling party from bearing responsibility for the massacre , and delivered a muddled and misleading account of it to Washington . "
LITEMPO : The CIA 's Eyes on Tlatelolco
By Jefferson Morley
Newly - declassified U.S. government documents and interviews shed new light on what the American Central Intelligence Agency knew -- and did not know - - about the terrible events of 1968 in Mexico City .
Winston Scott , the CIA 's top man in Mexico at the time , was a brash and charming 59 - year - old American who operated out of the U.S. Embassy on Reforma .
The CIA documents , now publicly available in the U.S. National Archives in Washington , show Scott relied on his friendship with President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz ; then - Secretary of Gobernación Luis Echeverría ; and other senior officials to inform Washington about the student movement whose demands challenged the government 's monopoly on power .
The documents , reported here for the first time , show that Scott recruited a total of 12 agents in the upper echelons of the Mexican government between 1956 and 1969 .
His informants included two presidents of Mexico , and two men who were later indicted for war crimes .
------------------------------
The CIA 's code name for Scott 's spy network was LITEMPO .
The letters LI represented the Agency 's code for Mexican operations ; TEMPO was Scott 's term for a program that was , in the words of one secret Agency history , " a productive and effective relationship between CIA and select top officials in Mexico . "
Begun in 1960 , LITEMPO served as " an unofficial channel for the exchange of selected sensitive political information which each government wanted the other to receive but not through public protocol exchanges . "
( Note 1 )
CIA Chief of Station Winston Scott in an undated family photo taken in Mexico
Scott 's agents were identified in CIA files by specific numbers .
LITEMPO - 1 was Emilio Bolanos , a nephew of Gustavo Díaz Ordaz , Minister of Gobernación and then President in the 1960s .
Díaz Ordaz was LITEMPO - 2 . Like his predecessor Adolfo Lopez Mateos , he was a personal friend of Scott's .
Both men attended Scott 's wedding to his third wife in December 1962 , with Lopez Mateos standing in as padrino , or chief witness , to the ceremony .
How much Scott paid his LITEMPO informants is not disclosed in the records , but at least two CIA officials thought it was excessive .
In a review of the LITEMPO program in 1963 , the chief of the clandestine services Mexico desk griped that " the agents are paid too much and their activities are not adequately reported . "
( Note 2 ) One colleague of Scott 's said the LITEMPO agents were " unproductive and expensive . "
( Note 3 )
Scott ignored such complaints .
He met frequently with his agents who he called LITEMPOs and reported to Washington about his contacts .
In October 1963 , he gave Bolanos , LITEMPO - 1 , a " personal gift " of 1,000 rounds of .223 Colt automatic ammunition to pass to Díaz Ordaz .
In his monthly report to CIA headquarters , Scott told his superiors that " changes to the LITEMPO program may be necessary when LITEMPO - 2 becomes the presidential candidate " in 1964 .
( Note 4 )
Scott also cultivated Fernando Gutiérrez Barrios in the Dirección Federal de Seguridad who was known as LITEMPO - 4 . ( Note 5 ) Scott had known El Pollo since at least 1960 .
Gutiérrez Barrios assisted Scott in the panicky days after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22 , 1963 , by interrogating Mexicans who had contact with accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald .
Another one of Scott 's agents , according to CIA records , was Luis Echeverría , a sub-secretary at Gobernación in the early 1960s , who is identified as LITEMPO - 8 . ( Note 6 ) Echeverría started out handling special requests from the American government for visas to assist Cuban travelers seeking to escape Fidel Castro 's socialist revolution .
( Note 7 ) As Echeverría rose in the Mexican hierarchy , so did his importance to his American friend .
He became an occasional dinner guest at Scott 's home in Lomas Chapultepec .
In 1966 , an unidentified subordinate of Gutiérrez Barrios , known as LITEMPO - 12 , began meeting daily with one of Scott 's most trusted officers , George Munro , to pass copies of reports from his own agents .
According to one CIA document , LITEMPO - 12 became one of the U.S. Embassy 's most productive sources of intelligence on " the CP [ Communist Party ] , Cuban exiles , Trotskyites , and Soviet bloc cultural groups . "
( Note 8 )
In the summer and fall of 1968 , LITEMPO assumed even greater importance in Mexico City and Washington as a spontaneous student movement convulsed the streets of the capital .
Scott relied on his allies at the top of the Mexican government to monitor and understand the unfolding events that culminated in the night of gunfire that claimed scores of lives in Tlatelolco Plaza on October 2 , 1968 .
The story of LITEMPO is a previously unknown dimension to that tragic crime .
One summer night in 1968 , one of Scott 's sons went out to dinner in downtown Mexico City with his mother and stepfather , whom he called " Scottie . "
" After we finished , " the son recalled in an interview years later , " we were walking back to the car when Scottie said , ' Look they have music down there . '
We were passing by what they call a pena , a coffee shop type of place .
He said , ' Let 's go listen . ' "
While politically conservative , Scott was socially outgoing , adept at making friends and conversation .
" So we 're sitting there drinking our beers and someone was singing a song about Castro that was popular at that time .
The chorus went , " ¿Fidel , Fidel , que tiene Fidel / Que los Americanos no pueden con el ? "
" And Scottie 's feeling good , so he starts singing along .
He 's holding his beer up and going , " ¿Fidel , Fidel , que tiene Fidel / Que los Americanos no pueden con el ? "
According to the son , Scott 's wife said , " Scottie do you know what they 're saying ? "
" Oh , something about Fidel , " he replied .
" She says ' Yeh , they 're saying , you can't handle him . "
" Scottie said something like , it 's only a song , and she said , ' You know , if somebody did n't know any better and saw you singing here , they'd think you were some kind of communist . ' "
Scott just laughed , the son recalled .
On the job , Scott obsessed about the possible influence of communism and Cuba in Mexico but reluctantly conceded that the student movement was not communist controlled .
That summer the U.S. Embassy compiled a list of 40 separate incidents of student unrest since 1963 .
Twenty three of the incidents were motivated by school grievances ; eight protests concerned local problems .
Six were inspired by Cuba and Vietnam .
Four of the demonstrations put forth demands related to the authoritarianism of the Mexican system .
( Note 9 )
In June 1968 , U.S. Ambassador Fulton " Tony " Freeman called a meeting with Scott and other members of the Embassy staff .
France had just been engulfed by student demonstrations so massive that the government fell .
Freeman wanted to discuss whether the same thing could happen in Mexico .
Because of his contacts in Los Pinos ( the Mexican White House ) , Scott 's views carried a lot of weight .
Scott and his colleagues concluded Díaz Ordaz could maintain control .
" The government has diverse means of gauging and influencing student opinion , and it has shown itself able and willing , when unrest exceeds what it considers acceptable limits , to crack down decisively , to date with salutary effects , " Freeman cabled the State Department after the meeting .
" Furthermore , student disorders , notwithstanding the wide publicity they receive , simply lack the muscle to create a national crisis . "
( Note 10 )
Scott spoke frequently to Díaz Ordaz .
Ferguson Dempster , a top British intelligence operative in Mexico and a longtime friend of Scott 's , told one of Scott 's sons that Scott delivered a daily report on " enemies of the nation " to the Mexican president .
Philip Agee , then a young officer in Scott 's operation , told much the same story when he broke with the agency a few years later and published a book exposing its operations .
Agee described Scott 's service to Los Pinos as " a daily intelligence summary " with a section on activities of Mexican revolutionary organizations and communist diplomatic missions , and a section on international developments based on information from CIA headquarters .
Scott , in turn , relayed the views of Díaz Ordaz and other top officials to Ambassador Freeman and to CIA headquarters .
The Mexican authorities ' public position " regarding disturbances is they were instigated by leftist agitators for purpose [ of ] creating [ an ] atmosphere [ of ] unrest , " Freeman said in a cable to Washington .
" Embassy concurs in this general estimate . "
But Scott 's inclination to see the student movement as a communist controlled rebellion was not borne out by the station 's reports from its many informants .
Declassified CIA records show that Scott had a network of sources at the UNAM ( National University of Mexico ) and other schools called LIMOTOR that kept him well - informed about campus politics .
( Note 11 ) He noted that students at the UNAM wrested control of student activities from the communist youth faction by creating a new National Strike Council .
" Those who are advocating violent action are still in the minority , " ( Note 12 ) he reported .
In conversation with his LITEMPO agents , Scott realized that the desire of top Mexican officials to blame the communists for the burgeoning protests in the streets coexisted with a kind of passive uncertainty about what was really going on .
In late August Díaz Ordaz named Luis Echeverría to head a new " Strategy Committee , " created to design the government 's response to the student disturbances .
But DFS chief Fernando Gutiérrez Barrios confided that the government did not have any plans in place to deal with student unrest , according to a confidential CIA cable .
( Note 13 )
Scott himself was uncertain .
His frequent " situation reports , " known informally as Sitreps , emphasized the communist background of the professors leading the student movement .
In an August 1968 report , entitled Students Stage Major Disorders in Mexico , he argued that the riot in the Zocalo represented " a classic example of the Communists ' ability to divert a peaceful demonstration into a major riot . "
( Note 14 )
But which communists ?
Díaz Ordaz was sure the Mexican Communist party and the Soviet Union were involved .
Scott wanted to believe it but could find no evidence .
" Although the government claims to have solid evidence that the Communist Party engineered the fracas on 26 July and reportedly has indications of Soviet Embassy complicity , " he told CIA headquarters , " it is unlikely that the Soviets would so undermine their carefully nurtured good relations with the Mexicans . "
( Note 15 )
Among the LITEMPO sources , Scott said , uncertainty about the student movement was giving way to anger .
" The Office of the Presidency is in a state of considerable agitation because of anticipated further disturbances , " Scott wrote in early August .
" The pressure on Díaz Ordaz to restore calm is particularly intense because of Mexico 's desire to project a good image internationally . "
( Note 16 )
From his conversations with Díaz Ordaz , Scott began to get a sense of how the president was going to respond .
Tourist and commercial interests were calling for " early action , " he told Washington .
Scott suspected that the president might be planning to use Mexico City mayor Alfonso Corona del Rosal as a scapegoat .
Corona del Rosal was a former general with a reputation for toughness .
Much to Díaz Ordaz 's annoyance , he was advocating a conciliatory stance toward the students .
From long experience , Win knew how Díaz Ordaz operated .
" A politician 's inability to preserve the peace in the area of his charge has more than once provided the President with an excuse to abort a political career , " Scott wrote .
" Corona del Rosal has been mentioned as Díaz Ordaz ' possible successor , and it is possible that the President has decided to ' burn ' him . ' "
( Note 17 )
The next demonstration was the largest yet -- but also peaceful .
Reforma Avenue was jammed with a joyous throng headed for the Zocalo .
People were shouting , applauding , laughing and crying too .
The cathedral bells pealed and , even inside the Lecumberri prison , jailed men could heard the crowd .
Mexicans were liberating themselves from fear of their government .
" We do n't want the Olympics , " the marchers chanted .
" We want revolution . "
Scott informed Ambassador Freeman that Díaz Ordaz was deeply offended that the students had flown the red and white strike flag in the Zocalo .
He was ordering army riot police and police to use force if necessary to break up all " illegal activities and gatherings . "
( Note 18 )
Win Scott was not a man who lacked confidence in his ability to correct a difficult situation .
He had been the CIA 's chief of station in Mexico City since 1956 , spoke decent Spanish , and knew how to get his way with Mexican officialdom .
One of his teenage sons got a glimpse of the father 's authority when he got into a traffic accident on Reforma and wound up in the police station in Chapultepec Park .
The cops suggested the young man make a phone call to get some money for the mordida that would secure his release .
The son called Scott who said he would be right over .
" Next thing you know , Scottie pulls up in his big black Mercury , " his son recalled .
" It had these red diplomatic license plates for the Olympics which meant it was the car of someone important and this big American gets out with a teenage girl .
Scottie had brought my sister along for some reason .
The Mexican cops started rethinking their position .
Ah chihuahua , quien es eso ?
" Scottie hands the first cop he sees a hundred peso bill .
He hands the second cop he sees a hundred peso bill .
He asks me if I was OK .
Was the car OK ?
I said I was fine and that he only had to pay the jefe .
But he did n't care .
He went around the room , shook everybody 's hand and gave everybody a hundred peso bill .
He gave the jefe about four hundred .
Then he looked around and said , " Todos contentos ? "
" Everybody was very happy .
That was Scottie in his prime , this American who could do anything . "
As the student protests grew larger , Scott 's information from the LITEMPO agents informed Ambassador Freeman 's increasingly dire cables to Washington , which noted that Díaz Ordaz and the people around him were talking tougher .
The government " implicitly accepts consequence that this will produce casualties , " the ambassador wrote .
" Leaders of student agitation have been and are being taken into custody … .
In other words , the [ government ] offensive against student disorder has opened on physical and psychological fronts . "
( Note 19 )
Scott knew that Díaz Ordaz thought the application of force was the only solution .
" The government policy currently being followed to quell the student uprisings , calls for immediate occupation by the army and / or police of any school which is being used illegally as a center of subversive activity .
This policy will continue to be followed until complete calm prevails , " ( Note 20 ) he told his superiors in Washington .
In late September , Scott reported that the government was " not seeking compromise solution with students but rather seeking to put end to all organized student actions before Olympics ….
Aim of Gov[ernment ] believed to be to round up extremist elements and detain them until after Olympics , " ( Note 21 ) scheduled to open in mid-October .
The leaders of the student movement called for a public meeting .
Depleted by arrests , confronted by a hard - line government , and facing the opening of the Olympic Games in less than two weeks , they wanted to convene on the afternoon of October 2 , at the Plaza de Las Tres Culturas in the Tlatelolco housing complex to announce their next move .
Scott reported that morning that the Mexican government 's determination to hold a successful Olympic Games would probably preclude any major incidents .
However , random , unsuspected acts could not be ruled out , he warned .
" Any estimate , such as this one , of the likelihood of intentional acts designed to disrupt the normal course of events must take into account the presence of radicals and extremists whose behavior is impossible to predict .
Such persons and groups do exist in Mexico , " ( Note 22 ) he wrote on October 2 .
That might have been the voice of Scott 's considerable experience in Mexico .
But it might have been passed along to him by friendly LITEMPOs who had reason to believe that " radicals and extremists " whose behavior was " impossible to predict " were about to act .
The rally in Tlatelolco began around five p.m .
Tanks surrounded the plaza and soldiers sat on the tanks cleaning their bayonets , but it was not a particularly tense situation .
Between five and ten thousand people had gathered by late afternoon .
Military commanders on the scene had just received orders to prevent the meeting from taking place .
They were ordered to isolate the leaders of the meeting , detain them and turn them over to DFS .
A group of officers in civilian clothes , known as the Olympic Battalion , had their own instructions .
They were to wear civilian clothes with a white glove on the left hand and post themselves in the doorways of the Chihuahua building overlooking the plaza .
When they got the signal , in form of a flare , they were to prevent the entrance or exit of anyone to the plaza while the student leaders were being detained .
Finally a group of police officers got orders to arrest the leaders of the National Strike Council .
What virtually no one knew until more than thirty years later was that Luis Gutiérrez Oropeza , the chief of staff of the Mexican military , had posted ten men with guns on the upper floor the Chihuahua building and given them orders to shoot into the crowd .
He was acting on orders of Díaz Ordaz , according to a revelatory account published in Proceso in 1999 .
Oropeza was the link between Díaz Ordaz and Echeverría , according to Jorge Castañeda 's book about the Mexican presidency .
Gutiérrez Oropeza was also a friend of Scott 's who had dinner at his home at least once , according to a log of guests kept by the Scott family .
There is no evidence that Gutiérrez Oropeza was a LITEMPO agent or that he acted at the CIA 's behest on October 2 .
Just as a student speaker announced that a scheduled march on the Santo Tomas campus of the Politecnico would not take place because of the threat of Army violence , flares suddenly appeared in the sky overhead and everyone automatically looked up .
That 's when the shooting began .
A wave of people ran to the far end of the plaza only to meet a line of oncoming soldiers .
They ran the other way into the free fire zone .
It was , in the words of historian Enrique Krauze , a " closed circle of hell , " a " terror operation . "
Win Scott filed his first report around midnight .
It was massaged at headquarters and passed to the White House where it was read the next morning .
Something big had happened at Tlatelolco .
" A senior [ classified source ] counted 8 dead students , six dead soldiers but a nearby Red Cross installation had 127 wounded students and 30 wounded soldiers .
" A classified source said the first shots were fired by the students from the Chihuahua apartments . "
An American classified source " expressed the opinion this was a premeditated encounter provoked by the students . "
Another classified source said " most of the students present on the speaker 's platform were armed , one with a sub - machine gun…troops were only answering the fire from the students . "
None of Scott 's reports turned out to be true .
His only accurate observation was that " this is the most serious incident thus far in the rash of student disturbances which began in late July . "
( Note 23 )
His next situation report cited " trained observers " who believed the students instigated the incident .
He said that the Tlatelolco incident raised questions about Mexico 's ability to provide security for the Olympics .
( Note 24 )
Agents of the American FBI in Mexico City who worked closely with Scott reported that the Trotskyite students had formed an armed group called the Olympia Brigade to provoke an attack .
These students were allegedly connected to Guatemalan communists and had supposedly fired the first shots .
The FBI reported that Díaz Ordaz had told an " American visitor , " who may have been Scott , that he believed the disturbance had been " carefully planned . "
" A good many people came into the country , " the president reportedly said .
" The guns used were new and had their numbers filed off .
The Castro and Chinese Communist groups were at the center of the effort .
The Soviet communists had to come along to avoid the charge of being chicken . "
( Note 25 )
In Washington , Walt Rostow , national security adviser to President Lyndon Johnson , sought to clarify the contradictory reports .
He sent a series of questions to Scott who went to see Díaz Ordaz .
He returned with answers that revealed how little he knew .
Were Mexican students using new rifles with numbers filed off from Chinese sources ?
No verification to date , Scott said .
Did individuals from outside Mexico participate in the student movement ?
Three students , a Chilean , French and an American , were arrested on July 26 and deported .
Two other French students were not apprehended , he noted .
In other words , there had not been single report of foreign involvement in the previous five weeks .
While the Mexican press continually played on the theme of foreign involvement , Scott said " no conclusive evidence to this effect has been presented . "
Could he verify the FBI 's story of a leftist Olympic Brigade that provoked the gunfire ?
A small group of Trotskyite university students had formed a group called a " Brigada Olympia , " he said .
One source said they planned to blow up transformers to interfere with Olympic events and to seize buses carrying Olympic athletes .
The White House and CIA headquarters did not fail to notice that Scott seemed to know very little about what had happened at Tlatelolco , save that reports of Cuban and Soviet involvement were overblown and the government 's claim of a left - wing provocation could not be proved .
Wallace Stuart , a counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City , later said the CIA station had submitted 15 differing and sometimes flatly contradictory versions of what happened at Tlatelolco , " all from either ' generally reliable sources ' or ' trained observers ' on the spot ! " ( Note 26 )
Scott had fallen into a classic trap of spies .
He had become too dependent on his well - placed sources .
He had no independent means of getting information about a hugely important political event .
The massacre at Tlatelolco , says historian Sergio Aguayo , parted " the waters of Mexican history .
It accented the turbulence of those years , served to concentrate power in the intelligence services dominated by a small group of men , hard and uncontrolled . "
With Win Scott 's assistance , those men had entrenched themselves in power over the course of a decade , acting with impunity against an opposition that was , in Aguayo 's words , " weak but each time more bellicose and desperate to rebel against the apathy of an indifferent , if not complicitous , international community . "
A week after the massacre , Win took time out from his duties to write a thank you note to Luis Echeverría .
The interior minister had just given him a gift : a large framed electronic map of the world that displayed the correct time in every time zone in the world .
" The marvelous clock you sent to me recently is a wonder to all who see it , " Win wrote in a note that Aguayo found in the Archivo General de la Nación .
In Win 's hour of need after the Tlatelolco massacre , his most trusted agents had delivered fictional accounts and then a bauble .
The master of LITEMPO had become its prisoner .
The puppetmaster had become the puppet .
Eight months later , Scott was forced to retire from his job as CIA chief of station .
His ouster did n't have anything to do with the events of October 1968 , according to William Broe , the chief of the CIA 's Latin America division at the time .
" He was one of our outstanding officers .
It was a strong station .
He ran a very good shop , " Broe said in a recent telephone interview .
The reason for his removal , he explained , " was his long tenure .
That was what we decided to do , to start changing and moving people .
It was n't because he had done something wrong .
We just felt that we should n't have individuals there as long as that .
Thirteen years is a long time . "
In June 1969 , Scott went to CIA headquarters in Washington to receive one of the Agency 's highest honors , the Distinguished Intelligence Medal .
The citation accompanying the medal alluded to the LITEMPO program as one of his greatest accomplishments .

In the inception of the project , LITEMPO agents provided assistance to US officials in Mexico City by helping get transit visas to Cuban travelers seeking to escape the new Castro government .
This report , prepared for the Mexico City station by agent Jeremy K. Benadum , shows the building of a relationship with LITEMPO - 8 ( Echeverría ) , who in turn requests information on " the names of terrorists and communists from Venezuela and other Latin American countries who might be likely to travel to or through Mexico . "

This report further details how Echeverría made the final decision as to who was granted visas through this process .
Specific conditions were established for the solicitation of each visa through the LITEMPO program .
These conditions were set in order to maintain the secrecy of the project and to avoid giving the political opposition fuel to criticize the Interior Minister for " working for the Yanquis [ sic ] . "

Software giant Microsoft is apparently also looking to lure away retail employees from Apple 's own stores ; and employees at a Washington Apple Store have planned a walk - out .
Microsoft courting Apple Store managers , staff
Citing anonymous sources , Jim Dalrymple at The Loop has reported that Microsoft has contacted " a number of Apple 's retail store managers " in an attempt to hire them away .
The employees have been promised " significant raises , " and some were even offered moving expenses .
The strategy also allegedly has a recruitment element to it .
" Once hired , the ex-Apple employees are then contacting some of the top sales people in the Apple retail organization offering them positions at Microsoft retail , " Dalrymple wrote .
" They have also been offered more money than what they made at Apple . "
As Microsoft prepares to enter the retail market , it has taken a number of cues from Apple 's successful brick - and - mortar stores .
In fact , the Redmond , Wash . , company even hired real estate expert George Blankenship , one of the cornerstones of Apple 's early retail efforts , to consult on its first retail stores .
Apple 's rival to the north will also mimic the Genius Bar with its own " Guru Bars , " where customers would be allowed to make appointments and ask questions .
Microsoft intends to go head - to - head with Apple in the retail space .
Some stores will even be purposefully located within proximity .
The first face - off will take place in Mission Viejo , Calif . , at The Shops .
Washington Apple Store walk - out planned by employees
Employees at the Apple Store in the Alderwood mall in Lynnwood , Wash. , are apparently so upset with management that they intend to walk out in protest at 1 p.m. on Saturday , Oct.
3 . According to someone familiar with the matter who contacted AppleInsider , it will include Mac Specialists , Geniuses and Creatives , as well as former employees of the location .
The info was also provided to ifoAppleStore , where it was noted that such an event would be the first known at an Apple Store .

General Petraeus ’s advisers say he has stepped back in part because Mr. Obama has handpicked his own public face for the war in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , who last week gave an interview to CBS ’s “ 60 Minutes , ” met with Mr. Obama on Air Force One and used a speech in London to reject calls for scaling back the war effort .
Image Gen. David H. Petraeus was the face of the Iraq troop surge .
Credit ... Stephen Crowley / The New York Times
If anything , General McChrystal ’s public comments may prove that General Petraeus might be prudent to take a back seat during the debate .
On Sunday , when CNN’s John King asked Gen. James L. Jones , the national security adviser , if it was appropriate for a man in uniform to appear to campaign so openly for more troops , General Jones replied , “ Ideally , it ’s better for military advice to come up through the chain of command . ”
How much General Petraeus ’s muted voice will affect Mr. Obama ’s decision on the war is unclear , but people close to him say that stifling himself in public could give him greater credibility to influence the debate from within .
Others say that his biggest influence may simply be as part of a team of military advisers , including General McChrystal and Adm .
Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
The men are united in what they see as the need to build up the American effort in Afghanistan , although General Petraeus , who works closely with General McChrystal , said last week that he had not yet endorsed General McChrystal ’s request for more troops .
Together the three are likely to be aligned against Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , as well as other administration officials who want to scale back the effort .
In that situation , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , who has worried about a big American presence in Afghanistan but left the door open to more troops , could be the most influential vote .
What is clear is that General Petraeus ’s relationship with Mr. Obama is nothing like his bond with Mr. Bush , who went mountain biking with the general in Washington last fall , or with Mr. Obama ’s opponent in the 2008 presidential campaign , Senator John McCain of Arizona , whose aides briefly floated the general ’s name last year as a possible running mate .
By then the general had been talked about as a potential presidential candidate himself , which still worries some political aides at the White House .
Preventing the havoc wrought when freezing rain collects on roads , power lines , and aircrafts could be only a few nanometers away .
A University of Pittsburgh - led team demonstrates in the Nov. 3 edition of " Langmuir " a nanoparticle - based coating developed in the lab of Di Gao , a chemical and petroleum engineering professor in Pitt 's Swanson School of Engineering , that thwarts the buildup of ice on solid surfaces and can be easily applied .
The paper , by lead author and Pitt doctoral student Liangliang Cao , presents the first evidence of anti-icing properties for a burgeoning class of water repellants - including the Pitt coating - known as superhydrophobic coatings .
These thin films mimic the rutted surface of lotus leaves by creating microscopic ridges that reduce the surface area to which water can adhere .
But the authors note that because ice behaves differently than water , the ability to repulse water cannot be readily applied to ice inhibition .
Cao 's coauthors include Gao , Jianzhong
Wu , a chemical engineering professor at the University of California at Riverside , and Andrew Jones and Vinod Sikka of Ross Technology Corporation of Leola , Pa .
The team found that superhydrophobic coatings must be specifically formulated to ward off ice buildup .
Gao and his team created different batches made of a silicone resin-solution combined with nanoparticles of silica ranging in size from 20 nanometers to 20 micrometers , at the largest .
They applied each variant to aluminum plates then exposed the plates to supercooled water ( - 20 degrees Celsius ) to simulate freezing rain .
Cao writes in " Langmuir " that while each compound containing silica bits of 10 - or - fewer micrometers deflected water , only those with silica pieces less than 50 nanometers in size completely prevented icing .
The minute surface area of the smaller fragments means they make minimal contact with the water .
Instead , the water mostly touches the air pockets between the particles and falls away without freezing .
Though not all superhydrophobic coatings follow the Pitt recipe , the researchers conclude that every type will have a different particle - scale for repelling ice than for repelling water .
Gao tested the coating with 50 - nanometer particles outdoors in freezing rain to determine its real - world potential .
He painted one side of an aluminum plate and left the other side untreated .
The treated side had very little ice , while the untreated side was completely covered .
He produced similar results on a commercial satellite dish where the glossed half of the dish had no ice and the other half was encrusted .
A video available on Pitt's Web site shows an aluminum plate glazed with Gao 's superhydrophobic coating ( left ) repelling the supercooled water .
For the uncoated plate ( right ) , the water freezes on contact and ice accumulates .

Is there really nothing more the White House can do about this ?
Seems like pretty weak tea to tell them to " think about it . "
Here 's hoping there 's some arm - twisting going on behind the scenes :
In the wake of reports that Goldman Sachs is set to pay a record 23 billion in bonuses this year , the President ’s Senior Adviser David Axelrod told me this morning that he thinks big banks dishing out bonuses to their employees is “ offensive ” and advises banks to “ think through what they are doing . ”
“ The bonuses are offensive and to the firms that still have federal TARP money there ’s some jurisdiction , the pay master of Treasury is working on trying to limit that , ” Axelrod said .
“ You ’ve seen a lot of firms go to stock rather than cash , so at least people have a stake in the success of their company and they ’re not just walking away with cash - making short - term decisions . ”
“ They ought to think through what they are doing and they ought to understand that a year ago a lot of these institutions were teetering on the brink and the United States government and taxpayers came to their defense .
They have responsibilities and they ought to meet those responsibilities . ”
Wall Street banks have had profitable quarters .
JPMorgan Chase reported $ 3.6 billion in profit ( more than $ 1 billion per month ) .
Goldman Sachs was only slightly behind , at $ 3.2 billion .
These profits supposedly came from “ trading . ”
I asked a friend who has worked in the money business how this was possible .
“ For someone to make money trading , there has to be someone on the other side of every trade who is losing money .
Where does each bank find someone who can lose $ 1 billion every month ? ”
He explained that “ carry trade ” would be a more accurate description of what they ’re doing .
Because of the Collapse of 2008 financial reforms , the big investment banks are able to borrow money from the U.S. government at 0 percent interest .
Then they can turn around and buy short - term bonds that pay 2 or 3 percent annual interest .
Now they ’re making 2 percent on whatever they borrowed .
They can use leverage to increase this number , by pledging some of the bonds that they ’ve already bought as collateral on additional bonds .
I asked if they were taking any risk in order to earn this return .
“ If interest rates went up to 20 percent , even though the bonds are short - term , the price of the bond could fall enough to make the trade a money - loser . ”
( Though since the banks are too big to fail , they would simply be bailed out with additional taxpayer funds . )
What kind of bonds are they buying ?
Are they investing the money in American business ?
“ No , they are mostly buying Treasuries . ”
So the money is just being shuffled from one Federal bank account to another , with each Wall Street bank skimming off $ 1 billion per month for itself ?
“ Pretty much . ”
[ A more old - fashioned way of making supranormal returns is insider trading , which was perfectly legal until the Crash of 1929 ( history ) .
The New York Times ran a story yesterday on Raj Rajaratnam , a hedge fund manager who invested heavily in inside information .
Rolling Stone published “ Wall Street ’s Naked Swindle ” on October 14 .
The story is much more sensational and entertaining than anything from the Times .
It covers a guy who spent $ 1.7 million on out - of - the - money put options on Bear Stearns on March 11 , 2008 .
The options would become worthless on March 20 , just 9 days later , unless Bear Stearns basically went bust .
Bear Stearns collapsed the next day and the guy made a $ 270 million profit .
He has never been identified by the SEC . ]

Cuneo Gilbert Out to Disinfect FINRA with Some Sunlight
23 Corporate Crime Reporter 36 , September 17 , 2009
They say sunlight is the best disinfectant .
If so , then Jonathan Cuneo is on a campaign to disinfect FINRA .
Cuneo and his law firm – Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca – have three lawsuits pending against the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) .
In each , FINRA is being represented by F. Joseph Warin of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher .
“ FINRA is the largest private regulator for all securities firms doing business in the United States , yet it is run like a secret society , ” Cuneo told Corporate Crime Reporter .
“ The organization claims to promote transparency in the financial industry , while simultaneously fighting a battle to hide very basic information from its members and the public .
Our lawsuits challenge this secrecy and aim to bring accountability to this organization . ”
Two of the lawsuits – Benchmark Financial Services v. FINRA and Standard Investment v. FINRA – allege that FINRA member firms are due more than the $ 35,000 they received as part of the 2007 merger between National Association of Securities Dealers ( NASD ) and the regulatory arm of the New York Stock Exchange – a merger that resulted in the creation of FINRA .
At the time of the merger negotiations , NASD told its members that because it was a non-profit , the most it could pay each firm was $ 35,000 .
But in March 2007 , the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) issued a private letter ruling which indicated that in fact NASD could pay a lot more than $ 35,000 .
How much more is a secret .
Earlier this month , the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that amount of money the IRS said NASD could pay each firm was confidential .
The NASD told its members at the time of the merger negotiations that the source of the $ 35,000 “ was projected future savings resulting from anticipated efficiencies of the consolidated entity . ”
“ This was false , ” the Benchmark lawsuit declares .
“ The true source of the funds was an over $ 1 billion fund that constituted a portion of NASD ’s member ’s equity , a pool of cash that had been amassed largely as a result of the development and sale of the NASDAQ stock trading system . ”
“ The misrepresentation was designed to deceive members into believing that they should accept the amount offered lest they upset the NASD ’s projections of future efficiencies and cause difficulties for the consolidated entity going forward .
Defendants knew that if they told members the truth – that they would be paid $ 35,000 each ( or a total of $ 175 million ) out of their own equity fund of more than $ 1 billion – they risked a wide - open evaluation demand scenario that would have delayed , invited more scrutiny concerning – and potentially even threatened – the whole transaction . ”
The Benchmark lawsuit alleges that one motivation for the merger was to secure higher executive compensation for officers .
Mary Schapiro is currently the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) .
Before leaving to the SEC , Schapiro was CEO of NASD , then FINRA .
In 2006 , before the merger , Schapiro ’s compensation was $ 1.9 million .
In 2007 , as head of the newly created FINRA , her compensation jumped to $ 3 million .
“ The amounts of total executive compensation are eye - popping by any measure , but are especially staggering for a non-profit institution , ” the lawsuit alleges .
The third lawsuit – Amerivet Securities v. FINRA – was brought by a firm owned by an African American California Army Reserve officer and Green Beret – Lt. Colonel Elton Johnson Jr.
Johnson has served two tours of duty in Iraq and is about to be deployed to Afghanistan .
He ’s had a long running battle with FINRA .
FINRA suspended him as a supervisor from December 2006 to June 2008 for failure to properly manage an employee .
Johnson claims that FINRA was retaliating against him because he complained publically about how FINRA was treating him .
As a member of FINRA , Johnson ’s company – Amerivet – wants FINRA to open its books .
In particular , the lawsuit seeks to find out where FINRA has invested its many hundreds of millions of dollars – and why .
It wants a federal judge to rule that Delaware Code Section 220 allows members of FINRA to inspect the company ’s books .
According to the lawsuit , in 2008 , FINRA lost $ 568 million , or 26.5 percent of its investment portfolio .
“ These losses wiped out the reported investment returns over the previous four years , ” the lawsuit alleges .
“ FINRA has been reckless in pursuing high - risk strategies inappropriate to preservation of capital , ” the lawsuit alleges .
“ It appears that , despite the fact that FINRA requires investment earnings as a supplement to other sources of funds ( e.g. member payments , fines ) , its emphasis on short - term investment returns and apparently risky vehicles was unwarranted , quite costly and a waste of its assets . ”
The lawsuit alleges that “ while FINRA has been reasonably vigorous in its oversight of smaller member firms , frequently devoting substantial resources to dealing with insignificant technical infractions , FINRA has , due to conflicts of interest , given a virtual ‘ free pass ’ to large member firms and their affiliates such as Bear Stearns , Lehman , Merrill , Madoff , Sky Capital and Stanford . ”
“ In Madoff ’s case , there appears to have been a particularly cozy relationship between Madoff and senior FINRA executives which resulted in virtually no oversight of Madoff and its affiliates or its $ 65 billion Ponzi scheme , ” the lawsuit alleges .
“ It appears that due to the personal relationships between Bernard Madoff , members of his family and FINRA executives , there was a ‘ hands off ’ policy in place to his activities and those of his firm , which allowed their Ponzi scheme to flourish . ”

Los primeros servicios de inteligencia en México fueron fundados en 1918 .
La fase más intensa de espionaje político , sin embargo , se produjo en los años sesenta , setenta y ochenta , a través de la Dirección Federal de Seguridad ( DFS ) .
El organismo fue fundado en 1947 y pertenecía a la Secretaría de Gobernación ( ministerio del Interior ) .
Fue uno de los brazos estratégicos del Gobierno que durante más de 70 años mantuvo el poder en México , a cargo del Partido Revolucionario Institucional ( PRI ) , en lo que el escritor peruano Mario Vargas Llosa calificó alguna vez como “ la dictadura perfecta ” .
Para Mario Vargas Llosa , el régimen del PRI era una " dictadura perfecta " .
De la información a la represión
La DSF no se limitaba al espionaje .
El organismo tenía bajo su mando a fuerzas paramilitares como las llamadas “ Brigadas Blancas ” .
La represión se radicalizó con la fundación del grupo guerrillero Liga Comunista 23 de septiembre , en marzo de 1973 .
Se cometieron numerosas y graves violaciones a los derechos humanos , conocidas en México como “ guerra sucia ” .
Sergio Aguayo Quezada , autor de libros sobre la historia del espionaje por parte del Estado mexicano , afirma que “ de 1947 a 1991 se acumularon de 60 a 80 millones de tarjetas ” con información obtenida a base de la vigilancia a personas consideradas relevantes .
“ En la década de los setenta , los organismos de seguridad gubernamentales recuperaban enormes cantidades de información .
La obtenían de los medios de comunicación , mediante la interceptación de teléfonos y de correspondencia , con la infiltración a organismos opositores , vigiliando personas , manifestaciones y presentaciones de libros ” , dice el académico en su libro 1968 .
Los archivos de la violencia .
De 1947 a 1991 fueron observadas entre tres y cuatro millones de ciudadanos , tanto mexicanos como extranjeros .
García Márquez , espiado
Según el diario mexicano El Universal , el Premio Nobel de Literatura , Gabriel García Márquez , fue una de esas personas .
El escritor colombiano mantiene una larga relación con México , país en el que reside desde hace décadas .
Sus actividades eran de interés para el Gobierno mexicano , por los contactos que a nivel político poseía desde entonces el autor de Cien años de soledad .
Documentos publicados por El Universal , mencionan en concreto que en los años setenta , García Márquez “ puso en contacto a Francois Mitterand y a Regis Debray , consejero del entonces presidente de Francia con líderes políticos latinoamericanos , en especial de El Salvador , Chile y Colombia ” .
Gabriel García Marquez puso a Francois Mitterand en contacto con la izquierda latinoamericana .
Muchas otras actividades del escritor fueron observadas con el mismo cuidado .
El diario mexicano afirma que incluso se llegó a interceptar llamadas telefónicas realizadas por el colombiano .
Gabriel García Márquez fue espiado por el Gobierno de México desde 1967 hasta por lo menos 1985 , cuando desapareció la Dirección Federal de Seguridad .
El último reporte describe la partida de García Márquez de México hacia Cuba , para visitar a su amigo , el comandante Fidel Castro .
No se sabe si la vigilancia sobre García Márquez continuó después .
Los documentos posteriores a 1985 se mantienen clasificados por el Centro de Investigación y Seguridad Nacional , actual organismo de inteligencia del Gobierno de México .
Otro Nobel en la mira
García Márquez no fue el único escritor observado por los servicios de inteligencia mexicanos .
Sergio Aguayo también ha documentado la interceptación de correspondencia personal dirigida a otro Premio Nobel de Literatura , el mexicano Octavio Paz .
En general , los intelectuales críticos y los periodistas independientes eran grupos que representaban especial interés para la DFS así como , naturalmente , los movimientos políticos de izquierda .
Pero la DFS también espiaba al propio régimen .
“ En 1965 , el centenar de teléfonos intervenidos incuía políticos del PRI y oficinas de secretarios de Estado ” , escribe Aguayo .
“ Los que participaban en la política en los años sesenta creían que el Gobierno tenía una enorme capacidad para espiarlos .
Formaba parte de la cultura popular ” .

Updated Facebook plans to open up members ' inboxes and notifications to developers have drawn fire from security experts as an unacceptable privacy risk .
The social network site published plans to release a notification and Mailbox API in a post on a developers ' forum last month .
The development has received little attention since , despite marking a huge shift in how much confidential data software applications on the social networking might be able to access .
Users who sign up to applications that make use of the feature give the green - light for software to scan the contents of messages sent through the social networking website , as Facebook explains .
The Mailbox API allows you to access your users ' messages , once they grant your application the new read_mailbox extended permission .
This lets your applications provide an interface for users to view their messages .
For example , your application could pop up an alert when the user receives a new message .
The social networking site suggests the technology might be used to develop desktop applications that allow users to check their company 's Page stream , as well as read messages and receive notifications , all via their desktop .
As well as the contents of messages , the recipients of a thread , time and date information would also be exposed .
About the only thing not enabled by the Mailbox API is the opportunity to send messages .
The notifications API , meanwhile , allows applications developers to retrieve users ' notifications and use this data within apps they develop .
Notifications cover everything from status updates through whether one of their contacts has taken a quiz through application - related activity .
But it 's the mail software hook feature that has security watchers worried .
" The idea of Facebook applications being given free rein to mine users ' inboxes and sent folders sends a shiver down my spine , " Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos told El Reg .
Even with safeguards and clear warnings , Cluley is wary about the technology .
" Obviously we have to hope that Facebook does not enable this functionality by default , and presents a clearly worded warning to its users if they try and add an application which insists on users waiving the rights to a private mailbox to third parties , " he said .
" But my worry is that many of Facebook 's 300 million users will be so keen to see what Sex and the City character they are , or to send a Best Friend Forever ecard to their online buddies , that they 'll glaze over the rights they are signing away when they add an app .
Even if you do decide to add an Facebook app that you trust to access your mailbox , there have been occasions in the past where app developers have used a ' bait and switch ' trick to change the nature of their app overnight . "
Facebook users are likely to include more detail in messages than in status updates or the like , a factor that increases the privacy risk .
Gmail users allow Google to scan the content of emails to display targeted adverts , a privacy concern for some .
Facebook 's approach goes even further , Cluley warned .
" Some people are nervous enough of Google using computers to examine the content of email to display targeted adverts in Gmail , but the idea of handing over this information to third party external developers sounds like a privacy nightmare waiting to happen , " Cluley told El Reg .
" An additional worry is that it appears Facebook is saying it may in the future integrate functionality which would allow application developers to send mails from their users ' inboxes .
It does n't take a great imagination to picture how this could be abused by spammers and malware authors . "
Update
Facebook defended its plans to open up members ' inboxes to application developers as a technology that will spur innovation in areas such as mobile messaging .
The social networking networking argues that its Mailbox API has fewer security concerns than Gmail for the privacy conscious in a response analysed in a follow - up story here . ®
A grand jury indicted former Contra Costa County sex crimes prosecutor Michael Gressett on Monday in connection with charges that he raped a colleague , Gressett 's attorneys said .
The indictment , handed down in Martinez , sends the case to a jury trial .
Gressett , 52 , who has been free on bail , was ordered to appear in court for arraignment Nov. 2 , said his attorney , Dan Russo .
State prosecutors , who are handling the case , did not return calls seeking comment .
Russo said he had been notified of the indictment by fax , but had not been told what specific charges Gressett is facing .
The accuser , who is in her early 30s and is now a prosecutor in another county , told police she wanted to sleep with Gressett but objected to the type of sex he initiated on May 8 , 2008 , at his Martinez townhouse .
She said he had forcibly sodomized her , held a gun to her head , handcuffed her and forced ice into her .
Gressett , who was fired in July , said a gun , cuffs and ice had been brought out but only in a playful way .
His attorneys said the alleged victim had a troubled history and that the case against Gressett - who lost three bids to be elected district attorney - had been unduly influenced by political opponents in his own office .
The Chronicle is not naming Gressett 's accuser because she is allegedly a rape victim .
Defense attorneys were angered by the prosecution 's decision to seek a grand jury indictment .
They had won a key ruling when a judge said they could question Gressett 's accuser during a public preliminary hearing - a hearing that was superseded by the use of a grand jury .
Prosecutors have said in the past that they wanted to protect the accuser from further trauma .
" Obviously , the grand jury was misled , " Russo said Monday .
Prosecutors " were afraid to do a preliminary hearing because then they would have to expose the wretchedness of their case to daylight . "
Chicago fighter and MMA legend Shonie “ Mr. International ” Carter will be fighting at the “ W - 1 : HighVoltage ” event on October 10th in Canada .
Shonie will be vying for the W - 1 welterweight title against former UFC champion Carlos Newton , who will be fighting in his home country .
Newton , the first ever Canadian UFC Welterweight Champion , is coming off a March KO win at W - 1 Inception , where he beat Nabil Khatib for his first victory since 2006 .
Shonie has won 3 straight fights and 5 of his last 6 .
He was very active in 2008 , fighting 5 times .
This year he has had just one bout , beating George Lockhart by decision in Utah ’s Throwdown III in February .
He fought at 185 in that fight , but will get to 170 against Newton .
A San Francisco murder suspect 's attorney sought assurances Wednesday that he would not be arrested for arranging what prosecutors called a " blatant act of witness intimidation " involving eight suspected gang members who stood up during a witness ' testimony .
The defendant , Charles " Cheese " Heard , 25 , was ordered to stand trial Wednesday on murder , attempted robbery and weapons charges linked to the slaying of Richard Barrett , 29 , outside a Broadway nightclub in November 2008 .
Prosecutors say that Heard was after Barrett 's gem-encrusted pendant of the Flintstones ' Bamm - Bamm character .
During the first day of the preliminary hearing on Tuesday , just as a star witness was asked whether she recognized anyone as responsible for Barrett 's shooting , eight reputed gang members stood up in unison , crossed their arms and stared at the witness .
The witness - a Texas woman who was in San Francisco for a conference and with friends when she saw the 1 a.m. shooting - nonetheless identified Heard as the gunman .
Prosecutor Michael Swart vociferously objected that the eight men who stood up amounted to " blatant witness intimidation . "
After the hearing , the eight men were arrested on suspicion of gang - related witness intimidation .
It is not clear who ordered the arrests .
No decision has been made as yet on whether the men will be formally charged .
Heard 's attorney , Eric Safire , acknowledged Wednesday that he arranged the incident to possibly confuse the identification by the witness .
Safire then sought assurances from Judge Wallace Douglass and the prosecutor that he would be immune from prosecution .
" Before I continue , I want a representation from the district attorney 's office that I 'm not going to be arrested , " Safire said , adding that the men were " here at my request - I motioned for them to stand up . "
He said the men's arrest created a " chilling effect on my ability to represent my client . "
He threatened to withdraw from the case .
" I can't guarantee that you wo n't be arrested , " Douglass said .
" The district attorney can arrest who he wants . "
Swart called Safire 's threatened withdrawal from the case " just another delaying gamesmanship on the part of Mr. Safire to prevent this witness from testifying . "
Safire declined to question the star witness , whom The Chronicle has not identified at the request of prosecutors .
" I do n't want to get arrested , " the defense attorney explained later .
" If ( the eight men arrested Tuesday ) intimidated the witness , you know what my cross examination would do to her ? "
Brian Buckelew , a spokesman for the district attorney 's office would not rule out charging Safire .
" Our office is providing no such assurance . "
The woman 's testimony was followed by another courtroom revelation - this one surrounding what police said triggered the slaying : the pendant of the Bamm - Bamm character .
A witness testified how he - and not a robber - had taken the bejeweled pendant from the dying man .
The man , Karl Rodriguez , an acquaintance of the victim , said he then arranged to return it to the man 's family .
Rodriguez was only interviewed by police this month .
It is unclear why the victim 's family had not alerted police to the fact that they had recovered the purportedly missing jewelry .
Rodriguez recounted how he heard what sounded like firecrackers , emerged from the bathroom of the Fuse nightclub and saw the man on the floor .
Rodriguez said Barrett was gasping for air , clutching his chest with one hand , and holding the chain and pendant with the other .
Rodriguez grasped the pendant .
" I knew I could get it back to the family , " he said .
" It was the proper thing to do . "

Korey Kline and I were the newest members of the CSXT team joining only six months before the launch .
During that time , in collaboration with Ky and Jerry , we designed , developed , and built the largest amateur rocket motor ever .
The solid propellant motor contained a derivation of the propellant that I have used for my O and P motors for the past few years .
The motor is designated as an S - 50,000 containing 435 lbs of AP based propellant configured in a monolithic case - bonded grain with a central fin-o - cyl core with a nearly neutral thrust profile .
The case was aluminum 6061 with an OD of 10 " and 175 " long .
The end closures were retained with two rows of radial bolts .
The nozzle was created from a new process using a combination of graphite , carbon fiber , and ablative materials and featured a bell shaped exit cone .
A number of static tests were performed on 3 " and 6 " hardware to characterize the propellant .
A full scale static firing revealed issues with the motors end closures that were corrected for the flight motor .
Chuck Rogers assisted in designing the test configurations and in addressing issues such as erosive burning and nozzle losses .
The in - flight motor performance was backed out of the CSXT GoFast flight acceleration data and netted a total impulse of 92,429 lb-sec for a delivered Isp of 212.5 seconds .

The Tate Museum has the finest collection of the works of J. M. W. Turner in the world , and from time to time they feel the need to refresh the public with another show to keep proving that Turner deserves the “ greatest British artist ever ” tag .
Back in 2005 this resulted in a hugely interesting show called Turner , Whistler , Monet , which looked at the interactions between the three , and it was a genuine treat .
This time around it ’s Turner and the Masters , a look at the painters that influenced Turner .
At least that ’s the intention .
And everyone loves it .
Well , not quite everyone — only Brian Sewellseems to give it the critical eye it deserves .
The Times calls it a “ Magnificent and hugely ambitious exhibition . ”
It ’s quoted right there on the Tate website .
What it turns into , however , is something completely different , something along the lines of Turner the Competitive Cockney Gnome who Tried to Outdo Everyone without Ever Having an Original Idea .
This is certainly the impression we took away from the show , although I suspect it ’s not what was intended .
In fact , the real impression we had was the same as the one we had after seeing the Van Gogh and Millet show at the Musee d’Orsay in Paris many years ago — is n’t it interesting that van Gogh used Millet ’s pictures as the architecture for many of his own paintings ?
It was known for years that van Gogh admired Millet , and even included “ after Millet ” in some of the titles of his works .
But still , it was surprising to see how much copying was involved .
“ They are not copies , ” Van Gogh told his brother , Theo , “ but translations into another language . ”
Well , maybe , but after wandering through several rooms at the Musee d’Orsay , you ’d actually be hard pressed to say that most of them were n’t copies , even if van Gogh transformed the scene with an entirely different sense of colour and a much more aggressive brushwork .
Van Gogh was at least lavish in his praise of Millet ( ” Millet is father Millet … counsellor and mentor in everything for young artists ” ) , and never denied his debt .
Turner , on the other hand , comes off poorly in this show , which was probably not the intent of the organizers .
Yes , Turner was a prodigious painter , and the show concentrates on a small percentage of his output .
But still , nearly every painting by Turner is paired with the painting that he was modelling in one way or another , and very often they are direct copies , with the only difference being Turner ’s different use of colour and , again , his distinctive brushwork .
And while he knew how to compose a picture as well as anyone , there are some pictures where the perspective just does n’t make sense .
And of course , like Bonnard , he just ca n’t paint people , a fact usually overlooked — or just ignored .
Now , this is always interesting — no artist works in isolation , there are always influences , and much of the fun of art appreciation is figuring out what those are .
The fact that Whistler and Monet were friends should n’t be a surprise , but it ’s something you normally do n’t think about .
We think of artists as solitary beings , but even if that has some truth in terms of their lifestyles , it ca n’t be true in terms of where their art comes from .
The line from Millet to van Gogh could n’t be more direct .
And it is interesting to see what Turner derived from , say , Rembrandt , or Watteau , of Cuyp , or the painter that Turner felt himself most in competition with — Claude .
Turner often is a great artist .
But here in London he ’s not only a great artist , but the greatest of all time , it seems .
One gets that impression , anyway — from the time Ruskin started trumpeting him as the greatest British artist ever , the art establishment in the UK has shown no signs of disputing this .
Turner , like the Impressionists , has become an industry .
Sewell , who has a reputation for not liking much of anything , has some words of praise for the show , but he also captures it about right , warts and all :
Turner belonged to a generation of artists whose work was deliberately rooted in the past , who could be measured by the comparison that revealed how much they had retained , how much rejected , and how much moved on by adding something new and of their own that might suggest that they had exceeded the successes of their mentors .
Turner painted not in slavish imitation but in rivalry , and two centuries on it is easier to see where he matched Claude ’s subtleties and Rembrandt ’s bravura and where he failed utterly — for this is an exhibition not only of Turner ’s occasional sublimities but of dogged recapitulation that is dull and failure that is ludicrous .
And that seems about right .
When Turner was good , he was as good as anyone .
But he often was n’t that good — and yet somehow we ’re supposed to ignore the fact that he often painted bad pictures .
The show brings up two reservations .
First , if the show is representative of Turner ’s output , it ’s an extraordinarily derivative output , without a single new idea until very late in Turner ’s career .
I suspect that ’s an unfair portrait of Turner — he was prolific , and this is just a sampling .
But the Tate is telling us it ’s an extremely important sampling , and there ’s nothing in the show to tell you otherwise .
Turner painted what other artists were also painting , and we ’re supposed to take away that , well , he was Turner , that ’s al you really need to know .
It ’s a bad analogy , I know , but I ’ve been looking for a place to use it ever since I saw the movie Mama Mia ( the biggest grossing movie of all time in the UK , amazingly enough ) — my main reaction was “ Who knew Abba wrote so many bad songs ? ”
Sewell is absolutely right — there are an awful lot of bad paintings by Turner here , especially the ones on mythological subjects .
And to pretend otherwise is just silly , and a bit insulting .
Second , it ’s a chronological show , so you can see how Turner developed as an artist .
Yes , he had many skills , but it was n’t until he was old that he became Turner .
The Turner we think about , and whose art still stuns , is the Turner who lapsed into pure light and atmosphere .
And he did n’t start doing these paintings until he was an old man ( or relatively one ) .
Turner was bon in 1775 .
And those extraordinary maritime paintings , with the storms , and the clouds , and the spray , and the sun — the ones that really do take your breath away — those are from the 1840s .
And while Turner was acknowledged as a major painter by his contemporaries even before he was painting these stunning seascapes , some explication of how Turner got to this style would have been appreciated , other than the bland comments we ’re greeted with in the narrative .
Still , it ’s a very interesting show , worth seeing .
For one thing , it ’s not often that the competitive nature of genius is acknowledged , and it ’s refreshing to see it so openly acknowledged .
And Turner was competitive , absolutely .
And it is interesting to study the comparisons to see where Turner was successful , and where he failed .
Plus there ’s the bonus of seeing some exceptionally good art that does n’t normally show up in London .
The Rembrandts are at treat , for example , including The Old Mill , normally at home at The National Gallery in Washington .
And Claude — well , you can see why it was that Turner targeted him as the one to beat .
And there ’s a small masterpiece —
The White House at Chelsea , pictured just above — by Thomas Girtin , a friend of and ( in the spirit of the show ) competitor to Turner .
Girtin died when he was quite young — in 1802 , at age 27 .
And the show quotes Turner ’s comment that “ had Tom Girtin lived I should have starved . ”
Looking at this little gem , surrounded by dozens of larger and more grandiose pictures by Turner and others , you understand exactly what Turner meant .
Stanford University , which lost a quarter of its endowment last year , has put on the block as much as $ 1 billion of hard - to - sell investments ranging from private equity to real estate to timberland as it seeks to raise cash , according to people familiar with the matter .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Global temperatures may be 4 degrees Celsius hotter by the mid-2050s if current greenhouse gas emissions trends continue , said a study published on Monday .

The study , by Britain ’s Met Office Hadley Center , echoed a U.N. report last week which found that climate changes were outpacing worst - case scenarios forecast in 2007 by the U.N. ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
“ Our results are showing similar patterns ( to the IPCC ) but also show the possibility that more extreme changes can happen , ” said Debbie Hemming , co-author of the research published at the start of a climate change conference at Oxford University .
Leaders of the main greenhouse gas- emitting countries recognized in July a scientific view that temperatures should not exceed 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels , to avoid more dangerous changes to the world ’s climate .
The IPCC shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for its fourth assessment report , or AR4 .
One finding was that global temperatures could rise by 4 degrees by the end of the 2050s .
Monday ’s study confirmed that warming could happen even earlier , by the mid-2050s , and suggested more extreme local effects .
“ It ’s affirming the AR4 results and also confirming that it is likely , ” Hemming told Reuters , referring to 4 degrees warming , assuming no extra global action to cut emissions in the next decade .
One advance since 2007 was to model the effect of “ carbon cycles . ”
For example , if parts of the Amazon rainforest died as a result of drought , that would expose soil which would then release carbon from formerly shaded organic matter .
“ That amplifies the amount of carbon dioxide that goes into the atmosphere and therefore the global warming .
It ’s really leading to more certainty , ” said Hemming .
DRASTIC
Some 190 countries will try to reach an agreement on how to slow global warming at a meeting in Copenhagen in December .
Chinese President Hu Jintao won praise for making a commitment to limit emissions growth by a “ notable ” amount , at a U.N. climate summit in New York last week .
Other leaders made pledges to agree a new climate pact .
Temperature rises are compared with pre-industrial levels .
The world warmed 0.7 degrees last century , scientists say .
A global average increase of 4 degrees masked higher regional increases , including more than 15 degrees warmer temperatures in parts of the Arctic , and up to 10 degrees higher in western and southern Africa , Monday ’s study found .
“ It ’s quite extreme .
I do n’t think it ’s hit home to people , ” said Hemming .
As sea ice melts , the region will reflect less sunlight , which may help trigger runaway effects .
Such higher Arctic temperatures could also melt permafrost , which until now has trapped the powerful greenhouse gas methane , helping trigger further runaway effects , said Hemming .
“ There are potentially quite big negative implications . ”
The study indicated rainfall may fall this century by a fifth or more in part of Africa , Central America , the Mediterranean , and coastal Australia , “ potentially more extreme ” than the IPCC ’s findings in 2007 .
“ The Mediterranean is a very consistent signal of significant drying in nearly all the model runs , ” said Hemming .
A 20 percent or more fall is “ quite a lot in areas like Spain already struggling with rainfall reductions in recent years . ”
Nine years ago BNP leader Nick Griffin set out plans to cleanse the party 's image in his bid to win over the media .
On Thursday he joins BBC's Question Time , an appearance that has already caused controversy – will his views be rebuffed , or will he flourish in the media spotlight ?
The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the records column , Sunday 1 November 2009
Below we reported that Nick Griffin joined the BNP " after it won a council seat in Millwall in south London " , but Millwall is a ward of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in east London ; confusion arose because Millwall , the football club has its home in south east London .
Two impressions strike visitors stepping off the commuter train at Dagenham Docks .
The first is unmissable : the vast walls of the Dagenham Ford plant dwarf the station .
The second takes longer to sink in : how quiet the factory is .
Dagenham was once as much a Ford Motors company town as Dearborn , Michigan .
In 1953 , Ford employed 40,000 workers .
Car production stopped in 2002 and the plant is now merely a supply centre , employing just 4,000 and providing engines for cars built elsewhere .
The BNP has moved into the space left by the collapse of manufacturing and the trade union politics that went with it .
Not that it is a racist hellhole by any means .
On the streets you have to work hard to find people who are proud to admit to supporting the BNP .
A man pushing a baby in a buggy , who would only identify himself as " Nemo " , hated being treated as an ethnic minority .
" Every form I get has a box I have to tick saying I'm ' white British ' .
I 'm not British , I'm English , and the BNP is the only party that stands up for people like me . "
I wo n't pretend that he 's typical .
After the BNP became the second largest party on the council , Labour activists reported that black mothers were in tears , worrying about what would happen to their children , and thugs attacked a disabled man with baseball bats after he challenged BNP electoral fraud .
But , they say , that was the limit of the trouble .
True , the BNP tries to incite fear .
The local authority suspended Richard Barnbrook , a BNP councillor and member of the London assembly , for making up stories about knife crime in the town .
BNP announcements that it had discovered a shooting range in a local mosque and £ 50,000 grants to Africans turned out to be equally phoney .
Given that Britain has had to cope with an unprecedented wave of immigration , and that towns like Dagenham have not only seen the end of secure employment but affordable housing vanish , even the Labour MP Jon Cruddas is surprised that there has not been a stronger backlash .
But he and many others continue to worry that , in London , politics is becoming racialised .
In Dagenham , there is the white BNP .
In Bethnal Green and Bow , George Galloway won for Respect , a bigoted party dominated by Jamaat - e - Islami , which in its native Bangladesh is regarded by the liberal - minded with fear .
South of the river , West African voters are turning to the evangelical Christian Peoples Alliance , which demonstrates against new mosques .
On Thursday night , attention will focus on the politics of the Dagenham estates and others like them when Nick Griffin , leader of the BNP , appears on BBC's Question Time .
As its theme tune jangles out , David Dimbleby could announce : " Joining us tonight from Television Centre , we have Conservative peer Baroness Warsi , Labour 's justice secretary , Jack Straw , and making his first appearance on Question Time , Britain 's leading neo - Nazi , Nick Griffin . "
Perhaps he will , but broadcasters have a feeble record of taking on totalitarian movements , and in ways that neither the BBC nor mainstream politicians realise , the ability of democratic Britain to expose sectarianism and call it by its real name will be as much on trial this week as the leader of the BNP .
A media interested in nothing so much as covering media stories will make the programme an event .
Dozens of press articles and radio debates have already analysed the BBC 's decision to allow the British National party on to its best current affairs show .
The London media barely cover the ugly problems of Stoke - on - Trent , Burnley , Oldham , Dagenham and the other depressed areas where the BNP has made gains , but justifies its current focus on itself by insisting that Dimbleby 's rigorous interviewing and the tough interventions of the mainstream panellists will expose the BNP .
Sitting in his cluttered office in a rundown parade of shops in Dagenham – only a 15 - minute train ride from central London , but a world away – Jon Cruddas doubts it .
The leftwing Labour MP has fought the BNP harder than any other politician .
It became the second largest party on Dagenham council in 2006 , and there is a chance – albeit an outside one – that it could take his parliamentary seat next year .
Cruddas and his assistants are engaging in an unglamorous task .
By the next election they will have argued with every voter worried about African and Polish immigration into the borderlands of east London and Essex , or bewildered by the collapse of the old certainties of working - class life .
Cruddas dismisses journalists ' boasts about the ruthlessness of television 's inquisitors as so much wind .
Question Time " is just car - crash TV " , he says .
" He who gets the best soundbite wins .
If they were letting Andrew Neil loose on Griffin for an hour , that would be public service broadcasting , but this is pointless .
It can only benefit the BNP . "
Maybe Neil could give Griffin a hard time , but the precedent set by his fellow broadcasters is not encouraging for those hoping that he will be unmasked on Thursday .
The supposedly ferocious Jeremy Paxman turned into Barbara Cartland when he interviewed the then new leader of the BNP in 2001 .
" Can I ask you a simple question ?
If one of your children fell in love with a Muslim or an Asian , what would you do ? " he began .
" I would be very unhappy about it , because I would have seen two very distinct lines with their own heritage and culture being destroyed , " Griffin replied .
But , beseeched Paxman , " do you think that 's a greater consideration than the fact that they might be in love ? "
Griffin calmly pointed out that many Asian parents felt the same way as him because " the decision to stay with your own people is a very strong human instinct " .
When Paxman pressed again , Griffin concluded by saying : " Well , children are children and adults are adults , and they do what they want . "
A stumped Paxman said : " Mr Griffin , thank you " , and grateful BNP supporters posted the interview on YouTube .
This year Andrew Marr allowed Griffin to get away with saying that a " significant number of blacks and Asians voted BNP " , which is not true , and that the party had no problem with blacks and Asians " who have bought into our ways and values , like Trevor McDonald " .
Needless to add , his pretence that the BNP does not wish to deport Britons with the wrong skin colour was n't true either .
The BNP 's constitution says that it wishes to restore " the overwhelmingly white makeup of the British population that existed in Britain prior to 1948 " – when the SS Windrush docked at Tilbury , beginning the postwar immigration of blacks and Asians .
Earlier this month , Radio 1's Newsbeat cutely allowed " Mark and Joey , two young guys who are members of the BNP " , to imply that Chelsea and England footballer Ashley Cole was not really British .
It did not reveal that " Mark " was Mark Collett , the BNP 's press officer and an admirer of Nazism , and " Joey " was Joey Smith , who runs the BNP 's record label .
It is as if well - paid broadcasters have been cocooned from the dark ideologies that so dominated the 20th century .
Radio 1 gives greater latitude to spin doctors from the BNP than spin doctors from the mainstream parties .
Marr was not prepared to confront the chairman of the BNP with his party 's policy of stripping millions of British citizens of their rights , but was prepared to give credence to false rumours by confronting a Labour prime minister with the accusation that he was taking prescription drugs .
Rolling news and the internet favour glib commentary over serious journalism .
Yet the spectacle of broadcasters asking rougher questions of the prime minister and leader of the opposition – who , say what you like about them , do not dream of being the next Adolf Hitler – remains strange .
It is not as if the ambitions of the BNP are a secret .
The party was born out of the split of the last successful neo -Nazi movement in Britain , the 1970s National Front .
The BNP did not represent the breakaway of the NF 's moderate wing .
In 1985 , the courts jailed a founder member , Tony Lecomber , for plotting to blow up the offices of a rival organisation .
Griffin grew up in a National Front family and quickly adopted the Jewish conspiracy theories of traditional Nazism and the white supremacism of the Ku Klux Klan .
Not all his preferences were as obvious .
He admired the demagogic black separatist Louis Farrakhan for his insistence that blacks and whites could never live together , and the dictatorships of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and Ayatollah Khomeini for their hatred of Jews .
All extremisms , far left , far right and religious fundamentalists , are the same in essence .
And today , although the BNP strains at the leash to attack British Muslims , prominent neo -Nazis who grace its rallies will join British Trotskyists in appearing on Press TV , the Iranian propaganda station , and the BNP 's foreign affairs spokesman denounces " the warmongers in London and Washington " with all the fervour of Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Griffin also admired violence .
He joined the BNP after it won a council seat in Millwall in south London .
" The electors did not back a postmodernist rightist party , but what they perceived to be a strong , disciplined organisation with the ability to back up its slogan ' Defend Rights for Whites ' with well - directed boots and fists , " he said .
The byelection was a rare success for the far right of the 1990s .
The economy was growing and the country was about to elect Tony Blair .
The time when the National Front could win more than 20 % of the vote in the Black Country and the East End of London seemed as far away as the three - day week and power cuts .
Yet in Europe , parties that had their roots in the fascism of the 1930s were doing well , most notably Jean - Marie Le Pen 's National Front in France .
Griffin reasoned that , if only the BNP could decontaminate its brand , perhaps it could share their success .
He spoke of his plans in April 2000 to the American Friends of the BNP , a group that included David Duke , the then Ku Klux Klan leader , and James W Von Brunn , the white supremacist who shot dead a guard at the Holocaust museum in Washington this year .
" The BNP is n't about selling out its ideas , but we are determined to sell them , " he explained .
Instead of talking about Jewish conspiracies and racial purity , he would use " saleable words such as freedom , security , identity , democracy " .
He said that the desire to form a national socialist dictatorship and to force out the descendants of immigrants remained the same ; only the means were changing .
" Once we 're in a position where we control the British broadcasting media , then perhaps one day the British people might change their mind and say , ' yes , every last one must go ' .
But if you hold that out as your sole aim to start with , you 're not going to get anywhere .
So instead of talking about racial purity , we talk about identity . "
Footage of the event is on the web , but the media do not know or want to know how to deal with a man who fantasises about controlling them .
The difficulties are particularly acute for Question Time .
With five panellists and Dimbleby and members of the studio audience all wanting their say , there is no scope for forensic questioning .
A performer merely needs to look composed and deliver his lines .
I speak from experience when I say that outsiders – journalists , comedians , celebrity dons – have it easiest .
We can engage in a little rabble - rousing , while politicians know that the Westminster press will accuse them of a " gaffe " if they accidentally deviate from the party line .
Griffin , who has been practising his sales pitch since he addressed the Ku Klux Klan leadership in 2000 , will be composed .
He may be surprisingly popular because Question Time cannot just be about racism , antisemitism and links between rhetoric and violence .
As a regular panellist put it : " Suppose there is a question on the transport system , and Griffin says ' congestion in our cities is a disgrace that needs to be tackled now ' , the other panellists can only nod in agreement .
They cannot condemn him as a dangerous lunatic . "
By this weekend , nervy producers were hitting the phones as they began to realise the 1,001 ways the show could go wrong .
One minute , they booked Douglas Murray .
He runs the Centre for Social Cohesion , which examines neo -Nazi , Islamist and other extremism in Britain .
But he is also from the right , and so , the BBC reasoned , could tell the audience that it was possible to worry about immigration without being compelled to vote BNP .
Murray was more than ready to take Griffin on , but the next minute the BBC called back with second thoughts .
If he were to say anything in favour of immigration controls , Griffin would look like he was the voice of consensus .
As confused call followed confused call , Murray formed the impression the BBC did not know what to do .
Nor do the political parties .
Originally , the Conservatives put up Michael Gove , one of their best debaters .
Then they decided that , as a British Asian , Lady Warsi would be the ideal face of progressive conservatism and a living rebuttal of BNP prejudice .
So she would , had she not run a nasty campaign against the sitting Labour MP in Dewsbury in the 2005 election .
In white areas , she declared that she would campaign " for British identity and British citizens " and fight the menace of mass immigration .
In Muslim areas , the flag appeared in leaflets in a blood - spattered montage of Tony Blair and George Bush and troops in Iraq , while underneath it she played to religious homophobia by claiming that Labour was allowing children to be propositioned for homosexual relationships .
Jack Straw is a more formidable politician , but as a series of leaks to the Observer in 2006 showed , he spent a part of his time as foreign secretary trying to " engage " with the Muslim Brotherhood , an organisation that , in its origins and policies towards women , Jews and gays , is not so different from the BNP .
So assiduous did Straw 's attempts at " engagement " become , the British ambassador to Egypt warned him he was engaging for the sake of engagement , and that there was no prospect of Britain being able " to influence the Islamists ' agenda " .
It is not that Warsi and Straw are as bad as Griffin , but their pasts leave them open to charges of hypocrisy .
That their parties have nevertheless chosen them to confront Griffin suggests that they , like celebrity broadcasters , think it is enough to accuse the BNP leader of racism for him to show his fangs to the cameras .
As Thursday night will demonstrate , the rebranded BNP is more sophisticated than that , and fighting it requires principled and hard - hitting politicians who are as able to take it apart in the studios of Television Centre as on Dagenham 's council estates .

The purpose of this website is to post pictures of silly bongs .
That is all .
They 're expected to deal with every new topic that comes down the pike , from regulating securitized credit swaps to beefing up cybersecurity , whether they 've had any previous experience with it or not .
Of course , there 's never a shortage of people who want to educate them , but the " educators " with the greatest access are likely to be lobbyists .
And when one paid advocate is promoting one action , political physics dictates that another highly paid individual in somebody else 's pocket will be promoting an equal and opposite action .
Soon , all potential solutions become obscured by a fog of business propaganda .
Good question .
There 's been plenty of fog on Capitol Hill about free and open source software ( FOSS ) for a decade now , and that 's hardly surprising .
In the beginning , most big software companies were a'gin it , and any government agency CIO allowing a useful bit of FOSS to find a home on the servers she supervised was not likely to advertise that fact .
Eventually , some major vendors ( like IBM ) began including FOSS programs in the systems they were promoting to government customers .
But that only made things worse , because other vendors ( like Microsoft ) went actively on the offensive , initially comparing the theory and appeal of FOSS to that of communism .
With hordes of lobbyists deployed on the ground in Washington and in state capitals throughout the nation , it was soon a brave , and perhaps foolhardy , public IT manager who would dare to take a public stand in defense of FOSS .
And yet , by the turn of the millennium , FOSS was already infiltrating federal and state government systems everywhere .
And it was spreading rapidly .
When MITRE conducted a two week email survey of FOSS use within the U.S. Department of Defense in 2002 , IT manager respondents reported that they were administering 251 FOSS installations that included a total of 115 different FOSS applications .
Moreover , MITRE noted that the use of certain FOSS solutions had passed from elective to essential , giving examples that resonate even more forcefully today :
The main conclusion of the analysis was that FOSS software plays a more critical role in the DoD than has generally been recognized … .
One unexpected result was the degree to which Security depends on FOSS .
Banning FOSS would remove certain types of infrastructure components ( e.g. , OpenBSD ) that currently help support network security .
It would also limit DoD access to — and overall expertise in — the use of powerful FOSS analysis and detection applications that hostile groups could use to help stage cyberattacks .
Finally , it would remove the demonstrated ability of FOSS applications to be updated rapidly in response to new types of cyberattack .
Taken together , these factors imply that banning FOSS would have immediate , broad , and strongly negative impacts on the ability of many sensitive and security - focused DoD groups to defend against cyberattacks .
In the years since MITRE performed that study , FOSS usage has spread hugely on all types of government , academic , business and personal systems .
In some areas , such as Web server installations , the use of FOSS software greatly exceeds that of all proprietary alternatives combined .
Indeed , the use of FOSS is so pervasive that even Microsoft has accepted the reality that its enterprise customers will continue to to maintain mixed proprietary and FOSS systems , and will expect Microsoft to help them maximize the efficiency of these systems as well .
The result is that more and more of the best software developers participate in FOSS projects , whether on their own initiative , or at the behest of their employers .
In consequence , some of the best architected , most effectively updated , and lowest total cost of ownership software to be found anywhere is now FOSS .
The number of examples of such software continues to grow .
This is good news for the Obama administration , because the President cannot make good on his promises of openness , achieve his technology - dependent policy agenda , reduce the national budget deficit , or protect the nation against cybersecurity threats unless procurement officers actively embrace and utilize the best software available in every case , whether it be proprietary or FOSS .
Increasingly , the best software tool for a given job is likely to be the FOSS alternative .
Moreover , choosing a FOSS product — and especially one that fully implements open standards — will better protect the procuring agency from vendor lock - in .
It will also facilitate an ongoing high degree of competitive bidding for supporting services throughout the useful lifetime of a product , and provide government IT managers with real - time time access to security and other bug fixes as well .
But will procurement officers always make the best and most informed choice between proprietary software and FOSS alternatives ?
Too often , government IT managers are subject to vendor pressures , and some ( as in Massachusetts ) have found it necessary to resign in the face of vendor retaliation .
When it comes to FOSS , government CIOs would welcome some long - overdue fog cutting on the Hill .
They deserve to know that someone has their back when they make the right procurement decisions for the benefit of the American people .
It 's time for the Obama Administration to publicly state that it whole heartedly supports FOSS procurement by the federal agencies .
Not in preference to proprietary software , but on an equal basis .
Only by doing so can it ensure that when it comes to getting the best deal for the American public , the best software will win .

Chang­ing our Minds
By imag­in­ing many pos­si­ble worlds , argues nov­el­ist and psy­chol­o­gist Kei­th Oat­ley , fic­tion helps us under­stand our­selves and oth­ers .
- By Kei­th Oat­ley
you .
Aris­to­tle claimed that poetry — he meant the epics of Homer and the tragedies of Aeschy­lus , Sopho­cles , and Euripi­des , which we would now call fiction — is a more seri­ous busi­ness than his­to­ry .
His­to­ry , he argued , tells us only what has hap­pened , where­as fic­tion tells us what can hap­pen , which can stretch our moral imag­i­na­tions and give us insights into our­selves and oth­er peo­ple .
This is a strong argu­ment for schools to con­tin­ue to focus on the lit­er­ary arts , not just his­to­ry , sci­ence , and social stud­ies .
For more than two thou­sand years peo­ple have insist­ed that read­ing fic­tion is good foryou .

This is a strong argu­ment for schools to con­tin­ue to focus on the lit­er­ary arts , not just his­to­ry , sci­ence , and social stud­ies .
But is the idea of fic­tion being good for you mere­ly wish­ful think­ing ?
The mem­bers of a small research group in Toronto — Maja Dji­kic , Ray­mond Mar , and I — have been work­ing on the prob­lem .
We have turned the idea into ques­tions .
In what ways might read­ing fic­tion be good for you ?
If it is good for you , why would this be ?
And what is the psy­cho­log­i­cal func­tion of art gen­er­al­ly ?
Through a series of stud­ies , we have dis­cov­ered that fic­tion at its best is n’t just enjoy­able .
It mea­sur­ably enhances our abil­i­ties to empathize with oth­er peo­ple and con­nect with some­thing larg­er than our­selves .
Pos­si­ble selves , pos­si­ble worlds
Peo­ple often think that a fic­tion is some­thing untrue , but this is wrong .
The word derives from the Latin fin­gere , to make .
As some­thing made , fic­tion is dif­fer­ent from some­thing dis­cov­ered , as in physics , or from some­thing that hap­pened , as in the news .
But this does not mean it is false .
Fic­tion is about pos­si­ble selves in pos­si­ble worlds .
In terms of 21st - cen­tu­ry psy­chol­o­gy , we might best see fic­tion as a kind of sim­u­la­tion : one that runs not on com­put­ers , but on minds .
Such men­tal sim­u­la­tion unfolds on two lev­els .
The first lev­el involves sim­u­lat­ing the minds of oth­er peo­ple : imag­in­ing what they are think­ing and feel­ing , which devel­op­men­tal psy­chol­o­gists call “ the­o­ry of mind . ”
The the­o­ry - of - mind sim­u­la­tion is like a watch , which is a small mod­el that sim­u­lates the alter­na­tion of day and night as the earth rotates .
Often we ca n’t see sun or stars , so we refer to a lit­tle mod­el that we can car­ry with us , a wrist­watch , which , as it hap­pens , is more accu­rate than a device like a sun­di­al that offers a direct read - out from the heav­ens .
Sim­i­lar­ly , although some­times we know what oth­er peo­ple are think­ing and feel­ing because they have just told us , for the most part we have to con­struct a men­tal mod­el of the per­son to know what ’s going on inside their heads .
When we do this for emo­tions , the process is called empa­thy , and neu­ro - imag­ing stud­ies sug­gest that when we rec­og­nize an emo­tion in some­one else , our brains gen­er­ate the same emo­tion .
In effect , we are sim­u­lat­ing the oth­er per­son­ ’s emo­tion­al state .
Fic­tion , as Lisa Zun­shine has empha­sized in her 2006 book , Why We Read Fic­tion , engages our the­o­ry - of - mind fac­ul­ties and gives us prac­tice in work­ing out what char­ac­ters are think­ing and feel­ing .
Indeed some gen­res of fiction — for instance , the mys­tery novel — are entire­ly con­cerned with work­ing out what char­ac­ters are up to when they are try­ing to con­ceal it .
The sec­ond lev­el of sim­u­la­tion is about what hap­pens when peo­ple get togeth­er .
Just as com­put­er sim­u­la­tions of atmos­pher­ic pres­sure , winds , and humid­i­ty are used to gen­er­ate weath­er fore­casts , so nov­els can be thought of as sim­u­la­tions of how peo­ple react to com­bi­na­tions of social forces .
Near the begin­ning of Pride and Prej­u­dice , for exam­ple , Jane Austen describes a ball .
The nov­el­ ’s pro­tag­o­nist , Eliz­a­beth Ben­net , and her sis­ters are excit­ed because they might meet poten­tial hus­bands .
But one of the most eli­gi­ble men , Mr. Dar­cy , finds the pro­ceed­ings provin­cial , and thinks they will be tedious .
Austen is run­ning a sim­u­la­tion in order to under­stand what hap­pens in social groups when expec­ta­tions clash in this kind of way .
She ’s offer­ing insight into peo­ple ’s lives and manners — insight that ’s just as rel­e­vant to our world as to Eliz­a­beth Ben­net’s .
Under­stand­ing oth­ers
So if fic­tion is a kind of sim­u­la­tion of our emo­tion­al and social worlds , could it be that peo­ple who read a lot of fic­tion are more empath­ic and social­ly intel­li­gent than those who do n’t ?
This is the ques­tion that Ray­mond Mar , Jacob Hirsh , Jen­nifer dela Paz , Jor­dan Peter­son , and I asked in a 2006 study .
First we mea­sured whether 94 par­tic­i­pants read pre­dom­i­nant­ly fic­tion or non-fic­tion .
Then , to esti­mate their social abil­i­ties , we used two tests .
One is a mea­sure of empa­thy and the­o­ry of mind : Simon Baron - Cohen ’s “ Mind in the Eyes ” test .
The par­tic­i­pant looks at pho­tos of peo­ple ’s eyes — as if seen through a mail slot — and tries to guess the men­tal state of the pho­tographed per­son .
In the sec­ond test , the Inter­per­son­al Per­cep­tion Test , par­tic­i­pants view 15 video clips of peo­ple inter­act­ing , then answer a ques­tion about each one — for instance , “ Which of the two chil­dren , or both , or nei­ther , are off­spring of the two adults in the clip ? ”
Our results con­firmed that read­ing fic­tion is asso­ci­at­ed with increased social abil­i­ty .
We found that peo­ple who read pre­dom­i­nant­ly fic­tion were sub­stan­tial­ly bet­ter than those who read pre­dom­i­nant­ly non-fic­tion at the Mind in the Eyes test , and some­what bet­ter at the Inter­per­son­al Per­cep­tion Test .
But could it be that the per­son­al­i­ty char­ac­ter­is­tics of more social­ly intel­li­gent peo­ple incline them to read fic­tion ?
To help find an answer to that ques­tion , Ray­mond Mar used a fic­tion sto­ry and a non-fic­tion arti­cle from The New York­er , and ran­dom­ly assigned peo­ple to read one or the oth­er .
Mar gave all the read­ers an ana­lyt­i­cal rea­son­ing task in a mul­ti­ple choice for­mat , derived from the LSAT exam for entrance to law school , and a social rea­son­ing test in the same for­mat with ques­tions about the emo­tions , beliefs , and inten­tions of char­ac­ters in social sce­nar­ios .
The result :
The two sets of read­ers had sim­i­lar ana­lyt­i­cal rea­son­ing skills , but the short - sto­ry read­ers showed a stronger under­stand­ing of social sit­u­a­tions than the essay read­ers .
How do we explain these results ?
My col­leagues and I think it ’s a mat­ter of exper­tise .
Fic­tion is prin­ci­pal­ly about the dif­fi­cul­ties of selves nav­i­gat­ing the social world .
Non-fic­tion is about , well , what­ev­er it is about : self­ish genes , or how to make Mediter­ranean food , or whether cli­mate changes will harm our plan­et .
So with fic­tion we tend to become more expert at empathiz­ing and social­iz­ing .
By con­trast , read­ers of non-fic­tion are like­ly to become more expert at genet­ics , or cook­ery , or envi­ron­men­tal stud­ies , or what­ev­er they spend their time read­ing and think­ing about .
Chang­ing our­selves
So there is evi­dence that read­ing fic­tion improves our social abil­i­ties .
But does it affect our emo­tions and per­son­al­i­ty ?
This was the ques­tion behind a dif­fer­ent kind of study by Maja Dji­kic , Sara Zoeter­man , Jor­dan Peter­son , and myself , due to be pub­lished this year .
We ran­dom­ly assigned 166 peo­ple to read either a lit­er­ary short sto­ry or a ver­sion of the same sto­ry rewrit­ten in a non-fic­tion­al for­mat .
Before and after they read the text , we mea­sured read­ers ’ per­son­al­i­ties using a stan­dard per­son­al­i­ty test .
The lit­er­ary sto­ry was “ The Lady with the Lit­tle Dog , ” by Anton Chekhov , who is gen­er­al­ly acknowl­edged as the world ’s great­est short sto­ry writer .
It is about Dmitri Gomov , and a lady , Anna Ser­gueyev­na , whom he sees walk­ing with her lit­tle dog .
They are both alone , on vaca­tion at a sea­side resort .
They are both mar­ried to oth­er peo­ple , but they begin an affair .
At the end of their vaca­tion they part .
But their feel­ings for each oth­er grow , and both are shocked to dis­cov­er how much more impor­tant these feel­ings are than any­thing else in their lives .
They encounter many dif­fi­cul­ties , and over­come some of them .
The sto­ry ends with this : “… their hard­est and most dif­fi­cult peri­od was only just begin­ning . ”
The ver­sion in a non-fic­tion for­mat was writ­ten by Dji­kic as a court­room report of divorce pro­ceed­ings .
It has the same char­ac­ters and events , and some of the words , of Chekhov ’s sto­ry .
It is the same length and read­ing dif­fi­cul­ty .
Impor­tant­ly , the read­ers of the non-fic­tion­al account report­ed that they found it just as inter­est­ing , though not as artis­tic , as Chekhov ’s sto­ry .
We found that the per­son­al­i­ty traits of read­ers of Chekhov ’s sto­ry changed more than those of the read­ers of the court­room account .
The changes in per­son­al­i­ty were not large , but they were mea­sur­able .
They were dif­fer­ent from the changes of belief spurred by a piece of writ­ing meant to be per­sua­sive , which tend to be all in the same direc­tion as intend­ed by the writer .
Instead , Chekhov ’s read­ers changed in dif­fer­ent direc­tions , with each change unique to the par­tic­u­lar read­er , medi­at­ed by the emo­tions that each indi­vid­ual felt while read­ing .
Why ?
We believe that as peo­ple read Chekhov ’s sto­ry , they expe­ri­enced empa­thy with the pro­tag­o­nists and iden­ti­fied with them so that each read­er , in his or her own way , became a bit more like them , or decid­ed not to think in the same ways as the char­ac­ters .
When we read “ The Lady with the Lit­tle Dog , ” we can be both our­selves and Gomov or Anna .
Through sto­ries , self­hood can expand .
My col­leagues and I also believe that read­ers of Chekhov ’s sto­ry were tak­en out of their usu­al ways of being so that they could con­nect with some­thing larg­er than them­selves , beyond them­selves .
This is an effect that goes beyond fic­tion .
All art aspires to help us tran­scend our­selves .
Bit­ter­sweet crea­tures
So what is art , that it can enhance social abil­i­ties and trans­form the self ?
First of all , art is some­thing that lasts and can spread to oth­ers .
So although one can imag­ine a lover whis­per­ing an impro­vised poem into her lover ’s ear , for the most part a poem will trav­el in time and space , and last beyond the moment of its con­cep­tion .
Sec­ond , art is some­thing made by humans that is both itself and some­thing else .
Archae­ol­o­gist Steven Mithen argues that the first unequiv­o­cal works of art appeared rel­a­tive­ly recent­ly , between 50,000 and 30,000 years ago .
For instance , a wood­en flute has been dis­cov­ered from 43,000 years ago , and the ear­li­est cave paint­ings , at Chau­vet in France , are from 31,000 years ago .
In this same peri­od , orna­ments such as bracelets start­ed to appear , as did sites of human bur­ial .
In all these cas­es , the thing pro­duced was both itself and some­thing else .
A piece of wood was also a flute capa­ble of sound­ing notes .
Char­coal on a cave wall was also a rhi­noc­er­os .
A piece of bronze was also an adorn­ment .
A bur­ial site was some­thing con­struct­ed to show that some­one was dead and also alive on some oth­er plane .
Mithen pro­pos­es that until this peri­od , our pre­his­toric ances­tors were knowl­edge­able , but their knowl­edge was con­fined with­in domains .
One domain was inter­ac­tions in the social group , anoth­er was , say , the prop­er­ties of plant foods , and so on .
But at some point in the evo­lu­tion of the human brain , 30,000 – 50,000 years ago , the domains of our cog­ni­tive struc­tures start­ed to inter­pen­e­trate , and metaphor was born : marks on the wall of a cave could become a rhi­noc­er­os .
This lat­er allowed the ancient Greek lyric poet Sap­pho to write , “ Love shakes me again , that bit­ter­sweet crea­ture . ”
Love is itself , and also some­thing else .
The domains of emo­tion and taste inter­pen­e­trate through Sap­pho ’s poem , in a phrase that was so mem­o­rable that the idea of love being bit­ter­sweet has last­ed 2,600 years .
Such cross­ings of domain bound­aries still sur­prise us .
It is that sur­prise which can help expand our under­stand­ing of our­selves and the social world .

Actually , crises are always brewing in Afghanistan , but the one coming now is threatening to boil over , melt the kettle and blow up the stove .
That crisis is the Afghani presidential election runoff and the crisis of legitimacy that is sure to follow .
Hamid Karzai will win , but it will be a messy , nasty business with messy , nasty consequences .
Those events will precipitate a crisis that provides an opportunity , a fleeting opportunity , to get America out of that country .
If we 're smart enough to take it .
The first thing we need is a reality check .
What are our objectives in Afghanistan ?
What do we want for that torn patchwork quilt forever trying , and failing , to become a healthy nation ?
What 's our goal there , freedom and democracy ?
Well , people in heaven want orgies .
We need to dial down the expectations .
Maybe we just want to build up the Afghan state until it 's ready to stand on its own two feet .
But Afghanistan does n't have two feet , it has dozens .
If it is to stand at all , it will be on the feet of clans , warlords , druglords , local despots , religious authorities and assorted tribesmen who have precious little in common , save this : they do n't respond well to outside force .
Nor inside force , for that matter , which is why they 're always fighting .
That fight is going to get a lot hotter in the days and months ahead , after the runoff .
There will be hurt feelings and wounded pride and a severely diminished belief in the ballot box 's power to make things right .
Obama will have a chance to make good use of that crisis .
When Afghanistan devolves into chaos , on top of the already occurring civil war , Obama can begin to make the case that it 's beyond our power , any power , to heal that nation �not even with 500,000 boots on the ground , much less the 40,000 that General McChrystal wants .
We need n't " cut and run , " nor will we .
All Obama needs to do is " set down markers . "
He can give the Afghan government some time to get their act together .
He can save face by getting into a holding pattern , keep the already augmented troops in country for a while and " await events . "
He can even add a few , saying it 's a down payment on our commitment to Afghanistan , the rest to be provided when conditions on the ground , in theater , allow .
And when those conditions never arise , which they wo n't , Obama can announce that it 's time to " change the mission " and begin to withdraw our troops .
What should our mission in Afghanistan be ?
To keep our real enemies there from taking over and to keep al Qaeda on the run .
We can do that with special - ops and commando raids and Predator strikes on terror camps or anyplace else fanatics are holed up , dreaming of a second 9/11 .
Just like we 're doing in Pakistan .
With our army mostly gone , and hearts and minds , always out of reach anyway , no longer our core mission , our job will be much easier .
Our footprint will be smaller , collateral damage can be minimized , and when it inevitably happens , regrettable though it is , it wo n't hurt our troops engaged in pacification .
Because they wo n't be there .
Pacification wo n't be our mission .
Defense will .
And the people we 'll be defending is us .
Never let a good crisis go to waste .
If we do n't want to be stuck in Afghanistan for longer than the American people , or the Afghani people , can tolerate , we have to follow that advice right now .
The coming crisis will give us a precious chance to get out .
It is too good to waste .

LAHORE , Pakistan  Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , on a visit meant to improve relations with Pakistan , strongly suggested Thursday that some Pakistani officials bore responsibility for allowing terrorists from Al Qaeda to operate from safe havens along this country ’s frontier .
“ I find it hard to believe that nobody in your government knows where they are , and could n’t get to them if they really wanted to , ” she said to a group of Pakistani journalists on her second day here .
“ Maybe that ’s the case ; maybe they ’re not gettable .
I do n’t know . ”
It is extremely rare for an official of Mrs. Clinton ’s rank to say publicly what American politicians and intelligence officials have said in more guarded ways for years .
The remarks upset her hosts , who have seen hundreds of soldiers and civilians killed as Pakistan has taken on a widening campaign against militant groups that have threatened the country from its tribal areas .
But her skeptical comments also gave voice to the longtime frustration of American officials with what they see as the Pakistani government ’s lack of resolve in rooting out not only Al Qaeda , but also the Taliban leadership based in Quetta , and a host of militant groups that use the border region to stage attacks on American and NATO forces in Afghanistan .

A new study adds to the growing concern that prenatal exposure to the chemical bisphenol A could harm children 's development .
In the study of 249 pregnant women , the first to examine the effects of BPA on children 's behavior , researchers found that girls whose mothers had the highest levels of BPA during pregnancy were more aggressive and hyperactive at age 2 than other girls .
Findings appear today in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives .
BISPHENOL A : What you need to know about ' everywhere chemical '
Girls were more likely to be aggressive if their mothers had high levels of BPA — an estrogen - like chemical used in many consumer products — early in pregnancy or at about 16 weeks , the study says .
A typical pregnancy lasts 40 weeks .
The girls had aggression scores that were similar to those of boys , as measured by a commonly used test , says co-author Joe Braun of the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill .
Boys appeared unaffected by BPA .
Braun says he plans to follow children until age 5 , because behaviors can change over time .
Michelle Macias , a doctor and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics , notes that the increases in aggression were subtle .
" Nothing in this study suggests that these kids have higher rates of behavioral disorders , " Macias says .
Pediatrician Lawrence Diller , who specializes in treating hyperactivity , notes that many other factors could have caused the girls ' aggressive behavior .
Scientists need to perform a more comprehensive study before sounding " alarm bells " about BPA , he says .
A Food and Drug Administration report on BPA 's safety is expected to be finished next month .
Based largely on animal experiments , the government 's National Toxicology Program last year expressed " some concern " about BPA 's effects on the brain , behavior and prostate gland in children before and after birth .
Hugh Taylor , an obstetrician / gynecologist at Yale University School of Medicine , notes that the new findings closely match the animal studies .
And Taylor says the study raises concerns about the effect of exposing a fetus to an artificial substance that mimics estrogen .
Although estrogen is often considered a " female hormone , " it actually helps to " masculinize " the male brain around the 11th and 12th weeks of pregnancy , says neuropsychiatrist Louann Brizendine , author of The Female Brain .
" In the developing brain , timing is everything , " Brizendine says .
" I 'm worried that tiny amounts of this stuff , given at just the wrong time , could partly masculinize the female brain . "
And while BPA may not cause noticeable problems in individuals , it could have a much greater effect if the entire population is affected , so that children generally become more aggressive and hyper , says David Bellinger , a professor of neurology at Children 's Hospital Boston .
The new study actually may underestimate the link between BPA and aggression , Macias says .
Children in the study came from well - educated families , whose children tend to have much lower rates of aggression and hyperactivity .
In a more diverse population , the link between BPA and aggression might appear even stronger .
Co-author Bruce Lanphear , a pediatrician at BC Children 's Hospital in Vancouver , says there 's already enough evidence to show that pregnant women should reduce their exposure to BPA .
" We could end up doing a lot of harm by not acting , " he says .

In a bid to diminish the power of the US - dominated IMF and counterbalance the influence of Western investors , seven Latin American countries have agreed to form a “ Bank of the South . ”
Seven South American leaders — representing Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Ecuador , Paraguay , Uruguay and Venezuela — signed an agreement to launch the development lending institution , a project first floated in 2007 , with a startup capital of $ 20 billion .
Notably , Bloomberg news service reports that Chile , Colombia and Peru did not sign on to the bank .
ADVERTISEMENT
The plan aims to give the regions a greater voice at international organizations like the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , which is seen by many Latin American leaders as an institution that allows wealthy Western countries , particularly the United States , to exert undue influence on the region .
Venezuelan firebrand Hugo Chavez is credited with leading the effort to create the bank .
Chavez has declared his intention to leave the IMF and the World Bank , and some observers see this as the first substantial move in that direction .
The agreement was signed during a meeting of 60 Latin American and African leaders in Venezuela , known as the “ South - South summit . ”
The aim of the summit , the second annual one held so far , is to create political and economic ties among the poorer southern regions of the world .
“ A new stage begins for the union of South America and Africa …
We want our house to be model of how the South meets the South , ” summit host Chavez said in welcoming a final declaration and plan of action to be signed by leaders from both regions .
Chavez and Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi led calls at the meeting of nearly 30 heads of state and representatives of a further 30 countries for improved ties between the two southern continents .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We must build an international financial system based on development and not the current perverse rationale , ” urged Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa , president pro tempore of the Union of South American Nations .
Speaking during the closing hours of the two - day summit held on Venezuela ’s scenic Isla Margarita resort , Correa called for countries to negotiate a regional and bi-regional monetary agreement “ to coordinate our policies and prevent the crisis from deepening in our countries . ”
Reform of world bodies like the United Nations loomed large at the summit , with Paraguay ’s President Fernando Lugo calling for a “ new world order ” and Correa decrying a “ grossly unjust world order . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Kadhafi , who lashed out at Western powers in his rambling 95 - minute speech at the UN General Assembly , meanwhile called for the creation of a “ NATO of the South ” by 2011 to counter the military bloc of the United States and European powers .
“ The 21st century can be the century of Africa and Latin America , ” said Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , who is aiming to make Brazil an industrial powerhouse .
ADVERTISEMENT
He urged both regions to work together to secure “ the opening of European farming markets to African countries ” as part of negotiations to conclude the stalled Doha Development Round , which aims to lift millions out of poverty and shore up the global economy .
Chavez , whose country is the top Latin American exporter of crude oil , proposed to launch a public multinational company he dubbed “ Petrosur ” that would supply fuel to both regions .
The firebrand leftist leader , who used the summit as an opportunity to criticize US and European influence in developing nations , confirmed he supported building a refinery in Mauritania and proposed to build another in Equatorial Guinea to sell oil at a better price .
ADVERTISEMENT
Energy cooperation between the two regions , which are home to 24 percent of the world ’s oil and top oil producers like Venezuela and Nigeria , was a key theme at the meet .
The third Africa - South America summit will take place in Libya .
At this year ’s meeting , Chavez was especially effusive about his “ brother ” Kadhafi , confessing great “ admiration ” for the leader who was marking his first visit to Latin America since he came to power 40 years ago .

Experiment Looks to Bridge Classical Physics and Quantum Mechanics
Researchers takes steps to observe the ghostly effects of quantum mechanics in objects larger than atoms
You can imagine my surprise when I learned that Beyoncé was not just another nauseating platinum - plated R&B diva , but has been lured to perform in Egypt , for the first time ever , as part of the Mubarak regime 's cunning plan to corrupt society .
" The government is trying to make people indulge in sin and licentiousness to cover up the other crimes it is committing against them , " fumed a member of the Muslim Brotherhood .
Despite being a " booty - shaking believer " and her expressed disappointment that she can't go to church any more because of her fame , Beyoncé is no stranger to religious controversy .
In fact , it would seem that Muslim and Christian conservatives , in spite of their conviction that they are worlds apart , actually share a lot of common ground when it comes to female pop stars .
" Beyoncé is NO Christian .
She is satanic , serving the Devil ! " the website jesus - is - savior.com self - righteously and surreally proclaims .
More moderately , the Yuinon , a movement that seeks , in its own words , " to reach , rescue and redeem youth and young adults " , complains that the R&B star is a bad role model for impressionable youth : " Young girls that look up to Beyoncé will think it 's acceptable to be in church worshipping teary - eyed on Sunday then frolicking , bootyliciously for a video shoot in some Daisy Dukes the next day . "
Personally , I am not too excited about Beyoncé performing in Egypt , but that 's entirely on artistic merit – I simply do not like her style of music .
If I have any deeper objections , they centre more on how her overpriced , exclusive concert will throw into stark relief the gaping chasm between the have - loads and have - nots in Egypt .
In a country where the official minimum wage is still stuck in 1984 – at a paltry 35 Egyptian pounds a month ( about £ 3.90 ) – and many Egyptians are forced to survive on tip - based and street jobs , I wonder how people will react to the news that tickets to the concert are reportedly fetching as much as $ 400 a pop .
One thing that stumps me with the Muslim Brotherhood 's allegations is that , with Beyoncé 's concert taking place at an exclusive Red Sea resort hundreds of miles away from any major Egyptian population centre , I can't help thinking that even if the government was out to " corrupt " the morals of the people , there are easier and cheaper ways to do so .
For example , Egypt is the cradle of one of the world 's oldest and most suggestive dances , the belly dance , which has been traced by historians back to Pharaonic times , was transformed into a high art by the Ottomans , was reinvented as an erotic image of the Orient by the west and was reclaimed by Egyptians and Arabs and fused with other modern dances .
Its practitioners are reviled and admired , even idolised in a way that reflects the contradictions of society 's attitudes to women at ease with their sexuality .
The persona of the 'alma , with her strong personality , rebelliousness and native decency , good sense and wisdom , is semi-legendary .
Despite the Brotherhood 's better efforts , Egypt remains the capital of the Arab pop music industry and is a base for the region 's sexiest and most airbrushed pop stars , such as Ruby – although admittedly , most of them come from Lebanon .
One of these , Haifa Wehbe , managed both to win a best song of 2006 award and to cause outrage among those conservatives who have active imaginations with her video Boos el - Wawa ( " Kiss the Boo - boo " ) , a silly dance number featuring her entertaining a child .
To add insult to wawa , her latest film has angered some Egyptian Sufis because it apparently features a scene in which her bare legs distract a group of mystics from their prayers .
Many may rightly wonder why , with all the major challenges facing Egypt – poverty , corruption , authoritarianism , overpopulation and environmental degradation – religious conservatives , and even secular Arab activists , are so obsessed with sexy women .
This tendency has an ancient pedigree .
" From the fall of al - Andalus to the debacle of the 1967 Arab - Israeli war , dancers are depicted in Arab lore as the critical distraction of Arab leaders that caused the demise of Arab glory , " writes Andrew Hammond in Popular Culture in the Arab World .
But this is mistaking the symptom for the malady .
Arab leaders may have traditionally been able to surround themselves with female entertainers and concubines , but it is not the dancers who weakened the leader and , by extension the system , it is the authoritarian system in which the ruling elite lives , in many ways , above the law and cannot easily be held to account by the people .
There is also the fear , in a male - dominated society , of the suppressed potential power of women .
An example of this is Tawfiq el - Hakim .
Crowned as the father of modern Arabic drama , he was also known as aduw al - mar 'a ( the enemy of women ) for his opposition to female emancipation .
For instance , in what could have been a great allegorical play about vanity , individualism , collectivism and the pursuit of power , his Fate of a Cockroach descends into a barely veiled attack on the modern , professional woman who dons the proverbial trousers and oppresses her husband .
But El - Hakim is wrong : strong , independent , empowered women do not make cockroaches of men , rather they make humans of us all .

Robert Fisk exposed revived discussions by the Gulf States , China , France , Japan , Brazil , and Russia to replace the dollar as the benchmark oil trading currency with a basket of currencies including gold within 10 years .
This proposal is not new and discussions have been ongoing for decades .
But other extraordinary moves in the capital markets suggest we should take this threat to the dollar ’s position very seriously .
For example , China has $ 2.3 trillion in currency reserves ( about 70 % in dollars ) , and China knows how to get its way .
In November 2008 , Chinese banks said they would no longer play by our rules .
Top tier banks ( Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ) reneged on derivatives contracts .
They failed to come up with billions in collateral on dollar / yen FX trades , which were out of the money after the yen ’s October appreciation .
This should have been headline news in every financial newspaper , but it was n’t .
Chinese banks defaulted .
They may have been partially motivated by U.S. malfeasance in the capital markets that caused losses in Asia .
The U.S. squandered its credibility and our cover -ups have done nothing to restore it .
Most credit support annex agreements would say that closing out these trades would be an event of default , and then the cross default on all the trades would kick in with the same counterparty .
But the credit of the Chinese banks was better than many of their counterparties .
Everyone was forced to renegotiate contracts with the Chinese banks .
From the perspective of the derivatives markets , this is earth shattering .
What would have happened if AIG had done the same thing ?
( Hey , Goldman , UBS , and others … you want your collateral ?
Well … Stuff It ! )
At the end of August 2009 , China signaled that state owned oil consumers : Air China , COSCO , and China Eastern could default on money - losing commodities derivatives contracts .
If we had been paying attention , the U.S. should have done everything in its power to correct our mistakes , clean up the mess in our financial system — instead of sweeping it under the carpet — and turned our efforts to maintaining the credibility of the capital markets and the credibility of the dollar .

The usual definition of a chickenhawk is someone who supports war but actively avoids fighting .
Whenever I think of one , what comes to my mind are Young Republicans , but also leftists , who are just as bad if not worse .
A writer , whose name unfortunately completely escapes me , said the aforementioned definition is not totally accurate .
A better one is that a chickenhawk is someone who believes supporting war is a sign of his personal bravery and patriotism , and is convinced that those who oppose war , for whatever principled and thoughtful reasons , are always cowards and traitors .
Still , chickenhawks are cowards .
Why , then , can they not see what they are ?
There is only one reason :
They deceive themselves as to what they truly are .
They idealize themselves as proud , brave and patriotic , while others , more clear - sighted , see them for what they are : cowards who will do nothing except stand on the sidelines and yell , " Okay , throw the ball here !
Now throw it over there ! "
When people refuse to see their bad qualities ( what Jung called their Shadows ) , there is only one thing they can do to protect their self - delusion : project those qualities on other people .
Here is an example : when leftists talk about " hate " ( which they do all the time ) , they are projecting their own unacknowledged hate onto other people .
Chickenhawks are the same :
They cannot acknowledge their own cowardice , so they must project it onto others .
Those Others , to the chickenhawk , are the cowards and traitors , not the chickenhawk .
Yet , the chickenhawk must know , somewhere deep inside , that he is a coward , and so has to be ashamed of himself .
How does he cover up his shame ?
With pride .
Pride on top , hiding shame underneath .
The first time I ran across that formulation of pride covering shame was in John le Carre 's novel , The Spy Who Came in from the Cold , when he wrote of Leamas ' " protective arrogance concealing shame . "
Plato once wrote , " The cause of all sins in every case lies in the person 's excessive love of self . "
I would n't call what he 's writing about " self love . "
Excessive pride , arrogance , grandiosity , yes , but not self - love .
The social researcher James Gilligan , who spent 35 years dealing with prisoners , wrote , " Shame . . . motivates not confession but concealment of whatever one feels ashamed of . "
Guilt , he writes , can on the other hand lead to confession and penance .
He also writes , '' people who feel ashamed typically attempt to diminish that painful feeling both by assuming attitudes of arrogance , self - importance , and boastfulness . '
We 'll never see confession and penance from chickenhawks , because they have no guilt .
And it 's a lot easier to admit guilt than shame .
And chickenhawks ' shame and cowardice is something they will not , cannot , admit .
So they project it onto others : ' You should be ashamed of yourself for being a coward who 's not supporting our country and its wars . '
I believe the average chickenhawk must be exceptionally narcissistic , which is correctly defined as splitting things into all - good and all - bad ' idealization and devaluation .
The chickenhawk has to see himself as all good ( brave and patriotic ) , so his own unacknowledged badness ( his cowardice ) has to be projected onto others .
The late M. Scott Peck , a psychiatrist , called this kind of projection ' the genesis of human evil . '
If he 's correct , and I believe he is , then what chickenhawks are doing , in their self - deception , their unacknowledged cowardice , their arrogance and grandiosity , and their scapegoating of the innocent , is evil .
I sometimes wonder if chickenhawks ever think about how they would handle combat .
I think they'd do what a soldier friend of mine saw another soldier do : brag to everyone how tough and brave he was ( pride ) , but when the first shot was fired , he turned and ran ( shaming himself ) .
It 's probably a good thing chickenhawks are n't in the military : their cowardice and incompetence would probably get innocent soldiers killed .
No , not probably .
Would .
There 's an old saying -- and I have no idea where it 's from -- that the best warriors are the least war - like .
I will nod and agree with it .
Why in the world anyone listens to chickenhawks is beyond me .
Would anyone in his right mind listen to any coward about anything ?
All of them should be laughed at and ridiculed into silence -- because the one thing no coward can stand is to be laughed at .
Another great representation of the amazing loss of purchasing power by the US public are today 's oblivious statements about the Dow at 10,000 .
While in absolute terms the Dow may cross whatever the Fed thinks is a necessary and sufficient mark before QE begins to taper off ( Dow crosses 10 k just as Treasury purchases expire ) , the truth is that over the past 10 years ( the first time the DJIA was at 10,000 ) the dollar has lost 25 % of its value .
Therefore , we present the Dow over the last decade indexed for the DXY , which has dropped from 100 to about 75 .
On a real basis ( not nominal ) the Dow at 10,000 ten years ago is equivalent to 7,537 today !
In other words , not only have we had a lost decade for all those who focus on the absolute flatness of the DJIA , but it is also a decade where the US Consumer has lost 25 % of purchasing power from the perspective of stocks !
You wo n't hear this fact on the MSM .
And if you want to be really scared , here is the comparable representation for the DJIA in ounces of gold .
It cost about 30 ounces to buy the 10,000 Dow last time .
Now it costs less than 10 .
A Philadelphia developer has rooted out an unfinished feature of Windows 7 that turns any laptop into a wireless access point , allowing other Wi-Fi-enabled devices to share the connection without special software .
Nomadio , which specializes in military network consulting and development , used the new " Virtual Wi-Fi " feature in Windows 7 to create Connectify , a free application that it released as a beta last Friday .
Virtual Wi-Fi was crafted in Microsoft 's research group as a way to " virtualize " one wireless card as several separate adapters .
The project was discontinued in 2006 , but the work made its way into Windows 7 as " Native 802.11 Virtual Wireless Fidelity ( Virtual Wi - Fi ) object identifiers ( OIDs ) " .
" A year ago , Microsoft talked a lot about this as a big feature in Windows 7 , " said Alex Gizis , the CEO of Nomadio .
" But driver support did n't get finished .
The low - level code is in there , but the driver - level stuff is n't .
And there 's no app or setting in Windows to turn it on . "
Explaining that the feature was " half there " in Windows 7 , Gizis said his company realized " we have the rest of the software here , in our networking work . "
The resulting Connectify differs from the Internet connection sharing that Windows already supports via an " ad hoc " network connection , which lets several Windows computers share a single connection .
" For one thing , it shows up as a real wireless access point , " Gizis said .
" Two , Internet connection sharing has issues .
It returns to the default settings every time you shut down a connection .
And three , you can join another wireless network and still run the Connectify Hotspot on the same Wi -Fi card . "
One application came immediately to mind , Gizis continued .
" You 're sitting in a coffee shop that charges you for a wireless connection .
With Connectify , I can pay for that connection , and still have all my other devices , like my iPhone , connected to the Internet . "
Connectify lets a Windows 7 laptop " tether " other wireless devices to a single Internet connection by effectively turning that PC into a software - based wireless router , added Gizis .
" We 've done a lot of military networking , including a lot of mesh networks , " he said , " where special routers connect to each other . "
That technique , he said , was ideal for keeping in - the - field troops connected to the Internet .
Gizis has used his Connectify - equipped Windows 7 laptop as a wireless access point for his Apple iPhone , for example , and to provide a wireless connection to multiple PCs when only one Ethernet jack was available .
" There are a lot of neat scenarios where this comes in handy , " he said .
" For example , people can use a wireless printer without any setup , which usually requires that you first plug the [ wireless ] printer into the computer with a USB cable so it can select the network . "
Although the Connectify beta is free to download , Gizis said that Nomadio would likely pin a price on the final , full - featured version when that 's ready to release in about six weeks .
" I think we 'll end up with two - tier model , one that 's free , potentially ad - supported , and then sell a full version , " said Gizis .
Windows 7 is required on the notebook acting as a wireless hotspot , but any wireless - equipped device , including PCs running Windows XP or Vista , or even Mac laptops , can reach the Web through Connectify without any additional software .
Connectify also encrypts the traffic to and from the software " hot spot " using WPA2 - Personal ( AES ) encryption .
The beta of Connectify can be downloaded from Nomadio 's Web site .
Apple 's Mac OS
X already offers a similar feature under the " Internet Sharing " preferences setting .

Tony Perkins ' Family Research Council put out a statement slamming a plan by the Obama administration to devote resources to LGBT seniors .
The plan as announced by HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius : " The LGBT Resource Center will help community - based organizations understand the
unique needs and concerns of older LGBT individuals and assist them in
implementing programs for local service providers , including providing help to
LGBT caregivers who are providing care for an older partner with health or other
challenges .
The Administration on Aging will award a single Resource Center grant at
approximately $ 250,000 per year , pending availability of funds .
Eligible
entities will include public - private nonprofit organizations with experience
working on LGBT issues on a national level . "
FRC says the program is a waste of time because gay people die before they get old :
" In reality , HHS has no idea how many LGBT seniors exist .
No one
does !
The movement is only a few decades old , and people who are 80 - or
90 - years - old did n't grow up in a culture where it was acceptable to
identify with this lifestyle .
Of course , the real tragedy here–apart from the unnecessary spending –is that , given the risks of homosexual conduct , these people are less likely
to live long enough to become senior citizens !
Yet once again , the
Obama administration is rushing to reward a lifestyle that poses one of
the greatest public health risks in America .
If this is how HHS
prioritizes , imagine what it could do with a trillion dollar health
care overhaul ! "
Americablog notes the whole " gays die young " is the brainchild of debunked doctor Paul Cameron .
Political detainees in China are suddenly getting a lot more mail , as netizens press for their release .
HONG KONG — Chinese netizens have broadened a postcard campaign in support of high - profile prisoners of conscience following the release last week of Fujian - based blogger Peter Guo Baofeng , known as the micro- blogger " amoiist . "
Guo , who resumed tweeting Saturday after his two - week detention came to an end , became the focus of an impromptu postcard campaign after he tweeted his detention with the words " i have been arrested by Mawei police , SOS " on July 15 .
Two other bloggers , Fan Yanqiong and You Jingyou , were formally detained , their lawyers and relatives said .
Netizens from around China posted , tweeted , and e-mailed the idea , which was simply to send Guo a postcard to the Fujian No. 2 Detention Center where he was being held , addressed to " amoiist , " or to Guo Baofeng , " prisoner of conscience , " bearing the words " Guo Baofeng , your mother is calling you home for dinner ! "
Soon , bloggers were suggesting other political detainees across China who might receive similar postcards , including detained civil rights lawyer Xu Zhiyong , environmental activist Tan Zuoren , and AIDS activist Hu Jia .
Cyber - dissident Huang Qi , Charter '08 author Liu Xiaobo , civil rights lawyer Guo Feixiong , and opposition party activist Wang Bingzhang are also being targeted by the postcard - writers .
The campaign calls for netizens to send postcards to the prisons and detention centers where the prisoners were detained , referring to the recipients as " prisoners of conscience . "
Called for dinner
In keeping with the first postcards sent to Guo , many of those shown in online photographs bore a single sentence , " Your mother is calling you to come home for dinner ! "
Campaigners said that even if the prisoner in question never received the postcards , the sheer number and sudden appearance would put pressure on the authorities dealing with them .
It said the use of the term " prisoners of conscience " was in itself a protest against the use of fear by the authorities , and an appeal to common sense and the rule of law .
One of the senders was Guangzhou - based blogger Beifeng .
" There was a campaign that started up to get everyone to send one postcard to political prisoners , " Beifeng said .
" To begin with , it was for Peter Guo .
But I thought that we should expand it much further than that . "
" For example , we should send them to Tan Zuoren and Huang Qi , who were about to go on trial , and to Xu Zhiyong , who had just been detained .
We should also send them immediately to Hu Jia and the others , and that it might have some interesting effects , " he added .
" This is an entirely reasonable and lawful way of expressing one 's opinions . "
Rape claim
Several Chinese bloggers have been detained over claims that a 25 - year - old woman , Yan Xiaoling , was gang - raped and murdered , and that the alleged perpetrators were connected to municipal authorities in Fujian .
Fan Yanqiong 's husband Lin Hui said she had been charged with " false accusation " on July 31 , the same date Guo was released .
" What sort of country do we live in ? " Lin said .
" The police have a lot of power , in the Constitution , in law .
It 's very hard to be an ordinary citizen . "
" I feel quite hopeless . "
Guo posted an interview with Yan 's mother in which she made the claims explicit and accused local authorities of trying to cover up a crime , according to the blogging portal Global Voices Online .
Officials said Yan had suffered a hemorrhage caused by an ectopic pregnancy and began detaining anyone blogging or tweeting about the case .
Beijing - based lawyer Liu Xiaoyuan said three bloggers were arrested at the same time , including his client , You Jingyou .
" [ His ] family have already received an official letter informing them of his detention , " Liu said .
"
The charges are changed from ' libel ' to ' false accusation . '
The main reason for this is that the police saw that a lot of high - profile libel cases from last year were being dropped , and in some cases judicial officials were punished or reprimanded .
" " These cases involved bloggers being sued for libel , but they were n't standing up .
So now the police have turned to bringing trumped - up charges against them because they can see that libel suits are n't working , because they 're individual civil suits , whereas now they are using public prosecutions to charge them with false accusation .
" Liu said that while some of the articles and blog posts written by bloggers may not have been entirely accurate , they did n't add up to the charge of false accusation , a deliberate action aimed at perverting the course of justice .
" The articles ... were posted openly in a public place , and can't be said to be on the level of false accusation , " Liu said .
Beifeng said the postcard campaign was a sign that China 's 298 million Internet users were beginning to flex their muscles and to help mold public opinion .
"
You can see netizens taking action online now in all sorts of ways , " Beifeng said .
" They are turning what was once a rather fictional entity , online public opinion , into a show of real effectiveness .
" Meanwhile , Guo said his computer was still in the hands of government experts after being confiscated by police .
" I am planning to buy myself a laptop , because I do n't know when I will get my computer back from the police , " Guo tweeted Wednesday from his mobile phone .
His lawyer had told him by text message that the computer was still considered " evidence , " because the case was still open , he said .
China 's 47 million bloggers are frequently subjected to censorship by their Internet service providers , but politically sensitive material also routinely falls through the cracks as individual companies interpret government guidelines in their own way , experts say .
China had 298 million
Web users by the end of 2008 , who spend more time online than netizens in any other country with the exception of France and South Korea , according to official figures .
Chinese are also more likely to contribute to blogs , forums , chatrooms , and other social media like photo and video - sharing sites .
A vulnerability in a Time Warner cable modem and Wi-Fi router deployed to 65,000 customers would allow a hacker to remotely access the device 's administrative menu over the internet , and potentially change the settings to intercept traffic , according to a blogger who discovered the issue .
Time Warner acknowledged the problem to Threat Level on Tuesday , and says it's in the process of testing replacement firmware code from the router manufacturer , which it plans to push out to customers soon .
" We were aware of the problem last week and have been working on it since , " said Time Warner spokesman Alex Dudley .
The vulnerability lies with Time Warner 's SMC8014 series cable modem / Wi-Fi router combo , made by SMC .
The device is one of several options Time Warner offers to customers who do n't want to install their own modem and router to use with the company 's broadband service .
The device is installed with default configurations , which customers can alter only slightly through its built - in web server .
The most customers can do through this page is add a list of URLs they want their router to block .
But blogger David Chen , writing at chenosaurus.com , recently discovered he could easily gain remote access to an administrative page served by the router that would allow him greater control of the device .
Chen , founder of a software startup called Pip.io , said he was trying to help a friend change the settings on his cable modem and discovered that Time Warner had hidden administrative functions from its customers with Javascript code .
By simply disabling Javascript in his browser , he was able to see those functions , which included a tool to dump the router 's configuration file .
That file , it turned out , included the administrative login and password in cleartext .
Chen investigated and found the same login and password could access the admin panels for every router in the SMC8014 series on Time Warner 's network – a grave vulnerability , given that the routers also expose their web interfaces to the public - facing internet .
All of this means that a hacker who wanted to target a specific router and change its settings could access a customer 's admin panel from anywhere on the net through a web browser , log in with the master password , and then start tinkering .
Among the possibilities , the intruder could alter the router 's DNS settings – for example , to redirect the customer 's browser to malicious websites – or change the Wi-Fi settings to open the user 's home network to the neighbors .
The attacker would need the router 's IP address to conduct the attack .
But Chen found a dozen customer SMC8014 series cable modem / Wi-Fi routers by simply running a port scan on a subnet of 255 Time Warner IP addresses .
An evil hacker could easily automate a scanning tool to sweep through Time Warner 's address space and hack every SMC8014 it finds .
" From within your own network , an intruder can eavesdrop on sensitive data being sent over the internet and even worse , they can manipulate the DNS address to point trusted sites to malicious servers to perform man - in - the - middle attacks , " Chen wrote on his blog .
" Someone skilled enough can possibly even modify and install a new firmware onto the router , which can then automatically scan and infect other routers automatically . "
Chen said he contacted Time Warner ’s security department four weeks ago and was told that the company was aware of the security vulnerability but “ cannot do anything about it . ”
He says he 's relieved to hear the company is now addressing the problem .
It 's unclear if other Time Warner customers would be affected by the same issues .
Time Warner 's Dudley says the SMC8014 modem / routers are just a small portion of the 14 million devices its customers are using .
" We are working to determine if it affects other models , " he says .

BERLIN , Germany —
What Americans know about Angela Merkel : Named by Forbes as the world ’s most powerful woman for the fourth straight year , she was the world leader who grimaced at then - U.S. President George W. Bush ’s shoulder rub .
What Germans know about " Angie " :
She is a confident chancellor who has made steady assurances that she would guide the world ’s third - largest economy through the financial crisis .
But they do n’t know much more about her than that .
While Germans have embraced Merkel ’s displays of quiet authority , they have n’t been able to overcome the aura of personal and political aloofness that she projects .
Germany knows that its chancellor is powerful , but the recent election campaign did not show them her vision for German society and her ideas for solving the country ’s most fundamental structural and social problems .
And that lack of clarity over what she stands for could get Merkel in trouble during her second term .
The general contours of her biography are clear enough .
Raised in East Germany as the daughter of a Protestant pastor , she pursued a scientific career as a physicist in East Berlin .
After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of the country , Merkel quickly rose through the ranks of the country ’s governing conservative party , the Christian Democratic Union , serving as environment minister from 1994 through 1998 .
The way Merkel coolly dispatched rivals both within and outside her party on her way to the top earned her respect among her colleagues — as well as a reputation for harboring a political identity motivated more by the maintenance of personal power than by any specific conservative principles .
Her strategy may be explained as necessity :
The earthy , western German , male Catholics who long dominated the party were not inclined to be long forgiving to the intellectual , eastern German , secular Protestant woman who had managed to take the reins .
Merkel already had one strike against her for the poorly managed campaign she ran four years ago that fumbled away the conservatives ’ strong lead in national polls and forced the CDU into an unwieldy coalition with its rival , the center - left Social Democrats ( SPD ) .
Last Sunday ’s election will only exacerbate traditional CDU members ’ suspicions that Merkel has had an agenda to change party .
Since climbing the merciless path to the top of the CDU hierarchy , Merkel has tried to attract independents by softening her party ’s stance on social issues .
Where the CDU ’s leadership used to routinely claim that Germany was not “ a country of immigration , ” Merkel organized conferences with the Muslim community in Germany to discuss social integration .
Where the CDU was once skeptical that Germany could afford measures to counteract global warming , Merkel has presented herself as the “ climate change chancellor . ”
And where the party used to go out of its way to show its reverence for the institutions of the Catholic Church , Merkel did not hesitate to criticize the current German - born Pope Benedict XVI for reinstating bishops who had denied the Holocaust .
But , in her term as chancellor , Merkel has not been nearly as vocal on issues traditionally closer to her conservative party ’s heart , such as reforming the country ’s labor markets and simplifying its tax code .
Merkel has claimed she had no choice .
She ran in 2005 on a platform of free - market reforms , she insisted , but the voters had forced her to work with the SPD .
Nonetheless , on Sunday night when the election tallies came in , it was the doubters of Merkel ’s commitment to the conservative creed who felt confirmed .
Merkel ’s support among her own Christian Democratic base , which was not strong to begin with , eroded even further this year .
Merkel ’s CDU only earned 33 percent of the vote , the second worst showing of the party ’s history .
Merkel , it seems , has failed to pass the authenticity test among loyal conservatives .
And , indeed , when Merkel took the stage at the party headquarters less than an hour after polls closed across Germany , her primary concern seemed to be assuaging the country ’s moderate independents .
She was there ostensibly to announce and take credit for having achieved her election goal — namely , a coalition with the free - market Free Democratic Party — but Merkel ’s demeanor momentarily belied the festive occasion .
She bore a diffident expression and her message was less than celebratory .
Unprompted , she anxiously emphasized that she intended to serve as “ chancellor for all Germans . ”
It was a phrase that neatly summed up the unsustainable character of Merkel ’s tenure at the top of Germany ’s government .
For four years , she has been chancellor for all Germans , but no one party .
Merkel ’s demure , consensus - seeking style at the top of the “ Grand Coalition ” between SPD and CDU earned her personal approval ratings that were consistently near 70 percent .
But , at the same time , the polls from Sunday show that she has failed to strongly convince any single group of Germans that she was their chancellor in particular .
It seemed Germans liked her precisely because they were n’t sure what she stood for .
Merkel may continue to try to rhetorically stake claim to the lofty above - the - fray role she has carved out for herself , but she will likely find herself having to offer more partisan red meat to keep her grumbling conservative base , as well as her free - market FDP coalition partners , at bay .
Indeed , Germans will likely have to adjust to a chancellor less like the conciliatory moderator between the center - left and center - right whom they came to know recently , and more like the polarizing Margaret Thatcher - style “ Iron Chancellor ” figure that she was first depicted as four years ago .
The economic faction of conservatives will soon demand their pound of flesh in the way of structural reforms of the economy .
With the SPD ’s weak showing in the election , they ’ll argue that there are no more excuses for delay .
But , Merkel , true to her cautious temperament , has already indicated that Germany likely wo n’t be able to afford any more tax breaks given the country ’s large budget deficit in the wake of the financial crisis .
How long Germany ’s conservatives will pay deference to Merkel ’s personal popularity in the country at large is an open question .
But , if they do attempt to pressure the chancellor , they ought to be prepared for pushback .
Merkel ’s vision for the direction of German society may lack inspiration , and her rallying cries may fail to stir her voters , but her critics and allies alike have always given her credit as a canny strategist of intra-party politics and a merciless defender of her own personal authority .
Famously , she secured the party leadership for herself 10 years ago by decisively staging a putsch against her mentor and patron , former chancellor Helmut Kohl , when he was embroiled in a financial scandal .
It ’s not for nothing that Merkel has found her way to the top and stayed there .
As the “ chancellor for all Germans ” she may not articulate a clear political philosophy , but she certainly does have sharp elbows .
If there is one thing the Department of Defense does well , it ’s spend money .
With the Government currently under a shutdown , it ’s important to realize that Defense has been prioritized as essential and they are on duty protecting you .
As we ’ve seen from the recent Edward Snowden leaks , protecting you can sometimes mean spying on you .
There is an entire mysterious part of government funding known as the ‘ black budget ’ – the secret projects fund that we are n’t really meant to know about , and only do because its hard for the Pentagon to just shrug and say they left all that money on a bus .
So what do they spend it on ?
Boring shit like satellites and LSD filled whore houses mostly .
The good news is they also make a bunch of cool toys with that funding which we sometimes get to see .
The bad news is they also make a lot of gadgets that get to see us , no matter where we are or what we ’re doing .
Gadgets like :
1 ) The ISIS Airship
And what pray tell is that ?
Why , it ’s a gigantic airship that is able to provide a :
So … Kind of like a giant CCTV camera , but capable of following your every move ?
Yes , but better .
Much better .
You see , its pretty hard to hide from the ISIS – even if you were to drive about 300 km away , and park underneath a thick canopy of trees .
It ’s also pretty hard to spot it , as it floats silently at 70,000 feet .
In addition to all that , it features a “ giant flexible radar antenna ” , which sounds absolutely nothing like those tentacle things from War of the Worlds
Ca n’t a guy masturbate in private anywhere these days ?
Not outdoors anyway .
The only real way to hide from this thing ?
Go inside .
Yeah , turns out it is n’t so good at spotting you underground or in buildings .
Unfortunately , the DoD operates on a similar mantra to Apple – got a problem ?
There ’s a gadget for that :
2 ) The Radar Scope
This handy little thing is the 21st century , high - tech , multi million dollar version of the trusty mirror - on - a - stick .
No more will soldiers have to peer around corners or fear entering rooms !
Just hold this against the wall ( up to 12 inches of concrete ) and it will tell you if there ’s anyone there by detecting movements ‘ as small as breathing ’ .
Think of this as the UAV from CoD4 – turn it on and suddenly you know where everyone is in the form of a radar blip .
It ’s also pretty handy for finding people hiding in secret passages and the like .
It ’s meant to be for safely moving through buildings , but it seems pretty obvious what the real use is – checking if you ’re at home or not .
By the sounds of things , the only way to hide from it is to stop moving and hold your breath , and there ’s only so long you can do that for .
Good luck trying though .
3 ) Gorgon Stare
Probably the most badass name ever given to a military project , Gorgon Stare involves 12 very powerful cameras providing a complete and uninterrupted picture of a 4 - square - kilometre zone .
The real advantage is that each of the 12 cameras can be operated either individually or as a whole to form a much bigger picture .
This means if 12 people jump out a minivan and all run in different directions , Gorgon Stare can track each of them individually .
All this surveillance stuff takes up a bit of space , but it is n’t too heavy , meaning the same drone also has space for some weapons ( Sadly not of the laser variety though ) .
There is also a similar project known as Argus , which has a somewhat less impressive name , but an absolutely more impressive camera array .
Featuring a ridiculous 92 cameras , Argus can cover a 40 - square - kilometre zone in very high - resolution .
In short , it can tell you have a bald spot , and it can see you dyed your hair .
It also has the standard array of night vision and thermal sensors , so forget using darkness as cover .
However , it still ca n’t see inside buildings , and that radar scope requires someone to get up close and personal .
If only there was another way …
4 ) Interior Mapping Device
This is probably the least interesting name for a military project ever .
Perhaps that ’s deliberate though , to throw people off its scent .
The purpose if the IMD is to , well , map the interior of buildings .
No prizes for originality there .
Its pretty remarkable though – a few sensors here and there and military planners can have a complete blueprint of your house , including basements , alcoves , doorways and the thickness of your walls .
They might have been better off just going to City Hall , but hey , nobody likes to stand in line .
Its claimed that it wont be necessary to get within 10 m of the target building ( which can be up to 10 stories , and 2 basement levels , so you can forget using an escape tunnel when the feds come a knocking ) , and operatives can just leave a few sensors in innocent looking bags , or pizza boxes before disappearing out the way .
Gone are the days of flower delivery vans parking opposite your driveway for days on end .
How does it work ?
Well , uh , we do n’t know .
Nobody does really .
The most likely theory seems to involve sending out “ echoes ” from pipes or electrical wiring within the building , or as DARPA puts it :
“ Stimulus response of building infrastructure contains tactically useful information on the interior structure .
Infrastructure includes , but is not limited to , the structural , electrical , plumbing , and ventilation systems ”
Ah well – even with the radar scope they wont know where you are exactly .
You can still have the element of surprise if you jump out on them – blow a wall down maybe ?
Oh they thought of that too …
5 ) Mind Reading Binoculars
Holy shit , the crazy guy with the tinfoil hat was right !
Well , yes and no .
The device does sort of read minds – just not yours .
It scans for brain activity in the same way thermal goggles pick up heat , in that the user will see a visual representation of it through the goggles .
The next step is where it gets interesting .
The operator will train the system to recognize their brain activity in the event of a threat , which means when actually deployed , the goggles will know if your little monkey brain is concerned or not .
But that ’s pointless – you know what ’s a threat and what is n’t anyway .
The difference here is that the goggles will know before you do .
The theory is that the subconscious mind picks up on threats before the conscious mind can process them .
What the goggles do is tap into the users head and bypass the ‘ inhibitory reactions ’ – that pesky reflex that stops you from acting impulsively – by ‘ reading ’ their subconscious .
In essence , that means if something were to surprise you , rather than go through the normal checklist of “ Is this going to hurt me ?
Can I stop this hurting me ? ” your brain ( courtesy of the goggles ) skips straight to the “ Arghh ! Kill it ! ” stage .
So to go back to the idea of jumping out of a hiding place , if you were to do that , the guy wearing these would shoot your sorry ass before he even had time to be surprised .
Absolutely no chance of escape then ?
Nope .
So it would appear then that the Government has everything they need to follow you 24/7 , without you ever knowing about it .
But they probably are n’t doing that , right ?
Right ?
Best fetch the tinfoil just in case …

October 8 , 2009
On his show today , Glenn Beck covered the H1N1 virus and vaccine .
He said he would not take a stand on if you should submit to the vaccination .
Beck asked his guests about the attenuated virus in the nasal spray version of the vaccine .
Marc Siegel , M.D. , who has written a book on the swine flu — and Fox naturally peddled , thus giving the audience the idea he is an expert — said the live virus in the vaccine is not capable of spreading the disease in healthy people .
“ No claws on it , ” Siegel insisted , “ it has been totally deactivated .
It is alive and it can get you sick if you are immunally compromised or if you have asthma or you are pregnant .
You can only take it if you are totally healthy .
It can not morph into the flu itself . ”
It is estimated 60 percent of the U.S. population is immunodeficient in one way or another , but doctor Siegel did not mention this .
He also did not mention concerns on the part of other doctors and health care professionals about the attenuated virus .
Siegel also did not say how health care providers will prevent the immunodeficient from getting the virus .
Due to government and corporate media hype about H1N1 , it is likely millions of less than healthy people will be demanding they be vaccinated .
As a responsible doctor instead of a Fox News talking head , Mr. Siegel would have mentioned the FluMist insert .
It states that FluMist “ recipients should avoid close contact with immunocompromised individuals for at least 21 days , ” in particular immunocompromised people living in the same house .
In other words , it is inevitable millions of immunocompromised people will get sick .
Millions of Americans suffer from eczema , allergies , cancer , HIV infection or AIDS , emphysema , Crohn ’s disease , multiple sclerosis , herniated spinal discs , acute muscular pain syndromes , and all types of rheumatoid and autoimmune diseases .
As much as 60 % of the entire population could be considered to be “ chemically immunosuppressed , ” according to experts .
The FluMist campaign now underway will be the “ most intense , direct - to - consumer marketing campaign ever waged for a vaccine , ” costing an estimated $ 25 million over the next 2.5 months .
Big Pharma plans a three - year , $ 100 million campaign to encourage use of the nasal flu vaccine among physicians , notes Dr. Sherri Tenpenny .
“ Apparently , the goal seems to center around frightening — or inducing enough guilt — that everyone would begin to demand the vaccine as soon as it is available , ” including the immunodeficient .
[ efoods ]
But is not merely the risks to the immunosuppressed .
As Dr. Tenpenny notes , an ever greater concern about FluMist is the contents within the vaccine .
In addition to the live , attenuated influenza virus — the average dose contains between 10 million and 100 million viral particles — the culture media the viral strain was developed in may not be free of pathogens not tested for .
In addition , the risk that the vaccine may contain contaminant avian retroviruses is present .
Add to this concern the fact a stabilizing buffer containing potassium phosphate , sucrose ( table sugar ) and nearly 0.5 mg of monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) is added to each dose , according to the FluMist package insert .
“ The pharmaceutical companies do not necessarily always do a reasonable job of considering the ‘ down side ’ when they are pushing new drugs or new vaccines , ” writes Tenpenny .
“ FluMist has the potential for causing the worst , most severe flu epidemic seen in years .
Parents tell their young children not to put things up their noses because they might cause them harm .
It would be wise to consider that advice for adults .
With all the risks involved , one should be extremely cautious about what one allows to be sprayed in one ’s nose . ”
Dr. Rima Laibow calls FluMist a “ recipe for pandemic .
( It ) contains 3 live viruses .
You shoot it up your nose and your immune system gets a chance to make antibodies to three live , weakened viruses while the manufacturer hopes against hope that one of these three actually causes a disease this year … .
Of course , if you are immune compromised or go near someone who is , you will get sick or infect them with the virus and they can get the flu . ”
“ Laibow and others also warn that Flu Mist risks potential brain damage , making it an extremely hazardous drug , ” writes Stephen Lendman .
“ The nasal passage olfactory tract is a direct pathway to the brain .
Ingesting viruses through it risks encephalitis , a viral - induced acute brain inflammation . ”
None of this was brought up on the Fox News segment — and for good reason .
The government wants a preponderant number of people to get vaccinated against a non-existent pandemic by a virus that has so far killed less people than the regular flu season .
Fox News , just like CNN , MSNBC and the rest , function as CIA disinformation , propaganda , and brainwashing organs for a global elite who are eugenicists and believe the planet is populated with too many useless eaters .
“ As the federal government launches the most ambitious inoculation campaign in U.S. history , several surveys indicate the public is decidedly ambivalent , ” the Washington Post reported last week .
“ A nationally representative poll of 1,042 adults released Friday by the Harvard School of Public Health found that only 40 percent were sure they would receive the vaccine and that about half were certain their children would .
Recent research by the University of Michigan and by Consumer Reports yielded similar results . ”
Americans are not stupid .
They know there is something rotten in Denmark — or the District of Criminals — when the government gives billions of their tax dollars to giant pharmaceutical companies and fills the public airwaves with PSAs featuring Elmo urging them to have their children injected with an experimental vaccination .

Twenty years ago , late in the evening of 3 June and into the morning of 4 June , Chinese tanks and troops stormed Tiananmen Square , killing thousands of occupiers .
The demonstrators only crime had been to campaign for democracy .
The death of Hu Yaobang sparked the revolt .
Hu was a reforming leader who lost power in 1987 for being “ too soft ” on student demonstrators .
150,000 students went to his funeral demanding his posthumous rehabilitation .
The calls widened to include demands for democracy and an end to corruption .
The movement grew rapidly and after a period of unrest throughout the country students and workers occupied Tiananmen Square .
The Square became a focus for the democratic and working class movements in China .
The movement was not just a student one .
John Gittings is a China expert and wrote for the Guardian newspaper in the UK .
He described the ferment in the month before the massacre this way :
Beijing in May 1989 was a city transformed .
In the streets there was a sense of comradeship mixed with excitement that so many people – workers and ordinary citizens – had found their voices .
The [ government ] seemed paralysed and the streets belonged to the masses .
After a month of unrest , the Government on 19 May tried to reassert order .
Prime Minister Li Peng declared martial law and ordered troops into Beijing to clear the protesters .
He failed .
70,000 workers in the city ’s Capital Iron and Steel works went on strike .
The Underground workers cut the power off and halted the progress of troops into Beijing .
Workers and students built barricades around the city .
The barricades were designed not to stop the soldiers but to slow their progress .
This meant ordinary Chinese people could argue with the soldiers and get them to join the revolt .
Many soldiers did join the workers and students .
Beijing was on the brink of revolution .
One eyewitness at the time described how “ for 48 hours now the city of Beijing has been entirely in the hands of the people . ”
5 million people were on the streets of the capital .
They were in charge .
Everywhere people sang the Internationale as a symbol of their commitment to a better world and to mock the false socialism of their rulers .
Workers began to organise a general strike .
Student leaders argued against it , saying it was not in “ the national interest . ”
The students won the argument , and there was no general strike .
The moment of insurrection was lost .
The hard - liners in the Government seized their chance .
Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng sacked Zhao Ziyang , who sided with the demonstrators .
They then ordered the brutal attack on the demonstrators in Tienanmen Square .
The hard - liners knew that the democracy movement was a challenge to the rule of the Chinese Communist Party and like all dictators they responded with guns .
John Gittings described the scene :
The tactics were brutally simple .
Armoured personnel carriers formed the spearhead while soldiers on foot shot to kill from both sides .
Repression defeated the revolt .
But force cannot keep the Chinese people in servitude forever .
The 1989 democracy movement arose out of the very success of the Communist Party ’s economic reforms .
It is the continuing massive growth of the Chinese economy which ensures that in the future there will be new and stronger democratic challenges to the rule of the Communist Party .
To paraphrase Marx , the Chinese Communist Party is creating its own gravedigger – the Chinese working class .
The changes to Chinese society have been monumental .
When Mao won power in 1949 , China was a peasant country .
The working class was small , and played no part as a class in the Chinese Communist Party ’s victory .
The revolution was nationalist , not socialist .
The essence of Mao ’s economic policies was to replicate Stalin and use the state in an attempt to industrialise the country .
Under this state capitalism the state is the collective embodiment of capital , extracting surplus from the working class , and dragging the country up by its bootlaces in the crude accumulation of capital .
Historically it appears state capitalism can be quite successful – for a while .
Stalin ’s version turned peasant Russia into a military superpower .
But state capitalism outgrows itself , and the ruling “ communist ” elite , recognising the economic stagnation their model eventually produces , begin to look for new ways of growing .
Thus under Deng Xiaoping the Chinese Government moved away from Mao ’s Stalinist state capitalism to a guided market economy .
The consequence has been a massive restructuring of Chinese society .
The workforce in China today is over 900 million .
There are hundreds of millions of workers , many of whom are concentrated in the major cities .
In addition , the country now has a thriving middle class and millions of students .
In the first quarter this year economic growth fell , on Government figures , to 6.1 percent .
Some economists believe the figure is really closer to 4 per cent .
The dictatorship itself admits it needs at least 8 per cent growth to prevent major social unrest .
Certainly many millions of workers in the cities have returned to their villages because there is no work in the cities .
China is linked to the world economy .
Almost a quarter of its GDP comes from trade with other countries .
That trade is drying up .
Twenty years after the massacre , with unemployment in urban areas growing markedly , with corruption endemic , with little faith in the dictatorship and with the Chinese working class the mainspring of China ’s growth , the situation is more favourable objectively for the democracy movement now than in 1989 .
Tiananmen Square was a dress rehearsal for the future .
The Chinese working class has a material interest in democracy .
It has the strength to overthrow the corrupt and bankrupt butchers in Beijing .
Posted by John , October 3rd , 2009 - under Kraft , Vegemite .
Tags : Capitalism
Vegemite is an iconic Australian spread ; so iconic in fact that it has never really spread anywhere else .
It is a yeast extract and the best way I can describe it for non-Australian readers is to suggest you imagine salty axle grease .
Vegemite is made from left over brewer ’s yeast and salt , celery and onion .
I am hooked .
Every morning my toast gets lashings of salt and Vitamin B cleverly disguised as Vegemite .
The US based company Kraft has owned Vegemite since 1935 .
Kraft is now a huge multinational food and beverage company .
It has had an expansion program in place for a number of years .
Indeed the whole of the global food industry is undergoing rationalisation under the pressure of competition and the need to cut costs .
The global economic crisis , by devaluing the worth of many companies , has increased opportunities for the remaining predators to purchase others on the cheap .
So this tendency to monopoly is hot - wired into capitalism .
What an irony .
Competition leads to monopoly .
Kraft for example has just made a $ 20 billion takeover bid for one of its main competitors , Cadbury .
It purchased the French Danone group two years ago .
Kraft is going through a renewal program under its CEO and Chair Irene Rosenfeld .
She has sold off loss making holdings , purchased competitors , cut jobs and other ‘ costs ’ and increased prices .
Some of these price increases have been sneaky – repackaging Vegemite for example in smaller jars but with no price reduction .
Indeed , so successful has this rationalisation process been that forecasts for Kraft for this financial year are of a ten percent revenue increase despite a fall in sales .
Rosenfeld has been well rewarded for her cost cutting .
Her remuneration package is worth about $ 20 million .
But not everything has gone well .
One cost cutting measure was to reduce the amount of cheese in Kraft ’s Macaroni and Cheese meal .
Consumers rebelled and the company relented .
But the search for cost cutting opportunities continues .
In Australia this has seen Kraft develop a ‘ new Vegemite ’ .
Let ’s be frank – the new product just enables Kraft to mix its excess cream cheese with left over Vegemite .
Sales of the original spread were falling .
Kraft argues that Australian tastes are changing and that traditional Vegemite was losing its appeal to migrants .
Since foreign born Australians make up nearly a quarter of the population this makes some sense .
The new unnamed version of Vegemite was successful – it has evidently sold 3 million jars since its release in July .
Whether these are overall extra sales , and longer term consumers , is the real question for Kraft .
The controversy over the name of the new product could well be a ploy to bring it to the attention of the Australian market and boost sales .
The cream cheese - Vegemite concoction is , according to many reports , a taste disaster .
Not only that ; according to Kelly Burke in the Sydney Morning Herald it is a nutritional disaster too .
In an article called Kraft spread saga gets iRonic Kelly writes :
IT HAS almost 12 times the amount of saturated fat and three times the kilojoules a serve .
It has half the protein of the original and less than half the amount of vitamin B . Oh , and there ’s more salt .
So it ’s a crap product , driven by the need to rationalise production , with no thought about what consumers would like and dressed up as something new and hip .
The company thought that they could sell us dog shit sandwiches if they came up with a good name .
So they had a competition to find a name for the new product .
A little history might help here .
There was a competition too back in 1923 to find a name for the then new product .
Vegemite won .
It did n’t take off .
So much so that after a few years the owners changed the name to Parwill .
The logic of doing so was something only a management guru divorced from real life could come up with .
You see , back in the 1920s Australia ’s favourite spread was the British product Marmite .
The advertising slogan became ‘ Marmite … Parwill ’ .
Boom boom .
When Parwill did n’t catch on , the owners reverted to Vegemite .
They devised schemes to basically give it away and advertised it massively .
We liked it ; it was a good cheap Depression spread .
Indeed as sections of society radicalised during the Depression and many blamed British financiers like Otto Niemeyer for the problems of Australian capitalism , a switch away from a British product to an appealing ‘ Australian ’ one resonated with sections of the working class .
The owners also played up fears that with lower wages – the Arbitration Commission cut them by ten percent – women and their babies would get less Vitamin B unless they tried a cheap alternative , like Vegemite .
So , following on from the early days of Vegemite , a few months ago the geniuses in Kraft thought a competition for its cream cheese - Vegemite abomination would be a clever marketing exercise .
It just shows what contempt they hold us in .
The winner was iSnack2.0 .
A better moniker might have been iShit2.0 .
We vegemites rejected the new name so overwhelmingly that the company abandoned it after four days .
And now these geniuses – do they really run the economy ?
– are going to have a new competition !
Is n’t capitalism wonderful ?
A rubbish product , and a rubbish name , and the CEO pockets $ 20 million a year .
By Victor Davis Hanson - October 8 , 2009
President Obama last week flew to Copenhagen to persuade the International Olympic Committee to award the 2016 games to Chicago , his hometown .
He and first lady Michelle Obama delivered their now well - known inspirational stories about their Chicago neighborhood experiences .
They even had Oprah in tow , along with a number of other Chicago big shots .
Danish crowds thronged to see the celebrity president .
The paparazzi had a field day .
After little more than an hour - long presidential pep talk , Obama 's Chicago whirlwind entourage jetted back home on Air Force One .
A few hours later , the IOC rejected Chicago 's we - are - the - world bid in the first round .
The rebuff of the well - received rock star Obama was a minor affair .
But the snub was emblematic of all sorts of larger problems with America 's new therapeutic foreign policy .
In the last ninth months , President Obama has used his youthful charisma and nontraditional background to wow nations abroad with his message that a new , friendly White House can export its trademark " hope and change . "
He has sent special envoys to dictators in Cuba and Syria .
Yet the former has not granted more freedom to its oppressed people , and the latter has not stopped funding terrorists or sabotaging Lebanon .
In Venezuela , it seems the more Hugo Chavez praises nice - guy Obama , the more he brags about plans to acquire rockets and develop a nuclear program ( all the while jailing opponents ) .
Months ago , Obama also sent an olive branch to the Israel - hating , terrorist - sponsoring Iran .
In reaction , the Iranians kept on building a new secret nuclear facility .
The International Atomic Energy Agency acknowledges the regime now has the necessary expertise to build a bomb .
America recently sought an implicit grand deal with Russia 's Vladimir Putin :
We would halt missile - defense plans in nearby Eastern Europe , which Russia believes is still in its sphere of influence ; he then would pressure Iran to give up its nuclear program .
Putin , of course , loved the missile - defense part of the deal - but did nothing concrete to pressure his long - term Iranian friends .
In the process , democratic but vulnerable Eastern European states have learned not to rely on the United States .
All these recent examples could be expanded , but suffice to say that former and present enemies now get more presidential attention than friends .
The president 's much ballyhooed " reset button " for dealing with adversaries is apparently based on three assumptions :
Too many nations abroad did not like us because of George Bush .
With Obama in office , they will once again be fond of America as they melt before his charisma , unique heritage and friendly outreach .
As a result , the world at large will become a calmer , safer place guided by us .
Only one of these propositions is correct :
More foreigners now really do say they like the United States better after Barack Obama was elected in January .
They apparently appreciate his heartfelt apologies for two centuries of American sins -- and his assurances that America is now an equal in the family of nations .
But the other two assumptions are terribly wrong .
Dictators like those in Cuba , Iran , Libya , North Korea , Russia , Syria and Venezuela predated George Bush .
They hate the United States not just because of Bush 's tough - guy rhetoric .
The problem instead is that their agendas - getting nukes , bullying neighbors , taking back disputed land , supporting terrorists , jacking up oil prices and stifling political dissent - are not reconcilable with America 's traditional vision of a democratic , free - market global system .
What keeps the so - called civilized world civilized each day is largely the willingness of the U.S. to invest vast resources to protect admirable but weaker nations .
America keeps Europe , Japan , South Korea , Taiwan and democracies in Asia and Latin America safe from regional bad actors .
That way these countries can help spread shared ideas about freedom and progress to less fortunate others .
And for all the tragedy in Afghanistan and Iraq , America removed the Middle East 's two worst regimes - the Taliban 's and Saddam Hussein's - and is trying to foster civil societies in their places that will benefit both the region and the world at large .
The U.S. 's job is expensive , dangerous and unpopular .
But our role largely explains a half - century of unprecedented global prosperity -- and so far the absence of World War III .
In contrast , the more Obama blurs the difference between allies and enemies , the more he depresses the former and encourages the latter .
At the present rate , America will become ever more liked - and ever less respected .
We saw a little of that in Copenhagen .
Last year , 202 cars were stolen in Upper Darby ; 84 this year .
According to FBI crime reports , about 950,000 motor vehicles were stolen in 2008 , resulting in a $ 6.4 billion loss .
Those numbers were down from previous years .
Across Pennsylvania , 22,243 motor - vehicle thefts were reported in 2008 - an average of 61 a day .
MANILA - Typhoon Pepeng ( international code name Parma ) remained strong Friday morning as it moved towards the area of Aurora and Isabela provinces in northern Luzon .
Weather bureau Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services ( PAGASA ) hoisted Signal No. 2 over Catanduanes , Camarines Norte , northern Quezon , Aurora and Polillo Islands .
Signal No. 1 was placed over 27 areas in Luzon and Visayas , including Ilocos Norte , Ilocos Sur , Abra , Apayao , Kalinga , Cagayan , Babuyan Islands , Isabela , Mt. Province , Ifugao , Benguet , La Union , Nueva Vizcaya , Quirino , Pangasinan , Nueva Ecija , Tarlac , Zambales , Pampanga , Bulacan , Rizal , southern Quezon , Camarines Sur , Albay , Sorsogon , Burias Island , and Northern Samar .
PAGASA said Pepeng was located 270 kilometers east of Virac town , Catanduanes province .
It was moving west northwest at 19 kph , packing maximum sustained winds of 195 kilometers per hour and gustiness of up to 230 kph .
The typhoon was expected to make landfall in the Aurora - Isabela area by Saturday noon and exit through Laoag City by Sunday morning .
The regional disaster coordinating council in Central Luzon has ordered units in Aurora , Nueva Ecija , Tarlac , Bataan , Zambales , Pampanga and Bulacan to closely monitor the storm and prepare for preemptive evacuations .
The Bicol regional disaster coordinating council has also convened and plot areas that can be used as evacuation sites in case Pepeng turns into a supertyphoon .
The Philippine Coast Guard has banned small seacrafts from sailing , particularly in Bicol and other areas affected by the typhoon .
Officials in Bicol said a total of 1,071 stranded passengers have been stranded in ports .
Classes at all levels in Albay province has also been suspended in anticipation of the typhoon .
It has become one of Britain ’s most troubling wildlife mysteries : why are some of our best - loved birds , all of them summer visitors from Africa , plunging in numbers ?
Drastic declines are occurring in a range of migratory species , from the cuckoo to the nightingale and from the turtle dove to the wood warbler , leaving bird lovers in many places bereft at the loss of the creatures which have always arrived with the spring .
But now the mystery is being seriously investigated .
Britain ’s leading bird research organisations , the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) and the British Trust for Ornithology ( BTO ) have mounted a joint expedition to the African regions south of the Sahara , where the birds spend the winter , to examine what may be happening there .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Today , eight out of 10 of our most rapidly declining species are sub-Saharan migrants , with the turtle dove heading the list – it has gone down by 66 per cent since 1994 .
Other species are close behind : the latest figures show that the wood warbler has declined in Britain by 60 per cent since the same date , the pied flycatcher by 51 per cent , the yellow wagtail by 49 per cent , the whinchat by 43 per cent , the nightingale by 41 per cent , the spotted flycatcher by 38 per cent and the cuckoo by 37 per cent .
In England alone , the cuckoo has declined by 55 per cent in 15 years .
The RSPB / BTO expedition is examining the range of habitats in West Africa to which many of these species annually return .
It will involve researchers monitoring birds along a corridor stretching from Ghana ’s Atlantic coast to northern Burkina Faso , spanning a range of habitats from coastal rainforest to the edge of the Sahara .
“ Although we have a reasonable understanding of these birds in the UK , we have little or no idea what ’s happening to them in their wintering grounds , ” said the RSPB ’s Dr Danaë Sheehan , one of the team .
“ But it ’s clear that without help these declines are likely to continue , reducing the populations of these summer visitors to dangerously low levels . ”
Dr Chris Hewson , research ecologist at the BTO , said : “ If we are to reverse these alarming declines we need to act now .
To do this we need to better understand where these birds spend the winter months and what pressures they face there . ”
A number of potential causes for the decline of migrants have been suggested , including climate change , changes in rainfall patterns , and land degradation .
Predicted increases in human population and climatic variability in West Africa are likely to exacerbate these threats .
Dr Hewson said that current research was focused on the birds during their breeding season in Britain .
“ However , problems on the wintering grounds could also be driving the declines , in particular , the predicted increase in the human population and the associated change of land use , ” he said .
“ These birds are facing a double whammy , and to help them we need to be looking at both ends of their migration . ”
In his article in the New York Times September 24 , " Oil Industry Sets a Brisk Pace of New Discoveries ” , staff reporter Jad Mouawad cites oil discoveries totaling ten billion barrels for the first half of 2009 .
The Tiber field in the Gulf of Mexico alone accounts for four to six billion barrels of crude that may eventually find its way into the world oil system .
Indeed , this year has seen discovery results that could end up being the best since 2000 .
But , the article notes , the new oil was expensive to find , it will be expensive to extract , and both exploration and production are only possible because of high levels of investment and sophisticated , expensive new technologies .
This is a guest post by Richard Heinberg .
Heinberg is Senior Fellow with Post Carbon Institute and author of several books on resource depletion , including The Oil Depletion Protocol and Blackout : Coal , Climate and the Last Energy Crisis .
He will be speaking at the ASPO - USA conference in Denver , October 12 .
To justify the needed level of effort , the oil industry requires prices in excess of $ 60 per barrel , according to Mouawad ; otherwise , the new projects will turn out to be money - losers .
Some analysts believe the magic break - even number is closer to $ 70 .
In any case , the figure is much higher than was required only a few years ago , and still - higher prices may be necessary to make exploration and production profitable for future projects — prices perhaps close to $ 80 .
According to Mouawad , “ While recent years have featured speculation about a coming peak and subsequent decline in oil production , people in the industry say there is still plenty of oil in the ground , especially beneath the ocean floor , even if finding and extracting it is becoming harder . ”
So the new discoveries presumably indicate that peak oil has been delayed , and that our concerns about the event have been misplaced .
Yet this would be a strange conclusion to draw from the facts cited , for two reasons .
First :
The ten billion barrels of new discoveries reported so far do initially sound encouraging : if the second half of 2009 is as productive , that means a total of 20 billion barrels of new oil will eventually be available to consumers as a result of discoveries this year .
But how much oil does the world use annually ?
In recent years , that amount has hovered within the range of 29 - 31 billion barrels .
Therefore ( assuming continued good results throughout 2009 ) , in its most successful recent year of exploration efforts , the oil industry will have found only two - thirds of the amount it extracted from previously discovered oilfields .
When the “ ten billion barrels ” figure is framed this way , its “ gee whiz ” shimmer quickly fades .
( Yes , the article discusses the phenomenon of “ reserve growth , ” which is supposed to render the pace of new discoveries less important — but that red herring has been exposed plenty of times , including here . )
The Times article hints that 2009 ’s high discovery rate may be the beginning of a new trend , so that we may see even better rates in future years ; but remember , that hypothetical outcome hinges on a crucial factor — increasing investment in exploration and production — which leads us to a second critical thought .
The staggering levels of investment that enabled drilling in miles of ocean water , so as to achieve the 2009 finds , were occasioned by historic petroleum price run-ups from 2004 to 2008 — with prices eventually spiking high enough to cripple the auto industry , the airlines , and global trade .
As petroleum prices climbed ever higher , oil companies saw sense in drilling test wells in risky , inhospitable places .
But in recent decades oil price spikes have repeatedly triggered recessions .
And clearly , as we all discovered rather forcibly last year , the global economy cannot sustain an oil price of $ 147 a barrel : as the economy crashed in the latter months of 2008 , so did oil demand and oil prices ( which hit a low in December - January near $ 30 ) .
So , what is a sustainable price ?
A review of recent economic history yields the observation that when petroleum sells above about $ 80 a barrel ( in inflation - adjusted terms ) , the economy begins to stall .
Oil industry wags have begun to speak of a “ Goldilocks ” price range of $ 60 to $ 80 a barrel ( not too high , not too low — just right ! ) as the prerequisite for economic recovery .
If prices are higher , the economy sputters , reducing oil demand and subsequently seriously undermining prices ; if they drift lower , not enough investment will go toward exploration and production , so that oil shortages and price spikes will become inevitable a few years hence ( indeed , since the oil price crash of late 2008 over $ 150 billion of investments in new oil projects have been cancelled ) .
If the market can keep prices reliably within that charmed $ 60 to $ 80 range , all will be well .
Too bad that petroleum prices have grown extremely volatile in recent years : we must hope and pray that trend is over ( though there ’s no apparent reason to assume that it is ) .
Let me summarize : the industry needs oil prices that are both stable and near economy - killing levels in order to justify investments necessary to possibly replace depleting reserves and overcome declining production in existing oilfields ( I say “ possibly ” because we have insufficient evidence as yet to conclusively show that new discoveries enabled by expensive new exploration and production technologies can offset declines in the world ’s aging giant oilfields ) .
Should this picture lead the viewer to come away with reassured thoughts of “ No worries , happy motoring ? ”
Or does this look more like a portrait of peak oil ?
Several commentators ( including analysts with financial services company Raymond James Associates and Macquarie , the Australian - headquartered investment bank ) have concluded from recent petroleum statistics that global oil production peaked in 2008 .
Macquarie is saying that world production capacity is peaking this year , which is a nuanced way of saying the same thing , since currently production is constrained more by depressed demand than by immediate shortfalls in supply ; in effect both organizations assert that the world will never see higher rates of extraction than the so - far record level of July 2008 .
I see nothing in the recent discovery data that should call that conclusion into doubt .
The New York Giants escaped Texas with a 33 - 31 win over the Dallas Cowboys .
In my opinion , one of the most overused phrases in sports is [ insert team name ] escaped with a win .
I mean really during football season you hear it all the time but tonight you have to use that term .
The Giants truly escaped Dallas with a win .
The Giants offense looked like it could be a major player this year , their young wide receivers Mario Manningham and Steve Smith both took Giant steps in their development .
Plaxico Burress and Amani Toomer are replaced by two younger , faster and just as talented individuals .
With them and Brandon Jacobs being led by Eli Manning it could be a long season for opponents .
But only if one thing happens and that is if they learn to score touchdowns .
There were some but not enough considering how many times the team has been in the red zone the last two weeks .
The play calling by Kevin Gilbride in that area has just been atrocious .
The team can move all the way down field with ease and then they hit a wall when they are closing in on the end zone .
This is a major issue that needs to be addressed and I ’m sure a lot of time in practice this week will be dedicated to it .
For how poorly they played tonight inside the 20 , they could of easily turned this game into a 40 + output by just converting .
If they can straighten out the red zone offense and truly turn that area into the green zone it could be a monumental season for that offense .
Regardless its early to panic about the offense ’s ineptitude in that area .
Instead I want to focus on the good .
The Giants are 2 - 0 alone in first place in the NFC East .
The Giants are 2 - 0 within the division .
And if Donovan McNabb misses any more time the Giants could have a stranglehold on this division very soon .
What I really want to focus on is Mario Manningham . 10 catches for 150 yards .
One deflected pass catch on the last drive and more importantly an acrobatic catch in the end zone .
He ’s what stands out the most to me tonight .
Ca n’t wait to see the G - Men against that horrendous Tampa Bay defense next week .
What Resistance 3 Could Learn From Two
That 's how much I liked Insomniac 's alternate history shooter , which saw the England of 1951 besieged by the alien - esque Chimera .
That purchase turned out to be a good call , as I 've played through the campaign a few more times since then .
And when the sequel hit last fall , I bought it without reservation .
Two hours later , all of my excitement had been replaced by frustration , the disc was back in the case and the case was on the shelf -- where it would remain for close to a year .
With the recent sign that Resistance 3 is in the works , I opted to give Resistance 2 another chance .
After wrapping it up this week , it 's safe to say my feelings did n't change much and that I 'm hoping Resistance 3 is closer to the first than the second .
Resistance 2 abandoned much of what I loved about the original .
Where the first Resistance provided players with a cache of creative weapons and the freedom to experiment with them , Resistance 2 took a more guided and much more linear direction which resulted in a restricted experience that simply was n't as gratifying .
Instead of tempting me to be creative with multiple approaches to a given situation , much of Resistance 2 felt like an experiment in trial and error to find that one correct approach .
Worse , numerous areas featured one - hit kills that forced me to replay a section over and over until I had it memorized .
Resistance : Fall of Man
For example , there was one particular area where I had to get close enough to a foe to " lure " them into a trap three times .
If I got too close , it was instant death , meaning that I spent a lot of time trying to do this three times without dying .
How much frustration could have been avoided by replacing one - hit kills with more gradual damage , or removing that section all together , I can't even begin to speculate .
There are plenty of other examples .
Multiple areas feature invisible foes that kill in one hit .
Even better , they appear in groups of twos or threes , meaning I 'd take one down , not notice the second , and then keep replaying until I 'd memorized their positions .
Another area repeatedly forced me to wait while a certain even unfolded and then crushed me to death with falling debris because I zigged when I did n't know to zag .
Another major issue stems from only being able to carry two weapons at once , instead of having an entire cache of weapons available a la the original .
That means I was stuck using only the weapons the designers wanted me to , instead of having the freedom and variety of weapons to come up with my own approach .
And while we 're on the subject of weapons , Resistance 2 falls short there as well .
Part of the fun of the original Resistance was messing around with unconventional weapons -- using the Hailstorm to bounce bullets off a wall and around a corner , setting a trap using the explosive sticky goop of the Sapper , that sort of thing .
Resistance 2
Sure , Resistance 2 brought some of them back , such as the Auger that can shoot through walls and the time - slowing Fareye sniper rifle .
Not everything made the cut though , and their replacements , like the flying saw blades of the Splicer and the HVAP Wraith minigun , do n't really change anything up .
Perhaps most frustrating is that these issues are , at least in hindsight , extremely obvious and could have been avoided with some slight tweaks here and there .
It felt like the developers forgot what made the first Resistance so unique , and rather than build upon that , they tried to make a more conventional experience instead .
So please , Insomniac , if it 's not too late for some constructive criticism , please take these points into consideration with Resistance 3 .
Give me the freedom to experiment with a variety of approaches and weapons .
Give me more creative weapons .
And above all , please , please do n't give me another Resistance 2 .

Today , Sony officially launched the latest salvos in the increasingly intense e-book wars .
Depending on your perspective , this was either a big deal , or a collection of incremental changes : new models , new supported formats , and cheaper e-books , but little that significantly differentiates these products from their predecessors .
Still , the effort reveals that , despite the company 's extensive cost - cutting measures , it 's not giving up on the e-book market .
On the hardware front , Sony will be offering two new reader models by the end of August .
The larger model , the Reader Touch Edition , aka the PRS - 600 , will retail for $ 299 .
This 6.9 x 4.8 inch device will keep the touchscreen of the PRS - 700 , but ditch its backlighting .
The software will apparently be updated , allowing freehand note taking with the included stylus .
It handles both Memory Stick and SD cards for expansion and file transfer .
The Reader Pocket edition ( PRS - 300 ) should fit in a relatively expansive pocket , as it's 6.2 x 4.2 inches .
Part of the reason that it has n't shrunk all that much from its larger sibling is the lack of a touchscreen , which forces Sony to allocate space to basic controls .
Despite the smaller size , it will display the same number of pixels as the Touch Edition .
There 's more news on the software front , where Sony is finally producing a Mac client of its library management software .
In addition to Sony 's DRMed e-book format , the software will handle the EPUB files used by Google 's public domain books , as well as PDF , Word documents , and RTF text files .
That 's more formats than the Kindle , and Sony claims that its PDF capabilities include reflowing documents on the fly ; PDFs on the Kindle are given a one - size - fits - all approach .
Wireless access to the e-book store is still in real - soon - now territory , but Sony is matching Amazon on price for new releases and best sellers , which will all appear at $ 9.99 .
All of this appears to be a nice incremental update , and Sony has provided a few differentiating features that will clearly appeal to audiences with specific needs .
The push to add features and support additional formats — both Sony and Amazon have done these sorts of product releases within a year of their last one — shows that the e-book reader market is extremely competitive , even before the entry of Plastic Logic 's device , planned for early next year .
Even the most significant differentiator , wireless service , should vanish at some point in the future .
The downside of this is that the ability of any manufacturer to produce a truly novel feature , one that clearly sets apart one product from the rest , seems to be limited .
Based on the most recent releases , device makers are focusing on trying to add anything that might provide a leg up on the competition , no matter how minor the feature .
This cutthroat competition is all the more striking because it's not even clear how large the market for dedicated e-book ( and e-newspaper ) readers is .
Barnes & Noble , for example , is betting that readers will simply access books on their other electronic gadgets .
In any case , the new releases show that Sony 's not giving up on the dedicated hardware , and plans on fighting Amazon for a slice of whatever market exists .
The key question , however , may be whether both companies can provide enough compelling features to ensure that an e-reader market flourishes .
There has been talk of Warner Bros. wanting to do a " dark " version of ( simply called " Oz " ) .
Last week there has been mention that Warners might be looking at Todd McFarlane 's " Twisted Land Of Oz " line of action figures as the inspiration for the movie .
The movie will be produced by McFarlane and Basil Iwanyk .
Empire Online recently spoke with McFarlane to try to clear up some of the reports .
There 's no confirmation that the movie will actually begin production next year .
The script is on its second draft ( apparently the first was n't " sexy " enough ) .
The first draft had the story centered around Dorothy 's granddaughter .
McFarlane 's not sure if that element will remain .
Reports have stated that the movie will film in Britain but McFarlane said it really depends on the budget and how much confidence the studio has in the project .
McFarlane had n't heard the rumors of Dakota Fanning as Dorothy .
Looking at her action figure to the left , that does n't look like a good fit .
McFarlane said he'd be happy with " whoever will get the most people in the seats . "
Will it be as " twisted " as his line of figures ?
McFarlane thinks his line might be " a little scary for Warners to embrace .
" Check out the other figures from McFarlane 's Monster Series 2 : Twisted Land Of Oz ) : Toto , and the Wizard ( with Scientist ) ) .
I think a dark version would be pretty cool .
I can't say I 'm crazy about the ' bondage ' version of Dorothy though .
Would making a darker version work or would it be wrong ?
is pretty much known for its sugary wholesomeness .
It has some dark elements but nothing quite like this .
How edgy do you think Warner Bros. will be willing to make this ?
I think we can safely assume it would n't be R-rated .

A team of scientists from Italy and Sweden has developed what is believed to be the first artificial hand that has feeling .
It has been attached to the arm of a 22 - year - old man who lost his own hand through cancer .
Researchers say it works by connecting human nerve endings with tiny electronic sensors .
Duncan Kennedy reports from Tuscany in Italy .
A model and aspiring TV presenter who had sulphuric acid thrown in her face has revealed details of her courageous battle to recover and pioneering surgery to treat her burns .
Katie Piper was left fighting for her life when her jealous boyfriend Daniel Lynch raped her and then arranged for another man to throw the corrosive liquid on her .

The acid burned through all four layers of skin on her face and some spilled down her throat , damaging it so badly that she needs to be fed through a tube into her stomach .
She was left blind in one eye and has undergone more than 30 operations on her face and throat .
Surgeons had to remove the skin from her entire face and use an artificial skin substitute and skin grafts from other parts of her body to rebuild it .
The 26 - year - old 's recovery will feature in a Channel 4 documentary later this month , and she has waived her right to anonymity over the sexual assault .
In the film , she says she was a “ fun person ” before the attack on March 31 last year .
She said : “ I was a fun person .
I had lots of friends .
If I went somewhere and people met me for the first time they would say ‘ Oh , you 're really pretty ’ and I would think ‘ Yeah , I am ’ . ”
In the wake of the attack and only able to communicate by writing , she told her mother Diane “ kill me ” .
She now wears a plastic pressure mask for 23 hours a day to flatten her scars and keep in moisture .
She said : “ I think I 've got the chance to build a life .
“ I do n't it 's going to be that easy , but I wanna try .
I want to move on from my attack , and I do n't want to be a scared little child .
I want to blossom into a confident , able woman . ”
” My dream would be just to live a normal life and after all this be able to meet somebody again and learn to trust a guy and the normal dream : a girl wants to get married and have kids . ”
She has thanked the hospital staff who saved her life and have cared for her since the attack .
“ Coming to terms with the fact that my life as I knew it before the acid attack was over , and that my facial appearance had changed forever , has been incredibly difficult , ” she said .
“ I would n't have been able to rebuild my life without the support of all the staff at Chelsea and Westminster .
“ I want to say thank you to everyone in the Burns Service , in particular my surgeon Mohammad Jawad who has done an amazing job of rebuilding my face - it has exceeded my expectations of what I ever thought would be medically possibly .
I 'm absolutely thrilled . ”
She told the News of the World that she had decided to go public to raise awareness of the plight of burns victims .
Miss Piper said : “ I 've decided to tell my story so that people know what these men did to me .
To help people understand who have ignorance about people that look different , and for people not to be frightened of burns and the stigma attached to it , to understand that it 's still the same person underneath . ”

The prophesies o…
Three years ago this month Jack Straw argued his case for urging Muslim women who attend his MP 's surgery to remove their niqab .
He said that he wanted to start a debate .
In this , at least , he was successful .
The French philosopher Bernard - Henri Lévy said " the veil is an invitation to rape " ; the Daily Mail columnist Allison Pearson said women who wear " nose bags on their faces ... have no place on British streets " ; the then shadow home secretary David Davis argued that Muslims were encouraging voluntary apartheid .
And 16 - year - old Daniel Coine insisted he felt threatened : " I 'd go further than Jack Straw and say they should all take off their veils .
You need to see people face to face .
It 's weird not knowing who it is you 're passing in the street , specially late at night when someone might jump you . "
And so Muslim women passed , in the public imagination , from being actually among the group most likely to be racially attacked to ostensibly being a primary cause of social strife – roaming the land in search of white teenagers to physically harass .
Tomorrow night the conversation that Straw started will follow its logical , lamentable path as he takes his seat alongside the British National party leader , Nick Griffin , on the panel of Question Time .
The issue of whether the BNP should be given this kind of airtime has been debated extensively elsewhere in these pages .
But there is little doubt that once the BNP is on Question Time , Jack Straw – or indeed anyone in the New Labour hierarchy – is in no position to take the fight to it .
The same is true for most of the rest of the British political establishment that will be represented on the panel – they have either actively colluded or passively acquiesced in the political trajectory of the past decade .
But it is no accident that this happened on New Labour 's watch and no small irony that Jack Straw should set himself up as Griffin 's opponent .
Economically , its neoliberal policies have resulted in growing insecurity , rising unemployment , child poverty and inequality that have alienated the poor and made the middle class feel vulnerable .
Politically , its lies over the war , stewardship of the expenses scandal and internal bickering have produced widespread cynicism with our political culture .
The ramifications of its role in the war on terror in general , and Iraq in particular , were to elevate fear of a racialised " other " to a matter of life and death at home .
" Terror is first of all the terror of the next attack , " explains Arjun Appadurai , in Fear of Small Numbers .
" Terror ... opens the possibility that anyone may be a soldier in disguise , a sleeper among us , waiting to strike at the heart of our social slumber . "
Meanwhile New Labour 's race - baiting rhetoric gave the state 's imprimatur to the notion that Britain 's racial problems were not caused by racism but the existence of non-white , non-Christian and non-British people .
This provided little material solace but plenty of vulnerable scapegoats .
Having inflated racism 's political currency , New Labour vacated the electoral market so that others with a more ostentatious style might more freely spend it .
Once they had made these ideas respectable it was only a matter of time before a party reached a position where it too would earn sufficient respectability to appear on prime time .
New Labour marginalised the white working class , assuming they had nowhere else to go , only to find some of them rush into the arms of the far right .
Peter Hain has made an impressive stand over the last few weeks .
But during the last election he slammed those who were abandoning New Labour as " the kind of dinner party critic who quaffs shiraz or chardonnay " .
But it was always the beer talking .
New Labour extinguished all hope of class solidarity and singularly failed to provide principled anti-racist alternatives , leaving a significant section of the white working class to seek cheap refuge in racism and xenophobia .
In their identity they see not the potential for resistance against corruption and injustice , but only a grievance .
They do n't trust government and do n't see any alternatives .
The coming election simply provides the choice between two parties that share the intent to slash public spending , after the gift of billions to bankers .
There has always been more to the BNP than racism and always been more to racism than the BNP , which is merely the most vile electoral expression of our degraded racial discourse and political sclerosis .
Under such circumstances setting Straw – and the rest of the political class – against Griffin is simply putting the cause against the symptom without any suggestion of an antidote .
This has been New Labour 's problem all along .
While they have long recognised that racism is a problem , it never seemed to occur to them that anti-racism might be the solution .
This should not obscure some of the positive things Labour has done – most notably the Macpherson report and the Race Relations Amendment Act .
But in the words of the late African American writer James Baldwin : " What it gave , at length and grudgingly with one hand , it took back with the other . "
The BNP 's victories are a product of our politics .
Its defeat , when it comes , will necessarily be a product of a change in our politics .
But since New Labour 's politics enabled the BNP , it is in no position to disable it .
The BNP is a bottom feeder .
But the system is rotting from the head down .
I think this is good news … but I wonder how it will change some reviews as we know it .
We know alot of reviews are bought with swag and stuff .
Perhaps we will get some better reviews in the future .
PHILADELPHIA —
The Federal Trade Commission will require bloggers to clearly disclose any freebies or payments they get from companies for reviewing their products .
It is the first time since 1980 that the commission has revised its guidelines on endorsements and testimonials , and the first time the rules have covered bloggers .
But the commission stopped short Monday of specifying how bloggers must disclose any conflicts of interest .
The FTC said its commissioners voted 4 - 0 to approve the final guidelines , which had been expected .
Penalties include up to $ 11,000 in fines per violation .
The rules take effect Dec. 1 .

Beheadings and amputations .
Iraqi - style brutality , bribery , extortion , kidnapping , and murder .
More than 7,200 dead — almost double last year ’s tally — in shoot - outs between federales and often better - armed drug cartels .
This is modern Mexico , whose president , Felipe Calderón , has been struggling since 2006 to wrest his country from the grip of four powerful cartels and their estimated 100,000 foot soldiers .
But chillingly , there are signs that one of the worst features of Mexico ’s war on drugs — law enforcement officials on the take from drug lords — is becoming an American problem as well .
Most press accounts focus on the drug- related violence that has migrated north into the United States .
Far less widely reported is the infiltration and corruption of American law enforcement , according to Robert Killebrew , a retired U.S. Army colonel and senior fellow at the Washington - based Center for a New American Security .
“ This is a national security problem that does not yet have a name , ” he wrote last fall in The National Strategy Forum Review .
The drug lords , he tells me , are seeking to “ hollow out our institutions , just as they have in Mexico . ”
Corruption indictments and convictions linked to drug - trafficking organizations , known in police parlance as DTOs , are popping up in FBI press releases with disturbing frequency .
In April , for instance , the U.S. Attorney ’s office in the Southern District of Texas announced that Sergio Lopez Hernandez , a 40 - year - old Customs and Border Protection inspector , had been convicted of drug trafficking , alien smuggling , and bribery .
Hernandez pleaded guilty to accepting over $ 150,000 in bribes and to conspiring to sell cocaine and bring illegal aliens into the country .
Or consider the case of border inspector Margarita Crispin — “ precisely the kind of border corruption case that alarms us , ” says William Abbott , an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI ’s criminal branch in El Paso , Texas .
In 2005 , he says , a federal informant tipped off the Bureau that Crispin was deliberately ignoring traffickers who moved drugs and other contraband through her border post .
Then , in the spring of 2006 , a van that had just gone through Crispin ’s lane sputtered out of gas .
The driver abandoned the vehicle and fled back across the border into Mexico — and when other inspectors opened the van ’s doors , they found nearly 6,000 pounds of marijuana in plain sight .
Crispin could n’t explain why she had n’t noticed the stash when she had examined the vehicle , according to an FBI press release on the case and an official who worked on it .
Another year of surveillance uncovered evidence of Crispin ’s drug - cartel connections .
Though she lived simply in El Paso , she socialized with known drug traffickers in Mexico and had bought two expensive homes and several luxury vehicles there through straw purchasers .
Crispin was then arrested .
After pleading guilty in 2008 to conspiring to import drugs and abusing the public trust , she was sentenced to 20 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $ 5 million in assets she was estimated to have stolen .
Government investigators believe that Crispin had been working for the cartels for at least a year before she applied to become an inspector .
In other words , federal screening failed to detect that , at the time she applied for her job , the cartels had already recruited her to facilitate their cross - border trafficking .
At one point , federal investigators say , Crispin claimed to have wanted out of her arrangement with the cartels .
“ But we think she was kidnapped and forcibly taken back to Mexico to remind her of whom she was working for , ” Abbott says .
Having family in both Juárez and El Paso , cities within sight of each other across the border , Crispin found herself trapped .
Abbott says that the Crispin case is atypical .
But the potential damage , he stresses , is huge .
“ You have the mule : an illegal immigrant who carries five pounds of marijuana in his backpack across the border through the desert .
Compare that with the border inspector who waves through five completely loaded vans , as she did . ”
Experts disagree about how deep this rot runs .
Some try to downplay the phenomenon , dismissing the law enforcement officials who have succumbed to bribes or intimidation from the drug cartels as a few bad apples .
Peter Nuñez , a former U.S. attorney who lectures at the University of San Diego , says he does not believe that there has been a noticeable surge of cartel - related corruption along the border , partly because the FBI , which has been historically less corrupt than its state and local counterparts , has significantly ratcheted up its presence there .
“ It ’s harder to be as corrupt today as locals were in the 1970s , when there was n’t a federal agent around for hundreds of miles , ” he says .
But Jason Ackleson , an associate professor of government at New Mexico State University , disagrees .
“ U.S. Customs and Border Protection is very alert to the problem , ” he tells me .
“ Their internal investigations caseload is going up , and there are other cases that are not being publicized . ”
While corruption is not widespread , “ if you increase the overall number of law enforcement officers as dramatically as we have ” — from 9,000 border agents and inspectors prior to 9/11 to a planned 20,000 by the end of 2009 — “ you increase the possibility of corruption due to the larger number of people exposed to it and tempted by it . ”
Note , too , that Drug Enforcement Agency data suggest that Mexican cartels are operating in at least 230 American cities .
Washington is taking no chances .
In recent months , the FBI ’s Criminal Division has created seven multiagency task forces and assigned 120 agents to investigate public corruption , drug- related and otherwise , in the Southwest border region , says Debbie Weierman of the FBI ’s public - affairs office in Washington .
Meanwhile , Customs and Border Protection , the largest U.S. law enforcement agency , has increased the number of its internal investigators over three years from five to 220 .

And David Shirk , director of the San Diego–based Trans - Border Institute and a political scientist at the University of San Diego , says that recent years have seen an “ alarming ” increase in the number of Department of Homeland Security personnel being investigated for possible corruption .
“ The number of cases filed against DHS agents in recent years is in the hundreds , ” says Shirk .
“ And that , obviously , is a potentially huge problem . ”
An August 2009 investigation by the Associated Press supports his assessment .
Based on records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act , court records , and interviews with sentenced agents , the AP concluded that more than 80 federal , state , and local border - control officials had been convicted of corruption - related crimes since 2007 , soon after President Calderón launched his war on the cartels .
Over the previous ten months , the AP data showed , 20 Customs and Border Protection agents alone had been charged with a corruption - related crime .
If that pace continued , the reporters concluded , “ the organization will set a new record for in - house corruption . ”
While the FBI task forces focus mainly on corruption along the border , cartel - related vice has spread much deeper into the American heartland .
Consider New Mexico ’s San Juan County , some 450 miles north of the border , where the U.S. Attorney ’s office has recently prosecuted a startling corruption case that may be a portent of things to come .
Back in 1994 , Ken Christesen was a detective in the Four Corners , the region where the borders of Colorado , Arizona , Utah , and New Mexico meet .
That was the year that one Miguel Tarango was convicted of murdering a member of a rival drug gang in a territorial dispute .
The conviction made Christesen realize that the Tarango family was “ far more significant than we had initially thought ” in the local drug trade , he tells me over coffee at Donna Kay ’s , a popular café in Bloomfield , New Mexico .
Even in a county where 80 to 90 percent of all serious crimes are linked to drugs — an area where “ you ca n’t swing a dead cat without hitting a drug dealer ” — the Tarangos stood out .
The family was locally based but had ties to Mexico ’s Sinaloa and Juárez cartels , and it had big ideas about controlling the lucrative trade in methamphetamine and other illicit drugs in San Juan County .
The clan ’s rising star was Daniel Tarango , Jr. , a short , slim , American - born hipster with a pencil - thin mustache , a fondness for black T - shirts , and no visible means of support .
After his father and uncle were convicted of heavy - duty meth trafficking , sent to federal prison , and deported , Danny , known to local cops as “ the Runt , ” took charge of the family business .
By 2002 , Christesen had become a lieutenant in the San Juan County sheriff ’s office , where he participated in Operation Farmland , an effort run by a federal , state , and local alliance called the Region II Narcotics Task Force .
The operation , which targeted meth sales in the Four Corners , ended in 2003 with 250 people charged , among them Mike Marshall , a former sheriff ’s deputy sentenced to five years in federal prison for distributing drugs .
Christesen happened to know that Marshall and Danny Tarango had often been seen together .
If Tarango had befriended Marshall , Christesen reasoned , might he also be trying to get inside information from active cops about the task force itself ?
The hero of Operation Farmland was Levi Countryman , then a San Juan County sheriff ’s deputy who had gotten many of the tips and intelligence that led to the massive arrests .
Despite Countryman ’s ostensibly heroic role in Farmland , Christesen was suspicious .
Farmland had n’t fingered a single member of the Tarango clan , despite its growing prominence in the county drug trade .
And despite Farmland ’s apparent success , methamphetamine still flowed freely into Farmington , Bloomfield , Shiprock , Aztec , and other forlorn , trailer - strewn desert towns in the Four Corners .
Christesen concluded that Danny Tarango and Levi Countryman were working together — that “ we made the arrests , Levi became a hero , and Danny got rich by eliminating his competition , ” Christesen recalls .
But he had no proof .
Nevertheless , when he took over the Narcotics Task Force in October 2004 , he quietly put Levi Countryman at the top of his target list .
Christesen ’s suspicions about Countryman had been reinforced in the spring of 2004 , when officers searching one of Danny Tarango ’s many houses found an all - terrain vehicle registered in Countryman ’s name .
What was Countryman ’s ATV doing in the Runt ’s garage ?
Under intense scrutiny , Countryman resigned as deputy sheriff and told friends that he would enter the private sector as a stock trader .
But sensitive task - force information kept leaking out to the Tarangos , much to Christesen ’s frustration .
Every time Christesen got close to persuading someone to talk or testify in a drug - related case , the inquiry would fall apart .
A parade of witnesses who had agreed to testify would suddenly change their minds .
One potential witness in a drug case against Josh Tarango , Danny ’s younger brother , refused to testify in 2006 after her daughter ’s car was burned on her front lawn .
“ Every time we got close to tying Tarango to Countryman , ” Christesen recalls , “ an informant would be burned ” — intimidated , that is .
“ I began to think that our own building was bugged .
I even asked the FBI to do a sweep . ”
Tired of waiting for federal help , “ we finally bought old equipment and did it ourselves . ”
The sweep turned up nothing .
Meanwhile , violence in San Juan County kept escalating , much of it apparently tied to Danny Tarango .
In January 2007 , the FBI finally responded to Christesen ’s repeated appeals and quietly opened an investigation into whether the task force ’s operations were being compromised from within .
Because everyone on the task force was potentially a suspect , the FBI agents told no one in local law enforcement — not even Christesen — precisely what they were doing and whom they were targeting .
But after wiretapping Danny Tarango ’s cell - phone calls , they discovered that information about the task force was still being provided by Countryman .
Christesen ’s suspicions were all too true : Countryman was getting his information from a state police officer named Keith Salazar , one of the unit ’s most trusted , experienced members .
Countryman and Tarango even referred to Salazar by the code name “ Candy ” because the information he provided was so “ sweet . ”
In court , Salazar later argued that he had been forced to betray his fellow officers — that Countryman had threatened , if Salazar refused to cooperate , not only to expose the fact that he had skimmed funds from the task force ’s kitty , but also to harm him and his family .
But the cell - phone conversations that prosecutor Reeve Swainston played in court made a mockery of that claim .
Calling each other several times a day , referring to each other as “ bro , ” joking and swearing like fraternity brothers staging college pranks , Salazar and Countryman were obviously close friends who enjoyed their dirty work .
Salazar eagerly provided Countryman with the names of his fellow officers , even those serving undercover .
He gave Countryman pictures he had taken of them , their home addresses , their birth dates and Social Security numbers , and detailed descriptions of their cars and license - plate numbers .
He also disclosed the identity of confidential informants ; the dates , times , and locations of impending search warrants ; the nature of ongoing antidrug investigations in New Mexico and Colorado ; and other material that Countryman requested .
And he did all this for just $ 1,000 a month from Tarango .
For his part , Countryman was the perfect middleman .
As soon as he got sensitive information from “ Candy , ” he would call Tarango and pass it along .
As a result , Salazar never had to talk to Tarango or meet with him , insulating him from scrutiny .
All three men used cell phones specifically dedicated to their double - dealing , creating what Swainston called in his indictment a “ compartmentalized line of communication . ”
But Countryman was more than a go - between ; he also distributed some of the methamphetamine he received from Tarango , street profits from which supplemented the $ 8,000 a month that Tarango routinely paid him .
Christesen suspected that Tarango had turned other law enforcement officers and local and state officials , and he hoped that the FBI ’s investigation would uncover them .
But the FBI had to cut short its investigation and move against the three men in December 2007 , after agents overheard Tarango and Countryman discussing ways to intimidate and possibly harm a deputy sheriff .
Among the tactics they discussed were following the deputy ’s wife around town , taking photos of her and her children , leaving a photo of her on her car , throwing hypodermic needles on her lawn , delivering a box filled with dying rats to the family ’s home , and leaving a pig ’s head on the front porch .
They agreed that this might send her a message that “ her husband needs to back off , ” a court document states , quoting part of an intercepted conversation between Tarango and Countryman .
Further , the FBI overheard Tarango telling Countryman that he had watched the family ’s home at various hours , and Countryman telling Tarango that this deputy ’s “ ass needed to be whacked . ”
Tarango vetoed the proposal , but the FBI had heard enough .
Arrest warrants for all three men were promptly issued .
But before Tarango could be served , he escaped to Mexico .
When the police arrested Countryman at a Denny ’s restaurant in Farmington , the county seat , they found a handgun in his truck .
In a safe at his home were 13 more firearms , $ 18,000 in cash , and almost eight pounds of marijuana .
In a sentencing memorandum , Countryman said that his heavy drinking had “ clouded ” his judgment and asked to be enrolled in a substance - abuse program .
Countryman and Salazar pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute drugs and were each sentenced to six years in prison .
Their attorneys argued successfully in court for lighter sentences because of their post - arrest cooperation with law enforcement .
And this past June , for reasons that remain murky , Danny Tarango returned from Mexico .
His trial is expected to begin soon .
Christesen , who is now running for sheriff in San Juan County , still fears that Danny Tarango ’s web of corruption may have been far broader than the public has been told .
In the wake of the Countryman and Salazar arrests , the New Mexico state police ’s narcotics division was quietly disbanded and reorganized .
The fact that the state said so little about its actions leads Christesen and others to believe that the conspiracy may have involved other , still - unnamed , corrupt cops , border patrol agents , and public officials .
But “ law enforcement and the communities they serve have been irreversibly damaged ” merely by the information that Salazar and Countryman gave Tarango and his Mexican associates , Christesen wrote in a statement that he gave to prosecutor Swainston .
In his own statement , Swainston asserted that nine separate law enforcement agencies in New Mexico and six in Colorado had been damaged by Salazar ’s betrayal .
“ It is hard to imagine anything more frightening for a law enforcement officer than to find out after the fact that those upon whom you just executed a . . . search warrant knew you were coming because one of your own told them so , ” Swainston wrote in an impassioned 47 - page sentencing memorandum .
“ Cops hate these cases , hate to investigate and prosecute them , because it shows we ’re not perfect , that we ’re vulnerable to corruption like other human beings , ” Christesen says .
“ A Salazar looks bad for all of us .
But how many other counties like ours are there in the Southwest ?
How can we be sure that our law enforcement system is n’t being Mexicanized ?
I ’m worried that they ’ll start with bribes , and end as they have in Mexico , with intimidation and murder . ”
Michael Hayden , director of the Central Intelligence Agency under President George W. Bush , called the prospect of a narco - state in Mexico one of the gravest threats to American national security , second only to al - Qaida and on par with a nuclear - armed Iran .
But the threat to American law enforcement is still often underestimated , say Christesen and other law enforcement officials .
Last year , FBI officials tell me , the Bureau worked on nearly 2,500 public corruption cases and convicted more than 700 dishonest public servants throughout the nation .
Most of them were unrelated to the cartels , and Special Agent Abbott , of the FBI ’s criminal branch in El Paso , says that only 15 to 30 of his region ’s cases so far have involved drug - related corruption among law enforcement officials .
“ But given the damage that can be done by just one corrupt officer or inspector , ” he adds , “ this is an important vulnerability .
We know it . ”

South Korea 's military Internet network was breached for 24 hours by North Korean hackers on March 5 , causing around 2,000 national secrets to leak , according to the November issue of the Monthly Chosun out Sunday .
North Korean cyber warfare unit stole confidential information from the Chemical Accident Response Information System ( CARIS ) set up by the National Institute of Environmental Research ( NIER ) using a password obtained from hacking South Korean Army command .
A NIER official is quoted as saying , " Our system was hacked into on March 5 and we received a call from the National Intelligence Service on March 6 informing us that our Internet link with Army command had been severed . "
The Monthly Chosun exclusive was based on a document prepared by the national security office under the prime minister detailing the secrets that leaked out in the cyber attack .
The NIER official said , " It looks like around 2,000 national secrets have been stolen , including the names of around 700 companies or state - run entities that manufacture toxic chemicals and some 1,350 types of such chemicals . "
The toxic chemicals monitored by CARIS include acetone , alcohol , paint thinner and other organic solvents , sulphuric acid , hydrochloric acid and benzene and heavy metals including lead , mercury and cadmium , all of which can be fatal if they get into the drinking water .
Kim Heung - kwang , a former professor at Pyongyang Computer Technology University , said , " The addresses of the manufacturers listed under CARIS serve as ' coordinates ' for North Korea to set up targets for its KN - O2 short - range missiles and 240 mm rocket launchers aimed at the South . "
The Defense Ministry has claimed its computerized system is an " independent network , " meaning it can be accessed only from within and is impervious to cyber attacks .
But the incident suggests a need for urgent review .
Since 2005 , the Unification Ministry has tapped into a cultural exchange fund to provide North Korea with W432 million ( US $ 1=W1,164 ) to train people in Internet skills .
Of that amount , the Korean Sharing Movement received W349 million , while Hanabiz.com , which has been pursuing joint IT projects with the North , received W83 million .
Hanasoft Academy in Dandong , China also received funding and has trained North Korean IT workers in 3D skills .
In 2008 , the Unification Ministry also gave another W63 million to the Korean Sharing Movement to teach North Koreans software programming skills .
" International treaties such as the Wassenar Arrangement limit exports to terrorism - sponsoring countries of Pentium - level computers , whi ch are capable of being used to develop or manufacture weapons of mass destruction . " said Kim Dong- sung , a lawmaker for the ruling Grand National Party .
" Over the last 10 years , we provided more than 3,000 Pentium - level computers to North Korea and helped train their workers in IT skills .
What we have ended up doing is to train a unit of hackers . "
A Verizon router failure in the northeastern U.S. caused an outage that Internet engineers and Twitter users reported on Friday afternoon .
Verizon is still investigating the problem , but it apparently involved a card in a router in New York City that failed , according to Verizon spokesman John Bonomo .
The problem occurred between about 3:15 p.m. and 3:50 p.m. Eastern time , according to Verizon .
The router was taken offline and traffic seems to have recovered , Bonomo said .
Problems seem to have been concentrated around New York City , though they may have been broader , Bonomo said .
Verizon had no estimate of the number of customers affected .
The problem seems to have affected users of DSL ( digital subscriber line ) , leased lines and Verizon 's FiOS fiber - to - the - premises service , according to comments on the North American Network Operators Group mailing list , as well as on Twitter .
Around 4:30 p.m. Eastern , Verizon Senior Vice President Eric Rabe posted on Verizon 's Twitter feed that the carrier 's engineers were aware of the problem and working on it .
About 15 minutes later , Verizon said a peering router between its network and the Internet for the Northeast , which handled traffic for DSL and FiOS , had failed .
The router has been restarted and is now handling traffic , Verizon said .
Because the router went into a hung state , it appeared to the rest of the network as if it did n't have a problem , Verizon 's Rabe wrote in a blog post later on Friday .
And because the router could n't communicate its failed state , traffic from some customers kept flowing to the router but could n't be processed , so they lost their access , he wrote .
The structure of the Internet and carrier data networks normally prevents such problems through the ability to route traffic around a failure in seconds .
In addition , routers on critical paths are typically deployed in pairs for failover , said Burton Group analyst David Passmore .
" It 's highly unusual that a single router could take down substantial portions of the network , " Passmore said .
Such failures are more often caused by " backhoe " incidents in which a work crew digs in the wrong place and cuts a cable used by several carriers , he said .
Misconfigured routers or network settings , or software bugs that are distributed to multiple routers , can also cause routing problems that do n't get resolved immediately , he said .

Yup .
We tried 39 mustards .
Mayo phobia is understandable .
Ketchup disdain can be justified ( people always have complex relationships with tomatoes ) .
But not liking mustard ?
Oh , come on .
Mustard is just the little somethin ' somethin ' that sandwiches , hot dogs , burgers , salad dressings , and pretzels need .
When people say they do n't like mustard , alarms sound in my head :
This person is not to be trusted .
But even a mustard enthusiast would have trouble stomaching 39 kinds of mustard .
We dolloped , squeezed , scooped , and dunked into jars and tubes of all types of the yellow condiment — sometimes it was n't even yellow .
After visiting four stores and staring at many condiment aisles , freaking out any nearby employees and shoppers , we found mustards to fit into the following categories :
Yellow
Dijon
Deli-Style and Spicy Brown
Honey
Full of Seeds
" Other " ( trust me , they did n't fit anywhere else )
The results , after the jump .
Best Yellow
Plochman 's not only came in the funnest - to - squeeze rotund tube ( with " 25 % MORE FREE !* " ) but it was exactly what every picnic needs .
Not offensively vinegary , it offers that sturdy " yellow " flavor that you want on hot dogs and burgers .
Plus you have to trust a company that 's been around since 1852 — a year before Vincent Van Gogh was born , as the website points out .
Guldens vs. French's
" I grew up eating this , " was the response everyone gave to either Guldens or French 's mustard .
This is the Crest vs. Colgate battle of the mustard world .
It 's tricky to name a winner since you 're just going to piss off the other group , and they 'll insist you 're wrong .
" To me , [ insert one of them here ] is what yellow mustard should taste like .
The other one is too metallic , gross , and / or stupid . "
Sorry to cop out of picking , but this decision was too emotionally strenuous .
Best Organic Yellow
Who knew there was such a competitive market for organic yellow mustards ?
We tried Annie's , Whole Foods 365 , and Eden Foods , but of them all , Annie 's tasted the most like the classic yellow .
It was n't complicated .
So if you decide you need to organic - ify your life , down to the mustard , this wo n't compromise the iconic taste .
Best Deli-Style
Ba-Tampte ( means " tasty " in Yiddish ) is what you want on your pastrami on rye .
" The very essence of mustard , " said one taster .
Great texture , a bit spicy , and there 's a menorah on the label — can you really argue with that ?
If the Jewish delis approve , bring it on .
Plus it was only $ 1.50 for a 16 - ounce barrel .
Best Spicy Brown
There 's not much separating the " Spicy Brown " category from the aforementioned " Deli - Style " ( alright mustard scholars , come out and correct me , I can take it ) but the winner here was Kosciusko .
Made by trusted brand Plochman's , this was one of our favorites overall .
It 's not hot in the sense that it attacks your sinuses , just nudges them , while still having flavor .
The ingredients read : White Distilled Vinegar , # 1 Grade Mustard Seed , Water , Salt and Spices .
( Not sure what # 2 mustard seeds taste like , but the # 1 is doing the trick . )
Best Not -Too - Sweet Honey
If you like your honey mustard more mustard than honey , Gulden 's will make you happy .
Just a smidge spicy with lots of good texture bits , it 's not part of the dessert mustard family .
Best Fancy - Pants Honey
If it comes in a hexagonal - shaped jar and costs $ 5.29 for eight ounces , it 's fancy - pants mustard .
Honeycup is super thick , almost pasty .
It would never work in a squeeze bottle .
Spicy and zippy , it 's more than just brown sugar ( the first ingredient ) and honey ( the fifth ) .
Take a whiff and your nostrils will gently flare .
A little goes a long way .
Most Versatile Honey
Annie 's Naturals would be good on nuggets and sandwiches alike .
Not oozing with sweetness , it 's just an all - around mellow honey mustard .
Most Like Birdseed
If you like to floss after your mustard , you 'll love Maille 's Old Style moutarde .
There 's hardly any filler between all those mustard seeds .
Slightly sweet and super vinegary , the little seeds pop in your mouth .
Good for kicking up a sandwich .
Best Classic Dijon
Grey Poupon , you 've still got it .
You 're still what I want to pull out of my glove compartment when a polished dude in a Rolls - Royce happens to cruise by .
Spicier and more complex - tasting than many other mustards — but still available at any grocery store or Target — this is a mustard that gets your attention .
Maille ( prounounced " my " ) was also a favorite .
Slightly less up - your - nose spicy , it 's creamy and smooth with a more interesting Dijon -y flavor , if that makes any sense .
Bonus : Grey Poupon Mustard Commercial
Super Bonus : Wayne 's World Spoof
Most Sinus - Clearing Mustards
Trader Joe 's Dijon deserves a category all its own .
The " My - Nose - Just - Exploded " category .
Geez , put a warning label on that jar .
It 's like Grey Poupon squared ... multiplied by infinity .
Also spicy , but somehow more acceptable since it comes in a teeny 3.5 - ounce tub : Colman's .
My papa always keeps a jar of this in the cupboard — the same jar since I was small .
You really just need a dab .
He swears it also helps with sore throats and colds .
Mister Mustard ( look for the chef dude on the label and " HOT " in all caps ) might be tougher to find , but is also good .
Least Mustardy Substance
Um .
You are 18 other things before you are mustard .
Made in Vermont , Fox Hollow Farm's Fox Mustard looks like molasses and is equally goopy .
But there 's a great progression of flavors happening here — from sweet to spicy , back to sweet again .
Made with balsamic vinegar and fresh garlic ( and were those curry whiffs ? ) this should never go on a hot dog , but could be nice on ribs or really specific sandwiches .
Most Disappointing Overall
The Whole Foods 365 line is usually solid as far as generic brands go ( they won our last olive oil taste test ) , but yikes .
The dijon tasted like metal .
The yellow went way overboard on apple cider vinegar .
And did a bee ever go near the honey mustard ?
Mustard with the Biggest Cult Following
When we asked for mustard suggestions , the love for Oregon - based Beaver brand came pouring in .
" Unbelievable stuff ! " ... " I 'd just squeeze out a little bit on my finger and eat it raw " ... " The favorite in our house . "
More commonly known for dams and buck teeth , the beaver is apparently a successful mustard mascot in the Pacific Northwest .
You can find Beaver brand mustard all over the West Coast , and according to Beaver Mustard HQ , parts of Chicago , Texas , Florida , and South Carolina too — but beyond that , not so much .
" Beaver has always been easier to find on the West Coast and Inglehoffer on the East , " said representative Roger Klingsporn on the phone .
Inglehoffer is made by the same Beaverton Foods company ( replace dam - building rodent with a mustachioed man ) and exactly the same recipe for some flavors , including Sweet Hot and Cream Horseradish .
Beaver mustards are so delicious , they even inspire passive aggressive notes like this one , which had one person so upset , they even used the verb " absconded . "
Mustard Doodles
Per taste test tradition , Robyn supplied the artwork .
When exposed to mass quantities of things , her hand can not be controlled .

Left 4 Dead 2's New Multiplayer Mode Revealed
Dubbed " Scavenge , " the mode essentially combines Left 4 Dead 's Versus and Survival modes .
One team , the survivors , is tasked with retrieving scattered gas canisters and using them to fill up generators .
As in Versus , the other team takes control of " special infected " and attempts to stop the survivors alongside legions of regular zombies .
A total of 16 gas cans appear every round -- the goal is to use as many of those cans as possible within the time limit .
Each round kicks off with a ticking 120 second timer , and every gas can used adds another 20 seconds to the clock .
As the canisters are a limited commodity , survivors have to be careful that they do n't shoot them or otherwise cause them to explode .
And they 'll also have to watch out for the other team too , as enemies can detonate the canisters at points .
One match is comprised of three rounds , with each team getting a shot at the Survivor side in an attempt to collect the most gas cans .
The team that wins two out of three rounds triumphs overall .
If there is a tie in the number of gas cans used in a particular round , the side with the lowest recorded time gets the tally .
Six " Scavenge " maps will be including with Left 4 Dead 2 when it comes to PC and Xbox 360 on November 17 , alongside the game 's other co-op and competitive modes .
By John Ross , Mexico City
September 27 , 2009 -- Rag Blog --
Seven mornings a week , Vicente Ramirez 's battered aluminium kiosk on Cinco de Mayo Street in this city 's old quarter is plastered with the front pages of 22 daily newspapers .
All day handfuls of pedestrians pause to gawk at the incendiary headlines slapped to the siding , often engaging in animated debate about the nature of the news .
" This country is going down the toilet " , sneers one elderly gentleman studying a story about a particularly cruel kidnapping .
" Ay Mamacita " , another old gaffer exclaims , ogling a bare - breasted senorita .
Fully a quarter of the score of dailies on view at Vicente 's kiosk are dedicated to the " nota roja " or " red note " .
Tabloids like La Prensa ( reputedly Mexico's biggest seller but circulation figures are elusive ) and Impacto are all blood and tits , spotlighting brutal beheadings , sensational crimes of passion and bevies of topless lasses .
Three sports dailies including the venerable Esto , which still publishes in sepia , rivet the ad hoc attentions of passerbys .
Two financial papers ( El Financiero and El Economista ) , The News ( a re-incarnation of the long - lived English - language paper ) and El Pais , or at least the Mexican edition of the prestigious Madrid daily , dangle from Vicente 's stand .
Noon - time and evening editions of Mexico City papers will join the display during the day .
Editorial slants run from hard right to soft left -- Cronica , reputedly financed by the reviled ex-president Carlos Salinas , savagely slams the left - centre Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) that has managed the affairs of the capital for the past 12 years .
Many of the dailies hung from Vicente 's kiosk exist only to cadge juicy government advertising and are hesitant to bite the hand that feeds them .
Excelsior and El Universal , broadsheets founded in the midst of the Mexican Revolution not quite a hundred years ago , make much of their " impartiality " but are intractably linked to the once and future ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) .
Reforma and its tabloid sidekick Metro are sounding boards for the right - wing National Action Party ( PAN ) of which President Felipe Calderon is king -- both are unavailable at Vicente 's kiosk , having broken with the powerful Newspaper Venders Union , and they now field an army of comically uniformed street hawkers .
The only openly left - wing daily in this vast array , La Jornada ( The Work Day ) , is Vicente 's best seller at 20 a day , followed by La Prensa ( 15 ) and Universal ( 10 . )
When leftists gather in the nearby Zocalo Plaza , usually for events captained by ex-Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador ( AMLO ) , Vicente will sell up to 100 Jornadas .
One caveat : despite this monumental exhibition of newsprint and dead trees , the first news source for 95 % of all Mexicans is still the nation 's two - headed TV monopoly , Televisa and TV Azteca .
September has been a big month for La Jornada .
To celebrate its 25th birthday , the National Lottery offered a commemorative ticket as did the Mexico City Metro subway system , rare mainstream honours for a lefty rag , and notorious US rabble rouser Noam Chomsky came to town to help cut the cake -- along with Gabriel Garcia Marquez ( a founding investor ) and the much - lauded Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano , Chomsky is one of several literary superstars whose words fill the pages of La Jornada .
Origins
The Jornada was founded in 1984 by itinerant journalists who had bounced from one short - lived left periodical to the next -- for many of the original Jornaleros , like La Jornada 's first editor Miguel Angel Granados Chapa , the last ports of call had been Uno Mas Uno ( One Plus One ) and El Dia , but when their publishers were bought off by then - president Miguel De la Madrid , the lefty newshounds trundled their old Underwoods ( computers were nowhere on the horizon back then ) up the winding stairs of La Jornada 's old ramshackle headquarters on Balderas Street 's newspaper row and went to work .
Nostalgia was on the menu for La Jornada 's 25th .
During one celebration under chandeliers at the elegant Casa Lamm , where the paper presents weekly forums on burning social issues , founding director Carlos Payan recalled how in February 1984 he summoned movers and shakers from a broad spectrum of the Mexican left to the phantasmagoric Hotel Mexico , the unfinished dream of Spanish visionary Manuel Suarez with a revolving rooftop restaurant ( it has since been converted into Mexico 's World Trade Center . )
Eight - hundred potential investors showed up at the assembly , buying in at a 1000 pesos a share -- one of those on hand was Carlos Slim , now the third - richest tycoon on the planet but then still a two - bit corporate cannibal who shared Payan 's Lebanese ancestry .
Two of Mexico 's most illustrious painters , Rufino Tamayo and Francisco Toledo , donated priceless works that became La Jornada 's principal capital .
Payan 's words to those gathered in the Insurgentes Avenue ballroom that night ring just as true today as they did back then : " In this hour of crisis , we convoke a new labour of critical journalism in solidarity with those who struggle for the causes of this country . "
The first issue of La Jornada rolled off borrowed presses September 19 , 1984 , to the universal disdain of Mexico 's ruling class which then maintained a hammerlock on the press , doling out government advertising and even newsprint to newspapers based on their allegiances to the PRI and the government it commanded .
The barons of the press gave the left - wing daily a few short months of life at best .
Turbulent times
La Jornada was indeed born into turbulent times -- always a propitious moment for independent journalism .
Mexico had just gone belly up , forced into default of US $ 100,000,000,000 in short - term foreign bank loans by plunging oil prices , and the crisis kicked the legs out from under outgoing president Jose Lopez Portillo and his hand - picked successor De la Madrid .
Wars fomented by US proxies were raging in neighbouring Central America -- two of the paper 's veteran reporters Carmen Lira ( now Payan 's replacement as director ) and Blanche Petrich ( winner of the National Journalism Award ) made their bones in El Salvador and Nicaragua .
On the first anniversary of La Jornada 's birth , Mexico City was savaged by an 8.1 - grade earthquake that took up to 30,000 lives and when the damnificados ( survivors ) built a social movement that triggered the resurgence of Mexican civil society , La Jornada became its voice .
The left daily 's history is built on such dramatic moments .
During and after the stealing of the 1988 presidential election from leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas by the evil Salinas and the PRI , La Jornada stood on the front lines , exposing the fraud that included everything from tens of thousands of burnt ballots to crashing computers , and the paper accompanied Cardenas when he consolidated the PRD in 1989 -- the Jornada is often accused of being the left - centre party 's mouthpiece .
In the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union , also in 1989 , La Jornada played a critical role in the debate about the future of the Mexican left and the left press .
The Zapatista rebellion in Chiapas that exploded on January 1 , 1994 , further burnished La Jornada 's bonafides and sold tonnes of papers for Vicente Ramirez .
Petrich rode into the jungle on horseback and got the first interview with Subcomandante Marcos and Hermann Bellinghausen , another National Journalism Award winner ( he turned it down ) has reported daily from that conflict zone ever since .
As the 1990s ebbed into the new millennium , La Jornada closely covered the collapse of the PRI and the installation of the rightist PAN in Los Pinos , the Mexican White House .
The paper 's platoon of mordant , militant political cartoonists continue to relentlessly lampoon and skewer the political class .
For the 12 years that the PRD has administered the affairs of this monstrous megalopolis , La Jornada has provided critical support and has , in fact , played a key role in the democratisation of the most contaminated , crime - ridden , corrupt and chaotic city in the western hemisphere .
The left daily 's reportage of the heist of the 2006 presidenciales by Felipe Calderon from Lopez Obrador -- who still enjoys the blessings of the Jornaleros -- became Vicente Ramirez 's bread and butter .
" I sold a chingo ( a fucking lot ) .
They flew out of here like balas ( bullets ) . "
Despised by the right
Giving this bold trajectory and because La Jornada has never been " a yes man for the corrupt governments of the PAN and the PRI " ( Lira ) , the paper is despised by right wingers and establishment intellectuals .
Historian Enrique Krauze 's vitriol at La Jornada is splattered all over the glossy pages of his Letras Libres .
Writing in Krauze 's rightist monthly , poet - philosopher Gabriel Zaid bemoans the influence that La Jornada has accumulated over the years : " How can La Jornada have so much weight when important decisions are taken in this country ? " , he complains , blaming the paper 's " opportunistic " use of culture .
" La Jornada brings together left intellectuals who define what they think is political correct . "
Every morning , La Jornada 's letters to the editor column is packed with bristling epistles from government flunkies assailing La Jornada reporters for exposing the shenanigans of the bureaucracy .
When the left paper reports on the dirty dealings of provincial governors and their abuses of authority , the governors are apt to send agents into the street to confiscate every Jornada in the state .
State and federal governments threaten the withdrawal of paid publicity but La Jornada 's clout has often nullified the denial of this lifeblood of the Mexican newspaper industry .
For its 25th anniversary edition , mortal foes of La Jornada like the state of Oaxaca 's tyrannical governor Ulises Ruiz , the Falangist state government of Guanajuato and the Zapatista - hating mayor of San Cristobal de las Casas were all obligated to take out paid birthday greetings .
While the corporate newspaper industry appears to be gasping its last in the United States , where no comparable left daily has ever survived for longer than two years ( PM in New York City in the late 1940s ) , Jornada runs in the black .
Although La Jornada is published in Mexico City , the hub of a highly centralised nation from which all power emanates , the Jornaleros have mothered affiliated dailies in eight Mexican states and the national edition is distributed from Tijuana to Tapachula on the southern border , where eager readers snatch up the paper the moment it hits the stands .
In addition to the print edition , La Jornada On Line receives thousands of visits each day and has attracted a lively community of bloggers .
Despite its long reach into the provinces , La Jornada is anything but provincial .
Its correspondents prowl New York and Moscow and Havana , Bolivia and Chile and Argentina .
The newspaper 's perspective is firmly grounded in the global South but Robert Fisk and Patrick Cockburn share their London Independent dispatches from Middle East hotspots .
This correspondent reported on the first days of Bush 's illegal invasion of Iraq from Baghdad .
Similarly , David Brooks covered the 9/11 terror attacks on New York and Washington from ground zero .
Luis Hernandez Navarro never misses an international anti-globalisation mobilisation or World Social Forum .
Cronista ( chronicler ) Arturo Cano hangs out with Mel Zelaya in Tegucigalpa .
Makes news
La Jornada does not only print the news , it makes it , actively espousing social causes and decrying injustice daily on its pages .
In fact , the resistance of marginated communities from Chiapas to Pais Vasco would be little noted if the news had not first run in La Jornada .
Crucial to this insemination of resistance in Mexico are daily notices of meetings and forums and rallies and marches that act as a mighty force multiplier for left movements , turning handfuls into multitudes .
La Jornada , whose strong suit is reporting on social movements , has itself become a social movement .
Although politics are its main course , La Jornada publishes monthly supplements on agriculture , the environment , labour issues , Indigenous cultures , women 's struggles and gay and lesbian rights .
The weekly cultural insert and daily reports on painting , dance , literature , music and popular entertainment have deep scratch among cultural workers .
The Jornada even once published a weekly magazine in English , a losing commercial venture that was eventually killed by Lira .
" We are not going to spend the benefits of our workers " by continuing to publish a magazine " in the language of the oppressors " , Carmen explained to this writer at the time .
Jornada workers have built a strong in - house union .
La Jornada also operates a book publishing arm with dozens of titles authored by its own reporters like Bellinghausen 's account of the massacre at Acteal , A Crime of State .
Translations of Noam Chomsky 's multiple works are hot sellers .
Despite hard - wired anti-gringo sentiments , La Jornada invited the renowned gavacho gadfly to crown its 25th birthday celebration with a magnum lecture at the National University ( UNAM ) .
Noam Chomsky is hardly the only US lefty to adorn La Jornada 's op - ed columns -- Howard Zinn , Immanuel Wallerstein , James Petras and Amy Goodman are regular collaborators .
Noam Chomsky
In introducing his September 21 lecture at the UNAM , the oldest and most prestigious in the Americas , Carmen Lira posited that Chomsky 's analysis of mass media in writings like Manufacturing Consent and the ethical guidance of the late Polish journalist Ryzsward Kupascinski ( " bad people cannot become good reporters " ) were the cornerstones of La Jornada 's credo .
Chomsky 's near two - hour talk to a jam - packed auditorium named for the poet - king Nezahualcoytl ( every seat in the house was claimed within 30 minutes of the announcement of the lecture ) lasered in on Washington 's fading domination of a uni-polar world .
Noam ranged far afield : how Barack Obama , the darling of Wall Street , was sold to the North American electorate " like toothpaste or a wonder drug " ; the British Empire as the " first international narco - trafficker " ( the Opium War ) ; the strategic perils of US bases in Colombia for the global South .
The 82 - year - old MIT linguistics pioneer 's discourses are often better read on the printed page than pronounced out loud and Chomsky 's low - key , nebbishy persona left some attendees dozing despite the dazzling blizzard of data he offered .
Focusing on Washington 's crimes around the globe , the talk often approached the world on an west - east power bias rather than South to North , mentioning NATO more than NAFTA with no reference to new Latin left leaders like Hugo Chavez with whom Chomsky had just huddled .
The perennial icon of the US left also avoided much mention of contemporary Mexican politics , perhaps with an eye out for Constitutional Article 33 that gives the Mexican president carte blanche to kick out any " inconvenient " foreigner .
Still , the old gringo's condemnation of free trade , the war on drugs and neoliberal economics must have made Felipe Calderon ( whose name was never dropped ) uncomfortable .
Despite the length of the talk , Chomsky was only twice interrupted with applause -- once when he advanced that like the US , Mexico was not a " failed state " for the oligarchy , but for millions of the poor who have lost all social protections , the state has , in fact , failed .
When Noam Chomsky counseled that the best cure for neoliberal excess was to confront the rulers with mass mobilisations , the audience again broke into cheers .
As the very professorial Noam Chomsky stepped from the podium he was greeted by Trinidad Ramirez , wife of the imprisoned Ignacio del Valle , leader of the Popular Front for the Defense of the Land , who tied a red kerchief around his neck and presented him with the emblematic machete of the farmers of San Salvador Atenco , who count 13 political prisoners among their ranks .
After 25 years and upwards of 9000 editions , La Jornada has forcefully disproved one of Noam Chomsky 's pet theses : that an independent media cannot survive in a corporate - dominated press .
" You 've proven me wrong " , the old professor sheepishly confessed during a visit to the paper 's spartan headquarters in the south of the city .
" Nine thousand editions !
You 've got be kidding ! " .
Vicente Ramirez marveled in his cramped little newspaper kiosk , whipping out his pocket computer .
" Lets see -- 9000 editions at 10 pesos a piece times 20 .
That 's 1,800,000 pesos !
Happy birthday !
La Jornada has been very good to me . "

I need to update Modern : : Perl .
I waited until the release of Perl 5.10.1 .
I 'm going to add autodie as a dependency ( but not enable it ; that 's for you to decide to use ) .
I 'm also going to load IO : : Handle , per Yuval 's suggestion in Are Filehandles Objects ?.
Note that perl5i does this .
These are all simple and obvious changes .
I 've blocked on a larger change , related to a simple philosophical user interface question for the module :
What happens when what 's " modern " changes ?
Adding an installation requirement and loading two new modules wo n't hurt anything .
It wo n't change any existing code .
There are no compatibility concerns .
Future changes might have compatibility concerns .
If you use Modern : : Perl ; by itself , you 're taking a slight risk that you may have to revisit existing code after an upgrade .

EVERYONE knows that the dinosaurs were exterminated when an asteroid hit what is now Mexico about 65 m years ago .
The crater is there .
It is 180 km ( 110 miles ) in diameter .
It was formed in a 100 m - megatonne explosion by an object about 10 km across .
The ejecta from the impact are found all over the world .
The potassium - argon radioactive dating method shows the crater was created within a gnat 's whisker of the extinction .
Calculations suggest that the “ nuclear winter ” from the impact would have lasted years .
Plants would have stopped photosynthesising .
Animals would have starved to death .
Case closed .
Well , it now seems possible that everyone was wrong .
The Chicxulub crater , as it is known , may have been a mere aperitif .
According to Sankar Chatterjee of Texas Tech University , the main course was served later .
Dr Chatterjee has found a bigger crater — much bigger — in India .
His is 500 km across .
The explosion that caused it may have been 100 times the size of the one that created Chicxulub .
He calls it Shiva , after the Indian deity of destruction .
Dr Chatterjee presented his latest findings on Shiva to the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America in Portland , Oregon , on October 18th .
He makes a compelling case , identifying an underwater mountain called Bombay High , off the coast of Mumbai , that formed right at the time of the dinosaur extinction .
This mountain measures five kilometres from sea bed to peak , and is surrounded by Shiva 's crater rim .
Dr Chatterjee 's analysis shows that it formed from a sudden upwelling of magma that destroyed the Earth 's crust in the area and pushed the mountain upwards in a hurry .
He argues that no force other than the rebound from an impact could have produced this kind of vertical uplift so quickly .
And the blow that caused it would surely have been powerful enough to smash ecosystems around the world .
Double whammy
In truth , agreement on the cause of the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous ( when not only the dinosaurs , but also a host of other species died ) has never been as cut and dried among palaeontologists as it may have appeared to the public .
One confounding factor is that the late Cretaceous was also a period of great volcanic activity .
In India , which was then an island continent like Australia is today ( it did not collide with Asia until 50 m years ago ) , huge eruptions created fields of basalt called the Deccan Traps .
Before the discovery of Chicxulub , the climate - changing effects of these eruptions had been put forward as an explanation for the death of the dinosaurs .
After its discovery , some argued that even if the eruptions did not cause the extinction , they weakened the biosphere and made it particularly vulnerable to the Chicxulub hammer - blow .
There are also puzzling anomalies in the pattern of extinction .
The greatest of these is that , as fiery and horrible as the impact would have been , the survivors included many seemingly sensitive animals like birds , frogs and turtles .
Moreover , close inspection of the fossil record shows that many “ Cretaceous ” species disappear both well before , and well after , the signs of the impact that are found in the rocks .
Ironically , it was while he was investigating the Deccan Traps that Dr Chatterjee came across the evidence for Shiva .
First , he found dinosaur nests that had been built between lava flows 10 - 15 metres thick — evidence that the animals were coping well with the volcanic activity rather than being weakened by it .
Then , quite suddenly , 65 m years ago , a layer of lava nearly 2 km thick appears .
This led him to wonder what could possibly have caused such a sudden volcanic surge .
He knew that the west coast of India had been the site of an ancient impact of unknown age and size .
It was not until he was reading through a paper published by an oil company that had collected geological information in the area that he realised the volcanic surge he had seen might be related to a cosmic collision .
Further examination revealed a crater rich in shocked quartz and iridium , minerals that are commonly found at impact sites .
( These are also the telltales in distant layers of ejecta that the rock in question has come from an impact . )
Most important , the rocks above and below Shiva date it to 65 m years ago .
Dr Chatterjee therefore suggests that an object 40 km in diameter hit the Earth off the coast of India and forced vast quantities of lava out of the Deccan Traps .
As well as killing the dinosaurs the impact was , he proposes , responsible for breaking the Seychelles away from India .
These islands and their surrounding seabed have long looked anomalous .
They are made of continental rather than oceanic rock , and seem to be a small part of the jigsaw puzzle of continental drift rather than genuine oceanic islands .
This story , though , raises the question of why there is but a single ejecta layer of iridium and shocked quartz in late Cretaceous rocks around the world .
One answer might be that the two impacts were , in effect , simultaneous — that the objects which created Shiva and Chicxulub were the daughters of a comet that had broken up in space and hit the Earth a few hours apart , as the pieces of comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 hit Jupiter in 1994 .
Other , smaller craters in the North Sea and Ukraine have been prayed in aid of this theory .
Recent research suggests that there was , in fact , no impact in the North Sea at all , but the Ukrainian site does appear to be the result of a genuine collision that took place at the time of the dinosaur extinction and could therefore be connected with Shiva .
But even if it is , it is so much smaller that its environmental effect would have been both minor and local .
Extensive dating research at Chicxulub , however , now suggests that the object which created that crater actually struck 300,000 years earlier than the dinosaur extinction , meaning there really should be two ejecta layers .
That there are not could be explained by the fact that the accumulation of sediment in most rocks is so slow that the two layers are , in effect , superimposed .
Alternatively , it could be that no one has been looking for two layers , so they have not seen the double signature or have ignored its significance .
Indeed , two iridium layers have been found in some places .
Anjar , an Indian town north of the impact site , is one .
That is leading Dr Chatterjee to suggest that the two big impacts did take place at different times .
The picture that is emerging , then , is of a strange set of coincidences .
First , two of the biggest impacts in history happened within 300,000 years of each other — a geological eyeblink .
Second , they coincided with one of the largest periods of vulcanicity in the past billion years .
Third , one of them just happened to strike where these volcanoes were active .
Or , to put it another way , what really killed the dinosaurs was a string of the most atrocious bad luck .
Have Fewer Children
Overpopulation is becoming a larger problem each and every year .
The world population increased one - hundred percent in only forty years .
The population grew from three billion in 1959 to six billion in 1999 .
Population projections have estimated a world population of nine billion by 2040 .
Overpopulation can lead to great demands on natural resources such as land , water , and fossil fuels .
Somehow we are going to have to find a way to produce much for food without exhausting the land and find many new sources for energy .
Limit Your Water Use and Help Keep It Clean
Freshwater is such an essential necessity to life .
Without it society would crumble .
It is important that we manage our water usage and be responsible .
We need to make sure there is enough freshwater for our homes and crops .
Also , it is important that we keep our water clean .
One - third of the world ’s people lack access to clean drinking water .
This makes it easy to believe that 80 percent of all illnesses in developing countries can be linked to unsanitary water .
According to the United Nations , 95 percent of cities worldwide still dump raw sewage into their water supplies .
Pay Attention to What You Eat
You should always try to eat locally grown food because it supports your area ’s economy and reduces the amount of fuel and greenhouse emissions required to transport the goods from farther areas to your area .
Eating organic food reduces the amounts of pesticides you consume and the amounts that make their way into water sources through run off .
Also , you can help save the environment by eating less meat and animal products .
Livestock requires much more land and water than food crops .
In fact , it is estimated that you could save about 280 gallons of water and 12 to 50 square feet of land from deforestation and overgrazing by eating a plant - based meal over an animal - based meal .
Limit Your Energy Use and Think of Renewable Sources
There are many other ways of transportation besides driving your car .
Walking , bike riding , and public transportation are great ways to preserve energy resources as well as save money .
The American Public Transportation Association estimates that families can save an average of $ 6,200 a year by using public transportation .
Also , use alternative energy whenever possible .
Many utilities offer green energy alternatives by allowing you to acquire your energy from solar , wind or other alternative energy methods .
Reduce Your Carbon Footprint
Humans contribute to greenhouse gas emissions through many activities such as using coal - fired power plants and driving gasoline - powered vehicles .
Greenhouse gas emissions continue to contribute global climate change which can have serious effects on our planet such as more severe droughts and hurricanes .
Lowering our carbon footprint will allow for a more stable environment while avoiding the dangers of global climate change .
Certain websites have carbon footprint calculators where you can measure and reduce your personal carbon footprint .

An alert reader called my attention to two blog posts by Josh Rosenau and Chris Mooney / Sheril Kirshenbaum , both claiming that Richard Dawkins explicitly voiced accommodationist views in a Newsweek interview .
“ He ’s changed ! ” they say .
Well , I know Richard Dawkins .
I am at a meeting with Richard Dawkins .
I just discussed these accusations of accommodationism with Richard Dawkins .
And I can tell you , Chris , Sheril , and Josh , that Richard is not one of you .
Right now I feel like Woody Allen in Annie Hall .
If you ’ve seen the movie , you ’ll remember that in one scene Allen standing in line with Diane Keaton , waiting to see a movie , and becomes annoyed by some pompous guy trying to impress his date by nattering on about the work of Marshall McLuhan .
Allen goes behind a movie sign and pulls out McLuhan himself , taking him over to confront Mr. Pomposity .
McLuhan coldly eyes him and says , “ Excuse me , but I am Marshall McLuhan , and I could n’t help overhearing what you said .
I have to tell you that you know nothing of my work ! ”
Allen turns to the camera and quips , “ Do n’t you wish life could be like this ? ”
Well , I have a Woody moment now .
Nobody who has followed Dawkins ’s work and writing could possibly think he ’s an accommodationist .
Since I ’m here with Richard at at the Conclave of the Godless , I simply emailed him the links to Rosenau and Mooney - and - Kirshenbaum ’s websites .
Here is Richard ’s email response to the claims that he ’s an accommodationist ; it ’s posted here with his permission , and was verified in person :
How utterly ridiculous .
All I was saying is that it is possible for a human mind to accommodate both evolution and religion because F. Collins ’s mind seems to manage the feat ( along with lots of vicars and bishops and rabbis ) .
I also needed to make the point that TGSOE [ The Greatest Show on Earth ] is not the same book as TGD [ The God Delusion ] because many interviewers who are supposed to be interviewing me about TGSOE have simply ignored it and gone right back to assuming that it is the same book as TGD .
I sympathize with politicians who have to watch every syllable they utter for fear it will be misused by somebody with an agenda .
So there ”s your answer , Josh , Sheril , and Chris .
I wish you were n’t so keen to validate your own ideas that you need to distort the views of others in a desperate ploy to show that they agree with your accommodationism .
Really , you ’ve read The God Delusion and , presumably , Dawkins ’s other writings .
Anybody with two neurons to rub together should know that the man is not an accommodationist .
Now that Dawkins has verified this , it would be nice to see Rosenau , Mooney , and Kirshenbaum correct their postings .
And they need to stop pretending that the existence of religious scientists and religious people who accept evolution proves that science and faith are compatible .
We settled that issue long ago .
The issue is philosophical compatibility .
Is that really so hard for anyone to understand ?
Chicken at a market .
After years spent hunting for the buried remains of prehistoric animals , a Canadian paleontologist now plans to manipulate chicken embryos to show he can create a dinosaur .
After years spent hunting for the buried remains of prehistoric animals , a Canadian paleontologist now plans to manipulate chicken embryos to show he can create a dinosaur .
Hans Larsson , the Canada Research Chair in Macro Evolution at Montreal 's McGill University , said he aims to develop dinosaur traits that disappeared millions of years ago in birds .
Larsson believes by flipping certain genetic levers during a chicken embryo's development , he can reproduce the dinosaur anatomy , he told AFP in an interview .
Though still in its infancy , the research could eventually lead to hatching live prehistoric animals , but Larsson said there are no plans for that now , for ethical and practical reasons -- a dinosaur hatchery is " too large an enterprise . "
" It 's a demonstration of evolution , " said Larsson , who has studied bird evolution for the last 10 years .
" If I can demonstrate clearly that the potential for dinosaur anatomical development exists in birds , then it again proves that birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs . "
The research is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada , the Canada Research Chairs program and National Geographic .
The idea for the project , Larsson said , came about during discussions with renowned American paleontologist Jack Horner , who served as technical advisor for the Jurassic Park films .
Horner recently wrote a book entitled " How to Build A Dinosaur , " in which he refers to the embryo experiment as part of a quest to create a " chickenosaurus . "
Larsson 's team has previously worked to uncover prehistoric animal remains , including eight unknown species of dinosaurs and five new types of crocodile in Niger .
He also recently uncovered the remains of a new carnivorous dinosaur in Argentina .

US Forester Stacy Clark ( UTK '96 and ' 97 ) collects data on a test planting of first - generation blight - resistant American chestnuts .
This spring Clark has planted chestnuts in three National Forests .

The American chestnut was a dominant species in eastern U.S. 's forests before a blight wiped it out in the early 1900s .
Today it 's being returned to the landscape thanks in part to work by a University of Tennessee Forestry alumna and the UT Tree Improvement Program ( UT TIP ) .
Once used extensively for building , for tanning leather , as an important source of food for humans and wildlife , and even as nutritious fodder for hogs , the American chestnut seemed destined to be a memory — a line in a Christmas song .
In a few years , the public should be able to once again enjoy the benefits of the forest giant .
UT alumna Stacy Clark , lead researcher with the U.S. Forest Service restoration project , believes the chestnut 's revival will become one of the great stories of American conservation .
Her work in cooperation with The American Chestnut Foundation ( TACF ) and the UT TIP has resulted in test plantings of blight - resistant trees in three southern National Forests .
Planted over the winter , the young trees are 94 percent pure American chestnuts .
But the remaining 6 percent has blight resistance derived from the Chinese chestnut tree .
Simply planting a Chinese chestnut would n't solve the problem , Clark said .
" The American chestnut grows straight and tall , is highly valuable , and has highly flavored edible nuts , " she said .
" All that differs from the Chinese .
We want the trees to look and act like an American chestnut .
But they have to have the resistance genes from Chinese chestnut .
That 's the only way they 're going to survive . "
The young trees appear healthy and are growing well , but results from tree experiments come slowly , even for a fast - growth tree like the chestnut .
" We 'll know in about five years whether or not the trees will be successful in early establishment , " she said .
" In 10 to 15 years we will know about blight resistance .
It takes 10 to 15 years to get significant mast and another 15 years to get harvestable wood . "
Making the resistant tree available to the public will take longer still .
" These plantings are not the final answer .
We need several more experiments to really test the Foundation 's breeding lines and blight resistance . "
TACF , which provided the hybrid stock , has produced multiple lines of blight - resistant seedlings .
In 2010 , partners will plant an additional 900 to 1,000 seedlings of the American chestnut in national forests in Tennessee and Virginia .
Plantings will include all generations of the American chestnut — approximately 700 will be blight - resistant .
" We really want to test which are the best families .
All that will take many , many years .
I 'll be retired , probably , before that is done . "
Clark works closely with Dr. Scott Schlarbaum , director of UT 's 50 - year - old Tree Improvement Program .
UT TIP provided the necessary infrastructure for the Forestry Service to implement nursery and field studies of chestnut material .
UT TIP has provided technical assistance to develop the experimental designs for testing , and they will assist the Forest Service in monitoring the research .
They have also provided an avenue for partnerships with state forestry divisions for nursery research .
" Keeping track of the genetic identity of a tree from nursery into the field is a tremendous task , " Clark said .
" UT has a well - developed program in hardwood seedling restoration .
We can tap into that expertise . "
Though her work will help re-establish a tree with significant forest and economic potential for Tennessee and other southern states , the long - term influence will go much further .
" The biggest impact is to provide a road map for other species .
Many trees have exotic pest concerns .
This project provides hope for those other species .
If we are successful , this will be one of the greatest triumphs in the history of forest conservation . "

Weizmann Institute Yonath
Yale University Steitz
MRC Ramakrishnan
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences today awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to scientists in the U.S. , England , and Israel " for studies of the structure and function of the ribosome , " the protein - making factory of cells .
Structural biologists Venkatraman Ramakrishnan of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Cambridge , U.K. ; Thomas A. Steitz of Yale University ; and Ada E. Yonath of Weizmann Institute of Science , Rehovot , Israel , will share the $ 1.4 million prize .
Several researchers — many more than three — have made key contributions in recent years to a better understanding of the structure and function of the ribosome , but advances achieved by the three awardees are among the most significant of those contributions .
Ramakrishnan , Steitz , and Yonath have all used X - ray crystallography to map the ribosome 's structure , and the resulting 3 - D models have cast light on its complicated mechanism of action .
The ribosome is a huge protein - RNA complex that is essential to life .
This macromolecular giant , which is composed of one small and one large subunit , reads mRNA messages transcribed from the genetic code in genomic DNA and translates them by catalyzing the biosynthesis of the proteins they encode .
The bacterial ribosome in particular is the site of action for antibiotics such as aminoglycosides and tetracyclines and a key target for the design of new antibiotics as well .
Yonath , is professor of structural biology and director of the Helen & Milton A. Kimmelman Center for Biomolecular Structure & Assembly at the Weizmann Institute .
Yonath , in collaboration with the late biochemist H. G. Wittmann of Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics , Berlin , was the first to obtain crystals of the ribosome , a prerequisite to the X - ray crystallographic studies honored with this year 's prize .
Later , she and her coworkers studied ribosome structure with cryo-crystallography , obtained X - ray crystal structures of the small and large subunits , revealed the binding sites of several antibiotics , and proposed modes of action for the drugs .
She is an Israeli citizen .
The contributions of Steitz , professor of chemistry and of molecular biophysics & biochemistry and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at Yale , have included a structure of the large subunit , obtained by a group led by him and his Yale colleague Peter B. Moore .
This study helped show that the ribosome is actually a ribozyme ( RNA - based enzyme ) by revealing that RNA predominates in the active site .
The group later determined structures of the large subunit bound to various substrates , such as antibiotics and transition - state analogs .
Ramakrishnan , now senior scientist and group leader at the Structural Studies Division of the MRC Laboratory for Molecular Biology , is a U.S. citizen born in India .
His group 's contributions have included determination of the crystal structure of the small subunit and a demonstration of how the ribosome discriminates between correct and incorrect tRNAs , which deliver specific amino acids to the ribosome for protein synthesis .
American Chemical Society President Thomas H. Lane commented that " the research behind these prizes shows how the transforming power of chemistry can improve peoples ' lives .
Scientists around the world are using the winners ' research to develop new antibiotics that can be used in the ongoing battle against antibiotic - resistant microbes that cause so much illness , suffering , and death . "

4. Enforce a diet

Back in the day , when the idea of phones with cameras was new to the world ( okay , this was only 2005 ) , the MyFood Phone service offered , for $ 149 / month , then $ 10 / month , to have a dietitian review any photos you send in of your food and ping you back with a quick take or suggestion .
As you might imagine , that service does n't seem to be around anymore — perhaps because , for many people , the act of simply committing what they 're eating to a camera , and maybe even making it public , is enough to start dropping pounds .
It 's akin to the idea of calling a parent every night you hit the town and telling them how much you had to drink or how much you spent — you would , almost certainly , cut back , and you 'd also have photo evidence and reinforcement of the times you managed not to kill off that entire Cheesecake Factory plate .

That said , you can learn how to get better shots out of the camera you always have with you , as Gina learned and related :
Plan for shutter delay
Like many consumer digital cameras , there 's most likely a delay between the exact moment you press the shutter button and when your cameraphone captures the image .
Plan for this : hit that button half a second in advance to get the exact moment you 're looking for , and keep the phone steady for a few seconds after it 's pressed , too .

What secret superpowers does your cameraphone have , through your own doing or others ' suggestions ?
We want to hear about them in the comments .
Before Ricky Gervais decided to become a lumpen Charlton Heston , before he spoofed “ The Ten Commandments , ” before he wedged a mean - spirited putdown of Christianity into a cute date movie , he should have considered the Golden Rule :
Do n’t be a giant wiener just because you can .
I ’m paraphrasing .
Gervais , formerly the bobbing and oozing star of the inventive original version of “ The Office , ” is today a movie star on tryout .
His new film , “ The Invention of Lying , ” illustrates why Nora Ephron and Christopher Hitchens do n’t write screenplays together .
It begins in frilly cuteness but soon becomes a labored , blunt , loud attack on religion , especially Christianity .
It ’s Hollywood ’s big atheist comedy .
Atheist comedy ?
Surely I exaggerate .
Surely I ’m one of those hyper - sensitive Bible lovers who thinks the secularists are coming to strip my Christmas tree down to a Midwinter Solstice Pole .
You can have my ceramic Nativity scene when you pry it out of my cold , dead hands .
Actually , no .
Like Gervais , I ’m an atheist .
And I think Gervais has one of the most brilliant minds in comedy today — “ Extras , ” his HBO series , was even funnier than “ The Office , ” and his last film , “ Ghost Town , ” is one of the brightest comedies of the decade .
Which is why I wish he had n’t made “ The Invention of Lying . ”
It ’s going to flop ( as “ Ghost Town ” did ) , and it ’s going to damage Gervais in Hollywood .
In the movie , the guy Gervais plays lives in an alternate world in which no one has ever thought of telling an untruth .
He randomly hits on the idea of telling his dying mother not to worry because she ’ll have a glorious afterlife in which she ’ll be reunited with everyone she ever loved .
Everyone gets their own mansion in the sky .
Since no one has ever lied before , everyone believes Gervais , and soon he finds himself forced to instruct the peoples of the world about what happens after they die , about how to curry favor with the “ Man in the Sky ” who is watching everything they do and how to secure a spot in the better place we go to after death .
The movie is an ill - tempered fraud .
Instead of making the latest in a long line of “ stealth movies , ” as my wife calls them ( the ones , like “ Stepmom ” and “ The Family Stone , ” that are trailered to look like fun family holiday treats but are actually about mother - killing outbreaks of cancer ) , Gervais , who presents himself as just an honest bloke telling it the way he sees it , should have insisted that the TV commercials show “ The Invention of Lying ” as exactly what it is : More “ Life of Brian ” than “ Liar , Liar . ”
He could have called it “ The Invention of God . ”
But it would still be a failure artistically , because of Gervais ’s smug contempt .
In the “ Ten Commandments ” scene — I was about to call it the soon - to - be- infamous “ Ten Commandments ” scene but in order to become infamous , people have to know you exist — his character makes up 10 religious precepts , pastes them to Pizza Hut boxes and reads them to multitudes of dullards who will , literally , believe anything they are told .
The scene is tailored to infuriate people of faith .
The nice thing about atheism is that it is n’t ( or should n’t be ) a creed .
Those of us who do n’t believe see ourselves as liberated .
The principal mystery of Genesis , to us , is how to reconcile “ The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway ” with “ Invisible Touch . ”
We do n’t have to stand on street corners proselytizing , telling people they ’re idiots — which is what Gervais is doing .
There are too many smart believers to dismiss them .
Many scientists have faith , and many say that the more they studied science , the more convinced of a Creator they became .
Books like “ I Do n’t Believe in Atheists , ” by Chris Hedges and “ The Case for God , ” by Karen Armstrong , make a spirited argument , saying that atheists can be dogmatic too and that even if Bible stories are n’t true , we ignore their core principles at our peril .
“ Intellectuals of faith ” is not an oxymoron .
But you do n’t need to have written a book or gotten a PhD in astronomy for your views to count .
If believers are , according to atheists , dead wrong , that does n’t give atheists a license to treat them as the blundering dopes mindlessly absorbing the Pizza Hut Commandments in Gervais ’s movie .
The believers I ’ve known tend to be kind and thoughtful .
They do n’t try to talk me into faith , but even if they did , it would n’t bother me .
I do n’t try to convince them that they ’re wrong — because it would bother them .
What would be the point ?
How much joy lies in convincing someone that he ’s just walking fertilizer for the bone orchard ?
Religion provides a great many people with a great many comforts .
Christian Americans are n’t pushing the country toward theocracy .
All they ask is a little respect .
Maybe Gervais thinks believers are going to leave his movie thinking , “ Gee , I guess Rick showed me what ’s what !
How silly I ’ve been ! ”
But they ’re going to be offended , if not outraged .
He ’s lucky the movie is going to flop .
Otherwise he might have to heed the wisdom of a popular Bumper Sticker Commandment of the 1970s : “ Do Unto Others — Then Run ! ”
In February , Bill Myers had a $ 62,478 operation to fix an aortic aneurysm .
But he has n’t seen a doctor to make sure the complicated repair is working and healing properly .
He also has stopped taking medication for his other medical problems , including high blood pressure and cholesterol .
It ’s because Myers has no health insurance .
And he has more than $ 70,000 in medical bills .
“ After finding out I ’m that far in debt , there ’s no way I ’m going back , ” said Myers , 44 .
Myers is one of the laid - off employees of Turbine Airfoil Designs in Harrisburg .
Their situation might provide the perfect example of how broken the U.S. health care system is .
In March , the workers learned their Capital BlueCross medical benefits had been canceled because TAD had n't been paying the premiums .
It gets worse .
Capital backdated the cancellation to last October .
That left some TAD employees with five months of medical bills .
During those months , they received no hint their bills might not be covered .
TAD told them not to worry .
Their Capital BlueCross benefits cards remained valid .
Whenever anyone , including hospitals and medical practices , checked with Capital , they were told the medical care was covered .
Almost everyone agrees the TAD workers bear no fault .
But all the bills have come home to them .
So have letters and calls from bill collectors , and threats that their credit will be ruined .
“ I ’m at the point I do n’t even answer the phone unless I can see who it is on the caller ID , ” said Jason Beachler , 39 , of McAlisterville .
Beacher has about $ 3,000 in bills , with much resulting from a trip to the emergency room after his wife got glass in her eye while working on a ceiling fan .
Beachler and his former co-workers are lashing out in many directions .
Most are union members , and blame TAD for reneging on contract - required benefits .
They blame hospitals for turning them over to collection agencies .
They ’ve also noticed that hospitals have charged them full price — not the lower , contract rate the hospital had expected from Capital .
And they blame Capital for not warning them that their bills might not be covered .
“ There was nothing there to lead us to believe we did n’t have insurance .
I think the responsibility lies with them , too , ” said Terry Hocker , 64 , of Swatara Twp .
Yet it ’s hard to pinpoint the villain — at least from a legal standpoint .
TAD officials admit the company is responsible for the bills .
But they also say TAD does n’t have the money to pay them .
Capital says it did nothing wrong .
Beginning last October , a recession - crippled TAD was unable to make full premium payments to Capital .
Capital tried to work with TAD to keep the coverage in place .
But after five months , Capital pulled the plug .
It said continuing to carry TAD would have been unfair to Capital ’s other customers .
Capital further said it followed the rules in canceling the coverage .
A responsible employer would have notified employees of the situation and that bills might not be covered , Capital said .
The state Insurance Department , however , is investigating whether Capital might bear some responsibility .
On their end , hospitals had noticed bills submitted to Capital were n’t getting paid , and were listed as on “ hold . ”
They did n’t know why .
“ We ’re caught in the middle of this , just like the patients are , ” said Lori Moran , a spokeswoman for Holy Spirit Hospital .
More than anything , the situation demonstrates the need for health reform , said Joel Ario , the Pennsylvania insurance commissioner .
It shows how quickly even people with good health insurance can find themselves uninsured , facing financial nightmare , and unable to afford medical care , Ario noted .
It shows the absence of options for people who lose employer - sponsored health insurance .
Many of the laid - off TAD workers and their spouses are older , with significant health problems .
Some shopped for new coverage .
They learned monthly premiums could equal nearly half of their unemployment income .
They also learned it would n’t cover their existing medical problems for the first year .
So on top of their insurance premiums , they must pay for the medical care they are most likely to need .
“ It ’s costing me $ 363 a month and it does n’t cover anything , ” said Judy Fisher , 63 , whose husband , Robert , is laid off from TAD .
TAD workers tell of two people who had to stop cancer treatment .
Several said they are living without medical care .
“ I ’ve been more or less putting my life in God ’s hand .
The day he wants me is the day he takes me , ” said Myers , of Bernville in Berks County .
Pinnacle and Holy Spirit Hospital have each turned bills involving TAD employees over to collection agencies .
In an interview , four Pinnacle officials strongly defended the collection tactics .
Patricia Taleff , the director of patient business services , explained Pinnacle has no recourse or reason to bill Capital once a patient is no longer a Capital member .
And billing TAD , or even forwarding any information about an employee ’s medical situation , would violate privacy laws , Taleff said .
But as soon as TAD workers apply for financial aid , the bill collectors will be called off , Taleff said .
“ I really want to work with these individuals , ” she said .
Holy Spirit recently suspended bill collection involving TAD workers .
It did so in mid-September , when it first learned of the their situation , spokeswoman Lori Moran said .
Holy Spirit will await the outcome of TAD ’s efforts to resolve the situation .
I opposed all the unconstitutional bailouts and stimulus plans of the Republican - Democratic Establishment .
I stand against government - assisted cartelization of our nation 's industries and businesses .
The actions taken so far by the government will only serve to worsen the economy .
Government 's responsibilities should be limited to establishing a framework of laws to protect individuals from fraud , coercion , and aggression against the rights of individuals — life , liberty , and justly acquired property .
The Banker Bailout of October 2008 was not only unnecessary , but a complete outrage .
“ Too big to fail ” is an outright lie .
An orderly bankruptcy process of debt liquidation and asset reevaluation sold by the insolvent firms and bought by solvent , stronger firms would have resulted in a quick recovery .
The spillover from the financial sector into the general economy would not have been as severe if market corrections for the “ toxic assets ” had been valued properly .
The Republican incumbent , Congressman Dent , voted for the Banker Bailout , HR 1424 , after voting against the original 110 - page bill several days earlier .
Dent was a turncoat in that he voted for the bailout only AFTER 332 pages of pork were added , ranging from Section 503's exemption from excise tax for certain toy wooden arrows to Section 317's 7 - year cost recovery period for a motorsports racing track facility as I listed in an article as an outraged citizen last October .
The Obama Stimulus Plan of January 2009 will be looked upon by posterity as a prime example of how central economic planning is detrimental and can never work .
Why ?
The first reason is because the focus is on full employment rather than full production .
The second reason is that the American economy , or any economy , is far too complex for a central planning group .
The third reason is pure common sense ; spending is exactly what got America into an economic depression , and to suggest more spending will cure the problem is ludicrous .
I predicted this failure in January before the bill was passed in my article “ Why Obama 's Stimulus Plan Will Fail … and a Better Alternative . ” ( Cartoon from 1934 Chicago Tribune )
Of course , the Republican central planning stimulus alternative favored by Congressman Dent was likewise nonsensical .
Their recommendation for a different redistribution of wealth was at best a lesser of two evils , and further proof that agreement on economic planning by a central body simply cannot be achieved .
Government exists to protect liberty , not to redistribute wealth or grant special privileges .
Both the Banker Bailout and Obama Stimulus served to benefit the government 's favorite corporations at the expense of every individual in America .
By creating more future debt , the government has worsened the present imbalances and placed our next generations into bondage .
Whether it is the military - industrial complex , Big Oil , Big Pharm , Big Ag , or the financial firms who bankroll their Establishment politicians into power , the crony corporatism and revolving door between the Treasury Department , the FED and Wall Street must end .
The government should not be issuing special favors to any corporation for any reason , as to do so the government must first steal from someone else .
Faceless groups like corporations do not have rights .
Only individuals can have rights , such as individual shareholders .
We must realize that much of the government - sponsored regulations put in place for “ safety ” or “ fair trade ” merely serve to increase the size of government bureaucracy , which increases the end cost to the consumer , prevents competition from smaller firms , and creates a higher barrier of entry for new businesses .
By their very nature , bureaucratic regulatory agencies are doomed to inefficiency and failures , and can do nothing than a series of private , competing accreditation firms cannot do both profitably and far better .
The free market is the most just , most humane , and most prosperous economic system the world has ever known .
As Congressman , I will never award special favors or bailouts to corporations and bankers .
[ Note : The Banker Bailout even led me to decide to run for Congress since it was the point when I realized that if no one steps up , our country , conceived in liberty , will be destroyed by the Republican and Democratic Establishment . ]

LONG BEACH , Calif . --
Plug - in electric cars could destabilize the distribution of power , a utility executive cautioned at a conference here this week .
Ed Kjaer , director of Southern California Edison 's electric transportation advancement program , said plug - in manufacturers , designers and component makers are poised to capitalize on a " perfect storm " that could push electric cars into the mainstream .
Kjaer noted that 10 to 12 carmakers are ready to launch plug - in models between 2010 and 2012 , creating a sense of " incredible excitement " around a sector that has seen its fair share of false starts .
But Kjaer warned that consumer demand for electric cars is still unproven .
He also said he wants infrastructure planners to focus on how a flood of plug - in cars would drain the power grid at the most local level .
" The realities are , this is not a done deal , " Kjaer told the " Plug In 2009 " conference and exhibition .
" We have a lot of challenges before us to help make this market a reality . "
Chief among those challenges is how thousands of power - hungry vehicles would tax distribution transformers at the local level .
Such transformers have historically handled electricity load for about 10 average - size homes each .
Adding a plug - in car to the grid is equal to about a third of a house , Kjaer said .
And because early adopters are likely to spring up in geographic concentrations , that could mean overloaded transformers at the distribution level or plug - in cars potentially causing power outages .
" The worst imaginable situation you could have is your neighbor yelling at you because you blacked out the neighborhood , " Kjaer said .
Kjaer is less concerned about transmission or generation being overtaxed , as long as consumers are taught to charge their plug - in cars at night , during off - peak demand periods , to smooth the load .
Kjaer said improving distribution is the key infrastructure challenge for utilities , aside from creating a network of charging stations .
" We 're talking about the last 10 feet " between the house and the transformer , he said .
" It 's the last 10 or 20 feet that we 've got to work on .
We 're got to work on it really hard , really quickly , because these cars are coming . "
Volt makes splash
The big news at this year 's Plug In conference was General Motors Corp .'s announcement that test models of the Chevrolet Volt , a plug - in hybrid , are surpassing 230 miles per gallon in the city , as rated by a U.S. EPA system for measuring energy consumption .
If confirmed by EPA , that means the Volt would be the first model to exceed triple - digit gas mileage when introduced in showrooms in late 2010 .
Tony Posawatz , GM 's vehicle line director for the Volt , told attendees here that the Volt will go into pre-production between March 2010 and August 2010 , with commercially available cars set to roll out the following November .
He added that GM engineers had just returned from a trip to the desert , where they tested a liquid - cooled battery with positive results .
" This really is breakthrough news , " Posawatz said .
James Boyd , a former chief of the California Air Resources Board , said the announcement had him praising GM for perhaps the first time in his career .
" Can you believe the company ... that led the campaign to kill the electric car has released a plug - in hybrid ? "
Boyd said .
" This is my first public congratulatory statement to General Motors ever . "
Still , Boyd , now a commissioner at the California Energy Commission , cautioned that the infrastructure issues standing in the way of real commercial viability are likely to block further progress if government officials do not start taking some risks to encourage planting charging stations in home residences and elsewhere .
Among the obstacles are building out charging sockets in homes and permitting them through local authorities , in addition to mapping a future network of charging stations .
The process for residential construction can sometimes take months , which would likely deter buyers .
And limited range means charging stations away from the home are a must .
Mark Perry , director of product planning at Nissan North America , said Nissan is preparing to launch its own plug - in , zero-emissions model -- the Leaf -- in 14 months ' time , but executives there are urging governments to get involved in infrastructure planning .
The subject is their top focus .
" There are a lot of jigsaw pieces that have to come together in 14 months , " Perry said .
" It 's not financial ; it 's manpower , time and work . "
Perry said Nissan has signed agreements with San Diego , Sonoma County , Phoenix , Raleigh , Seattle and the state of Oregon to develop launch markets .
In San Diego , $ 100 million in stimulus funding will be spent on developing a test market and charging stations , and Nissan is working with the city to get there .
Other deals with test markets are expected soon , Perry said .
" We 're playing a pathfinder role here , " he added .
" We 're coming , GM is coming , and there are going to be a lot of others . "

Science is amazing .
And I 'm not just saying that because it's my only hope of cloning dinosaurs or inventing a time machine .
Yes I am .
But still , the Leidenfrost Effect is cool too .
The Leidenfrost effect is a phenomenon in which a liquid , in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than the liquid 's boiling point , produces an insulating vapor layer which keeps that liquid from boiling rapidly .
This is most commonly seen when cooking ; one sprinkles drops of water in a skillet to gauge its temperature -- if the skillet 's temperature is at or above the Leidenfrost point , the water skitters across the metal and takes longer to evaporate than it would in a skillet that is above boiling temperature , but below the temperature of the Leidenfrost point .
It has also been used in some dangerous demonstrations , such as dipping a wet finger in molten lead or blowing out a mouthful of liquid nitrogen , both enacted without injury to the demonstrator .
Well neato .
If you do n't like reading the guy in the video explains the whole Lederhosen effect and even demonstrates the water on a hot surface and dipping your hand in liquid nitrogen experiments .
So , watch that while I run to the restroom .
Okay , now which one of you jokers filled the toilet bowl with liquid nitrogen ?
And , hypothetically , how long do you think it takes to thaw a frozen python ?
And , if using a microwave , should you use the defrost or popcorn button ?

Thanks to towhee , who , like all women , has a heart that pumps liquid nitrogen .

I do n’t usually do requests , but as libel law reform is a particular interest of mine and a subject I ’ve blogged on previous occasions , I ’m more than happy to rise to the challenge set by ‘ organic cheeseboard ’ in comments under Sunder ’s commentary on yesterday ’s events .
but for god ’s sake could SOMEONE writing about this stuff PLEASE offer an idea of what those reforms might actually look like ?
Fair enough , lets start with an internet specific reform which , as a blogger , is number one on my own shopping list of reforms , and a measure that we absolutely do want to import from our cousins over the the other side of the Big Pond .
Section 230 of the Communications Decency
Acy specifies simply that :
No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider .
Under English libel law , at present , web hosting companies may treated as the publisher of , and held liable for , [ allegedly ] defamatory content published to their servers by a third party despite having had no absolutely part in in , or prior knowledge , of the that material ’s publication .
Likewise , bloggers and forum operators can be sued over comments , posted to their blog / forum by visitors , over which they will have had no control whatsoever unless they actively pre-moderate all such comments .
There ’s a basic issue of fairness here .
Why should I ( or Dave Osler , for that matter ) face the rap , and a phenomenally expensive and time consuming High Court action , as a result of material posted to my blog by a visitor with my express knowledge , particularly if I then behave entirely responsibly by removing the allegedly defamatory material with n a reasonable amount of time after being made aware of its existence ?
That ’s the exact situation that Dave finds himself in at the moment , one that simply could not arise in the US .
There is also a second important issue here .
By treating web hosts as the publishers of material uploaded to their servers by third parties , the law as it stands encourages would be litigants to bypass the due legal process entirely by threatening to sue the hosting company , which will almost always prompt the company to roll over and take matters into its own hands irrespective of the views / intentions of the blogger / forum owner to whom such a threat directly relates .
That ’s what happened to Craig Murray and , by extension to Tim Ireland , Boris Johnson and Bob Piper .
Craig was perfectly content to stand his ground and defend what he had to say about Russian / Uzbek oligarch Alisher Usmanov in court , going so far as to specifically invite a libel action to put his comments to the test .
That rigfht was , however , temporarily taken entirely out of his hands by the company that hosted his blog , which rolled over when threatened by Usmanov ’s lawyers , Schillings .
Again , that cannot happen in the US , and its the main reason why I and many other bloggers choose to host our sites with American providers on US - based servers .
It does n’t prevent us from being sued for defamation , but it does stop would - be litigants trying to short - circuit the due legal process by threatening the hosting company , leaving the decision as to whether to stand and fight , or back down , in my hands and those of someone who has no effective means of accurately assessing the situation .
This has been under discussion for while amongst established bloggers from all parts of the political spectrum and its fair to say , having been part of those discussions .
that there ’s a clear consensus that we need provisions similar to those enjoyed by bloggers in the US .
If blogging is to continue to be an interactive medium then , at the very least , web hosting companies should be afforded the same ‘ common carrier ’ status enjoyed by providers of telephone services , removing entirely their current liability for content housed on their servers , while bloggers and forum owners need provisions which limit their potential liability for third party comments to situations in which they fail to act responsibly when faced with a complaint that a comment may be [ allegedly ] defamatory , i.e. removal of such a comment within a reasonable amount time after receiving such a complaint should be sufficient to preclude any further action .
Target number two for urgent reform is the abominable multiple publication rule , which provides the foundations for England ’s rapidly expanding libel tourism industry .
To save time , the background to this aspect of English libel law and the issues it raises are discussed here by Peter Noorlander .
It is , however , worth noting that this rule has become so pernicious that , so far , the states of New York , Florida and California have enacted laws rendering High Court libel judgements based on this rule unenforceable in those states , and that a Federal law to the same effect may soon follow .
Thankfully , the days of the multiple publication rule ( and libel tourism ) may well be numbers as the Ministry of Justice is currently consulting on possible reforms , with the favoured reform option looking likely to be a single publication rule with an extension to the time limit within which a libel action may generally be brought to three years and an absolute limit of ten year .
In the circumstances , our best option at this time would clearly appear to be to support and , if possible , contribute to the MoJ ’s consultation by supporting the proposal to do away with the multiple publication rule .
From there we need next to focus on the workings of two important legal principles within the framework of English defamation law , those of absolute and qualified privilege and malice both of which , if formulated well and applied in a nuanced and judicious manner , would allow us to afford a greater degree of protection to certain important types of speech without tipping English defamation law towards the kind of ‘ free for all ’ that exists in the United States in which public figures , in particular , have almost no possibility of obtaining redress even if what is written about them is verifiable a complete fabrication .
In comments , ‘ organic cheeseboard ’ makes the following observation :
Nick Cohen , who writes the ratbiter pieces in private eye and who thinks we should copy the American laws verbatim ( not that he ever says that in the Eye pieces , natch ) .
Now , I think that ’s a really bad idea , given the state of the US news industry and the extent to which smears dominate political reporting and campaigning over there .
And , broadly speaking , I ’m inclined to agree , although I ’m much less concerned about the issue of political smears , which could more readily be dealt with in electoral law , than I am about the proliferation of the made - up celebrity tittle - tattle industry , which is getting bad enough over here as things currently stand .
In the US , public figures have to prove malice in order to mount a libel action against a publisher ( in English law , malice is only a factor in determining damages ) and this has created a gaping loophole in their defamation law in which an entire industry based on spreading made - up celebrity ‘ gossip ’ has flourished .
I recent read an article in which a journalist who ’d worked on one of these downmarket gossip rags , the kind that invariably feature either Jennifer Aniston , Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie on the cover every simgle week , blew the lid on the ‘ journalistic ’ methods by which they generate the constant stream of banal fictions on which their sales figure entirely depend , the short version of which being that they routinely buy in every paparazzi shot they can get hold of , pick out one that shows Brad / Angelina / Jennifer in a particular ‘ mood ’ and then make if a story to go with the photo .
If Jennifer ’s looking happy then , in made - up gossip world , things must be going well with her current boyfriend , or there ’s a new man on the horizon or whatever , if she looks a bit pissed off then her relationship must be on the rock or she must still be pining for Brad .
The real trick in all this is that today ’s paps use high - speed digital cameras which can reel off tens , and even , hundreds of shots in rapid succession with the result that a couple of minutes worth of frantic snapping will give the magazine just about every possible ‘ mood ’ they could ever work with .
As I see it , what we need to be looking for is a framework in which the principles of absolute and qualified privilege and malice are balanced in a such a way as to ‘ raise the bar ’ on defamation actions relating to certain types of speech which we consider to be necessary and / or desirable in an open , democratic society .
This is view that I know will prove a bit controversial with some Lib Dem bloggers who debated this issue following Richard Dawkin ’s appearance at their recent conference and who came down strongly against the idea that some type of speech should be regarded as being ‘ more equal ’ than other .
Personally , I take the view that there are certain type of speech to which a greater degree of protection from suppressive or censorious litigation should be afford , over and above the general protections given to all forms of speech .
Political speech , including criticism of politicians and public officials , which is absolutely necessary in a democracy , is one such category and one that the European Court of Human Rights already recognises as meriting an enhanced degree of legal protection .
Whistleblowing is another , as - to my mind – is scientific ‘ speech ’ founded on evidence .
Libel hearings are no place to resolve disputes over the merits , or otherwise , of claims which purport to be based on scientific evidence .
This brief list is not exhaustive , nor intended to be so , but it does give a flavour of the kind of speech that we should by ‘ hardening ’ against private censorship founded on the abuse of defamation law because its in our interests , as a free and democratic society , to encourage and facilitate speech of this kind as a matter of public good .
Finally we come to matters of process at trial , in which those defending a libel action are unduly and unfairly burdened with presumptions that may have seemed reasonable in the 18th Century but which have should have no place in a 21st century courtroom .
The most notorious of these is , of course , the presumption that an allegedly defamatory statement is untrue unless proven otherwise by the defendant in circumstances in which the plaintiff need provide no evidence whatsoever to support their claim that the statement is untrue .
Such a presumption may have suited the social mores of a society in which a gentleman was automatically though to be a man of honour but in this day and age such archaic and overly romantic notions can hardly be held to remain valid .
That absolute presumption has to go .
In other forms of civil action , no such automatic presumption is made .
Instead , at any given time , each party is obligated to produce evidence relating to their claim / defence ( called the burden of going forward ) which , if it gives rise to presumption of fact , places the burden of going forward onto the opposing party who may , then , introduce evidence to rebut that presumption .
If the presumption is adequately rebutted then it ‘ bursts ’ ( hence this is called the ‘ bursting bubble ’ approach ) and that presumption can no longer be relied on .
That process , which does not rely on any absolute presumption at the outset , does not seem , to me at least , to unreasonably shift the advantage in libel actions towards the defendant , in seems only to place both parties on a more equitable inasmuch as both will be required , at various times , to produce evidence to support their case .
In fact it may , in practice , have little or no impact on the prospects of those defending a libel action , at all , but it would remove the clear perception that such actions are loaded unfairly in favour of plaintiffs .
Beyond that , the presumption of damage , i.e. that a defamatory statement is automatically damaging , except where it can be shown that the plaintiff has no reputation to defend , also needs to revised such that the plaintiff must produce evidence to show both that their reputation and standing has suffered actual damage as a consequence of a defamatory statement and where compensation is sought in relation to such a claim , that , evidence of a material of loss is produced .
So that ’s four areas in which reforms are needed ;
One – ‘ common carrier status ’ – that should be easy to effect but which , sadly , is likely to meet considerable resistance from politicians given their overweening interest in forced ISP ’s to police the Internet – I ’m reliably informed that the ‘ benefits ’ of Chinese - style universal fire - walling was a hot topic of interest amongst some Tory MPs at their conference .
Two – changes to the multiple publication rule – that ’s currently in the pipeline and needing support , and
Three – adjustments to the rules of privilege , malice and the procedure rules covering presumptions in libel actions , that need careful thought and better legal minds than this layman can offer to work up the details .
Now , what was Sunder saying about needing an effective campaign ?
Oh , and support Dave Osler – that ’s really important right now !
UPDATE

( CNN ) --
Three major earthquakes struck within an hour and 10 minutes Thursday morning near Vanuatu in the South Pacific , prompting a tsunami warning that was quickly lifted .
Thursday 's quakes struck near Vanuatu in the South Pacific .
They were part of series of nine moderate - to - major quakes that rattled the region in just over four hours .
The first quake , with a magnitude of 7.8 , struck at 9:03 a.m. ( 6:03 p.m. ET ) at a depth of 35 km ( 22 miles ) and an epicenter 295 km ( 180 miles ) north - northwest of Luganville , Espiritu Santo , Vanuatu , the U.S. Geological Survey said .
A second quake , with a magnitude of 7.7 , struck 15 minutes later at the same depth and an epicenter of 340 km ( 210 miles ) north - northwest of Luganville .
The third quake , with a magnitude of 7.1 , struck at 10:13 a.m. ( 7:13 p.m. ET ) at about the same depth and an epicenter of 280 km ( 175 miles ) north - northwest of Luganville .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued and then quickly lifted a regional tsunami warning and watch for parts of the Pacific near the first earthquake 's epicenter .
The first data from a buoy at Luganville on Vanuatu detected a tsunami wave of 4 centimeters ( 1.6 inches ) at Luganville on Vanuatu , said Victor Sardina , a geophysicist with the center .

A second pulse of the wave was 10 centimeters ( 3.9 inches ) , he said .
" It looks like a very small wave , " he told CNN in a telephone interview .
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries , Sardina said .
The two major quakes that followed the first one were aftershocks , Sardina said .
When there 's a big quake , the pattern they follow is after the first quake , a second and then a third , " he said .
" Those are obviously related , " he said .
At the Hotel Le Paris in Noumea , the capital of New Caledonia , the manager told CNN that she felt the shake but had not seen any damage .
On Espiritu Santo Island in Vanuatu , dive - shop owner Rehan Syed said he was aware of no reports of damages or injuries .
" We have the sun out and winds are pretty normal , " he told CNN .
" Pretty cloudy skies but nothing more than that . "
" We felt the quake ( my chair and my keyboard moved ) but did not take too much notice as we live with shakes every week , " said John Nicholls of Vanuatu Hotels in an e-mail .
At the New Caledonia Hotel , guests were evacuated to higher ground , General Manager Torani George told CNN , adding that he had felt " nothing , nothing at all . "
" There is no panic , nothing , " he said .
CNN 's Lonzo Cook and Jessica Jordan contributed to this story .

A trip to the grocery store , simple enough , but now there is a choice to be made , organic or non-organic products ?
What does organic really mean ?
Whatever it means , organic farming has been one of the fastest growing segments of U.S. agriculture in the last decade and Oregon is no exception .
According to a study conducted by Washington State University and Oregon Tilth Certified Organic in 2008 farm acreage in Oregon certified as organic has increased over six fold between 1999 and 2008 .
Between 2005 and 2008 certified acreage grew 39 percent .
The acreage category with the biggest gain is in the forage category as dairy farms increasingly seek to have their products classified as organic .
Congress passed the Organic Foods Production Act in 1990 .
Oregon passed the first organic standards legislation in the U.S. in 1973 .
When you see “ organic ” in a store or on a product it is a labeling term indicating that the products have been produced under the authority of the Organic Foods Production Act .
The National Organic Standards Board approved a definition of organic agriculture that said , “ The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life , plants , animals and people . ”
If products are detected with prohibited substances levels that are greater than five percent of the Environmental Protection Agency ’s allowance for the specific residue detected , the product must not be sold , labeled or represented as organically produced .
In order to be classified as organic , operations must be certified by an organization such as Oregon Tilth Certified Organic , verifying that the business meets the organic operation standards .
The organic certification process covers not only the end product , but also every step of the process from harvest to market .
Farmers apply for certification , are inspected , the application reviewed , any discrepancies corrected and finally certified as organic .
.
Organic farming has grown to such an extent that , September 14 - 20 , 2009 has been declared Organically Grown in Oregon Week by Governor Ted Kulongowski .
The week will celebrate , promote and demonstrate the importance or organic agriculture in Oregon

More than 79,000 people have signed a Progressive Change Campaign Committee petition urging Harry Reid to strip the chairmanship of any Democratic senator who votes to filibuster health care reform .
The response from Reid's No. 2 , Sen . Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) : ' We 've never done that .
We 're not going to do that . ' | John Shinkle / POLITICO
Dem leaders brush off the left
Some of the progressives who helped put Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid in power are demanding that they come down hard on House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel and any Senate committee chairmen who stray from the flock on health care reform .
Do n’t hold your breath .

While three Democratic insiders say leaders have privately discussed the possibility of ousting Rangel or asking him to step aside , there has been no move to approach the New York Democrat — and aides to Pelosi have made it clear that she wo n’t do anything about him until the House Ethics Committee finishes its probe .
That does n’t sit well with Markos Moulitsas and Arianna Huffington , two stars of the liberal blogosphere who ’ve joined House Republicans in calling for Rangel ’s ouster .
“ Talk about tone deaf , ” Huffington wrote for The Huffington Post on Sunday .
“ The Democrats have to make it clear to America ’s beleaguered middle class that they do n’t believe there are two sets of rules : one for the power players of Wall Street and Washington and one for everybody else .
Congress ’s approval rating is at 21 percent , a 10 - point drop over the last month .
If the Democrats want to see it hit single digits , by all means , keep Charlie Rangel as chairman . ”
While Huffington ’s comments buzzed through the blogs Sunday and Monday , Pelosi cares much more about her close - up constituency — the 255 members of the House Democratic Caucus .
And when House Republicans pushed a resolution last week calling for Rangel ’s ouster , the vast majority of Pelosi ’s Democrats said no .
And the Congressional Black Caucus is leaning hard on the Californian to lay off Rangel until the ethics committee completes its investigation , which could drag into next year .
Last week , 36 members of the CBC sent a letter to Pelosi on Rangel , a move interpreted by top Democratic aides as a “ shot across Pelosi ’s bow . ”
That does n’t mean Democrats are happy that Rangel is still an issue — or that he threatens to remain one into the 2010 election season .
“ She is under a lot of pressure to do something , ” one Pelosi confidant said of the speaker .
“ She wants the [ ethics committee ] to finish quickly so we can get this over with . ”
But for now , Pelosi wo n’t do anything but wait — regardless of what Huffington says .
“ The speaker ’s made it clear that she ’s going to wait until the ethics committee comes back with its findings , ” said Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly .
While Pelosi and Reid rode Barack Obama ’s message of change and reform to supermajority power in the House and Senate , they ’ve proved less willing to act on specific demands from their liberal base — especially when those demands cross into the realm of palace politics .
Earlier this year , Reid defended Democratic moderates and conservatives when a liberal advocacy group with ties to Obama threatened to air ads against party members who opposed the public option .
Now , more than 79,000 people have signed a Progressive Change Campaign Committee petition urging Reid to strip the chairmanship of any Democratic senator who votes to filibuster health care reform .
The response from Reid ’s No. 2 , Sen. Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) : “ We ’ve never done that .
We ’re not going to do that . ”
Durbin said the petitioners needed to “ count to 60 and understand we need to be together , and there are times when we need to work out our differences . ”
“ This is a silly and unnecessary distraction that is not going to happen — period , ” added a Senate Democratic leadership aide .
“ Given how important this is to the rest of his agenda , it is up to President Obama to help the leadership to hold the caucus together . ”
Not surprisingly , Democratic senators who are still evaluating the reform bill making its way through the Senate Finance Committee are n’t worried about the progressives ’ punishment plan .
“ It ’s not fair to ask people to facilitate the enactment of policies with which we ultimately disagree , ” said moderate Sen. Evan Bayh ( D - Ind . ) .
“ So the closer we get to the end of the process , the more , for me , the process and policy will be one and the same . ”
Several Democratic moderates told POLITICO that they most likely will be with their party on most procedural votes but could hold out on the last one — to end debate and cut off a filibuster — if they wanted to demand changes to the final product .
“ Not vote for cloture ?
I would n’t rule that possibility out — not at all , ” said Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) , who caucuses with the Democrats .
“ Sen .
Reid is working hard with the White House and his colleagues in the Senate on a bill that will get 60 votes needed to make health insurance reform a reality , ” said Jim Manley , spokesman for Reid .
For Reid , the realities of the Senate make it tough for him to hold senators ’ feet to the fire .
Senators — unlike House members — have enormous power under the rules to dictate the terms of floor debate , limiting the leader ’s power , and stripping chairmanships would require the Nevadan to garner support from a majority of Senate Democrats .
Moreover , Reid is not an arm - twisting type — a point underscored by his decision to allow Lieberman to retain his chairmanship of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee over the objections of liberals furious with his decision to campaign for John McCain in 2008 .
“ The Democratic leadership of the Senate is being extremely respectful of the different views within our caucus and trying to find a way forward that accomplishes our goals , ” said centrist Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - La . ) .
She added that she would not automatically vote against a filibuster on the bill and that “ the leadership has not , to date , asked me to . ”
But critics say that approach could come at a cost , saying that senators unfazed about retaliation from their leadership will have an even freer hand to buck their party — and that Reid should lay down the law .
“ If he calls himself majority leader , he needs to lead that majority , not follow , ” said Adam Green , co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee .
“ If he calls himself ‘ Give ’ Em Hell ’ Harry , he needs to actually give ’em hell . ”

Life expectancy has been increasing for 165 years
More than half of babies now born in the UK and other wealthy nations will live to 100 years , researchers say .
The study , published in The Lancet journal , also says the extra years are spent with less serious disability .
Data from more than 30 developed countries shows that since 1950 the probability of surviving past 80 years of age has doubled for both sexes .
One expert said healthy behaviours for all ages was the key to enjoying living a long life .
Professor Kaare Christensen , of the Danish Ageing Research Centre at the University of Southern Denmark , who led the study , said life expectancy had been increasing since 1840 and there was no sign of this trend slowing down .
People are not only living longer than they did previously , but also they are living longer , with less disability and fewer functional limitations
Professor Kaare Christensen , University of Southern Denmark
He said : " The linear increase in record life expectancy for more than 165 years does not suggest a looming limit to human lifespan .
" If life expectancy were approaching a limit , some deceleration of progress would probably occur . "
In 1950 the probability of surviving for between 80 and 90 years of age was , on average , 15 to 16 % for women and 12 % for men .
In 2002 , these figures had risen to 37 % for women and 25 % for men .
The study points out that until the 1920s , improvements in infant and childhood survival contributed most to the increase in life expectancies .
Since then the increases have been fuelled by progress in the survival of the elderly , which has been particularly evident since the 1970s .
Four ' ages of man '
The researchers said that man could now be regarded as having four stages of life - child , adult , young old age and old old age .
They said there was no evidence that the old old age group were unhealthier than their younger counterparts , partly because the frailest people died first , leaving the most robust to survive past 85 .
Danish research had shown that as many as 30 % to 40 % of individuals were independent from the ages of 92 to 100 .
And a study of US super - centenarians ( age 110 to 119 years ) showed that , even at these advanced ages , 40 % needed little assistance or were independent .
Professor Christensen said that in the UK and other countries there was evidence of a postponement in the limitations and disabilities caused by ill - health , despite an increase in chronic diseases .
This was because of improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses such as heart disease and cancer .
He said : " Increasing numbers of people at old and very old ages will pose major challenges for health - care systems .
" Present evidence , however , suggests that people are not only living longer than they did previously , but also they are living longer , with less disability and fewer functional limitations . "
Some researchers have suggested that growing rates of obesity will limit lifespan - but Professor Christensen said such predictions were too simplistic .
He said : " Life is a lottery and some obese people will live to a 100 and some thin people will die early .
" Professor Alan Maryon - Davis , president of the Faculty of Public Health , said there were still concerns that obesity and unhealthy behaviours would shorten many people 's lives .
He said : " It 's great that as a nation we 're living longer and staying younger - but let 's do what we can to help those who find it harder to lead healthy lives . "
The Department of Health said rising life expectancy would have an impact on the future funding of care services in England .
A spokesman said it would look at the study 's findings .
" We know that the shape of our society is changing ...
We want to make sure that people who are living longer continue to enjoy a good quality of life .
By 2040 we expect 1.7 m more adults will have a care need .
" We want to be able to offer really good care to everyone who needs it , so we need to radically change the way the system is funded . "
Plans for a National Care Service to provide free at - home support for elderly people in the greatest need were announced by the prime minister at the Labour Party conference .

RIDGWAY , COLORADO — A Merrill Lyncher with good timing cashed out a while back and bought himself a modest cabin with breathtaking views of the aspen and pine forests rising toward the jagged peaks of the Rockies .
The American West , empty enough in these parts , still holds something of the limitless promise of a virgin land .
Some time later , a former colleague who had labored on and amassed a far greater fortune — as well as greater cares — came to visit and the two men went for a stroll .
The cabin owner , by now a ruddy - faced Mr. Mellow , gestured toward the snow - covered ridge and said : “ The difference between us is you have everything money can buy and I have everything money ca n’t buy . ”
When it comes to money , timing is everything .
When it comes to life , it helps to have what the British explorer Richard Burton called “ the wanderer ’s heart . ”
The United States , like some heavyweight who ’s taken one punch too many , is still groggy from the money fever of gutted pension funds , toxic securities and lunatic leverage .
My sense is the world , like Merrill Lynch , was about three nanoseconds from complete meltdown .
Oh no .

Editor 's note : Peter Bergen , CNN 's national security analyst , is a fellow at the New America Foundation , a Washington - based think tank that promotes innovative thought from across the ideological spectrum , and at New York University 's Center on Law and Security .
He 's the author of " The Osama bin Laden I Know : An Oral History of al Qaeda 's Leader . "
Peter Bergen says Osama bin Laden is still alive and still significant eight years after September 11 .
HELMAND , Afghanistan ( CNN ) --
Eight years after September 11 , the " war on terror " has gone the way of the dodo .
And President Obama talks instead about a war against al Qaeda and its allies .
What , then , of al Qaeda 's enigmatic leader , Osama bin Laden , who has vanished like a wisp of smoke ?
And does he even matter now ?
The U.S. government had n't had a solid lead on al Qaeda 's leader since the battle of Tora Bora in winter 2001 .
Although there are informed hypotheses that today he is in Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province on the Afghan border , perhaps in one of the more northerly areas such as Bajaur , these are essentially guesses , not " actionable " intelligence .
A longtime American counterterrorism analyst explained to me , " There is very limited collection on him personally . "
That 's intelligence community shorthand for the fact that the usual avenues of " collection " on a target such as bin Laden are yielding little or no information about him .
Those avenues typically include signal intercepts of phone calls and e-mails , as well as human intelligence from spies .
Given the hundreds of billions of dollars that the " war on terror " has consumed , the failure to capture or kill al Qaeda 's leader is one of its signal failures .
Does it even matter whether bin Laden is found ?
Yes , it does .
First , there is the matter of justice for the almost 3,000 people who died in the September 11 attacks and for the thousands of other victims of al Qaeda 's attacks around the world .
Second , every day that bin Laden remains at liberty is a propaganda victory for al Qaeda .
Third , although bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al - Zawahiri are n't managing al Qaeda 's operations on a daily basis they guide the overall direction of the jihadist movement around the world , even while they are in hiding .
Those messages from al Qaeda 's leaders have reached untold millions worldwide via television , the Internet and newspapers .
The tapes have not only instructed al Qaeda 's followers to continue to kill Westerners and Jews , but some also carried specific instructions that militant cells then acted on .
In March 2008 , for instance , the al Qaeda leader denounced the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in a Danish newspaper as a " catastrophe " for which punishment would soon be meted out .
Three months later , an al Qaeda suicide attacker bombed the Danish Embassy in Islamabad , killing six .
Some reading this may think :
But what 's the proof that the al Qaeda leader is still alive ?
Plenty .
Since September 11 , bin Laden has released a slew of video and audiotapes , many of which discuss current events .
After a nine - month silence , for instance , bin Laden released a 22 - minute audiotape on March 14 , sharply condemning the recent Israeli invasion of Gaza .
Are these tapes real ?
Not one of the dozens of tapes released by bin Laden after 9/11 has been a fake .
Indeed the U.S. government has authenticated many of them using bin Laden 's distinctive voiceprint .
And what about the persistent reports that he is ill ?
In 2002 , Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said bin Laden had kidney disease , for which he required a dialysis machine , and was therefore likely dead .
But the stories of bin Laden 's life - threatening kidney problems are false , judging by his appearance in videos that he released in 2004 and again in 2007 , in which he showed no signs of illness .
On the 2007 tape , the al Qaeda leader had even dyed his white - flecked beard black , suggesting that as the Saudi militant entered his fifth decade , he was not immune to a measure of vanity about his personal appearance .
In fact , bin Laden looked much better in those videos than he did in the video he released shortly after the battle of Tora Bora in late 2001 , where he had narrowly escaped being killed in a massive American attack .
The situation is further complicated by the fact that bin Laden and al - Zawahiri are almost certainly hiding out in the tribal areas of Pakistan , on the Afghan border .
Arthur Keller , a CIA officer who ran a spy network in Pakistan 's tribal areas in 2006 , told me the problems of working in the region : " It 's an incredibly remote area .
They 're hiding in a sea of people that are very xenophobic of outsiders , so it 's a very , very tough nut to crack . "
An additional factor operating in bin Laden 's favor is the personal popularity he has long enjoyed in Pakistan .
Three years after the September 11 attacks , for instance , a Pew poll found that al Qaeda 's leader had a 65 percent favorability rating among Pakistanis .
However , it is clear from the videos of bin Laden and al - Zawahiri that aired in the years since the attacks that they are not living in caves .
In those tapes , both men's clothes were clean and well - pressed .
Caves generally do n't have laundry facilities .
And the videos that they have released are well - lit and well - shot productions , suggesting access either to electrical outlets or to generators to run lights .
Al - Zawahiri is often filmed in a library setting , and on one of his videos from March 2006 , there are curtains clearly visible behind him , suggesting that the tape was shot in a house .
By early 2008 , the Bush administration had tired of the Pakistani government 's unwillingness or inability to take out al Qaeda 's leaders , and in July , the president authorized Special Operations forces to carry out ground assaults in the tribal regions without the permission of the Pakistani government .
But in the face of the intense Pakistani opposition to American boots on the ground , the Bush administration chose to rely instead on drones to target suspected al Qaeda and Taliban leaders .
Bush ordered the CIA to expand its attacks with Predator and Reaper drones .
Between July 2008 and this month , U.S. drones have killed dozens of lower - ranking militants and at least 10 mid- and upper - level leaders within al Qaeda or the Taliban .
This strategy seems to have worked , at least in terms of combating the ability of al Qaeda to plan or carry out attacks in the West .
Law - enforcement authorities have uncovered no serious plots against U.S. or European targets that were traceable to militants who had received training in Pakistan 's tribal regions after the drone program had been dramatically ramped up there .
The increased pace of the American drone attacks in Pakistani 's tribal areas was motivated in part by the hope that it would increase panicked communications among the militants , which might help pinpoint the locations of the top leaders in al Qaeda or the Taliban , but that approach has not paid off when it comes to bin Laden .
If killing bin Laden with a drone has proved difficult , so too will be capturing him alive .
His former bodyguard Abu Jandal told Al Quds al Arabi newspaper , " Sheikh Osama gave me a pistol .
...
The pistol had only two bullets , for me to kill Sheikh Osama with in case we were surrounded or he was about to fall into the enemy 's hands , so that he would not be caught alive "
Should bin Laden be captured or killed , that would probably trigger a succession battle within al Qaeda .
While al - Zawahiri is the deputy leader of the terror group and therefore technically bin Laden 's successor , he is not regarded as a natural leader .
Indeed , even among his fellow Egyptian militants , al - Zawahiri is seen as a divisive force , and so he is unlikely to be able to step into the role of leader of al Qaeda and of the world jihadist movement that is occupied by bin Laden .
By the law of averages , eventually , bin Laden will be captured or killed .
Yet the ideological movement that he helped spawn -- " Binladenism " -- will live on long after he is gone .
That is bin Laden 's legacy .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen .

ACTUAL POST !
I was going to write a long post about how fucking tragic it is that America embraces lowest common denominator comedy but I think I nailed it with my early synopsis : Basically Jeff Dunham has a show where incredibly racist puppets do incredibly racist things .
If he were actually funny , I would n’t be offended at all .
It ’s lazy comedy and it sucks .
I remember watching this guy in the 90’s when I was a kid and … yes , I admit I wanted to be a ventriloquist [ dodges all the things you are throwing at my head place ] .
At the time he had his main fuzzy green monkey muppet , Peanut , and the jalapeno pepper - on - a - stick guy .
When I was 11 the fact that the pepper character was sleepy and lazy and slow witted did n’t really register with me .
Growing up in SE
Texas the only Mexicans I knew about were cartoon mice with sombreros .
The seeds of lazy racist comedy were there 15 years ago .
Now his line up of co-starts consists of : Aforementioned green fuzz monkey guy , old guy , lazy mexican food stuff , black pimp with gold chains , dumb ass white redneck Nascar dude ( psst… America , he ’s making fun of YOU ) and THE CORPSE OF A DEAD FUCKING MUSLIM TERRORIST !
WTF !?
I just … I have no idea .
It is n’t his racist , no - effort comedy that offends me .
It ’s the fact that it works ; that America loves it .
What a waste of LOLS .

This is an unofficial list of Problem Banks .
Changes and comments from surferdude808 :
Since last week , the Unofficial Problem Bank List shrank by a net three institutions to 460 .
Aggregate assets decreased slightly to $ 297.8 billion from $ 298.6 billion .
New additions include two Cease & Desist orders issued by the OTS against Lincoln FSB of Nebraska , Lincoln ( $ 371.3 m ) and Waterfield Bank , Germantown , MD ( $ 217.3 m ) .
Also , the Federal Reserve issued a Prompt Corrective Action order against San Joaquin Bank , Bakersfield , CA ( $ 832.8 m ) on October 5th , which was has been operating under a Cease & Desist order since April 9 , 2009 .
The removals include the failures last Friday – Warren Bank , Jennings State Bank , and Southern Colorado National Bank .
The OCC terminated a Formal Agreement against Pacific National Bank , Miami , FL on September 29th .
The other deletion was Venture Bank which was misidentified with the bank of the same name based out of Washington that failed on September 11th .
We were notified of the error by a reader and greatly appreciate the assistance in maintaining the accuracy of this list .
The FDIC assigns classification codes indicating an institution 's charter type ( commercial bank , savings bank , or savings association ) , its chartering agent ( state or federal government ) , its Federal Reserve membership status ( member or nonmember ) , and its primary federal regulator ( state - chartered institutions are subject to both federal and state supervision ) .
These codes are : N National chartered commercial bank supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

With all due respect to the seminar room , the boardroom , the hearing room and the Oval Office , a better vantage point than any of them for evaluating and redesigning our health care system is the hospital room ( window bed , please ) .
The chair next to the bed is n’t bad , either .
Some of us perch on one or the other almost every day , observing the tangled mess that is our current system and mentally designing a dozen better alternatives .
But for those who wind up in bed or a chair only when tragedy strikes , T. R. Reid ’s new book provides an excellent substitute perspective .
Mr. Reid , a veteran foreign correspondent for The Washington Post , knows from personal experience that there are indeed a dozen better alternatives .
International postings from London to Japan familiarized him with many of the world ’s health care systems .
Then a chronic shoulder problem offered the opportunity for an unusually well - controlled experiment : Mr. Reid decided to present his stiff shoulder for treatment around the world .
One shoulder , 10 countries .
Admittedly it ’s a gimmick , but what saves the book from slumping into a sack of anecdotes like Michael Moore ’s 2007 documentary “ Sicko ” is a steel backbone of health policy analysis that manages to trap immensely complicated concepts in crystalline prose .
THOMAS KELLER cooked his father ’s last meal .
He had only recently come to know Ed Keller , a towering former Marine drill sergeant who left his family when Thomas Keller , the youngest of five boys , was just 5 years old .
When they finally reunited decades later , father and son liked each other so much that in 2006 Ed Keller moved from Pennsylvania into a house next door to the French Laundry , the restaurant in Yountville , Calif. , where his son had made his name as a chef .
He quickly became a fixture around town , a real character who would show up at 8 a.m. every day to tell stories to his son ’s staff and customers at the nearby Bouchon Bakery .
In the afternoons , he would drink wine in the French Laundry garden .
Catch him in the right mood and he would even help you get into the reservation book .
For a few great years , Mr. Keller finally knew what it meant to have a dad around .
“ Just to sit with your father and have a beer and smoke a cigar , that is really important , ” Mr. Keller said .
Now that people have finally realized ethanol is a government - run , unscientific boondoggle , efforts are under way to make legitimate biofuels efficient enough for mass usage .
Microalgae are monocellular , plant - like organisms that use photosynthesis and convert carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) into biomass .
From this biomass , both potential resources and active substances as well as fuels like biodiesel may be produced .
While growing , algae take up the amount of CO2 that is later released again when they are used for energy production .
Hence , energy from algae could potentially be produced in a CO2 - neutral manner contrary to fossil fuels or current biofuels .
Apart from CO2 - neutral closed loop management , algae have an - other advantage : Industrial CO2 emissions may be used as a " re-source " , as algae grow faster at high carbon dioxide concentrations and , hence , produce more biomass for energy production .
Newly developed plate reactor for optimum light management in the cultivation of microalgae at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology .
Photo by : Florian LehrHowever , this is not their only advantage : " Compared to land plants , algae produce five times as much biomass per hectare and contain 30 to 40 % oil usable for energy production " , says Professor Clemens Posten , who directs this research activity at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology ( KIT ) Institute of Life Science Engineering .
As the algae may also be cultivated in arid i.e. dry , areas not suited for agriculture , there is hardly any competition with agricultural areas .
There , however , closed systems are required .
For energy production from microalgae , KIT scientists are developing closed photo - bioreactors and novel cell disruption methods .
Presently , algae are being produced in open ponds in southern countries of relatively small productivity .
This is where Posten 's new technology starts .
" In terms of process technology , our approach is completely different , as we are working with closed photobioreactors " , underlines the scientist .
" Our plants convert solar energy into biomass , the efficiency being five times higher than that in open ponds . "
The plates in usual photo - bioreactors are arranged verti-cally .
" Every alga sees a little bit less light , but the plant is operated at increased efficiency " , emphasizes the biologist and electrical engineer .
Modern designs under investigation will find more intelligent ways to light distribution .
Consequently , algae production does not only work in countries with an extremely high solar irradiation .
Most algae need a maximum of ten percent of the incident sunlight intensity .
According to Posten , the remaining fraction would just be wasted , if light management in the photobioreactor would not be optimum .
Posten points out that the Sahara offers just twice as much sun as Central Europe .
But there , the reactor contents would have to be cooled .
Other advantages of the closed system are drastic savings of water and fertilizers .
Double use of algae for the production of food or fine chemicals and subsequent energy production from the residualbiomass may also be conceivable .
Posten 's institute hosts one of the two KIT working groups focusing on research in the field of algae biotechnology .
" As far as the development of photobioreactors is concerned , we are among the three locations worldwide , where considerable progress is being achieved in both process technology and biology " , explains Posten .
The stop of his research area on the southern KIT campus marks the starting point of research conducted by the Institute for Pulsed Power and Microwave Technology on the northern campus of the KIT .
Here , it is focused on extracting the valuable constituents of the algae biomass by an electric pulsed treatment .
So far , Dr. Georg Müller , head of this institute 's Pulsed Power Technology Division , has studied the decomposition of plant cells of olives , grapes , apples , sugar beets , and terrestrial energy plants in cooperation with partners from research and industry .
Partly , large - scale facilities were constructed .
" It is our objective to develop new economically efficient and sustainable extraction methods to obtain a maximum amount of cell constituents from the algae that can be used for energy production " , says Müller .
" The plant cells are exposed to a high electric field for a very short term .
This causes a perforation of the cell membrane and the constituents are released .
" Cooperation of both working groups now aims at bundling the existing know - how , with starting funds being provided by the KIT Energy Center .
It is planned to establish a KIT " Algae Platform " for energy production from microalgae .
In the medium term , pilot - scale and demonstration plants shall be built on the northern KIT campus , with the favorable conditions in terms of space and infrastructure being made use of .
" This will represent a major node in the presently rather rapid networking of algae biotechnology " , emphasizes Posten .
To make energy production from algae economically efficient , it will be focused on minimizing investment and operation costs of photobioreactors and on developing highly efficient processes for the harvesting and decomposition of algae .
To close the cycle for the complete use of algae biomass for energy production , KIT researchers even go another step forwards .
The biomass remaining after extraction ( 60 – 70 % ) is planned to be con-verted into other energy carriers like hydrogen or methane by means of the hydrothermal gasification process developed on the northern campus .
At BofA and AIG close to a majority of the top executives whose salaries were to be cut have already left .
Nuff said .
" There 's no question people have left because of uncertainty of our ability to pay , " said an executive at one of the affected firms .
" It 's a highly competitive market out there . "
At Bank of America , for instance , only 14 of the 25 highly paid executives remained by the time Feinberg announced his decision .
Under his plan , compensation for the most highly paid employees at the bank would be a maximum of $ 9.9 million .
The bank had sought permission to pay as much as $ 21 million , according to Treasury Department documents .
At American International Group , only 13 people of the top 25 were still on hand for Feinberg 's decision .

Powerslides are the coolest and fastest way to stop on skateboards .
A powerslide is executed when you are skating along , sometimes pretty fast , and spin your board to the side and skid to a stop .
It 's very similar to how you stop on a snowboard , except that if you mess up , you eat concrete or pavement instead of snow !
Most people have a hard time learning to powerslide , but it 's extremely valuable .
Imagine being able to stop immediately — you can use the powerslide to keep yourself from getting into traffic , to prevent running into someone and to stop with style .
01 of 04 Powerslide Setup Powerslide . ( Jamie O'Clock )
Before learning to powerslide , you need to :
Be comfortable with skating in general , confident with riding your board , and have good balance .
Be able to kickturn .
The powerslide is a tough move to learn , and until you get it right , learning can be pretty painful !
If you are a new skater , we recommend first learning to footbreak to stop , then learn to powerslide a little later when you feel more confident .
But once you 're ready , powerslides are easily the fastest and coolest way to stop .
You can use powerslides on regular skateboards , longboards , when flying down hills , and in skateparks on transition .
Read all the instructions before you go out and try it — make sure that you have a strong , clear mental picture of what it should look like .
The better you can visualize it before you try it , the better your powersliding will be !

Powerslides are one of those things that are easy to explain , but hard to do correctly !
First , you should be skating along at a pretty comfortable speed .
You can't be going too slow — go as fast as you can while you still feel like you have control .
For practice , try to find a place that 's very flat and smooth .
Concrete is usually best .
Once you have a good speed going , position your feet so that you have one over each truck .
03 of 04 The Turn ( M M / Flickr / CC BY - SA 2.0 )
Now , shift most of your weight to your front foot .
Slide your back wheels around 90 degrees , making your board horizontal underneath you .
The easiest way to explain the action of the slide is to straighten out your back leg while sliding it out to the side .
It 's important to understand that you need to drag , or slide , those back wheels around .
They need to be touching the ground .
Do n't just do a kickturn or it wo n't work ; you 'll end up either flying off to the side or just wiping out .
Once your board is sideways , lean back a bit .
Push out with your feet , sliding the board along the ground .
As your speed is spent in the slide , you will stop and should end up just standing on your stopped board !
The first several times you try to powerslide , you might need to do some kickturns to keep your balance , but the goal is to get to the point that you wo n't need to at all .
Many would say that hope for meaningful health care reform ended this week with the apparent demise of President Obama 's " public " option .
In reality , meaningful reform died many months ago when Obama took single payer reform " off the table " and along with it the American people lost their chance to learn about the only system that could maintain high quality care at an affordable price for everyone .
Instead , President Obama gave the American people mandated insurance and a " public " option .
Mandated insurance was a " bone " that he threw to the insurance industry in hopes it would allow his " public " option to survive .
In this Mr. Obama greatly underestimated the influence that the insurance and pharmaceutical lobbyists have over Congress and not surprisingly the public option , if it survives , will be in a form so emasculated that its impact on reform will be minimal at best .
President Obama needed to take his case for reform directly to the American people as most members of Congress , dependent as they are on powerful lobbyists for their political survival , are incapable of promoting real change .
By promoting halfway measures and policies of appeasement President Obama was incapable of capturing the hearts and minds of the American people who could have provided the backbone allowing members of Congress to stand up to the powerful interests vested in the status quo .
Not unexpectedly , when the forces of greed and avarice unleashed their vigilantes at town hall meetings the average American had no solid ground of reform to stand on and were incapable of mounting a counterattack .
Obama once advocated for single payer reform , but presumably , he believes it can not be won politically .
In this he vastly underestimates the American people and the beauty of the single payer system .
The forces aligned against single payer totally rely on fear mongering and deception .
They are easily countered by the reality that our own Medicare , a single payer system for the elderly , has been highly successful and universally appreciated .
Why not expand its services to include all basic health care needs and include everyone ?
The logic is simple and compelling and when it is revealed that it is less expensive than our present system , there is really no logical rebuttal .
The cries against " socialized " medicine would have been easily squelched by our veterans whose needs have been met admirably by our government - run Veterans Affairs .
It would be interesting to see how far an anti-reformist would get in explaining to VFW members that we should dissemble their VA health care system because it might lead to communism .
The hope for real reform has been for the moment lost at the federal level .
Perhaps that hope can be rekindled at the state level where Pennsylvania HB 1660 and SB 300 await the embrace of legislators who care more for their constituents ' well - being than political advancement and cold ideology .
Bankruptcy and denial of care for pre-existing conditions do n't make the national news , but they are realities that many of our fellow citizens endure because our health care system cares more about profits than public welfare .
This needs to change , and a single payer publicly financed , privately delivered system is the only reform we can truly believe in .

In the search for extraterrestrial life , some scientists say we 're focusing too much on finding signs of existence as we know it , and in the process , we may be missing more strange forms of life that do n't rely on water or carbon metabolism .
Now researchers from Austria have started a systematic study of solvents other than water that might be able to support life outside our planet .
They 're hoping their research will lead to a shift in what they call the " geocentric mindset " of our attempts to detect extraterrestrial life .
" With our current measurement strategy for life on other planets , we will only be able to detect life which shares most of its parameters with terrestrial life , " astrobiologist Johannes Leitner of the University of Vienna , who presented his research Friday at the European Planetary Science Congress in Germany , wrote in an e-mail .
" Presently we will not be able to detect exotic life , because we have no idea of its potential properties and by this , our probes to planetary surfaces do not carry instruments which can look for something exotic . "
For instance , Leitner said , we can send rovers to Mars carrying antibodies that detect traces of chemicals and bacteria that would indicate life .
But because we can only make antibodies to known substances , this method will be limited to finding Earth - like life .
" When we try to find a definition for life , in most cases , such a definition is more a summary of the specific properties of terrestrial life , " Leitner said .
Because life on Earth requires water , most of the search for extraterrestrial life thus far has focused on the " habitable zone , " or the relatively narrow region around a star where liquid water could exist .
But while water is liquid only between zero and 100 degrees Celsius , other solvents are liquid over a much larger temperature range .
For instance , because ammonia stays liquid at a lower temperature , an ocean of ammonia could exist on a planet much further from its host star .
By exploring the properties of more potential solvents , such as sulfuric acid and formamide , the researchers hope to expand the potential life - supporting zone .
The Austrian researchers are certainly not the first to consider the possibility of exotic life supported by a solvent other than water .
According to Ariel Anbar , head of the astrobiology program at Arizona State University , the idea dates back to at least 1954 , when J.B.S.
Haldane speculated that ammonia might be able to sustain life at a symposium on the origin of life .
" The notion of alternative solvents is certainly plausible , though entirely unproven , " Anbar wrote in an e-mail .
But because life as we do n't know it is so hard to study , he said the topic has received less attention than it deserves .
Leitner 's team is starting its search for exotic life by investigating the thermal and biochemical properties of potential solvents , especially focusing on each substance 's ability to support a non-carbon - based metabolism .
" We know , for instance , that a carbon - oxygen - based metabolism simply wo n't work in an ammonia or sulfuric acid solvent , " Leitner said in a press release .
" If life exists in the Venusian atmosphere , it probably wo n't work in the same way as life on Earth . "
For now , Anbar says our search for extraterrestrial life is limited more by our access to extraterrestrial environments than by our conception of what life might look like .
" However , as we plan future missions to Mars and elsewhere , especially Titan , " he said , " and as we begin to consider the prospects for life in the solar systems other than our own that are being discovered at a rapid pace , it 's important to begin thinking about ' weird life ' so that we do n't miss something under our noses .

Sad News & an Uplifting Declaration
I have received a report from N. Innaiah , Chairman of CFI India , and M. Subba Rao , concerning the condition of our colleague Basava Premanand , the revered and justly famous Indian rationalist with whom I have had the honor to be associated for many decades .
Premanand is the publisher of " The Indian Skeptic , " a journal devoted to exposing the tricks of such frauds as Sai Baba , who is worshiped as a living god by countless naifs around the world .
The excellent documentary film " Guru Busters " by British film maker Robert Eagle shows Premanand and his crew zealously exposing supposedly supernatural stunts such as levitation , flesh - piercing and live burials .
Premanand is now hospitalized with a terminal condition , his friends are caring for him , but he's not lost any of his zeal or determination to maintain his rational philosophy .
The report says , concerning a hospital visit :
He was quite drowsy and not responding to queries until I told him that there was a rumor that he has started believing in god and supernatural powers .
He opened his eyes and said , " Who says that ? " and that was the clear indication that , however ill we may continue to hold onto our convictions !
He said , " That is nonsense ! "
So , I told him that we should say so to the world , and he agreed .
The statement reproduced herein was put for his signature .
But , his hands were weak and hence we had to take his thumb impression , too .
The declaration has been witnessed by Dr. Maya Prabhu , his sister , and Suneera , one of his admirers who has been taking care of him .
Our movement is not based on individuals but , those who are in the forefront are ever in the public eye and particularly in the sights of those who want to attack us .
They would like to spread rumors that eminent rationalists have changed on their death bed , have gone back to god and spiritualism , etc .
We do not want to give any occasion for such rumors and hence , though it may sound morbid , I had this task .
I would like that to be done to me when I am on my death bed so that all can know that we hold on to our convictions whatever the circumstances may be .
This short report is a bulletin on the health of one of those who have inspired a whole generation and have done significant work to build up the movement .
As and when news is received I shall make more such communications .
TO WHOMSOEVER IT MAY CONCERN
Declaration of attitude and temperament
I , B. Premanand son of the late Sri Basava Prabhu , 80 years of age , resident of Chettipalayam Road , Podanur , sound of mind though suffering from physical complications caused by metastases in many organs caused by carcinoma of the stomach , herein solemnly wish to place on record the following :
1 . I have been closely associated with the rationalist movement from 1975 onwards and have been a rationalist of full conviction since then and continue to be so .
2 . It is common for the purveyors of superstitions and such anti-rational forces to start spreading rumors about rationalists turning to god and other supernatural forces at the end of their lives and becoming devotees of gods and god men of various types .
3 . It is also claimed that at times of crises that we staunch rationalists through the major part of our lives , turn to spiritualism and religion .
4 . I wish to clarify that as on today the twentieth of September , 2009 , I remain a staunch rationalist and wish to place on record the following :
a. I continue to be a rationalist of full conviction .
b. I do not believe in any supernatural power .
All the powers that we encounter are in the realm of nature and nothing exists beyond that .
c. I do not believe in the existence of the soul or rebirth .
d. I have not turned to any religion , god , or any sort of spiritual pursuits .
e . When I pass away I shall be leaving only my body which is to be donated to a medical college and no spirit or soul to cause problems for the living .
I want to convey to all that the struggle against the exploitation by god men and so - called supernatural forces , is a long and hard one but the ultimate victory will be ours .
My very survival has been a challenge to astrologers and their so - called " science " of astrology , as they had all predicted that I would die soon after birth and refused to cast a horoscope for me .
I wish to convey to my colleagues of the rationalist movement to continue the work that I have been doing with renewed vigor and that will be the best of tributes for me .
The declaration is signed and thumb - printed by this noble warrior ...
What could I possibly add ?
Oligarchies often seal themselves off from public opinion .
Only rarely do they rebel , actively and scornfully , against the people they are meant to serve .
David Wilshire , the retiring Tory MP for Spelthorne who paid £ 105,500 of his allowances to a company owned by him and his girlfriend , reportedly claims that his pay per hour “ comes dangerously close to working out as the minimum wage . ”
The Labour backbencher Alan Simpson says he will not repay £ 500 for cleaning bills .
Others rumble that their written dealings with the fees office have the force of contract and that Sir Thomas cannot override them .
Sir Christopher Kelly ’s separate review of the rules governing expenses is not due to be published until November 4 , yet the whispering campaign against it has already begun .
Yesterday , The Daily Telegraph revealed that 27 MPs are under investigation by HM Revenue and Customs over possible breaches of tax law .
Could it be worse ?
WASHINGTON ( AP )  Iranian authorities this week allowed a Swiss diplomat a second visit with three detained American hikers arrested for illegal entry near the Iraq border in late July , the State Department said Friday .
Spokesman Robert Wood said the Swiss ambassador to Iran was granted consular access to Shane Bauer , Sarah Shourd and Josh Fattal on Thursday " after repeated requests . "
He provided no details , citing privacy concerns but the families of the hikers said in a statement they were in " good physical shape . "
They said the 40 - minute visit was held at Evin Prison in Tehran , where the three are being held , and that the Swiss ambassador had brought them clothes and other supplies , including books and writing paper .
The Swiss , who represent U.S. interests in Iran , were first allowed to visit the trio in late September .
" Today marks exactly three months since our children were detained , and we urge the Iranian authorities to let our children speak to us directly , " the families said .
" Every time our telephones ring , we hope they it is them calling to tell us they 've been released . "
" Shane , Sarah and Josh went hiking at the height of summer , and they had very few clothes , since they had planned to be on vacation for only a week , " they said .
" It 's hard to believe it 's now almost the winter , and they still have n't been released .
We see no reason why Iranian authorities continue to hold them . "
Bauer , Shourd and Fattal were arrested July 31 after straying over the Iranian border while hiking in northern Iraq .
All are graduates of the University of California , Berkeley .
The U.S. government and their families have appealed for their release , saying they were vacationing and did not mean to cross the border .

The truly mean Gumpert Apollo Sport has powered its way to a Nürburgring lap time of 7:11.57 , simultaneously setting the fastest lap for a production road - legal car and embarrassing the competition .

This number is an eleven - second improvement over the the Dodge Viper SRT10 ACR and Corvette ZR1 times , and a full 15 seconds over the Nissan GT - R VSpec time .

This feat was accomplished with the help of the Gumpert 's 700 HP Audi turbo V8 and one skilled driver ( 26 - year - old Florian Gruber ) last week .
The Apollo Sport has n't officially been released , but with a lap time like this and a top speed of 224 MPH we imagine they wo n't have a hard time finding buyers .
( Hat tip to YellowDucati for the tip ! )

Inquiring minds are wondering about the possibility of " pent - up " inflation from the massive expansion money supply by the Fed .
Our search for the truth starts with the question " Which Comes First : The Printing or The Lending ? "
This is a critical question given the massive expansion of base money by the Fed as shown in the following chart .
Base Money Supply
Since the beginning of the recession , the Fed has expanded base money supply from $ 800 billion to $ 1.7 trillion .
Conventional wisdom suggests this money is going to come soaring into the economy at any second causing hyperinflation on the notion banks will lend out 10 times the amount of reserves .
So is this pent - up inflation just waiting to break out ?
Hardly .
A funny thing happened to the inflation theory : Banks are n't lending and proof can be found in excess reserves at member banks .
Excess Reserves
Banks are Insolvent , Consumers Tapped Out
Because of rising credit card defaults , commercial real estate defaults , foreclosures , walk - aways , and other bad debts , banks need those reserves to cover future losses .
In practice , banks are insolvent , unable or unwilling to lend .
Moreover , tapped out consumers are unable or unwilling to borrow .
As a result , Spending Collapses In All Generation Groups .
Bernanke can flood the world with " reserves " and indeed he has .
However , he cannot force banks to lend or consumers to borrow .
Yet every day someone comes up with another convoluted theory about how inflationary this all is .
It is certainly " distortionary " in that it creates problems down the road and prolongs a real recovery by keeping zombie banks alive ( as happened in Japan ) .
However , it is not ( in aggregate ) going to cause massive inflation because it is not spurring the creation of new debt .
Consumers and banks both are suffering from a massive hangover .
Their willingness and ability to drink is gone .
No matter how many pints of whiskey Bernanke sets in front of someone passed out on the floor , liquor sales will not rise .
In a debt - based economy , it is extremely difficult to produce inflation if consumers will not participate .
And as noted above , demographics and attitudes strongly suggest consumers have had enough of debt and spending sprees .
Those pointing to flawed measures of money supply as proof of inflation just do n't get it , and likely never will .
Banks Lend , Reserves Come Later
Steve Keen On the Edge
Did The Government Rescue The System ?
In explaining his recovery program in April , President Obama noted that :
“ there are a lot of Americans who understandably think that government money would be better spent going directly to families and businesses instead of banks – ‘ where ’s our bailout ? , ’ they ask ” .
He justified giving the money to the lenders , rather than to the debtors , on the basis of “ the multiplier effect ” from bank lending :
" The truth is that a dollar of capital in a bank can actually result in eight or ten dollars of loans to families and businesses , a multiplier effect that can ultimately lead to a faster pace of economic growth . "
This argument comes straight out of the neoclassical economics textbook .
Fortunately , due to the clear manner in which Obama enunciates it , the flaw in this textbook argument is vividly apparent in his speech .
This “ multiplier effect ” will only work if American families and businesses are willing to take on yet more debt : “ a dollar of capital in a bank can actually result in eight or ten dollars of loans ” .
So the only way the roughly US $ 1 trillion of money that the Federal Reserve has injected into the banks will result in additional spending is if American families and businesses take out another US $ 8 - 10 trillion in loans .
What are the odds that this will happen , when they already owe more than they have ever owed in the history of America ?
If the money multiplier was going to “ ride to the rescue ” , private debt would need to rise from its current level of US $ 41.5 trillion to about US $ 50 trillion , and this ratio would rise to about 375 % — more than twice the level that ushered in the Great Depression .
Obama has been sold a pup by neoclassical economics : not only did neoclassical theory help cause the crisis , by championing the growth of private debt and the asset bubbles it financed ; it also is undermining efforts to reduce the severity of the crisis .
This is unfortunately the good news : the bad news is that this model only considers an economy undergoing a “ credit crunch ” , and not also one suffering from a serious debt overhang that only a direct reduction in debt can tackle .
That is our actual problem , and while a stimulus will work for a while , the drag from debt - deleveraging is still present .
The economy will therefore lapse back into recession soon after the stimulus is removed .
Since Obama became President - and yes , I voted for him - there has been a great deal of optimism and energy around the idea that the Internet can be used to improve or " reboot " our democracy .
The Administration has hired some great people to work on making government more open and transparent .
This is all great .
But how much good will all of this nifty e-government do for American democracy if citizens ' rights to privacy and free expression are not also fiercely defended ?
On that score , the Obama Administration has been dangerously disappointing .
This month 's news makes me feel like the U.S. is getting more like China in some ways .
A man who was using Twitter to help coordinate G20 protests in Pittsburgh was arrested and had his home searched because he posted information about police movements on Twitter .
For more on that story see the New York Times , Democracy Now ( with a video interview of Elliot Madison and his lawyer ) , the Huffington Post , the CDT 's Policy Beta blog , and the Digitaldumonde blog .
The FTC has released new commercial endorsement guidelines for anybody who ever posts anything online , be it on a blog , Facebook , Twitter , Amazon reviews , or wherever ( except professional journalists who are exempt thanks to the First Amendment which seems only to apply to some Americans these days ) .
While the guidelines are well intentioned and aim to promote honesty in product promotion and protect consumers on the Internet , they are so broad and vaguely worded that they could only be enforced selectively and unfairly .
As Salon 's Jack Shafer describes them : " They are written so broadly that if you blog about a good and service in such a way that the FTC construes as an endorsement , the commission has a predicate to investigate . "
What 's more : " As I read the guidelines , the FTC could investigate you if you did disclose but it was not satisfied with the disclosure . "
See more critques from Dan Gillmor , Jeff Jarvis , the LA Times , and Jeff Bercovici at Daily Finance .
As free speech activists living in authoritarian countries like China - or even pseudo - authoritarian pseudo - democracies like Singapore - will readily tell you , over - broad and vague regulations of speech are dangerous because there 's no way to enforce them uniformly or fairly .
So authorities enforce them selectively based on often arbitrary and generally un-transparent criteria .
Such regulations become a great umbrella excuse to stifle speech that powerful people do n't like for whatever reason .
Over - broad regulations also have a chilling effect on speech because people tend to over - compensate in order to avoid trouble .
Then there 's the matter of the media shield bill currently before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
The idea is to pass a law that would protect journalists who refuse to divulge their confidential sources in federal court .
It was bad enough that the definition of " journalist " has now excluded citizen media , bloggers , and student journalists completely .
Even worse , the White House has now proposed changes to the bill that would substantially weaken professional reporters ' protections .
As the New York Times editorial page points out , so much for Obama 's promise of transparency :
At the heart of the disagreement is the balance between national security and the public ’s right to know .
The best approach is to protect legitimate security claims while rejecting those that are made in the name of national security but are really aimed at avoiding embarrassment .
That was the constant cry from the Bush administration as the public learned — through the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information — of prisoner abuse , secret C.I.A. prisons for terrorist suspects and warrantless wiretapping .
The Senate bill and a measure passed earlier in the House aim at a reasonable balance by relying on a federal judge to decide when security is not truly at risk and sources must be protected .
The White House proposals would instruct judges to defer to the administration ’s view of when and if a news leak presents a “ significant ” security leak .
The executive branch would arrogate power to decide the public ’s right to know by crimping the news media ’s ability to make a case for disclosure .
If you want to create a chilling effect against any sort of whistleblowing on gov't corruption , that 's what this proposal does .
It basically lets the gov't say that the shield law only applies to whistleblowing that does n't make the administration look bad .
But , in any case where the administration is n't happy , it gets to wipe out the shield .
Apparently , freedom of the press only applies to situations in which the administration is not embarrassed .
As Michael Masnick at Tech Dirt puts it
Dan Thomasson at Scripps Howard puts it this way : " Now it seems the president also has decided the people 's right to know might not be all that beneficial to him or them .
" Last but not least , there 's the USA PATRIOT
Act ( full text here ) , which in 2001 expanded the government 's powers to spy on American citizens in the course of anti-terror and criminal investigations .
Three of its key provisions are up for reauthorization this year , and the Senate Judiciary Committee will be considering them today ( Thursday U.S. time ) .
The Economist 's Democracy in America blog has an excellent summary of the current state of play , which I take the liberty to quote at great length :
For updates on Thursday 's developments , a liveblog of the proceedings , and information about how to take action , visit the Patriot Act Action Hub .
For very detailed background read the last eight posts or so on Marcy Wheeler 's Empty Wheel blog .
She will also be live - blogging on Thursday .
Also see Glenn Greenwald 's
The joint Post / Obama defense of the Patriot Act and FISA for a critique of some of the lap - doggish mainstream media coverage on the issue , and a rebuttal of Fox news coverage by Cato 's Julian Sanchez .
I 'm worried that most liberals and progressives have stopped paying attention and are just assuming everything will work out ok now that " our guy " is in office .
I was tremendously excited about Obama 's candidacy .
I was jubilant when he got elected .
I do n't see myself turning Republican any time in this lifetime , but if the Obama Administration does n't start showing a bit more concern for American civil liberties - putting aside for the moment the question of whether he cares about anybody else 's - I 'm going to start wishing for a viable third party with a meaningful civil liberties and human rights platform .

Outsource Method Review
I just purchased Outsource Method , a new program by Daniel Turner and Marc Lindsay , and I have to say that so far I m incredibly impressed , and I m really excited to start implementing the techniques Ive learned thus far .
( Please note , I used Outsource Method when it had a $ 1 trial period .
The current price for membership is $ 995 , which may seem steep , but because you are given so much information , Outsource Method is still worth consideration . )
I have been looking at outsourcing techniques for a while now because to be perfectly honest , working a full - time job and then working another four to six hours each night on building my online business was becoming quite a drag , both mentally and physically .
While I enjoy writing and site building , if I could outsource the grunt work to other people , I would be freed up to work on marketing and other higher level business activities , not to mention being able to get more beauty rest .
This is where Outsource Method comes in , and walks you though the process of how to outsource the grunt work .
Basically Outsource Method teaches you how to work smarter  not harder  and shows you how to get more results with less effort on your part .
Here are some key things you learn from Outsource Method :
Why outsourcing is critical if you want to grow your business and have free time
How to go about selecting the right people to outsource to
How to put together proposals that get you exactly what you want while saving you time and money
How to successfully pull off your first outsourcing job and where to go from there
If you re anything like me , you have a tough time letting to and assigning  work to other people .
However , since there are only 24 hours in a day , theres really only so much that we can accomplish on our own .
When you add in the fact that most of us small - time internet marketers have regular full - time jobs , families and basic human needs ( like wanting to eat and sleep ) , there s really only a couple hours each day that can be devoted to working on your online business .
Obviously its pretty tough to grow a business if only a couple hours per day are being put into it .
So why not put more time into you business by leveraging the time that you do have so that you can maximize efforts and profits ?
Lets look at this very likely real world scenario :
You only have two hours each day that you can devote to growing your online business , and chances are you re not going to be able to get a lot done in that time .
Maybe youll be able to do some tweaking to your WordPress site , write a new article and then distribute it to Digg , Facebook and Twitter .
Not to sound like a jerk , but that s really not a lot to show for two hours of work .
Now lets look at another very likely scenario , should you choose to begin outsourcing your grunt work :
You only have two hours each day to devote to your online business , but during those two hours you put together a request to have 50 unique articles created for your site ( which youll receive the following day ) , contact a website developer to talk about updating your latest affiliate website , and work with your SEO team to help get another site ranked higher on Google for highly targeted keywords .
In looking at the two scenarios , in which one was more work accomplished ?
In which one did you work the least ?
Hmm get more accomplished while doing less work ?
Sounds pretty smart to me !
Yes , I realize that outsourcing is nt free ; you do in fact have to pay the people that are helping you .
That being said , outsourcing is incredibly cheap , especially when you factor in the dollar value of your own time .
And when being guided by Outsource Method , you re not going to get burned or end up wasting your money .
In fact , after following the lessons in Outsource Method , you re probably going to ask yourself why you didnt start outsourcing work earlier .
Let me leave you with just one more example ( in case you couldnt tell , I m really trying to hammer home the point ) :
I value my own personal time at $ 100 an hour .
That s not too cheap , yet not too expensive .
So , to do those two hours where I slave away at writing a single article and installing some WordPress plugins , I would essentially have to myself $ 200 to do that work .
In the other scenario , where I do far less work and a lot more delegating , I may only have to pay the article writer and my design and SEO teams a total of $ 50 , or roughly $ 25 per hour .
So not only am I working less , but I m actually coming out $ 150 ahead .
One of the oldest facts of business is you dont get rich working for people ; you get rich when people work for you .
Do yourself a favor , check out Outsource Method and finally get the free time  and business growth  you deserve .
Outsource Method Review

In April of 1932 , an unlikely literary débutante published her first book .
Laura Elizabeth Ingalls Wilder was a matron of sixty - five , neat and tiny — about four feet eleven — who was known as Bessie to her husband , Almanzo , and as Mama Bess to her daughter , Rose .
The family lived at Rocky Ridge , a farm in the Ozarks , near Mansfield , Missouri , where Wilder raised chickens and tended an apple orchard .
She also enjoyed meetings of her embroidery circle , and of the Justamere Club , a study group that she helped found .
Readers of The Missouri Ruralist knew her as Mrs. A. J. Wilder , the author of a biweekly column .
Her sensible opinions on housekeeping , marriage , husbandry , country life , and , more rarely , on politics and patriotism were expressed in a plain style , with an occasional ecstatic flourish inspired by her love for “ the sweet , simple things of life which are the real ones after all . ”
A work ethic inherited from her Puritan forebears , which exalted labor and self - improvement not merely for their material rewards but as moral values , was , she believed , the key to happiness .
Mrs. Wilder , however , was n’t entirely happy with her part - time career , or with her obscurity .
In 1930 , she sat down with a supply of sharpened pencils — she did n’t type — to write something more ambitious : an autobiography .
Laura Ingalls married Almanzo Wilder in 1885 .
Their daughter , born a year later , was named for the wild roses on the prairie .
Illustration by Maira Kalman
Laura Ingalls was born in the sylvan wilds near Pepin , Wisconsin , in 1867 , and she grew up on the frontier , in the various log cabins , claim shanties , sod dugouts , and little frame houses that her inveterately restless father , Charles , built for his wife and daughters each time he bundled them into a covered wagon and moved on , mostly westward , in search of an elusive prosperity .
While the Ingallses were living outside the town of De Smet , in what is now South Dakota , Laura met her future husband , a laconic homesteader ten years her senior .
Almanzo Wilder , whom she called Manly , had raised horses as a farm boy in Malone , New York , and he owned the finest team in town — two beautiful brown Morgans .
When De Smet was cut off from supplies by a winter of record cold and relentless blizzards that buried the railroad tracks , he and a friend had risked their lives to buy grain from an outlying farmer who was rumored to have a reserve .
They barely made it back , in a whiteout , but they saved their neighbors from starvation .
Almanzo and Laura started courting when she was fifteen .
By that time , she was helping to support her family by teaching school ( she was younger than some of her students ) and working as a part - time seamstress .
Her elder sister , Mary , had gone blind after an illness diagnosed as “ brain fever , ” which may have been caused by measles or meningitis .
Carrie , the third - born , was thin and sickly .
Grace was the baby .
Laura had always been the sturdy one , pleasant - looking but no beauty , her father ’s favorite , and something of a tomboy who occasionally showed flashes of defiance .
Almanzo was the town hero , and Laura had a rival for his affections , yet she treated him coolly .
After her death , in 1957 , Laura ’s qualms about a life like her mother ’s surfaced in an unpublished manuscript .
Caroline Ingalls was a woman of some education and gentility who had also taught school before marrying a pioneer .
( The only relics of her former life were a treasured figurine — a china shepherdess — and her love of fashion and poetry . )
“ Sweet are the uses of adversity ” was , perhaps by default , her working motto .
She rose before dawn to stoke the fire and boil the bathwater .
She fed her family with whatever she had .
She made all their clothes and linens , recycling the scraps for her patchwork quilts .
She baked the bread , churned the butter , blacked the stove , and restuffed the pallets that they slept on with fresh hay .
Even when it was twenty below , she did the washing for six people , pressing with heavy flatirons laundry that had frozen stiff .
When her husband was away on some urgent survival mission ( Laura recounted how he once walked three hundred miles to find work as a field hand ) , she fetched the wood and pitched feed to the horses , then waited up for his uncertain return , knitting in her rocker .
Informed summarily that she would be packing up , yet again , to start over in a new wilderness , she protested feebly but acquiesced .
Laura waited until she was eighteen , in 1885 , before she agreed to marry Almanzo .
Their daughter arrived a year later .
She was named for the wild roses on the prairie where she was born .
The book business , hard hit by the Depression , was cutting back drastically , and a first draft of Wilder ’s memoir , “ Pioneer Girl , ” was passed over by several agents and publishers , who felt that it lacked drama .
But she persisted — less interested , she later said , in the money than in the prestige of authorship — and when Virginia Kirkus , an editor of children ’s books at Harper & Brothers , received a new version of the material , now recast as a novel aimed at readers between the ages of eight and twelve , she bought it .
That “ juvenile ” ( as such chapter books were quaintly called ) , “ Little House in the Big Woods , ” was the first volume of an American family saga that has since sold about sixty million copies in thirty - three languages .
During last year ’s Presidential campaign , when a journalist from the Times asked Heather Bruce , Sarah Palin ’s sister , about the candidate ’s reading habits as a child in Wasilla , she mentioned only one book , “ Little House on the Prairie , ” the third and best known of the eight novels that Wilder published in her lifetime .
It describes the Ingallses ’ migration from Wisconsin to Kansas , where they build an illegal homestead on land reserved for the Osage tribe , and suffer a series of Job - like tribulations : predation by wolves and panthers , a prairie fire , malaria , blizzards , menacing encounters with the Indians , and a near - fatal well - gas accident .
None of it crushed their spirits or shook their belief in self - reliance , although the story ends on a bitter note — one that Governor Palin might have recalled .
Charles learns from a neighbor that federal troops are coming to evict the settlers .
The “ blasted politicians in Washington ” have betrayed them , and , without waiting to be run off “ like an outlaw , ” he abandons the little house in a rage .
In the last scene , with his family camped by its wagon in the high grass , he gets out his fiddle .
“ And we ’ll rally round the flag boys , ” he sings .
“ We ’ll rally once again / Shouting the battle - cry of Freedom ! ”
Ma shushes him — it ’s too martial a song for the girls , who are half - asleep , but “ Laura felt that she must shout , too . ”
In 1974 , “ Little House on the Prairie ” was loosely adapted as a television drama , which ran for nine seasons .
It was said to be Ronald Reagan ’s favorite program .
After it went off the air , the actors reunited to make three “ Little House ” films .
Melissa Gilbert , who played the young Laura , grew up in the role from the age of ten to eighteen , and last year she played Caroline in a musical based on the books , which opened at the Guthrie Theatre , in Minneapolis , and begins a national tour in September at the Paper Mill Playhouse , in Millburn , New Jersey .
The farmhouse at Rocky Ridge now receives some forty thousand visitors annually .
It is one of seven historical sites and museums — in New York , Iowa , Minnesota , Wisconsin , Missouri , South Dakota , and Kansas — devoted to the series and its lore .
( Last autumn , the Kansas museum , which bills itself as “ The Little House on the Prairie , ” was sued for trademark dilution by the company that produced the series .
A spokesperson for the museum — which is owned by the television personality Bill Kurtis and his sister — says that it declined a cash offer to change its name .
The case is pending . )
Wilder scholarship is a flourishing industry , particularly at universities in the Midwest , and much of it seeks to sift fiction from history .
The best book among many good , if more pedestrian , ones , “ The Ghost in the Little House , ” by William Holtz , a professor emeritus of English at the University of Missouri , explores a controversy that first arose after Wilder bequeathed her original manuscripts to libraries in Detroit and California .
It is the work of a fastidious stylist , and , in its way , a minor masterpiece of insight and research .
Holtz ’s subject , however , is n’t Laura Ingalls Wilder .
It is her daughter and , he argues , her unacknowledged “ ghost , ” Rose Wilder Lane .
By the time that Laura published her first book , Rose was a frumpish , middle - aged divorcée , who was tormented by rotten teeth and suffered from bouts of suicidal depression , which she diagnosed in her journal , with more insight than many doctors of the era , as a mental illness .
For more than a decade , she had earned a good living with what she considered literary hack work for the San Francisco Bulletin , its rival , the Call , various magazines , and the Red Cross Publicity Bureau .
She had published commercial fiction , travelogues , ghostwritten memoirs , and several celebrity biographies .
Charles Ingalls ’s granddaughter had inherited his wanderlust , and her career had given her a chance to indulge it .
Much of her reporting had been filed from exotic places .
She had lived among bohemians in Paris and Greenwich Village , Soviet peasants and revolutionaries , intellectuals in Weimar Berlin , survivors of the massacres in Armenia , Albanian rebels , and camel - drivers on the road to Baghdad .
In 1928 , she had come home to Rocky Ridge for an extended visit with her aging parents , whose income she subsidized .
They were so used to denying themselves basic comforts that they threatened to have their electricity cut off , even though they no longer needed to live so austerely , and Laura ’s martyrdom , as Rose saw it , was a reproach to her own way of life .
“ My mother can not learn to have any reliance upon my financial judgment or promises , ” she wrote to a sometime lover .
“ Where is perseverance , thrift , caution , industry — where are any of the necessary virtues ?
Simply not in me . ”
She grandly spent eleven thousand dollars to build Laura and Almanzo a new fieldstone house — an “ English cottage ” — which they did n’t want , and she bought them a Buick , which Almanzo drove into a tree .
The transformation of a barefoot Cinderella from the Ozarks into a stylish cosmopolite who acquired several languages , enjoyed smoking and fornication , and dined at La Rotonde when she was n’t motoring around Europe in her Model T is , like the Little House books themselves , an American saga .
Rose ’s published writing was sensationalist , if not trashy , but her letters and her conversation were prized for their acerbic sophistication by a diverse circle of friends which included Dorothy Thompson , a leading journalist of the day ; Floyd Dell , the editor , with Max Eastman , of The Masses ; Ahmet Zogu , who became King Zog of Albania ; and Herbert Hoover , despite the fact that he had apparently tried to suppress an embarrassing hagiography that Rose and a collaborator had cobbled together in 1920 .
( He had n’t yet entered electoral politics , but he was widely admired for his postwar relief work in Europe . )
Hoover was not unique among Rose ’s subjects in deploring her fabrications .
Charlie Chaplin was so incensed by them that he threatened legal action , as did Jack London ’s widow .
Henry Ford repudiated a portrait of himself that he could n’t recognize .
Laura , who publicly ( and disingenuously ) insisted that her stories were pure autobiography , also sometimes balked at the liberties that her daughter took with factual detail .
Fidelity to a subject , or to history , was of less importance to Rose , as she implied in a placating letter to Chaplin , than a “ corking ” tale .
But perhaps she did n’t understand the principle at stake : she had reinvented herself just as brashly .
The Wilders ’ life on a shrinking frontier was considerably bleaker than even the Ingallses ’ had been .
The first decade of their marriage , as Laura later recalled , was a period of almost unrelieved calamity and failure .
Their infant son died .
Drought and hail destroyed their crops , and they struggled to pay the interest on their heavily mortgaged house and equipment .
Then the house burned down .
Almanzo had a stroke , brought on by diphtheria , and he never fully recovered from the paralysis .
Virtually destitute , they embarked on a series of futile peregrinations , by train and wagon , across the Midwest , with a wretched interlude on the Florida Panhandle .
In 1894 , they were uprooted by one of the worst depressions in American history , and headed for the Ozarks , which had been touted by promoters as yet another promised land .
They struggled for years to eke out a living from the rocky soil .
Rose was , in essence , the child of refugees .
The girls in Mansfield laughed at her for her patched clothes and bare feet .
The family sometimes went hungry , and Rose blamed the condition of her teeth on early malnutrition .
She later recalled her parents ’ outward show of courage and gaiety and her own sullen pride in defying her humiliations .
But she confided them to her journal , where she also complained bitterly about her mother .
“ No affection ” heads the litany of her privations .
“ She made me so miserable as a child that I never got over it . ”
Even as a grown woman , Laura belittled her , Rose said : she “ hesitates to let me have the responsibility of bringing up the butter from the spring , for fear I wo n’t do it quite right ! ”
William Holtz points out that Laura had been so harried by poverty and hardship — doing some of the man ’s work that Almanzo could n’t manage , in addition to her own — that she might not have had much left to give , except the example of self - denial .
Rose herself could be grandiose and domineering .
There is nothing explicit in their letters ( few of Laura ’s survive , one a belated paean of gratitude ) to suggest that Wilder merited the accusations , even though she accepted Rose ’s extravagant gifts and literary labors on her behalf with a sense of entitlement that was more like a child ’s than like a mother ’s .
Rose , in her less aggrieved moments , could admit that Mama Bess , through no fault of her own , had the wrong daughter .
Whatever their disappointments , they kept them from each other .
After high school , Rose left home to work as a telegraph operator , and in 1908 she took a job in San Francisco .
Holtz is n’t sure whether or not she had already met her future husband , Claire Gillette Lane , a newspaper reporter her own age — twenty - two — but they married a year later .
She became pregnant only once , and lost the infant , a boy .
( Later in life , she informally adopted a series of protégés whom she considered foster children ; she could be a needy and controlling benefactor , but she lavished upon her wards the gifts of maternal warmth and of faith in their potential of which she herself had felt cheated . )
If Rose had reckoned on her husband as a cultivated soul mate and provider , she was quickly disabused .
Gillette Lane was full of schemes for making a fortune in advertising and promotion .
The young couple went on the road for several unhappy years .
Back in San Francisco , in 1915 , she “ got rid of Gillette ” ( “ my attitude toward men has always been essentially exploiting , ” she later remarked ) , and was hired as an assistant at the Bulletin .
The editor , Fremont Older , a legendary newsman and anti-corruption crusader , became Rose ’s mentor and a “ model of integrity ” to her , Holtz writes , if not a surrogate father .
She failed to absorb his ethics , although under his tutelage she learned not only to rewrite her copy but to accept being rewritten .
In that sense , one could say that the career of Laura Ingalls Wilder began there .
Rose saw her mother as a literary apprentice , not as an artist , even though she had always encouraged Wilder ’s writing — first the journalism , then the juveniles ; they were a less strenuous and more profitable source of income for an elderly woman than chicken farming .
But , whatever art may be , the Little House books fulfill its purpose as defined by Horace : “ to entertain and to inform . ”
Mother and daughter essentially divided that labor .
One has to suspect that the delicious minutiae of the books ’ famous how - to chapters on molding bullets , pressing cheese , digging a well , making a rag doll , drying plums , framing a house , and smoking a ham , among dozens of daily activities , were mostly Laura ’s contribution .
( In my favorite of many Christmas scenes , little Grace gets an elegant new coat and hood , trimmed in swan ’s down ; her father shot the bird , her mother cured the skin and did most of the sewing , and her older sisters pieced out the lining from scraps of blue silk . )
It was what Laura knew , loved , and had proved , in her columns for the Ruralist , that she could write about .
Rose had proved that she could romanticize whatever material she was given .
She did some minor tinkering with “ Pioneer Girl , ” but , once it was decided to fictionalize the memoir as a children ’s story — the idea had come from an editor who rejected the memoir — she took a more aggressive role .
It varied in intensity from book to book , but she dutifully typed up the manuscript pages , and , in the process , reshaped and heightened the dramatic structure .
She also rewrote the prose so drastically that Laura sometimes felt usurped .
“ A good bit of the detail that I add to your copy is for pure sensory effect , ” Rose explained in a letter .
John Miller , a thorough biographer and historian who , like Holtz , compared the manuscripts with the published texts , came to a different conclusion about the collaboration .
In the introduction to his book “ Becoming Laura Ingalls Wilder , ” he writes , “ Wilder demonstrated a high degree of writing competence from the beginning , and her daughter ’s contribution to the final products , while important , was less significant than has been asserted . ”
( The four pages of manuscript that he reproduces arouse more questions than they settle , however .
In Laura ’s scribbled margin notes to Rose — points of fact about geography — she misspells definite as “ deffinite ” and remarks that her husband “ do n’t remember ” the distance between two towns . )
A concise , recent biography by Pamela Smith Hill , “ Laura Ingalls Wilder : A Writer ’s Life , ” is more overtly partisan .
Hill accuses
Rose of insensitivity to her mother ’s “ imaginative vision , ” and , at times , of arrogance , condescension , bullying , self - aggrandizement , and even plagiarism .
( Rose secretly wrote an adult novella of her own , “ Let the Hurricane Roar , ” which was widely admired and sold briskly .
The substance and characters were pillaged from “ Pioneer Girl . ”
Laura apparently never read the book , and considered it a betrayal . )
The cumulative evidence suggests that sometimes Laura stood her ground and sometimes she was cowed into submission , but most often she solicited and welcomed Rose ’s improvements .
When Rose left the farm , in 1935 , the editing of the five books yet to come was done by correspondence .
“ I have written you the whys of the story as I wrote it , ” Laura told her in a letter that accompanied a draft of volume four , “ On the Banks of Plum Creek , ” “ but you know your judgment is better than mine , so what you decide is the one that stands . ”
Rose , for her part , could be an insufferable didact .
She played down her authority , even as she hammered it home : “ I ’m trying to train you as a writer for the big market , ” she had told her mother in 1925 .
( Laura had written an article about her Ozark kitchen , which , heavily revised , had appeared in the magazine Country Gentleman . )
“ You must understand that what sold was your article , edited .
You must study how it was edited , and why .
. . .
Above all , you must listen to me . ”
“ Little House in the Big Woods ” was a great success , critically and commercially .
Seven months after it was published , Franklin Delano Roosevelt defeated Herbert Hoover .
His victory bitterly dismayed the Wilders — Rose , in particular .
Shortly after the Inauguration , she noted in her journal , “ We have a dictator . ”
At the turn of the twentieth century , the Wilders , along with other disillusioned pioneers , had briefly rallied to the incendiary populism of William Jennings Bryan .
By the middle of the decade , Rose had become a follower of Eugene Debs , the union organizer and Socialist candidate for President .
In her days as a bohemian , she had flirted with Communism .
Laura was a Democrat until the late nineteen - twenties ; after the First World War , she served as the local secretary of a national loan association that dispersed federal money to farmers , and as the chairwoman of her county ’s Democratic Committee .
But , ultimately , both women ’s experience of adversity — or their selective recall of it — made them less sympathetic to the homeless and the jobless .
“ The Greatest Good to the Greatest Number , ” Rose argued in a letter to Dorothy Thompson , “ will obviously be reached when each individual of the greatest number is doing the greatest good to himself . ”
Laura had kept in touch fitfully with her sisters , and when she began to research her childhood they sometimes provided details that she ’d forgotten .
Mary had died in 1928 , but Grace , a farmer ’s wife , and Carrie , a journalist , were both still living in South Dakota — Grace and her husband receiving welfare and surplus food .
Nevertheless , from Rocky Ridge , the predicament of the urban poor was a remote abstraction , and the Wilders blamed rural poverty on the Democrats ’ support , as they saw it , of industry at the expense of agriculture .
They opposed legislation that compelled farmers to plow crops under as a strategy for price support .
Miller writes that , according to Rose , Almanzo was ready to run off an agent from the Agriculture Department with a shotgun , telling him , “ I ’ll plant whatever I damn please on my own farm . ”
In 1943 , the year that Laura published “ These Happy Golden Years ” ( the final installment of her saga ) , she told a Republican congressman from Malone , New York , “ What we accomplished was without help of any kind , from anyone . ”
The Wilders had , in fact , received unacknowledged help from their families , and the Ingallses , like all pioneers , were dependent , to some degree , on the railroads ; on taxpayer - financed schools ( Mary ’s tuition at a college for the blind , Hill points out , was paid for by the Dakota Territory ) ; on credit — which is to say , the savings of their fellow - citizens ; on “ boughten ” supplies they could n’t make or grow ; and , most of all , on the federal government , which had cleared their land of its previous owners .
“ There were no people ” on the prairie , Laura , or Rose , had written .
“ Only Indians lived there . ”
( Hill writes that Wilder agreed to amend the sentence when an outraged reader objected , calling it “ a stupid blunder . ”
It now reads , “ There were no settlers . ” )
In 1936 , the Saturday Evening Post published Lane ’s own “ Credo , ” an impassioned essay that was widely admired by conservatives .
Her vision was of a quasi- anarchic democracy , with minimal taxes , limited government , and no entitlements , regulated only by the principle of personal responsibility .
Its citizens would be equal in their absolute freedom to flourish or to fail .
Everything that Lane wrote after “ Credo ” — fiction or polemics — was an expression of that vision .
She may have been the first to invoke the term “ libertarian ” ( it dates to the eighteenth century ) to describe the agenda of a nascent anti-statist movement of which she has been called , with Isabel Paterson and Ayn Rand , “ a founding mother . ”
To the degree that she is still remembered for her own achievements , it is mainly by a few libertarian ultras for whom her tract of 1943 , “ The Discovery of Freedom : Man ’s Struggle Against Authority , ” is a foundational work of political theory .
( It was written “ in a white heat , ” she said . )
The struggle against authority defined Rose ’s life .
She railed against a mother who had infantilized her ( even though she returned the favor ) , and at a President who , she believed , was infantilizing a free republic .
( “ I hoped that Roosevelt would be killed in 1933 , ” she wrote to her agent , George Bye , who also represented Eleanor Roosevelt . )
She fought a valiant losing battle for the psychic freedom necessary to write something authentic , yet she was beholden to her parents for her greatest literary successes .
In 1938 , Rose serialized “ Free Land , ” a novel set on the Dakota plains , whose central character was modelled on Almanzo .
It reached the best - seller list , and a reviewer in the Times recommended it to the Pulitzer Prize committee .
But , once Rose had exhausted her family history , her creative life was finished .
Her last attempt at fiction , in 1939 , “ The Forgotten Man , ” is the story of a working - class hero whose ingenuity has been thwarted by the New Deal .
When it was rejected by an editor as artless propaganda , Rose , according to Holtz , argued that she “ could not write it otherwise . ”
By then , Lane had moved East .
In 1938 , at fifty - one , she bought three suburban acres near Danbury , Connecticut , and a clapboard farmhouse — her first real home .
( Remodelling , she told a friend , was “ my vice . ” )
As she aged , her inner and outer worlds both contracted .
She abandoned her journal and , with it , Holtz concludes , her introspection .
Old friends were alienated by her increasingly kooky and embattled militance .
( One of them described her as “ floating between sanity and a bedlam of hates . ” )
The F.B.I. took notice of her “ subversive ” actions to protest Social Security , and she made headlines by denouncing the agency ’s “ Gestapo ” tactics .
She talked about reducing her income to a bare minimum , so that she would n’t have to file taxes .
During the Second World War , she found an improbable new pulpit — a column , “ Rose Lane Says , ” in the Pittsburgh Courier , a progressive African - American weekly .
In 1943 , convinced that wartime rationing would lead only to inefficiency , she denounced it to her readers , and , to make the point that a determined individualist could live off the grid , she arranged with her neighbors to share a cow , a pig , and some chickens , and she canned the produce from her garden .
Two hours from Manhattan , she was re-creating her parents ’ life .
The Wilders were a long - lived family .
Almanzo died in 1949 , at ninety - two ; Laura in 1957 , at ninety ; and Rose in 1968 , at eighty - one .
She bequeathed her literary estate to Roger Lea MacBride , her “ adopted grandson ” and political torchbearer .
( He ran for President on the Libertarian ticket in 1976 . )
Among the papers of mother and daughter was the draft of a novella that Wilder had mentioned in a letter of 1937 : “ I thought it might wangle a little more advertising for the L. H. books if I said I might write the grown up one , ” she told Rose .
“ You could polish it and put your name to it if that would be better than mine . ”
At some point soon afterward , Laura did set down the story of her experience as a bride and a young mother , but she abandoned it .
That was the manuscript that was found after her death ; in 1971 MacBride published it , without revisions , as “ The First Four Years , ” and it is now marketed as volume nine in the Little House series .
But Laura ’s instincts were right .
The writing is prissy and amateurish ; the heroine is bigoted and obsessed with money .
It is too simplistic for an adult reader , and too mature for a child .
In slightly more than a hundred pages , there is n’t even a glimmer of the radiant simplicity that draws one to the Little House books .
Last June , Anita Clair Fellman , a professor emerita of history at Old Dominion University , in Norfolk , Virginia , published “ Little House , Long Shadow , ” a survey of the Wilders ’ “ core ” beliefs , and of their influence on American political culture .
Two streams of conservatism , she argues — not in themselves inherently compatible — converge in the series .
One is Lane ’s libertarianism , and the other is Wilder ’s image of a poster family for Republican “ value voters ” : a devoted couple of Christian patriots and their unspoiled children ; the father a heroic provider and benign disciplinarian , the mother a pious homemaker and an example of feminine self - sacrifice .
( In that respect , Rose considered herself an abject failure .
“ My life has been arid and sterile , ” she wrote , “ because I have been a human being instead of a woman . ” )
Fellman concludes , “ The popularity of the Little House books . . . helped create a constituency for politicians like Reagan who sought to unsettle the so - called liberal consensus established by New Deal politics . ”
Considering the outcome of the November election , and the present debacle of laissez - faire capitalism , that popularity may have peaked .
On the other hand , it may not have .
Hard times whet the appetite for survival stories . ♦

In Columbia , Tennessee , one of the patrons of the Maury County Public Library has decided that there ’s a problem with modern fiction , and has taken to signing out novels — especially mystery novels — with one particular word in them , blacking out the word , and returning the books .
The word ?
“ It ’s the ‘ f ’ word , ” said library director Elizabeth Potts .
According to a story from local News Channel 5 , staffers at the library suffering from numerical hesitancy have found “ 50 to 100 books copy edited , illegally . ”
However , “ Staff can not locate the offender because federal law protects patrons , ” says the report .
Exactly what federal law “ is tying the hands of the library director ” from looking at who signed out a book and fining that person for damaging the book — as they would be able to do if a patron had n’t returned a book at all — is unclear .
The article merely says it ’s “ a federal library law that protects privacy . ”
So God knows what they would have done if the same federal government , under the Patriot Act , had demanded to see who signed out what .
Meanwhile , the director has put up a sign , asking whoever it is to stop that shit .
A UN spokesman in the Austrian capital said there were no " suspicious circumstances " surrounding the man 's death , while a police spokesman said that no other person was believed to have been involved .
Journalism students ’ emails , report cards subpoenaed in review of 31 - year - old conviction
Media observers are openly questioning whether prosecutors in Cook County , Illinois , are intentionally trying to undermine a long - running project to clear the innocent of wrongful convictions , after prosecutors reviewing a 31 - year - old murder case subpoenaed the emails , grades , and even course materials of journalism students at Northwestern University .
ADVERTISEMENT
In 2003 , the Medill Innocence Project , run by Northwestern University ’s Medill School of Journalism , launched an investigation into the conviction of Anthony McKinney , who was found guilty of killing a security guard in the Chicago suburb of Harvey in 1978 .
In 2008 , lawyers filed a post - conviction petition with the Cook County Circuit Court , with evidence gathered by the Medill Project as part of their argument .
Now , prosecutors want to see just about anything and everything having to do with the students who researched the McKinney prosecution — their grades , the course syllabi for their journalism classes , their emails , and their notes and recordings of witness interviews .
The New York Times reports :
Lawyers in the Cook County state ’s attorney ’s office say that in their quest for justice in the old case , they need every pertinent piece of information about the students ’ three - year investigation into Anthony McKinney , who was convicted of fatally shooting a security guard in 1978 .
Mr. McKinney ’s conviction is being reviewed by a judge .
Among the issues the prosecutors need to understand better , a spokeswoman said , is whether students believed they would receive better grades if witnesses they interviewed provided evidence to exonerate Mr. McKinney .

The suggestion that students were encouraged to find evidence of wrongful prosecution even if there were none has raised alarms among some legal experts , who wonder whether Cook County prosecutors may be trying to discredit the project that has caused embarrassment for numerous prosecutors over the past decade .
“ They ’re either trying to undermine the investigation , or they ’re trying to undermine the entire project , ” Don Craven , executive director of the Illinois Press Association , told the press last week .
Northwestern University officials are fighting the subpoena , arguing that it ’s too broad and the students are protected by Illinois ’ broad Illinois Reporter ’s Privilege Act .
Additionally , the dean of the journalism school , John Levine , has said it would be illegal for the school to hand over the students ’ grades .
And “ frankly , even if I could , I would n’t share them , ” he told the Daily Northwestern .
ADVERTISEMENT
Lavine told the New York Times the notion that the students ’ grades could affect the evidence in a 31 - year - old murder prosecution is “ astonishing . ”
As the Times points out , forcing private information into public about Northwestern students could affect the willingness of others to participate in innocence projects around the country .
ADVERTISEMENT
If the school gives in to such a demand , say advocates of the Medill Innocence Project and more than 50 similar projects ( most involving law schools and legal clinics ) , the stakes could be still higher , discouraging students from taking part or forcing groups to devote time and money to legal assistance .
“ Every time the government starts attacking the messenger as opposed to the message , it can have a chilling effect , ” said Barry C. Scheck , a pioneer of the Innocence Project in New York , who said he had never seen a similar demand from prosecutors .
Northwestern officials have said they have no intention of turning over students ’ private information to prosecutors .
If the court rules against them , they could face contempt - of - court charges , the Times notes .
Bingo .
If you have the health care industry complaining that we ’re going to raise costs because of these changes , it is them putting us on notice that we have n’t put enough cost containment in the bill .
You know , the health care industry themselves is putting out a whole report saying that .
That should be a tell to the Baucus team that you know what , maybe it ’s time for them to go back and revisit the public option .
In a strange way , and look , obviously they did n’t mean this , the health insurance lobby today fired the most important salvo in weeks for the public option , because they have said , as clear as day , left to their own devices , according to their own number crunchers , they ’re going to raise rates 111 % .
And that ’s why , you know we have a petition at CountdownToHealthCare.com where we ’re telling people for the moderates in the Senate , the so - called moderates , and for the White House , we need the public option , and the health care industry is making our argument for us .
Left to their own devices , the industry raised rates 119 percent in the last decade , soo 111 % in the next is right on course .
As Rep .
Weiner says , adequate cost containment just is n't in the Baucus bill , and while the last thing -- the very last thing AHIP wants is a public option , they make a damned good argument for it by commissioning this report .
That argument is the substantive one Weiner is making about cost containment , but also a political one .
They 've just shown that , despite all the cozy meetings early on with White House officials and the Baucus team , that they are intrinsically opposed to reform and they 'll do anything to kill it .
So now that AHIP has betrayed their true selves , maybe we can get a real push from the White House and the Senate leadership for real reform , and a robust public option .
On August 2nd , 1939 , after consultation with fellow physicists Leó Szilárd and Eugene Wigner , Albert Einstein signed the following letter to then - U.S. President , Franklin Roosevelt .
The letter warned that the construction of an atomic bomb using uranium was indeed possible , advised the U.S. Government to invest time and money into its research , and then hinted that physicists in Nazi Germany had already begun similar work .
As a result of the letter , Roosevelt created the Briggs Advisory Committee .
This slowly evolved to become the Manhattan Project , an enormous project that later developed the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs .
These were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 , killing over 200,000 people .
Einstein later described signing the letter as the “ one great mistake in my life . ”

Sir :
Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard , which has been communicated to me in manuscript , leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future .
Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and , if necessary , quick action on the part of the Administration .
I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations :
In the course of the last four months it has been made probable – through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America – that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium , by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium - like elements would be generated .
Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future .
This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs , and it is conceivable – though much less certain – that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed .
A single bomb of this type , carried by boat and exploded in a port , might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory .
However , such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air .
The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities .
There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia , while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo .
In view of the situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America .
One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial capacity .
His task might comprise the following :
a ) to approach Government Departments , keep them informed of the further development , and put forward recommendations for Government action , giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for the United States ;
b ) to speed up the experimental work , which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories , by providing funds , if such funds be required , through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause , and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary equipment .
I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over .
That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under - Secretary of State , von Weizsäcker , is attached to the Kaiser - Wilhelm - Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated .
Yours very truly ,

The lovely - looking restaurant and bar The Breslin begins lunch service tomorrow , and co-owner Ken Friedman ( The Spotted Pig ) is planning on serving alcohol despite objections from the Masjid Ar- Rahman mosque across the street .
Earlier this month the mosque ’s leaders called a meeting with Friedman at The Ace Hotel , where The Breslin is located , and asked , " Can you move the bar ? "
Friedman 's response makes us want to hurry over to The Breslin right now for a dram of Laphroaig to show our support ( and drown out the voices ) :
I laughed .
And the guy said , " Oh , you think that ’s funny ? "
And I said , " Yeah , that is funny , that is really funny , because we ’re not going to move the bar just because you discovered we ’re serving booze . "
Can you name one restaurant in New York that does n’t serve booze ?
I said , " This is the United States of America and we ’ll do whatever the fuck we want . "
He said the mosque had suggested it could n’t control the behavior of " a few bad eggs " ; i.e. , we could get a brick through our window .
Friedman notified police of the threat , but just to show he's not a hard - hearted man , that it 's not all dollars and cents , he agreed to put a curtain over the windows so devout Muslims would n't be corrupted by the sight of infidel inebriation .
But the curtain has n't arrived yet , so over the weekend he actually taped paper over the windows to hide a gay wedding .
A volunteer at the mosque says city law forbids serving liquor within 200 feet of a place of worship and that " not more than 200 feet is between the mosque and the bar . "
But Ace Hotel developer Andrew Zobler tells The Observer , " The law is clear that in order for that to apply it has to be an exclusively dedicated house of worship , and at their space they have both residences and a restaurant , so basically , because of those uses the law allowed there to be a bar within 200 feet .
Everyone was aware of that when the liquor license was granted . "
And Friedman adds , " They can threaten , but they ca n’t really stop us . "
Yeah , heh , what are these devout , pissed - off Muslims gonna do ?

A chorus of wailing sirens and ringing bells will signal Samoa 's attempt to do something no country has tried since the 1970s .
Bus owners are angry they will have to convert their vehicles From Monday morning , drivers in the Pacific island nation will steer their cars to the left - hand side of roads , instead of the right - hand side they are currently driving on .
The government has pitched the change as economically beneficial , but critics say it will lead to traffic mayhem .
Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi has said the move will allow the tens of thousands of expatriate Samoans living in New Zealand and Australia to send used cars - with steering wheels on the right side of vehicles - to their families back home .
It will also allow used cars to be imported from Japan , which also drives on the left .
Cars will become cheaper , and more people in rural areas will be able to obtain vehicles to help them develop their land , the government reasons .
Cars are going to crash , people are going to die - not to mention the huge expense to our country
Tole 'afoa Solomona Toa'iloa
" The switch in the side of the road for driving is a policy for the development and improvement of life for all the people of Samoa , " the prime minister said in August .
There are fewer than 20,000 vehicles on Samoa 's roads , and about 4,000 are currently right - hand drive , with half of those recently imported , says Keni Lesa , editor of the Samoa Observer .
The rest are left - hand drive vehicles built to be driven on the right side of the road , imported from the US and neighbouring American Samoa .
Signs removed
The proposed changeover has split opinion in Samoa , with opponents predicting traffic mayhem as confused drivers forget which lane to pull into and pedestrians look the wrong way before crossing roads .
" Cars are going to crash , people are going to die - not to mention the huge expense to our country , " says lawyer Tole ' afoa Solomona Toa'iloa , who has headed a legal challenge in the Supreme Court against the constitutionality of the plan for protest group People Against Switching Sides ( Pass ) .
Traffic analysts testifying in court agreed that more accidents were likely to occur .
ROAD SWITCH FACTS
One - third of the world drives on the left All recent changes have been to the right Sweden went right in 1967 Sierra Leone , Nigeria and Ghana went right in the 1970s New Zealand crash investigator Graham Williams said there would be more accidents on Samoa 's narrow , pot - holed rural roads , which are often obscured by vegetation .
" Based on my experience and from what I 've seen during my trips to Samoa , come 7 September , there will be a dramatic increase in the number of road crashes , " he told the court .
Local bus owners are also furious about having to either buy new vehicles or convert their old ones - by cutting new doors on the left side behind the driver so passengers do n't have to step off into the middle of the road .
One bus company owner has threatened to set his vehicles alight in protest .
In some places , new signs directing drivers to keep left have been removed , and directional arrows on the road have been painted over to point the wrong way .
Complaints have also been raised about the expense .
Samoa 's Chamber of Commerce estimates that it will cost at least $ 300 m ( £ 185 m ) in direct and indirect costs to the Samoan economy .
The Chamber of Commerce also questioned the benefits to the agricultural sector , saying that most vehicles in Australia and New Zealand are sedans and wagons and not pick - up trucks or utility vehicles .
Critics also say the government has failed to consult the public on the change or conduct any feasibility studies .
Last - ditch appeal
In April last year an estimated 18,000 people - about 10 % of Samoa 's population - demonstrated against the change in the capital , Apia .
But the opposition has since lost some of its steam , and last week the Supreme Court rejected a legal challenge from Pass .
The president of Pass , Lefau Waikaimoana So'onalolole , said Samoa was not ready and necessary roadwork had not been finished .
" The efforts to prepare for the road switch are nowhere near completed , " he said .
" Not only that , but I believe there is much work to be done in educating everybody about the switch . "
Could some of these Australian cars end up in Samoa ?
But Prime Minister Tuilaepa turned down a last - ditch appeal to delay the switch .
" Many preparations have been carried out , " he said after a special cabinet meeting held to consider the appeal .
" A repeated request to government from the wider public has been to start the switch on the scheduled date to make it quicker for the country to become familiar to the changes . "
He has declared a special two - day holiday on 7 and 8 September to provide time for people to adjust to the change .
" I would envisage at 0550 [ on 7 September ] we will have a kind of speech through the television , and then exactly at 0600 the call will go , sirens and church bells will ring , " he said .

CHINA'S car market has overtaken America 's in sales volume for the first time , several years earlier than analysts had predicted before the financial crisis .
Plummeting demand in the West is to blame .
Earlier this year , as the American government was buying 61 % of General Motors and 8 % of Chrysler to prevent them from collapsing , the two manufacturers ' sales in China were rocketing .
GM 's sales in China in August more than doubled on a year earlier .
For 2009 as a whole the company predicted a 40 % rise .
Sales of all car brands in China in August were up by about 90 % , helped by a cut in the purchase tax on smaller , more fuel - efficient cars .
There is also huge pent - up demand as a new middle class takes to the road .

One of the things that you can never anticipate fully before becoming a parent is the absolute ferocity of the instinct to protect your child .
It 's innate , feral , and so deep that it can actually scare you .
I am profoundly grateful every day that my children were born healthy , but I know that should my luck run out and one of my kids develop some sort of life - threatening illness , there is no stone I would leave unturned in my quest to save my child .
There is no length I would n't go for my babies .
And if all those efforts were in vain , I do n't know how I 'd survive the loss of my child .
I had a miscarriage some years back , and I carried that loss like a huge , gaping wound inside me for so long .
And that was for a child with whom I never got a chance to know or develop a real bond .
Now imagine how Hilda Sarkisyan feels .
The daughter she bore , raised and nurtured for seventeen years dies just hours before the insurance company she battled finally relented to give her daughter the liver transplant she needed .
Can you imagine that grief , that anger at how unnecessary Nataline 's death was ?
All the obstacles placed in their way by a for - profit insurance company in addition to just missing Nataline had to be paralyzing in its pain .
Which makes how CIGNA employees treated Hilda Sarkisyan so much more contemptible :
Surrounded by supporters , Hilda Sarkisyan marched into Cigna Corp . ’s Philadelphia headquarters on a chilly fall day , 10 months after the company refused to pay for a liver transplant for her daughter .
" You guys killed my daughter , " the diminutive San Fernando Valley real estate agent declared at the lobby security desk .
" I want an apology . "
What she got was something quite different .
Cigna employees , looking down into the atrium lobby from a balcony above , began heckling her , she said , with one of them giving her " the finger . "
Sarkisyan walked out , stunned and hurt .
" They showed me their true colors , " she said .
" Shame on them . "
This woman has just gone through a pain I would n't wish on anyone -- watching her child die needlessly - - because CIGNA decided there was n't enough of a cost - benefit to them to authorize a liver transplant .
A for - profit insurance agency acted as a de facto death panel , opting to let this child die .
Got that , GOP ?
There 's the death panel you fear - monger .
But they 're not some hypothetical used to scare Grandma and Grandpa , they 're REAL and some day , they may decide that you -- or worse , your child - - are not worth the cost of saving .
And do n't be surprised if they show their heartlessness by heckling you and flipping you off when you walk in their doors to ask why .
And as if on cue , here comes Fox News , defending CIGNA :
Dear God , where 's the humanity ?
Can you put together a plastic model Gundam and paint it perfectly within a 3 hour time frame ?
If you can then you might be ready for a job at the dental implant maker , Bitec Global .
From October Bitec Global are asking new recruits to assemble plastic models as part of the interview process .
The model expected to be used is the Gundam MG MS - 06S Char ’s Zaku II by Bandai .
The model is available at Amazon if you want to get one and practice .

Want to catch up on the Health Care Reform debate ?
Perhaps you ’d like for someone to explain it to you in everyday language ?
Maybe you would like to cut through all the noise , distractions , and partisan arguments that really have nothing to do with the core issues involved ?
Maybe … you ’d just like to better understand how this affects YOU .
Well , Keith Olbermann has done you , and all of us , a BIG favor .
Yesterday evening , he dedicated his entire show to providing one of his signature “ Special Comments ” on the subject of our Health Care system .
It is factual … in fact , it informed me of several things I did not know , despite my considerable research into this topic .
It is personal …he directly relates the issue to his family ’s stories , and the stories of other families .
It is direct …by stripping away everything that is truly just distracting us from what really is at stake , we are presented with what is certainly the most impassioned , clear , and very HUMAN perspective on the crisis America faces .
Consider watching these segments the very best possible use of an hour of your time :
Part 1 :
Part 2 :
Part 3 :
Part 4 :
Part 5 :
It is certain , that Olbermann is asserting that he , as an American and a human being , believes it is both his responsibility and his government ’s responsibility to provide for the healthy lives of our country ’s citizens , while minimizing all possible pain , suffering , and death .
Olbermann says that he wants his taxes to go towards that FIRST … and for what it is worth , polls show that most Americans agree .
It is interesting , that in the next hour of television that I watched , Rachel Maddow had a discussion with an author who has written on the subject of the Puritan colonists who founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the early 1600′s .
In this discussion , it was noted that President Ronald Reagan ( and Kennedy before him ) often liked to refer to America as the “ city upon a hill , ” which is a reference to a sermon delivered by the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , John Winthrop , in 1630 .
Many Republicans and conservatives since Reagan have made reference to this quote ( including both John McCain and Sarah Palin ) … citing that we should always strive to be that “ city upon a hill , ” serving as an example to the rest of the world .
It ’s just too bad … that these conservatives do n’t know what else Winthrop said in that famous sermon :
“ …we must be knit together , in this work , as one man .
We must entertain each other in brotherly affection .
We must be willing to abridge ourselves of our superfluities , for the supply of others ’ necessities .
We must uphold a familiar commerce together in all meekness , gentleness , patience and liberality .
We must delight in each other ; make others ’ conditions our own ; rejoice together , mourn together , labor and suffer together , always having before our eyes our commission and community in the work , as members of the same body .
So shall we keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace …
For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill . ”
That ’s right : we should give up our “ superfluities , ” that is to say our excess , our luxuries , that which we do n’t really need … to provide for others ’ “ necessities . ”
We must “ make others ’ conditions our own . “
For all the talk of wanting a “ Christian nation “ … I hear a lot about wanting “ scripture in legislation “ ….
I hear lot about wanting “ prayer in our schools “ … I hear a lot about “ legislating morality “ … none of which represents what Christ actually ASKED US TO DO .
Winthrop ’s sermon , asking each person to look after his fellow colonists as if they were “ members of the same body , ” more closely resembles Christ ’s commandments than anything I have seen advocated or sponsored by Republicans .
Is n’t it odd … that which Christians have been so clearly commanded to do …is so vehemently denounced by so many so - called Christians as “ vile socialism . “
I say , how can it be so “ vile ” if it takes only from me what I do not need , and provides it to those who need it ?
For now , Olbermann asks only that people visit his webpage , where he soon will be offering a link so that individuals can donate to the group that sets up large scale “ free health care days ” in various cities .
The goal : to host “ free health care ” clinics in all the capital cities of states where the Democratic legislators have been ignoring the voices and needs of their constituents by opposing the public option and other elements of REAL reform .
Perhaps … seeing the vast number of their people , turning out for desperately needed free health services , will serve to shame them into taking the action they should have taken a long time ago .
Perhaps …

One fan took it upon himself and registered Modernwarfare4.com , hoping the developer will make a deal for the domain URL .
He 's not asking for money or a job or anything , just copies of the game when it eventually gets released .
Of course , that 's going under the assumption that Infinity Ward develops more Modern Warfare titles after the upcoming sequel .
The website has recently been updated , but you can view the original message below :
We contacted both Infinity Ward and IGN 's legal department to see what , if anything , could come from this mess .
We 'll update you when we hear back .
Thanks to

for the link .
We spoke to a legal authority on the manner and here 's the comment they issued :
" In short , the owner of the MW2 trademark could institute a domain name proceeding against the holders of the domain to recover it .
If their rights are strong enough , and the current holders do not have a valid reason otherwise to use that mark and register that domain , then the owner of the mark would likely prevail .
The owner could use the " blackmail " as proof as a bad faith intention on the part of the holders , though the holders could say that that was just an offer to settle . "

Like you thought it was all healthy fun and games to strip yourself naked and lay on a bed of giant blue light bulbs and have ultraviolet rays blasted into every inch of your skin for hours per week and think , yeah , this can't be all bad , can it ?
What with my skin turning a bizarre shade of orange and that weird tingling in my brainstem and my genitalia melting like bubblegum in the sun ?
Like it 's not the transdermal equivalent of placing my mouth over the tailpipe of a Chevy Tahoe and gunning the engine ?
Mmm , stupid .
2 ) You are green to the core .
Organic everything , grey water , solar , Prius , compost your nail clippings and your urine and your condoms , the works .
You have a child , maybe two .
You are considering having a third , or maybe even a fourth or fifth .
You say you care about reducing your carbon footprint ?
You say you care deeply about your impact on the ecosphere ?
You might be lying .
Because of course , deep down , you know that you can compost and recycle your eco-friendly butt off for your entire life and still never come close to matching the reduction in carbon footprint you would gift the planet simply by not having that additional child .
It 's a rather harsh way to look at it , I admit , but there it is .
But of course , personal responsibility has its thresholds , right ?
3 ) Oh , but wait .
Maybe overpopulation is n't really the most pressing problem after all .
Relatively speaking , the U.S. does pretty well in managing birth rates , especially compared to explosive developing nations like China and India , so horribly strained for resources and with such staggering proportions of extreme poverty .
Maybe the real problem is rich Westerners sucking up far , far more than their fair share of , well , just about everything .
Did you know 50 percent of all toxic emissions come from just seven percent of the world population ?
I bet you did .
Upshot : Maybe the real solution is a nice combo of the two .
Not having too many kids , and buying less stuff you do n't actually need .
Radical !
Or not .
4 ) One large study has dared come forth to claim that organic food is really no better for you than " regular " food , implying that the organic thing is all a big sham , a multibillion - dollar lie , that the giant , watery , flavorless Safeway tomato doused in chemicals and gene - spliced goodness is really no worse for you than that fragrant , delicious , organic heirloom from Rainbow Grocery , or that the chem - blasted asparagus shipped in from Mexico in November has the same nutritional value as the organic goodness you should be getting in April from the local farm .
Is it tempting to believe ?
Not in the slightest .
For one thing , going organic is only partially about basic , keep - you - alive nutrients .
It 's just as much about the various toxins , chemicals , refined sugars and hormones slapped all over corporate foodstuffs in general ; not to mention the brutal , earth - stabbing , industrial manufacturing and farming practices that go into most crappy mainstream foods .
In other words , yes , in terms of basic nutritional values , maybe some organic foods are no better for you than their " normal " industrial - produced equivalents .
Unless you count the vicious environmental impact .
And the chemicals .
And the cancer .
And the death .
Otherwise , same .
5 ) Dammit .
Wait a second .
It also turns out that " USDA Certified Organic " label is just all sorts of mealy BS , too , and can't really be trusted .
Turns out the USDA has been so pressured by various industrial food titans to loosen the definition of " organic , " that the label has been rendered , if not meaningless , then more watered down than that same Safeway tomato .
Are the USDA 's standards still a huge improvement over what came before ?
Hell yes .
But they 're far from ideal .
Solution : Learn to read the ingredients yourself .
Figure it out .
Understand what you eat , and where it really comes from .
It 's not really very difficult .
Or , pretend that it is , that it 's too weird and you do n't have the time to care and it 's just too complicated .
You are probably lying .
But that 's OK .
6 ) 7 ) 8 ) The late infomercial pitchman Billy Mays ' OxiClean powdered miracle cleaner ?
Really just sodium percarbonate .
A standard chemical you can buy in bulk right now at your local swimming pool supply shop .
Whitening toothpaste ?
Just regular toothpaste with extra grit .
Red Bull ?
Massive shot of caffeine and a megadose of sugar combined with whatever they can squeeze out of the pituitary gland of dead rats .
I might be wrong about the rats .
But maybe not .
Oh , and if you buy high - end , thousand - dollar " audiophile - grade " cables to hook up your home theater system ?
You have achieved true greatness .
As a total sucker .
9 ) Wal - Mart is , apparently , hankering to launch a big initiative to stamp every product it sells with an eco-friendly rating label , some sort of grand , awareness - raising system to inform all Earth - conscious Wal - Mart customers --
I know , I know : oxymoron -- where every product falls on the you - are - destroying - the - planet scale .
It 's a rather wonderful idea that could radically transform the company 's entire supply chain for the better .
Except for one thing : Wal - Mart has no plans to slap a giant label on its own bloated megastores themselves , no plans to reveal the enormous waste and destruction Wal - Mart itself embodies merely by existing , by shipping a million products over from sweatshops in China and Malaysia and India .
Nor does it plan to offer a Smiley - Face Local Economy Decimation rating to all those countless small towns it 's swooped into and gutted .
But hey !
That giant tub of HFCS - blasted caramel corn ?
Not all that bad for the planet .
Yay !
10 ) We could totally do light rail in the United States .
We could totally invest in this massive , culture - altering project like it was the next man on the moon and within 20 years have this ridiculously cool , lighting - fast , super - efficient Euro - style train network connecting most major urban hubs like we were Italy and France and Japan and Disneyland all rolled into one , but with better drinks and free Wi-Fi and superlative in - seat movies like they do on Virgin .
We could totally do it .
But 50 + years of Big Auto PR bulls -- t has slyly convinced us all we really can't , that no one wants it , that big dumb America loves its big dumb open - road freedom far too much , that car culture is so embedded in our road - trippin ' nostalgia - thick psyches it can never be extricated .
Of course , Big Auto is full of crap , is now begging for table scraps , handouts , oxygen .
Who we thought we were , who we thought we had to be has essentially been a giant lie all along .
Did n't you already suspect as much ?

This is one of Tyson 's " Mathematical Nature " paintings .
This means that he has applied the paint to the aluminium in a mathematical order .
In this case , he poured on the pigments in a numbered spiral but only where the prime numbers would fall .
Usually Tyson uses 10 to 15 substances on each work , including stained - glass window paint , ceramic glazes , resins and pigments he 's invented himself .
( Image : Keith Tyson )
Fire
The following four works are the " Elements " series of the " Nature " paintings .
The idea for the work came about by accident while Tyson was busy collecting " all the paints known to man " in his studio for another project .
" One day they all collapsed and there was just this huge pile of junk on the floor .
I was devastated as this was thousands of pounds ' worth of paint , but there was one corner that had this incredibly DNA - like structure .
" I spent ages trying to work out which paints were responsible and in the process found more patches of the mess that I liked . "
( Image : Keith Tyson )
Earth
Tyson says it 's purely coincidental that his paintings end up looking organic : like a geological formation , a collection of tissues on a medical slide or an artist 's impression of a black hole .
The title of this work refers to the way he creates the art , he says , rather than what it ends up looking like .

Water
" Nature does its stuff instantly , at all scales , everywhere .
There 's no part of the painting that can be lazy .
It all has to obey the laws of physics , " says Tyson .
" You zoom into them and they retain their level of detail , but with a painting done by hand you can always get down to the brush marks .
The paintings look as good close up as they do far away .
" Nature 's better at painting than I am . "

Update : Our latest Hackintosh build is now here , and it 's easier than ever and full of step - by - step video goodness .
I 'd strongly recommend following the newest guide .
Advertisement
Two weeks ago I detailed how to build a Hackintosh with Snow Leopard , start to finish , with a little Terminal work .
If you 're not comfortable with command - line hacking , you can now install Snow Leopard on your Hackintosh with just a few point - and - clicks .

So what 's changed between my last guide and this one ?
In short , one of the incredibly helpful and generous people who helped walk me through the installation process last time was kind enough to wrap all the tedious Terminal work into one dead simple installer .
Where two weeks ago I showed you how to prepare your thumb drive ( and after that , hard drive ) with a custom bootloader that allows you to boot into OS X on regular old PC hardware , now all you have to do is run a package , point it at the drive you want to prepare , and then let it take care of all the nitty gritty .
It could not be more simple .
Now onto the revised process !
NOTE : Just like the last post , this guide is focused specifically on the hardware I suggested in the previous guide — specifically the motherboard .
If you try following this guide on other hardware , there 's a very good chance it wo n't work as advertised .

What You 'll Need
Advertisement
Step One : Prepare Your Thumb Drive
Advertisement
In this step , you 're going to format your thumb drive and then restore the Snow Leopard DVD image to the thumb drive because later we 'll be installing Snow Leopard to your hard drive using this thumb drive rather than the DVD .
" Why ? " you ask .
Because in order to boot the installer , we need to customize the disk image with some special helper files of our own .
I went into great detail on this process last time , so this time I 'm just going to include the step - by - step video below ( made by the same generous man who created the EP45UD3P Snow Leopard installer package ) .
If you want to read the very detailed version for a thorough explanation of how to rip the Snow Leopard install DVD to a disk image and then restore that image to your thumb drive , go here .
( Come back when you get to the " Semi- heavy Terminal work " warning .
That 's when you 're ready for the new and improved easy part . )
Advertisement
Note :
Watch the video in HD and fullscreen to get a closer look at everything that 's happening .
Advertisement
As you can see in the video , after you restore the Snow Leopard install DVD to your thumb drive , all you 've got to do is fire up the EP45UD3P Snow Leopard.pkg file ( if you have n't already downloaded and unzipped it , you can grab it here ) , select your thumb drive , and , let the installer take care of all the dirty work that you previously had to do one line at a time in Terminal .
Once you 've finished there , you 're ready to set your BIOS and install Snow Leopard .
Advertisement
Step 2 : Set Your BIOS
Before you can boot into or install OS X on your Hackintosh , you 've got to make some small adjustments to your system BIOS ( press Delete at system startup to tweak your BIOS settings ) .
Rather than taking you step by step through every change you need to make , I 've simply snapped a picture of the relevant BIOS screens and added some notes .
Just click through these images and make sure your BIOS settings match up .
Advertisement
Step 3 : Install Snow Leopard
If you 've made it this far , the hard part is over .
Now it 's time to install Snow Leopard , which — unlike what we 've done so far — is extremely easy .
Advertisement
Make sure you 've set the boot priority in your BIOS to boot from your thumb drive ( you can see how in this pic ) , then simply plug your prepared thumb drive into your Hackintosh and power it up .
Since screenshots are n't really an option — and since it 's a fairly easy process — my install instructions come in video format :
The quick version goes like this :
Boot into the Snow Leopard installer , format the hard drive you want to install Snow Leopard to ( go to Utilities ->
Disk Utility , then click on the drive , select 1 Partition , Mac OS X Journaled ( Case - Sensitive Update : Several readers have suggested that case - sensitive formatting can cause problems with some applications , like Adobe 's Creative Suite , so you may be better off sticking with plain old Mac OS X Journaled . ) , give it a name , and make sure GUID Partition Table is set in the Options .
After you Apply the new partition , go back to the installer and install like normal to that drive .
When you reboot after the install completes , press the arrow keys at the graphical boot menu and select the drive you just installed Snow Leopard to .
Advertisement
Two Last Tweaks
You could just stop there and be pretty happy at your new Hackintosh , but there are two little , easily performed tweaks you 'll want to tackle to get everything in tip top shape :
The first will get your sound fully working , and the second will allow you to boot into Snow Leopard without your thumb drive .
Advertisement
Tweak One : Snow Leopard should be up and running on your Hackintosh like a dream — with one exception : Sound is n't entirely working yet .
You may notice that sound actually does work in some instances , but not all .
In the old guide , you needed to install a custom audio kext ( your Mac 's equivalent to a driver ) ; the setup has been slightly tweaked in this new method , so all you should actually need to do is open up the Sound preference pane in System Preferences ( / Applications / System Preferences ) , click the Output tab , and change the output device to Built - in Line output ( I have n't tested with digital out , but it should work fine in theory ) .
Advertisement
Tweak Two :
At this point , in order to boot to your newly installed Snow Leopard installation , you need to have your thumb drive plugged in so it loads the custom bootloader , from which you can select your new Snow Leopard hard drive .
To install the custom bootloader to your hard drive ( so you no longer need the thumb drive to boot ) , again download the EP45UD3P Snow Leopard.pkg zip file and run it , but this time , instead of choosing to install the package to your thumb drive , select the hard drive you 've installed Snow Leopard to .
Once the installer completes , you 'll no longer need your thumb drive plugged in to boot into Snow Leopard .
Advertisement
Congratulations !
You 've Got a Fully Functional Hackintosh — the Easy Way
Advertisement
Where the method I covered previously required a good amount of time and care in Terminal , this new and improved method is a breeze , and it works even better .
( Sound works out of the box without any custom kexts , for example . )
Advertisement
It 's also worth noting that you can go ahead and upgrade to OS X 10.6.1 without any problems .

BUFFALO , N.Y . -
The parents of a 7 - year - old boy who died after an upstate New York car crash have fulfilled his wish that they get married , and they did it at the child 's funeral .
Amilcar Hill and Rahwa Ghirmatizion ( ger - MAT ' - ee - zahn ) got married during Monday 's funeral service in Buffalo for their son , Asa Hill .
Asa died a day after his grandfather 's car was involved a chain - reaction highway crash last week .
Hundreds of people packed the church for Asa 's funeral .
The couple surprised attendees by getting married , which the parents say their son had been asking them to do .
Amilcar Hill says
Asa 's organs were being donated to save other young lives .

Barrasso's response to this is to limply offer up the criticism that " we have not allowed the American people to read the bill , " which to my knowledge , does not contain a section entitled , " Oh By The Way , We Are All In Bed With Lobbyists , Like Whores . "
Smith continues to press the point : " But with every vote against the public option is a vote for the insurance companies , sir , it is . "
As much as I appreciate Smith for some informed support of the public option , it 's a far rarer thing to see someone in the media , anywhere , who 's willing to pin the blame for the degradation of the health care reform package on the toxic relationship between legislators and lobbyists .

THE first patient Dr Sherwin Nuland ever treated died horribly in front of him .
James McCarty , a 52 - year - old construction boss , had eaten too much red meat , smoked too many Camels and suffered a heart attack .
Dr Nuland , then but a student , was asked to keep an eye on him while he recuperated .
Suddenly , McCarty threw his head back , bellowed out a wordless roar and hit his own chest with balled fists .
His face turned purple , his eyes bulged out of his head , he took “ an immensely long gurgling breath ” — and he died .
Since this was half a century ago , Dr Nuland did what the textbooks then recommended .
He cut open his patient 's chest and tried , unsuccessfully , to massage his heart back to life with his bare hands .
It felt like “ a wet , jellylike bag of hyperactive worms ” .
And it did no good .
The “ dead McCarty … threw back his head once more [ and gave ] a dreadful rasping whoop that sounded like the hounds of hell were barking . ”
That story is one of several that make up “ How We Die ” , a book Dr Nuland wrote in 1993 , after a lifetime of watching the effects of terminal illness .
Because modern life is so clean and orderly , he argued , people expect to die with dignity .
But this may be wishful thinking : death can be dirty , ugly and often involves the “ disintegration of the dying person 's humanity ” .
Despite its gloominess , “ How We Die ” was a huge success , because it addressed with excruciating honesty mankind 's greatest fear .
The current debate about health - care reform is in part a debate about death , which is why it evokes such fear .
Some of this fear is absurd .
Outside a town - hall meeting in Reston , Virginia , last week , a few buffoons likened Barack Obama to Hitler .
But most of the protesters are sane .
Mr Obama plans to cover millions of uninsured people , says Brittany Tomaino , a young would - be oncologist .
He will have to find the money somewhere .
That means cuts to Medicare , the government health plan for the elderly , which covers her 95 - year - old grandfather , she reckons .
“ If he needs care , they 're going to give it to someone younger , ” she predicts .
A slim majority of Americans support Obamacare .
But that majority is declining , and the passion is mostly on the other side .
Pro-lifers , for example , worry that reform will mean taxpayer - funded abortions .
Half of all Americans believe this will happen .
Democrats point out that the bills in question do not mention abortion .
Pro-lifers respond that the language is vague enough to allow bureaucrats to add abortion funding after the bill is passed .
They also fret , like Ms Tomaino , that Mr Obama will deny life - saving treatment to Grandpa to save money .
This possibility alarms Grandpa , too .
Americans over 65 currently receive , through Medicare , fantastically generous health insurance for which they pay only a small fraction of the cost .
Only 23 % of them think Obamacare will make them better off , while a growing plurality think it will hurt them .
Health reformers always smash up against two unpalatable truths .
We are all going to die .
And the demand for interventions that might postpone that day far outstrips the supply .
No politician would be caught dead admitting this , of course : most promise that all will receive whatever is medically necessary .
But what does that mean ?
Should doctors seek to save the largest number of lives , or the largest number of years of life ?
Even in America , resources are finite .
No one doubts that $ 1,000 to save the life of a child is money well spent .
But what about $ 1 m to prolong a terminally ill patient 's painful life by a week ?
Also , who should pay ?
There are no easy answers .
Unfortunately for Mr Obama , some of his academic chums have pondered seriously and publicly about the questions .
Cass Sunstein , an adviser , has written extensively about which life - saving rules are most cost - effective .
Ezekiel Emanuel , a doctor whose brother is Mr Obama 's chief of staff , wrote a paper for the Lancet , a medical journal , in which he proposed a system for determining who should be first in line for such things as liver transplants or vaccines during an epidemic .
Among other factors , he suggested taking age into account , with adolescents and young adults getting priority , because they have fully developed personalities and many years of life ahead .
This may be philosophically defensible , but it is political poison —
Dr Emanuel even included a graph showing voters above and below the ideal age how much less their lives are worth .
Conservative talk radio predictably dubbed him “ Dr Death ” .
Republicans vowed last week to outlaw the rationing of care by age .
Blithe and distrustful
Mr Obama 's supporters say that objections to his reforms are largely based on misunderstanding , fuelled by Republican scaremongering .
They have a point .
But the Democrats ' bigger problem is that most Americans have pretty good health insurance and no idea how much it costs .
Taxpayers foot the bill for the old .
Most workers with employer - provided health insurance imagine that their employer is paying for it , when in fact it comes out of their wages .
Soaring medical inflation depresses Americans ' standard of living and threatens to bust the budget .
The system is riddled with waste .
Yet most Americans feel little urge to make it more efficient .
When asked if insurance firms should be obliged to pay for expensive treatments that have not been proved more effective than a cheaper alternative , 56 % say yes .
Few Americans have a clear idea how Obamacare will affect them — unsurprisingly , since even quite basic details are undecided .
The uninsured have the most to gain , but they are only 15 % of the population .
Everyone else has something to lose .
Many Americans do not trust the government to do anything much , let alone make decisions about life and death .
Small wonder Mr Obama finds the headwind against health reform so blustery .

* Virus found in 67 percent of chronic fatigue patients
* Findings show link to CSF , not proof of causation
* Discovery a major step toward treatment options
WASHINGTON , Oct 8 ( Reuters ) - A virus linked to prostate cancer also appears to play a role in chronic fatigue syndrome , according to research that could lead to the first drug treatments for a mysterious disorder that affects 17 million people worldwide .
Researchers found the virus , known as XMRV , in the blood of 68 out of 101 chronic fatigue syndrome patients .
The same virus showed up in only 8 of 218 healthy people , they reported on Thursday in the journal Science .
Judy Mikovits of the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Nevada and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute and the Cleveland Clinic emphasized that the finding only shows a link between the virus and chronic fatigue syndrome , or CFS , and does not prove that the pathogen causes the disorder .
Much more study would be necessary to show a direct link , but Mikovits said the study offers hope that CFS sufferers might gain relief from a cocktail of drugs designed to fight AIDS , cancer and inflammation .
" You can imagine a number of combination therapies that could be quite effective and could at least be used in clinical trials right away , " Mikovits said in a telephone interview .
She said AIDS drugs such as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and integrase inhibitors as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cancer - fighting proteasome inhibitors could be tested as potential treatments for CFS .
Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd
4502.T
makes a cancer drug called Velcade that is a proteasome inhibitor , although there are no reports that it has been tested against XMRV .
INCAPACITATING FATIGUE
CFS impairs the immune system and causes incapacitating fatigue , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Sufferers can also experience memory loss , problems with concentration , joint and muscle pain , headaches , tender lymph nodes and sore throats .
Symptoms last at least six months and can be as disabling as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis , the CDC said .
But Mikovits said there is currently no treatment for CFS aside from cognitive behavioral therapy to help patients cope with the disorder 's crippling effects .
The XMRV virus is a retrovirus , like the HIV virus that causes AIDS .
As with all viruses , a retrovirus copies its genetic code into the DNA of its host but uses RNA -- a working form of DNA -- instead of using DNA to do so .
Known formally as xenotropic murine leukemia virus - related virus , XMRV has also been found in some prostate tumors and is also known to cause leukemia and tumors in animals .
[ ID :nN07209255 ]
Mikovits ' team said further research must now determine whether XMRV directly causes CFS , is just a passenger virus in the suppressed immune systems of sufferers or a pathogen that acts in concert with other viruses that have been implicated in the disorder by previous research .
" Conceivably these viruses could be co-factors in pathogenesis , as is the case for HIV - mediated disease , where co-infecting pathogens play an important role , " the report said .
Because 3.7 percent of the healthy test population tested positive for XMRV , the researchers said several million otherwise healthy people in the United States could be infected with it .

Owners of property have a legal responsibility to keep their property safe and free of defects .
Unfortunately , many property owners fail in this regard and permit their property to become hazardous and dangerous .
Such conditions as broken and uneven sidewalks , ice and snow , poor lighting , missing or broken hand - rails and loose rugs are just a few examples of unsafe conditions that cause injury .

After all , that 's what had happened the decade before .
" Crowding out " is a major reason the UK suffered such a dearth of enterprise and investment in the 1970s , causing feeble growth and high unemployment .
And of all the world 's major economies , it 's the UK that 's now vulnerable to the same disease – given our massive fiscal deficit .
The verdict on the UK 's fiscal position was a mere footnote , though , among some far more grave IMF warnings .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. misled the public about the financial weakness of Bank of America and other early recipients of the government ’s $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout , creating “ unrealistic expectations ” about the companies and damaging the program ’s credibility , according to a report by the program ’s independent watchdog .
The federal government last October loaned Bank of America and eight other “ healthy ” financial institutions a total of $ 125 billion - the initial payout from the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP - in an attempt to avoid a series of major bank collapses that would push the sputtering economy into a free fall or depression .
The rationale for giving money to stable banks and not failing ones , regulators said , was that such institutions would be better able to lend money and thus unfreeze tight credit markets - a major factor in last year ’s Wall Street losses .
But an audit released Monday by TARP Special Inspector General Neil Barofsky says senior government officials and Wall Street regulators , including Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson , had “ affirmative concerns ” that several of the nine institutions were financially shaky .

“ By stating expressly that the ‘ healthy ’ institutions would be able to increase overall lending , Treasury may have created unrealistic expectations about the institutions ’ condition and their ability to increase lending , ” the audit says .
“ Treasury and the TARP program lost credibility when lending at those institutions did not in fact increase and when subsequent events - the further assistance needed by Citigroup and Bank of America being the most significant examples - demonstrated that at least some of those institutions were not in fact healthy . ”
The report makes no recommendations but argues that Treasury , the Federal Reserve and other federal agencies “ should take more care in publicly characterizing the nature and objectives of their initiatives . ”
Mr. Paulson , in an Oct. 14 , 2008 , statement announcing the original nine TARP recipients , described them as “ healthy institutions ” that “ have taken this step for the good of the U.S. economy . ”
The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ( FDIC ) similarly described the companies in news releases issued the same day .
Yet government officials and federal regulators privately were concerned that some of the institutions were financially stressed , the report says .
Two of the nine institutions - Bank of America and Citigroup - would receive billions of dollars more in separate bailouts later .
Another institution , Merrill Lynch , was hemorrhaging money for months before the enactment of TARP and was bought by Bank of America in January .
Regulators told auditors that the firms ’ health was less important than their interconnectedness and their overall importance to Wall Street .
They were chosen based on their size , the types of services they provided , and their collective importance to the overall economy , they said .
Executives at several of the nine institutions said they were reluctant to accept TARP funds - and the strings attached to them - but told auditors that federal officials forced them to take the money .
Officials at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and other federal regulators said it was important that all nine firms accept the money in order to instill investor confidence in Wall Street and to show that the nation ’s banking system “ can withstand any near - term credit loss . ”
Mr. Paulson stepped down as head of the Treasury Department in January .
He was succeed by Timothy F. Geithner , who , as head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during TARP ’s creation , also played a key role in crafting the scope of the program .
The Treasury Department , which at times has clashed with the TARP special inspector ’s office , took some issue with the audit ’s accusation that the agency lacks sufficient transparency .
“ While people may differ today on how the contemporaneous announcements about the reasons for selecting the initial nine recipients should have been phrased , any review of such announcements must be considered in light of the unprecedented circumstances in which they were made , ” Assistant Treasury Secretary Herb M. Allison Jr. , who oversees TARP , said in a written response to Mr. Barofsky .
However , the Federal Reserve generally agreed with the report ’s findings .
“ An important lesson illustrated by the events that shocked the financial systems over the past two years is that transparency and effective communication are important to restoring and maintaining public confidence , especially during a financial crisis , ” wrote Federal Reserve General Counsel Scott G. Alvarez .
The other initial TARP recipients were JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , the State Street Corp. and the Bank of New York Mellon .
The initial nine institutions collectively held more than $ 11 trillion in banking assets as of mid-2008 , or about 75 percent of all assets held by U.S. banks .
Treasury had disbursed about $ 361 billion of TARP money to more than 650 financial institutions as of July .
The report also concluded that Treasury , the Federal Reserve and the Bush administration last year acted responsibly when they pressed Bank of America to proceed with its planned buyout of Merrill Lynch .
Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lewis told Congress in June that the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve threatened to remove top executives of the bank unless the financial giant merged with the troubled Merrill Lynch for the good of the foundering economy .
Bank of America has received $ 45 billion in TARP funds , including $ 20 billion in January to help offset mounting losses at Merrill Lynch .
“ Former Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke believed that the already fragile financial system could further destabilize if the acquisition of Merrill Lynch failed , ” the audit said .

A Senate Estimates hearing has revealed that countermeasures put in place by secuirty professionals charged with protecting Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's web site contributed to the site 's failure in early September .
The attack , which saw the site become unavailable for 30 minutes and sluggish for several hours afterwards on September 9 , was publicised in advance by the ' Anonymous ' hacker group , to protest against the Government 's proposed web filter .
Mike Rothery , first assistant secretary of the National Security Resilience Policy Division within the Australian Government told a Senate Estimates committee on Monday that " a number of measures put in place to prepare for the attack actually contributed to the site being unavailable . "
Rothery said the Defence Signals Directorate knew about the possibility of an attack more than a week in advance and informed security personnel within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet accordingly .
To prepare for the attack , IT security professionals working for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet " reduced the number of concurrent users that could connect to the website , " Rothery said .
They had also " sought support from their internet service provider to manage an anticipated increase in demand . "
" That capacity was met very early , because the attack continued for about another 20 hours , " he explained .
" In fact , the attack was less than anticipated and some of the protective measures had been probably unnecessarily strict . "
Over time , he said , the security professionals realised that the restrictions on concurrent users was causing the site to appear offline .
" They turned that capacity up and were able to maintain the website despite the attack , " he said .
Rothery said the attack peaked at " a few thousand concurrent inquiries " on the Prime Minister 's web site .
Liberal Senator Guy Barnett said that " this did not seem like that many . "
" Surely a website can be appropriately protected from a few thousand hackers , " the Senator asked .
But Rothery defended the Government 's response , explaining to Senator Barnett that all websites are provisioned with capacity based on " what you would expect the normal traffic to be " .
" Otherwise you are paying for capacity that you are not using , " he said .
" A normal practice for any organisation , be it private sector or public sector is : if you assess that the normal peak demand is perhaps 200 concurrent users , you might buy the capacity for a few hundred more than that so that normal users would not notice any significant degradation should they all be on at the same time . "
Centrelink , he said by way of further example , would anticipate far more hits than the Prime Minister 's site , and would thus have " redundant capacity in excess of that " and a larger attack would be required to take its site down .
" The issue is that we do not allocate extremely large amounts of bandwidth , which government departments have to pay for on an ongoing lease basis , without there being a legitimate or identified business need for it , " he said .
Two phases
Rothery explained how the Distributed Denial of Service attack came in two surges .
“ The first was at 7 pm on Wednesday [ September 9 ] that week and there was another surge at 10 am [ September 10 ] on the next day , ” Rothery said .
He said that the second surge was “ slightly more severe ” but said adjustments - made prior to it - had prevented the site from being inaccessible .
“ There was a better balancing of the arrangements the next morning and , whilst the site became slower , it did not become unavailable , ” Rothery said .
Prime Minister briefed
It was also revealed that Prime Minister Kevin Rudd had personally been briefed through a report from the Attorney General ’s Department as to why his website was inaccessible on the night of September 9 .
“ The Attorney - General ’s Department coordinated a report on behalf of all of the agencies that were involved in managing the incident , with special emphasis on those arrangements around the protective measures and the mitigation measures , " Rothery said .
“ The report went to the Prime Minister . ”
The report came to the Minister the week following the incident , he said .
Prevention of future attacks
Rothery explained advice that had been given to government agencies in how they should deal with future attacks .
" The advice that we give to agencies ... is for them to have relationships with their internet service providers to be able to increase , for a short period , the amount of bandwidth allocated to a particular site until such time as either the attack can be disrupted or the attack wraps up for its own reasons , " Rothery said .
The attacks are believed to have been initiated by a group of protesters calling themselves Anonymous who launched the attack to protest against the Government 's proposed web filter , which the group describes as " draconian internet censorship " .
Charges were yet to be made and " inquiries " by the Australian Federal Police were still being looked into , Rothery said .
Recently I decided to throw my hat into the GitHub contest ring , the goal of which was to predict repositories that a GitHub user should watch .
It had been some years since I had really done anything intensive with artificial intelligence ( AI ) and I thought it would be fun .
I was also attracted to the bounty offered : an aged bottle of bourbon and a lifetime large GitHub account .
This post serves as my high - level recap of the contest .
While I had never worked on a recommendation system per se , I had done work with classifiers before .
Looking at the problem , my gut reaction was that an instance - based learning algorithm , such as k - nearest neighbors , would be the most effective approach .
I also anticipated the top three winning entries to end up somewhere in the 70 - 85 % accuracy range .
As it turns out , the best accuracy at the end of the contest was 56 % .
While it is possible that this prediction accuracy is the best that could be achieved with the data , my guess is the relatively short time allowed for the contest ( roughly a month ) made it difficult for a very strong entry in the contest .
Additionally , the prize offered likely only attracted amateur entries .
This is not to say the contestants were unskilled , just that I doubt the dedication shown for something such as the Netflix contest was exerted for the GitHub contest .
I decided to use the weighted k- nearest - neighbors algorithm as the basis for my submission .
In order to measure progress and avoid overfitting results , I used a stratified n- fold cross validation evaluation strategy .
The idea behind n- fold cross validation is to partition the dataset into proper subsets ( the “ fold ” ) that each maintain the underlying distribution of the full dataset .
This consisted of taking a stratified sample ( watcher ID , repository ID ) pairings , using the repository ID as the class value .
Once the n folds are created , one is used as a test set while the other n - 1 are used for training ; the process is repeated until every fold has the opportunity to be the test set ( the cross validation ) .
The average of the observed accuracies is used to mitigate the effect potential sampling bias .
My first approach was not terribly efficient , but I had taken the engineering approach of making it correct and then making it fast .
I was quite surprised when my first pass would n’t even run because it broke the MRI Ruby garbage collector .
This forced me to reduce the search space earlier than I had intended .
While I could have taken a stratified sample of the training data , I wanted to minimize data loss , so I opted to restructure the instance space into regions grouped by repository ancestry .
This reduced the instance space down from about 113,000 points to roughly 77,000 using 10 folds .
While an improvement , this reduced space still proved to be too large to perform full evaluations over doing pairwise comparisons ( a O ( n2 ) approach ) .
Other pruning methods , such as removing regions with single repositories or single watchers , further reduced the search space , but at the cost of accuracy .
The next step , thus , was to devise a search strategy that attempted to find the regions that the test instance belonged to , while avoiding those that the instance did not .
I tried several heuristics with varying degrees of success .
Empirical evidence suggested that if a test instance either watched 25 % or more of an owner ’s repositories or 25 % of the test instance ’s repositories were owned by the same person , that the test instance would be likely to watch other repositories owned by that person .
For my final submission the search heuristic I used considered all the regions that the test instance was already known to belong to and regions that contained repositories that were owned by any repository owner that the test instance was known to watch a substantial portion of .
Simply finding the correct regions was n’t sufficient , however .
Once the regions were chosen there was still the matter of choosing the correct repositories from those regions .
I found that using the most forked repository per region was generally the correct one .
A minor accuracy boost was achieved by evaluating the parent of any repository that a test instance was known to be watching , working under the observation that watchers tended to watch parent repositories when watching one of that repository ’s children .
Evaluations were performed by calculating the Euclidian distance between two repositories .
My first approaches were pure distances and yielded symmetric results .
As the project evolved , however , I found myself augmenting the definition of distance to be a route taken between two repositories by a given training instance and even adopted some aspects of Hamming distance .
This meant that for two repositories r 1 and r 2 , given training instances t 1 and t 2 , the distance between r 1 and r 2 could vary depending on characteristics of t 1 and t 2 .
While this may not be a strict Euclidian distance calculation , I likened it to modes of transportation .
E.g. , the distance between two city centers may be fixed for a straight line , but can vary considerably if one chooses to walk versus take a train .
The distance calculation weighted different attributes based upon observations of the shape of the training data .
The attributes I ended up using were : parent - child relationships , general common ancestry , common owner , and common watchers .
I had planned on using a genetic algorithm to optimize the weighting system , but ran out of time before the end of the contest .
I had two goals when starting this project : 1 ) win the contest ; and 2 ) learn more about Ruby .
Unfortunately , achieving the latter may have come at the expense of the former .
In the end , I achieved slightly over 40 % accuracy , which was a far cry from where I had expected to end up and was n’t enough to win the contest .
My original choice of technology stack was not appropriate .
In most of my previous AI projects I used Java with a smattering Python and to a lesser extent , ML and LISP .
Having been using Ruby as my primary programming language for the past year and a half , I thought I would use it for my contest entry .
I spent roughly three weeks trying to optimize a Ruby solution that could only achieve 31 % accuracy after a seven hour run on a quad core machine with 4 GB RAM .
During the last week of the contest , I rewrote the project in Java and achieved 40 % accuracy with a 10 minute long run on a dual core MacBook Pro .
I plan on elaborating on that a bit in a future post .
[ Edit : ( Sept. 17 , 2009 ) I ’ve now published the post comparing my Ruby and Java entries ]

Liverpool are ready to rekindle their interest in Stoke 's Ryan Shawcross , skysports.com understands .
Stoke defender linked with Liverpool switch
Liverpool are ready to rekindle their interest in Stoke 's Ryan Shawcross when the transfer window reopens , understands .
Shawcross is one of the most sought - after young defenders in the Premier League after catching the eye at Stoke following his arrival from Manchester United in 2007 .
The England Under - 21 international has established himself as one of the most promising players in the Premier League and he is a key member of Tony Pulis ' squad .
Liverpool are believed to have sounded out a move for Shawcross in the summer , but were put off by Stoke 's price tag .
Shawcross ' former club Manchester United , Arsenal , Fulham and Everton are also believed to be admirers of the powerful centre - back .
Liverpool have been keeping tabs on Shawcross ' progress this season and they are now thought to be ready to make a firm move for the 22 - year - old in January .
Reds boss Rafa Benitez is understood to be keen to bolster his defensive ranks and increase the number of English - born players in his squad , and Shawcross fits the bill as to the type of player he wants .
Stoke have opened talks with Shawcross about a new deal at the Britannia Stadium in a bid to stave off interest from the Premier League 's elite , but as yet no new contract has been agreed .
However , any move from Liverpool would depend on them raising the funds to persuade Stoke to cash - in on Shawcross .
Distracted drivers  including those sending and reading text messages from behind the wheel  caused the deaths of nearly 6,000 people in 2008 , according to Wednesday data from the Department of Transportation .
Distracted drivers  including those sending and reading text messages from behind the wheel  caused the deaths of nearly 6,000 people in 2008 , according to Wednesday data from the Department of Transportation .
" Every single time someone takes their eyes or their focus off the road - even for just a few seconds - they put their lives and the lives of others in danger , " Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said at the opening of a two - day D.C. summit on distracted driving .
" Distracted driving is unsafe , irresponsible and in a split second , its consequences can be devastating . "
Driving distractions can also include eating , drinking , conversing with passengers , or interaction with in - vehicle technologies and portable electronic devices .
In addition to the almost 6,000 people who died last year , more than half a million people were injured by distracted drivers , according to Wednesday findings from DOT and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
Driver distraction was involved in 16 percent of all fatal crashes last year .
On any given day , there are about 800,000 cars on the road being driven by someone using a handheld cell phone .
The worst offenders , DOT found , were young drivers  men and women under 20 years of age , but the problem is present among all age groups .
" We now know that the worst offenders are the youngest , least experienced drivers , " said Secretary LaHood .
" Unfortunately though , the problem does n't end there .
Distracted driving occurs across all age groups and all modes of transportation , from cars to buses and trucks to trains . "
The department has commissioned a new study from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ( FMCSA ) , which will study the connection between cell phone use and traffic accidents , LaHood said .
Data will be gathered from now through June 2010 .
Members of Congress have already crafted legislation dealing with this issue .
In July , Sen. Charles Schumer , a New York Democrat , introduced the Alert Drivers Act , which would require states to enact driving while texting or e-mailing bans or risk losing federal funds .
Within six months of the bill 's enactment , states would be required to put such bans in effect or risk losing 25 percent of their annual federal highway funding for each year they fail to comply .
" We need a ban on texting while driving in every state and we need it now , " Schumer told summmit attendees .
A similar initiative was used when trying to impose a national drinking age , Schumer said .
In 1984 , Congress enacted a law that withheld 10 percent of state highway funds from states that failed to increase their drinking age to 21 .
Within five years , all U.S. states had complied , Schumer said .
" Sometimes the states need a little tough love to get them to go along , " he said .
A July study from the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute found that texting while driving increases the risk of crashing by 20 times .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi , along with fellow Democratic Reps. George Miller , Steny Hoyer , Dave Obey , John Larson and Charles Rangel , has been shepherding health care legislation through the House .
Dems double down on health care
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny
Hoyer are double - teaming powerful chairmen and rank - and - file members to save health care reform from a repeat of the Democratic Party infighting that helped kill it in 1994 .
In a closed - door session Tuesday , Pelosi assured rank - and - file Democrats that she wo n’t move forward on a bill without their consent .
“ We have to hear from you , ” one participant quoted Pelosi as saying .

In a separate closed - door session in the speaker ’s office , Pelosi and Hoyer urged Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller ( D - Calif . ) , Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel ( D - N.Y. ) and Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) to heed the concerns of moderate Democrats .
That meeting came on the heels of a joint memo prepared by top aides to the speaker and the majority leader .
While Hoyer has been marshaling support for health care reform for months , Pelosi ’s increasingly hands - on involvement reflects the pressure to move quickly on President Barack Obama ’s top first - year legislative priority — and it ’s a signal that there ’s no daylight to exploit between the speaker and her No. 2 .
“ The point is to send a message clearly that they ’re not going to play the speaker off of Hoyer on this stuff , ” said a Democratic health care lobbyist .
Waxman , Miller and Rangel — along with their respective aides — are trying to draft legislation in concert with each other so their committees will take up the same bill later this summer .
“ This is the year we have to do it , ” Waxman told reporters after the caucus meeting .
“ There ’s an overwhelming commitment to getting this done . ”
“ We ’ll all go together , ” Miller said Tuesday .
“ Ultimately , ” said Rep. John Larson ( D - Conn . ) , “ our job is to come together as a caucus . ”
But that ’s easier said than done — especially on an issue as contentious as this one .

Moderate Democrats have been warning their leaders for weeks against pushing proposals that undermine the private market , particularly a so - called public option that could dissuade consumers or businesses from purchasing private insurance .
In a letter to their leaders last week , fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrats said a public option should be created only if insurance market reforms and increased competition do n’t lower costs on their own .
Rangel and Waxman have both rejected this argument .
“ Everyone ca n’t get everything , ” Waxman told reporters Tuesday .
“ Why should private companies object to competition ? ”
In addition , both the Blue Dogs and members of the New Democratic Coalition want to make sure the public plan is n’t based on Medicare rules ; they want the plan to pay for itself and operate under the same guidelines as private plans .
But more - liberal members want a more expansive — and expensive — plan .
During the closed - door session Tuesday , Rep. Brian Baird ( D - Wash . ) told colleagues that any bill should include mental health and dental insurance .
California Rep. Pete Stark , an outspoken liberal who chairs the Health Subcommittee on Ways and Means , would like to see more government funding than party leaders will allow .
But he predicted that members will put their individual priorities aside in the hopes of getting a bill through Congress .
“ This is not going to be the bill I ’d write , ” he joked Tuesday .
Plenty of hurdles are sure to arise as the committees draft a bill .
But after making numerous concessions in the climate change measure that recently cleared the Energy and Commerce panel , Pelosi seems more reluctant to make fundamental concessions on this bill .
“ We have to have something that works , not just that passes the House , ” she reminded her members Tuesday , according to the notes of one person present .
But she is cognizant of the political concerns .
“ She wants to get stuff done but she wants to protect her members , and I think that ’s always on her mind , ” said a Democratic health care lobbyist .
“ She does a good job protecting those members .
She ’s just a damn good inside pol , and she protects her flock . ”
The most impassioned appeal for unity Tuesday came from Michigan Rep. John Dingell , the dean of the House deposed by Waxman late last year as chairman of the Energy and Commerce panel .
Dingell has offered a universal health care bill every year since he came to Congress in 1955 .
Toward the end of Tuesday ’s caucus meeting , he rose on his crutches and told the audience that this measure has the promise of becoming a legacy like Social Security — a program his father helped create in the 1930s .
As he closed , he told members they should have the courage to move forward , eliciting a standing ovation from his fellow Democrats .
Pelosi announced Tuesday that the bill will bear Dingell ’s name .
House Democrats expect to introduce actual legislation next week , Waxman and others said Tuesday .
The preliminary goal is to move legislation out of the committees by the Fourth of July and then clear the House by the August recess , setting up a fall showdown with the Senate over a final bill .
Democrats on Sen . Ted Kennedy ’s Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee Tuesday released a 615 - page bill , but details on the most contentious issues , such as the public insurance option and the employer mandate , were left out for now .
Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) said he did n’t fill in the blanks in those areas because “ I wanted my Republican colleagues on the committee to know I wanted to their ideas .
I want to hear what they have to say . ”
The bill calls for insurance market reforms , a prohibition on insurers ’ denying coverage to sick people , a mandate on individuals to own coverage and the creation of marketplaces where people can compare and buy coverage .
Opinions on the bill are decidedly mixed .
R. Bruce Josten , a lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , said , “ We are disappointed , clearly . ”
He participated in weekly meetings with Kennedy ’s committee , and the bill that resulted suggests “ the only person who has skin in the game is the employers , ” Josten said .
On the other side , Andy Stern , president of the Service Employees International Union , issued a statement praising Kennedy and his committee for channeling their “ courage and passion into a vision of reform that provides Americans with more choices and more affordable health care options , including one guaranteed by the government that puts the good of the American people ahead of profits . ”

Riding a bicycle has many advantages .
As you do not have to register bicycles or obey any road rules , I am currently constructing a four person family bicycle which consists of two bicycles welded together with four armchairs in between .
Due to the extra weight , I have added an engine and am devising a roof , doors and storage area at the back allowing us to ride in all weather conditions and take it shopping .
Sometimes when I am riding my bicycle I feel like I am the only person on the road .
If I have my earphones in and the iPod turned up really loud , I cannot hear the car horns and people yelling " Get off the fucking road . "
Little compares to the exhilaration of listening to Queen 's ' Bicycle ' while riding in the centre of a lane at half the speed limit with several hundred cars banked up behind me during peak hour traffic .
Riding a bicycle is also an excellent way to quickly go downhill .
Correct bicycling speed and positionI am often asked why my Spandex® bicycle riding costume features eight hundred and thirty corporate sponsorship logos even though I do not actually have a sponsor .
The reason for this is simple .
For every thirty male bicycle riders there is one female bicycle rider and , as in nature where the most adorned peacock gets the peahen , the male bicycle rider with the most brightly coloured Spandex ® and most corporate sponsorship logos gets to mate with her .
Things that are almost as good as riding my bicycle : 1. Looking at my bicycle2 .
Talking about my bicycle3 .
Watching television programs that feature people riding bicycles4 .
CheeseRoad safety is an important component and basic precaution needs to be undertaken .
Once when I was riding my bicycle at great speed , I developed speed wobble and was thrown , rolling several times and sliding several metres , towards a busy intersection .
I was lucky enough not to enter the flow of traffic thanks only to friction .
As bicycles do not come with safety airbags , I now carry an inflatable raft and pump with me at all times .
A lot of people choose not to ride a bicycle because they are too embarrassed to wear a crash helmet but by painting the helmet light brown , it can easily be disguised as a large mushroom .

People often say to me " That 's a nice bicycle John " and I reply , " Yes , it is made out of a titanium composite alloy such as NASA uses on the space shuttle and it has Shimano gears which are the best . "
Just a few weeks ago , while I was taking a rest from riding my bicycle on a park bench , a man walking past said to me " That 's a nice bicycle , can I take it for a ride ?
I will bring it right back " and I said " Sure , but be careful because it is made out of a titanium composite alloy such as NASA uses on the space shuttle and it has Shimano gears which are the best . "
This week , game players and enthusiasts from 40 countries will descend upon Las Vegas to compete in the Monopoly World Championship , held roughly every four years .
The winner of the Hasbro Inc. - sponsored tournament will take home $ 20,580 -- the precise sum stashed in the title 's make - believe bank .
But one man who is perhaps the game 's most obsessive follower wo n't be attending .
Ralph Anspach , an 83 - year - old economics professor , spent decades locked in a real - life battle with Monopoly and its corporate owners .
The campaign dented his finances , sent him on a nationwide trek for intelligence and sparked a legal case that reached the steps of the Supreme Court .
Prof .
Anspach 's woes began with a real - life trademark fight for the right to sell his own game , called Anti-Monopoly .
Along the way , he says he helped to publicize the little - known origins of the classic American game .
The official history of Monopoly , a version of which appears on Hasbro 's Web site , describes how Charles B. Darrow developed Monopoly during the Great Depression .
Parker Brothers , which was later acquired by Hasbro , bought the impoverished heater salesman 's patent in 1935 and registered the Monopoly trademark .
Since then , the company says , an estimated 750 million copies of Monopoly have been sold worldwide .
August 21 , 2009 - Corey Peters
We thought you might be interested in seeing some of the " behind the scenes " work that goes on in Team Fortress 2 .
The process usually starts with a team discussion :
This helps us determine the goals of the map we 're going to build .
In this case , we wanted a game mode that had an intense , centralized experience with quick player turnaround .
We liked some of the facets of Arena mode , but it was clear that many players do n't like to wait for the next round to play .
The sooner we could prototype the new mode , the sooner we could start gathering data on it .
To this end , we converted some of the existing arena maps and started experimenting .
Some were more successful than others .
We quickly found out that fun arena maps were n't necessarily fun KOTH maps .
Playtesting the new mode on existing maps helped us explore various ideas that we used to generate rough sketches of what would become Viaduct .
In order to get some real data on its success or failure as fast as possible , we used Hammer to quickly turn the sketches into a very rough version of the map .
Then we started playing .
Here 's a timelapse video showing the evolution of Viaduct :
If you wish to watch this video , you will need to Download the Flash plugin .
If you wish to watch this video , you will need to Download the Flash plugin .
Here 's another that shows the map coming together as a whole :
We playtest daily .
Almost every version you can see in the timelapse video was at one point tested with a mix of experienced and new players .
That way , decisions are driven by the observations and feedback generated by the test .
As an example , at one point several sessions in , it felt as though the player was n't being given enough of a " cool - down " period after being in the action at the control point .
The pacing was actually too intense .
In addition , teams that captured the zone felt they had no space in which to keep control , due to the continuous stream of enemies pouring into the space .
This devalued some classes significantly , like the Engineer .
We were able to address both of these issues through the creation of an area in front of the respawn rooms .
This allowed us to push the spawn points further away from the control point .
Once the map started progressively improving in terms of playability , we started to feel more confident about the new game mode .
Now the art pass could begin .
We were still playtesting the map throughout this phase , though the layout changes tend to be on a smaller scale ( such as moving health and ammo , adjusting jump distances between objects for classes , and addressing sniper sight line issues ) .
The snow , as you can see from the timelapse , was a late addition the idea was put forward to extend the alpine theme and provide a new , visually interesting space to fight in .
Due to popular demand , the Classless Update Day Two " Medic and Heavy " image is now available as a downloadable wallpaper , available in either 1600x1200 or dual monitor 2560x1024 .

A better view of the asylum - seeker league tables
The last post looked at how many applications for asylum Australia and other countries have received this year on a per capita basis .
The top three countries in the resulting league table are Malta , Cyprus and Norway and their figures are so much higher than other countries that they skew the data , making it hard to differentiate the lower rankings .
To remedy this , I have reproduced the chart using a logarithmic scale .
Asylum - seekers per capita 2009
One commenter rightly pointed out that the top three countries are not necessarily finding life easy with such high numbers of asylum - seekers .
Malta has been criticised for using excessive force in immigration detention centres .
Cyprus is receiving a large number of applications , but it appears that far fewer are being allowed to stay , although I am sure that , in his new role as UN envoy to Cyprus , Alexander Downer will be able to give them a few pointers on how to spin this for the media .
Even in Norway , dealing with asylum - seekers has become a heated issue .
The chart shows that Australia , sitting in 20th place in the international ranking , has an asylum - application rate per capita that is just below the average across the countries listed by the UNHCR .
Looking at the league table ranked by each country ’s wealth , we are even further down the list , in 24th place .
Asylum - seekers by economy size 2009
Political debate on the subject of refugees is probably inevitable , but it is worth trying to keep a cool head and get some perspective from the numbers .
Australia is a long way away from most of the rest of the world , so it should not come as a surprise that we get only a modest number of asylum - seekers by international standards .
Unfortunately , this fact is unlikely to penetrate the consciousness of the more hysterical commentators .
Data sources : asylum - seeker application counts from the UNCHR , population and Gross Domestic Product from the CIA World Factbook .

Nasa Fermi telescope uncovers proof of famous space - time theory
Racing across the Universe for the last 7.3 - billion - years , two highly charged particles have arrived at Nasa 's Fermi Gamma -ray Space Telescope within a second of one another .
Excited scientists believe this could be evidence of Einstein 's space - time theory .
The photons were launched on their marathon during a short gamma-ray burst , an outpouring of radiation likely generated by the collision of two neutron stars , the densest known objects in the Universe .
One of the photons possessed a million times more energy that the other but they arrived at almost the same time .
In this illustration , one photon ( purple ) carries a million times the energy of another ( yellow ) .
Some theorists predict travel delays for higher - energy photons .
Yet Fermi data failed to show this effect
In Einstein 's vision of a unified space - time all forms of electromagnetic radiation , from gamma rays through to X - rays , are thought to travel through the vacuum of space at the same speed , no matter how much energy they have .
But in some new theories of gravity , space - time is considered to have a ' shifting , frothy structure ' when viewed at a scale trillions of times smaller than an electron .
These new models of the Universe say this ' foamy texture ' would slow down the higher - energy photon relative to the lower energy one .
The Fermi Telescope results showed this did not happen as scientists believe the nine - tenths of a second gap , when spread over more than seven billion years , is too small to be significant .
Professor Peter Michelson from Stanford University said : ' This measurement eliminates any approach to a new theory of gravity that predicts a strong energy - dependent change in the speed of light . '
The principal investigator for Fermi's Large Area Telescope ( LAT ) concluded : ' To one part in 100 million billion , these two photons traveled at the same speed .
Einstein still rules .'
Professor Michelson 's team has published a paper on the findings in the online version of the journal Nature .
Physicists have yearned for years to develop a unifying theory of how the universe works .
But no one has been able to come up with one that brings all four of the fundamental forces in the universe into one tent .
The Standard Model of particle physics is considered to have succeeded in unifying three of the four .
These are the ' strong force ' that holds nuclei together inside atoms and the ' weak force ' that is responsible for radioactive decay and electromagnetism .
However gravity has always been the odd man out in this model .
Though a host of theories have been advanced , none has been shown successful .
Albert Einstein's theories of relativity also fail to unify the four forces but the latest evidence suggests he was nearer to the truth than many modern theories .

FP - Syd # 18 .
Way back on August 23rd we held the 18th meeting of FP - Syd , the Sydney Functional Programming group .
As usual , the meeting was held at Google 's Sydney offices and we had about 24 people attend to hear our two presenters .
First up we had Mark Wotton and his presentation " Testing By Convention and Flow " .
TBC ( on Hackage ) is a harness for running tests written with HUnit or Quickcheck .
The main idea is that if your tests are written to follow a set of conventions , a lot of the boiler can be skipped used TBC .
The second presentation was by Ben Lippmeier on his work on getting Haskell 's GHC compiler working on SUN's OpenSparc T2 processor .
The OpenSparc T2 is interesting because it has 8 cores per processor and 8 hardware threads per core and hence is an interesting target for GHC 's parallel evaluation model .
A big thanks to Shane Stephens and Google for providing the meeting venue and some light refreshments .

Responding to Sterling 's " 18 Challenges " ( Part 1/3 )
If you want to write fiction and get paid for it , you can't sit back in a velvet armchair anymore and wait for the world to catch up with your genius .
If you seriously believe in the transformative power of fiction and believe that people who tell compelling and beautiful stories ought to be compensated for what they do , then you are going to have to get out there and fight for it .
That 's how you can tell the real writers from the amateurs these days .
The real writers are mad , blithering , and armed .
The amateurs are forlorn , wistful , and think somebody is coming to their rescue .
This is a new global world with real threats to expression , and unless writers start fighting the real fights instead of the pretend ones , fiction writers are going to disappear down fashion 's navel , becoming as irrelevant and useless to society as opera composers or rice - grain miniaturists .
But what are the new threats ?
What are the real fights ?
Frozen fascists are not waiting in German bunkers to finally burn the world 's " controversial " books , and there are no government subcommittees clacking their Masonic rings together as they fold their hands and contemplate the pornographic implications of modernism .
On the internet , you can watch people fuck each other with their own shit , cook human flesh that has been legally willed to them , and wear bear suits while eating Crisco right out of the jar , lathering their genitalia preparatory to intense , jowl - shaking masturbation sessions ( complete with authentic bear noises ) .
" Controversy " in fiction is dead .
When was the last time the public cared when a fiction writer said anything controversial ?
The 1960s ?
Ballard ?
The outing of Dumbledore ?
Fiction writers !
Fear the reality of obsolescence , not last century 's unhelpful paranoia !
Publishing companies are n't going to fight for you .
They are middle management .
They are the people who squirt you with water , call you " champ , " and cut your swollen eyebone .
They are useful and necessary , but they are n't in the ring and never have been .
You are on your own , and you need to know what that means .
Science fiction author and futurist Bruce Sterling has laid out " 18 Challenges Facing Contemporary Literature " over at his blog " Beyond the Beyond . "
They are all good points and they deserve clash .
Literature requires an intense and focused mastery of one specific language , whereas globalization seems to contort works into their simplest form ( movies , comics , commercials ) .
However , there are many notable examples of writers who are more successful writing in an acquired language rather than their native tongue , such as Beckett and Nabokov .
Additionally , Joyce is proof that learning as many languages as possible will increase the linguistic weapons at your disposal if you like tricks and flourishes .
These exceptions , however , prove the rule that a lifetime learning the hidden channels of power within a single language is no longer a sexy road to becoming one of the global elite .
The very nature of a piece of literature written in a specific , difficult language is a hostile gesture in a world where greater emphasis is placed on accepting other nationalities and cultures at face value than on history .
Yet , we pick new languages to learn because we want to see how they operate at their most subtle .
Who learns Russian without wanting to read Dostoevsky ?
Who learns French without curiosity about Baudelaire ?
The difficult treasures at the bottom of these languages are what pull people into them , and mere " communication " is not what keeps a language alive .
Lack of artistic compost within a language kills the garden where readers grow .
Literature does not have to change to become more global and polyglot .
But the translation nexus does .
Fiction writers should seek to learn at least one other language as well as they know their own , and these authors must then do their time at translation , translating books that they particularly like back and forth between languages to satisfy a worldwide base of thoughtful , polyglot fiction enthusiasts .
Complete dedication to this project is no longer necessary to achieve sufficient ends .
Translation of classic ' belles lettres ' using an open source wiki model could be an efficient method for opening up world literature .
Both amateurs and professional writers could dip into their favorite " public domain " works as hobbies , editing now and then , making suggestions when it suits them .
Over time , perfection could be achieved in these translated works , giving people a reason to continue to create powerful new narratives in their own exclusive languages that will compel others toward more ambitious translation initiatives .
If publishers put new work out in embedded flash drive sculptures instead of as paper books , they will be able to include original versions in original languages alongside every translation , also offering new translations as they are completed inside this " seed . "
With access to more books in other languages , people will find it easier to practice reading new tongues and publishers will have an incentive to cater to this market for fresh new books from exciting foreign lands .
Literature is exclusive ; contemporary society is inclusive .
But technology is good at both breaking down doors and at building new rooms .
The aims of technology and literature are one and the same : keeping the human animal curious enough to continue striving for the many frontiers of being .
This is temporary .
The printed word is still the most efficient means of communication between two people and will be until we develop ESP .
Reading is much faster than listening and words are nothing but crystallized images .
Just look at Chinese characters .
" What 's writing ? " asks the young gelfling male in the " Dark Crystal . " " Words that stay , " answers the young gelfling female .
Additionally , the fruits of literacy are so powerful there will always be hegemony for those who partake .
Functional literacy makes you strange , creative , powerful , logical , and empathetic .
Writing is thought ; writing is thinking .
These " vernacular means of everyday communication " are simply trial balloons .
Printed text will be the last to arrive in these " vernacular " quadrants , because when it finally shows up , it will be the big , bold , immovable beast that redefines everything .
These vernacular forms of discourse have simply been guinea pigs , tests to see if these new technologies can handle the load of literature , the highest human art .
Brave illiterates have always been the first pioneers .
If they survive the hard winters and plagues , civilization follows .
Digital readers are already the hot new tech commodity these days , signifying that printed text will always eventually arrive in a gilded carriage wherever " vernacular media " may toil and sweat .
Good riddance .
Writers and publishers need a new product , and " ebooks " are n't good enough .
See " Wunderkammer Seeds : A Fantasia " for a possible solution .
Writers may no longer be able to protect their work from piracy , but that does n't mean there are n't ways to add value to writing once again by adopting publishing methods that actively resist duplication .
Destabilized , like a wall between earth and heaven , ready to topple , letting the angels out and the good people in .
See " With the Espresso Book Machine , Suddenly You Are an ' Electronic Publishing Company ' or You Are Nothing " for further analysis .
There are better uses for wood than books .
When books do n't sell , the publishers burn them .
The process is called " remaindering . "
More books get burned by publishers every year than by any fascist superstate .
Adopting widespread print - on - demand technologies in bookstores will ensure that every book printed is a book someone wants .
The very idea of " remaindering " disgusts me and breaks my heart , like how starving people must have felt watching farmers burn oranges during the Great Depression .
No argument here .
Fiction writers have no place to train these days , and very few ways to make money while writing the experimental novels and short stories that help them find their voices .
However , this may be a natural correction .
The grim writing economy makes writers have to take jobs in the service and manufacturing sectors , which gives them direct access to the people for whom they should be writing in the first place .
By learning how to write for people who think literature is not for them , writers may spark a forgotten underclass with a new - found love of stories and writing .
The failure of newspapers and magazines is a bigger problem .
However , these institutions were n't saying anything interesting in the first place and , in many ways , they deserve to die .
Can blogging be monetized ?
Probably not .
Getting members of my generation to pay for anything on the internet than can be acquired for free will be impossible .
If there is no money in writing , there will be no fame in it .
If there is no money or fame , then who will want to do it ?
The right people , I say .
The people who love it .
The people who have no choice .
With less static , real storytellers will have an easier time getting heard .
If real storytellers get heard , people will start loving fiction again .
Money will show up .
The cycle will begin again .
WIth all the company 's riches , why is a Goldman Sachs ( GS ) subsidiary getting a $ 3 million earmark from Washington ?
Politico : A mining company owned by Goldman Sachs and two private equity funds is in line to get a $ 3 million earmark for work at a rare earth elements mine in Mountain Pass , Calif .
— raising questions as to why Congress would take on some of the risk for a bailed - out investment giant that ’s already making a profit .
As the article notes , Molycorp 's mine is a rich source of elements used to produce powerful magnets for precision - guided weapons , hand - held communication devices , wind turbines and hybrid cars .
California Republican Rep. Jerry Lewis inserted the earmark for the mine into the House Defense appropriations bill , reasoning that it 's a national security concern .
The other major source for the minerals , China , could cut exports .
This concern is fair , though probably overblown .
There 's a lot of hype about China limiting exports of so - called rare earth metals , but that 's far from clear -- plus , how does the taxpayer subsidizing Goldman Sachs change anything ?
Of course , the chance to line up at the government trough is a big reason why companies get into areas relating to green or weaponry .
Goldman and Molycorp did n't immediately respond to our requests for comment .
Part 1 of article
At first I was getting emails like this once a week .
Then it became a daily occurrence .
By now , it ’s a barrage .
“ Dear Mr. Lapid , ” writes Moshe from Raanana , or Hanna from Ofakim , or Rickey from Haifa .
“ In light of the haredi unruliness in recent weeks , I urge you to consider the reestablishment of the Shinui party .
The time has come to put an end to these shameless displays . ”
These emails usually include an attachment containing selected quotes from the haredi media which the writers present in order to outrage me .
Here are a few brief samples :
“ Anti-Semitism did not disappear with the Nazis , ” writes Prime Minister Prize winner Chaim Walder .
” It was internalized by many Jews … they simply decided to replace their persecutors and continue their work here . ”
Meanwhile , religious newspaper Yated Ne’eman charges : “ The ideological perverts also knows as seculars …are beasts .
Sophisticated beasts perhaps , as their external appearance is human . ”
And after Moshe or Hanna or Rickey are done with expressing their opinion ( “ Why does n’t anyone sue them ? ” ) they always note that their neighbors feel the same way and will be happy to offer support and paint the walls at the neglected Shinui branch in their neighborhood , in case I ’m considering the matter .
I am not considering the matter , and I think that had my last name not been “ Lapid , ” the letters would reach a more appropriate address .
But perhaps the haredim should consider this matter .
I was not among the founders of Shinui , but I was watching from up close , and I can attest that the circumstances at that time were quite similar to what is happening right now .
As opposed to the myths prevalent in Bnei Brak and in Mea Shearim , Shinui ’s establishment was not promoted by hatred for the ultra-Orthodox .
It won 15 Knesset seats not because they are haredim , but rather , despite the fact they are haredim .
The average secular does not hate haredim .
They remind him to a large extent of his grandfather , and he wishes to live in a Jewish state where the family sits around the Seder table , where there are no cars on the streets on Yom Kippur , and where the State of Israel ’s official emblem – the Menorah – is a duplication of the Menorah described in the book of Exodus ; the one that was placed in the Temple .
Seculars know , even if they do n’t think about it every day , that Judaism was preserved in the Diaspora thanks to the haredim .
The fact that they insist on maintaining their reclusive customs in the Jewish State may appear weird , perhaps , but we understand the haredi fear of the secular world ’s temptations .
As long as the haredim make do with this , we only have one disagreement with them :
The fact that they do not serve in the IDF .
In many ways , even when it comes to this issue , we can only blame ourselves .
We were wrong to allow the debate about military service to focus on the question of whether they will be “ wasting ” three years instead of studying the Torah .
Those lost years are not the problem of a young person who joins the army , but rather , the chance that he ’ll return in a black body bag .
The issue here is that some people in this country may die for the sake of the State of Israel ’s existence , while other people are exempt from this risk .
Nonetheless , we forgave .
As long as the haredim were a quiet minority that merely seeks to maintain its separatist way of life , they did not bother anyone .
However , in the years before Shinui ’s establishment this balance was wrecked .
The haredim came out of the Jewish closet and decided to run our lives .
Yeshiva and religious services budgets kept on growing , time and again we discovered cases of corruption and bribery , haredi protests became violent , they made pretenses of telling us where we ’re allowed to park , when we ’re allowed to shop , and what we ’re allowed to eat .
Their blatant contempt for us became increasingly blunter , until the seculars got sick and tired of it , and Shinui was established .
Jonathan Hickman blasts into the Marvel Universe , and he brings Nick Fury with him , as the super - spy popularized by Steranko maintains his classic sense of “ cool ” , refuting the modern - day “ kewl ” methods of cinema spies like James Bond and Jason Bourne as he attempts to take down his greatest threat to date .
Can someone please explain how in the world this guy is on television ?
You'd think that he'd be too nutty even for Fox , but no .
He 's the star of their lineup , the face of their network .
It 's your modern conservative movement , in a nutshell .

Clare Irby allegedly abused flight attendants A drunken mother revealed her G - string on a flight to Heathrow Airport and allowed a fellow passenger to fondle her , Isleworth Crown Court has heard .
Clare Irby , a member of the Guinness brewing dynasty , was flying from Bangalore on Kingfisher Airlines on 26 March when the incident occurred .
Captain Vivek Sondhi told jurors
Ms Irby , who was with her son , aged two , was " on the verge of being dangerous " .
Ms Irby , 30 , of Fulham , west London , denies being drunk on an aircraft .
She told the court that she had drunk " maybe four or five " glasses of red wine on the flight but was only " tipsy " .
Fondling denial
She said : " I was still fully functioning with all my faculties .
I was n't drunk . "
Ms Irby said she spoke to fellow passenger , Daniel Melia , but said : " I can assure you no - one touched my breasts . "
She denied there was any issue with the way she changed her clothes on the flight , saying she took care to protect her dignity .
However she admitted talking loudly , saying that her son " does n't listen to me if I whisper " .
Ms Irby criticised the flight attendants and said : " I did n't feel that they were particularly pleased by having a single parent and child , for some reason . "
The court heard that when police described Ms Irby 's alleged behaviour , she told them : " It sounds like I 'm hearing about a stranger . "
However Polly O'Callaghan , another passenger on the flight , alleged that Ms Irby had been acting flirtatiously with Mr Melia .
The man was leaning forward and grabbing hold of her breast and they were kissing each other
Arpita Mehra , flight attendant Ms Irby and Mr Melia , 36 , had drunk several glasses of wine together , the court was told .
Ms O'Callaghan said she heard Ms Irby say : " I 'm not normally this relaxed .
It 's just all the opium I 've been taking . "
She added that the comment may have been made in jest .
She said the pair were loud and abusive , claiming they regularly pressed the attendant call button .
It was further alleged that Mr Melia 's girlfriend moved away from him because she was being ignored .
Child concerns
Ms O'Callaghan said she also had concerns for Ms Irby 's son , who was jumping up and down on a seat while Ms Irby slept .
She also said Ms Irby put her hand into the face of a female flight attendant , while swearing at another one .
Describing Ms Irby and Mr Melia 's behaviour , Mr Sondhi said : " They were on the verge of being dangerous , I would say , so I asked my flight director to stop serving them any more liquor .
" They were kind of sprawled in the seats .
They were slurring and the man was a little more aggressive in his behaviour . "
Meanwhile , flight attendant Shivaneji Sharma said that Ms Irby took off her skirt , revealing her G - string , before changing into a pair of leggings .
Another flight attendant , Arpita Mehra , said : " She was busy with the guest sitting behind her .
" They were having a conversation and getting personal with each other and the child was crying .
" The man was leaning forward and grabbing hold of her breast and they were kissing each other . "
Mr Melia is not on trial .
The trial continues .

A Palin 2012 Run Would Be ' Catastrophic ' for GOP , Says Former McCain Aide
By Garance Franke - Ruta
The post-election sniping continues -- and how .
Speaking at the First Draft of History conference at the Newseum in Washington on Friday morning , former John McCain chief strategist Steve Schmidt took some none - too - subtle swipes at McCain 's former running mate , Sarah Palin , calling a 2012 presidential campaign by her potentially disastrous for both the Republican Party and the country .
" I think that she has talents , but my honest view is that she would not be a winning candidate for the Republican Party in 2012 , and in fact , were she to be the nominee , we would have a catastrophic election result , " he said , according to a report by The Atlantic 's Marc Ambinder from the conference .
" In the year since the election has ended , she has done nothing to expand her appeal beyond the base .
...
The independent vote is going to be up for grabs in 2012 .
That middle of the electorate is going to be determinative of the outcome of the elections .
I just do n't see that if you look at the things she has done over the year ... that she is going to expand that base in the middle , " he continued .
" It 's fairly inconceivable she could be elected , " Schmidt said , according to another Atlantic report .
Since the 2008 election , Schmidt has made several forays into criticizing positions held by his more socially conservative GOP brethren .
In April 2009 , he gave a speech outlining his support of same - sex marriage , staking a position that put him to the left of McCain and also President Obama .
" For the party to be seen as an anti-gay , that is injurious to its candidates in places like California and Washington and New York , " Schmidt said at the time .
He also criticized the prominent role of religion within the party , saying it risked turning the GOP into a sectarian party , rather than the big tent he hoped it would be .

Telling lies is something we all do from time to time .
Whether it ’s a well meant white lie or an out and out porker , life can be difficult to navigate without some degree of dishonesty .
“ A world without lies would be a terrible world [ ...]
A world without lies would be a world without fiction , ” remarked Ricky Gervais at the recent premiere of his new film The Invention of Lying .
While lying is sometimes necessary , there are of course degrees to which lying is acceptable and to call someone a liar is still an insult which carries enormous weight .
In fact the word liar is so controversial in British politics that the use of it is banned in Parliament .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Once you have been branded a liar it 's enormously difficult to shake off the stigma .
And while lying is common to all of us , it is particularly stupid if you are high profile or carry a great deal of responsibility .
Some people will never learn however and there are a number of extremely high profile politicians , world leaders and businessmen who have been caught out in telling some pretty major whoppers .
Click here or on the image above to launch our pick of ten notorious liars .
( Money Magazine ) --
For a foreclosure , the house at 15461 Kentfield St. in Detroit needed surprisingly little work .
The new owner , an investor from the Chicago area named Kevin Holmes , slapped on a coat of paint , pulled up the dirty carpets , and replaced the stolen water heater .
The car stashed out back , he learned soon enough , belonged to a neighbor , not a thief using the three - bedroom as a makeshift chop shop .
The simple brick home really would n't look out of place in any middle - income Midwestern neighborhood .
But in distressed Detroit , the Kentfield house sold for less than half the sticker price on a new Chevy coupe : $ 6,900 .
Giveaway - priced homes are in danger of becoming as much a part of Detroit 's identity as Motown , the Red Wings , and the Arsenal of Democracy .
Real estate agents in America 's 11th - largest city ( it used to be No. 5 ) say they get calls from all over the world asking to see rock - bottom listings .
Surreally , despite a hollowed - out job market and the continuing flow of new foreclosures , Detroit is abuzz with real estate deals .
Foreclosed homes in decent condition can sell within hours .
This city is the extreme end of a boom within the bust popping up all over the country as investors try to take advantage of prices not seen in years .
( Nationally , home prices are down 31 % from the 2006 peak . )
Lots of the sales are foreclosures , although just about anything that 's moving is cheap .
The activity is centered primarily in fading manufacturing hubs ( such as Detroit and Cleveland ) and the famous bubble cities ( like Miami , Phoenix , and Sacramento ) .
But investors are sniffing around for cut -rate deals just about everywhere from Memphis to Philadelphia .
So maybe you 've thought about it too -- whether it was after watching another news story about Detroit real estate , or driving by a house in your town that used to cost $ 300,000 and now lists somewhere south of $ 200,000 .
As you 'll see , though , squeezing a profit out of a house , even one as cheap as $ 6,900 , is far from simple .
In this story you 'll learn what it takes ( besides iron guts ) to be a successful investor in this market and how to avoid the rookie mistakes that can leave you stuck with a money pit .
Detroit provides the examples , but the lessons of the Motor City apply to would - be investors in any down market .
Despite its economic free fall , Detroit has not become a wilderness where the rules of capitalism no longer apply .
To the contrary , they are at work here with a vengeance .
Lesson no .
1 : Forget about flipping : this is the landlord business
Holmes , the new owner of the Kentfield house , was born in Detroit but now lives in Aurora , Ill. , where he recently retired from the police force .
He came to Detroit looking for a house he could rent out for income .
After closing costs and renovations , he 'll spend around $ 15,000 on a property for which he expects to get $ 800 per month .
Minus the ongoing taxes and maintenance , plus 10 % of the rent for a professional property manager , Holmes will pocket more than half the rent .
That would earn him his money back in less than three years .
He hopes to eventually own five properties , both to supplement his pension and , he says , to help the city where he grew up .
Buying to rent used to be at the core of real estate investing -- and with good reason :
As Yale economist Robert Shiller has shown , in many periods there has been very little real price appreciation in houses .
Historically , residential real estate is often less like , say , a zippy tech stock than like an old - fashioned utility share that pays out regular income ( in this case , rent ) while , with any luck , gradually rising in value .
That changed in most of the country during the boom .
With prices climbing 10 % to 20 % in a year , speculators bought property to sell within months or less for a profit .
Rental income was barely a factor .
Struggling Detroit actually saw a little bit of flipping , but that 's now out of the question .
None of the investors Money met in Detroit were assuming any kind of price appreciation , even when they paid something close to pocket change .
In the traditionally speculative markets , too , investors are thinking more about rents than they used to .
Yes , you might have a better shot at a price gain in Las Vegas than in Detroit .
( Automakers may never come back , but people always want to live in a warm climate . )
But that thinking is reflected in prices , and while the rate of decline in those cities has slowed substantially -- typically the sign of a bottom -- economists say that the constant stream of foreclosures and short sales could crowd the market for years , keeping prices in a holding pattern at best .
You 'll want some cash coming back in the meantime .
So a lot of the investing action around the country is in lower - end homes , which have a ready market of renters and are often priced low enough to be purchased for cash .
That often means condos .
A one - bedroom in the suburbs of Miami can be had for as little as $ 50,000 these days .
And rents , although down , are generally holding up better than prices .
For one thing , they did n't get out of hand in the first place , and all those people who lost their homes still need places to live .
In Miami , median apartment rents now exceed the monthly costs of owning a condo .
The same is true in Phoenix and Las Vegas , according to CBRE Torto Wheaton Research .
Lesson no .
2 : The purchase price is just the beginning of your costs
On Patton Street in the Mayfair Park neighborhood , real estate agent Scott McClue opens the door on a pleasant - looking three - bedroom house .
The view inside is a would - be owner 's nightmare .
Thieves stole the hot - water heater here too -- but they also took the furnace .
One of the back windows is gone , and the rest are old and poorly insulated .
The cracked kitchen ceiling reveals water damage from a leaky , blackened bathtub upstairs .
As amazing as it sounds , $ 14,900 is way too much to pay for this house .
An owner would have to spend at least $ 30,000 to make it livable .
One of the biggest investor mistakes is underestimating renovation and closing costs .
Buying a property sight unseen is the quickest way to fall into that trap -- and it's a real temptation when other investors are snapping up foreclosures .
If you do have a chance to look around , low - end properties can still have all sorts of problems you may not be able to spot immediately .
Unless you 're really handy , take a contractor with you when shopping to give an estimate .
As a rule , you should make a sale contingent on an inspection .
But investors in the Detroit market say that this is sometimes impossible :
There are enough buyers for foreclosed homes at these prices that many banks wo n't accept offers with conditions .
There are other costs to watch out for .
Liens do n't apply to properties that banks have already taken back , but they could be a factor if you 're buying from a distressed seller or at a courthouse auction .
( Most investors say to steer clear of auctions , by the way . )
You also need to find out about the financial health of any condo or homeowners association .
To get a handle on it all , you 'll want to work closely with agents , property managers , or in many cities , nonprofit redevelopment organizations .
Not only will reputable professionals steer you away from the worst properties , but they will also help you get the paperwork ready to do a quick deal .
Still , you have to know going in that there 's an irreducible level of risk in this game .
Detroit agent Christine Winans has seen plenty of people get hurt .
" They do n't understand what they 're getting , " she says .
" They have no idea about carrying costs , closing costs .
It 's the amateurs who are getting into trouble . "
Lesson no .
3 : you 'd better have cash ( and maybe a strong back )
Banks , burned by speculators who walked away from their properties after the collapse , are n't doing much lending to investors anywhere these days .
And they are n't interested in loans of less than $ 35,000 , making many of the low - end properties in places like Detroit unable to be financed , says area mortgage broker Brenda Brosnan .
And if you could get a loan , you 'd lose out to buyers who have cash .
That 's true even if you offer more money :
In Sacramento , agent Alan Wagner says a property recently drew 13 bids , and the sellers accepted a $ 140,000 cash offer rather than a $ 159,000 financed one .
Some would - be investors are tapping their retirement accounts or borrowing against the equity in their primary residence ( if they still have equity ) , but clearly those strategies carry significant risks .
Others are raising money from family and friends , and putting in old - fashioned sweat equity to keep other costs down .
Steve Morris , an automotive engineer renting out homes in the Detroit suburb of Warren , started out using his own cash but quickly figured out that he wanted to buy more properties than his bank account would allow .
So he borrows money from friends and local investors , paying them interest rates as high as 11 % .
The financing means that it 'll take longer on average to recoup his investment in a home .
It also puts him on the hook for every mistake .
Morris saves money by managing his own properties :
He spends his lunchtime and a couple of hours after work most days , plus about two weekends a month , on his real estate business .
He has learned a few tricks that help him save , such as using the same paint and carpeting at every home so that he always has supplies in stock .
For rehab work he employs friends who lost their auto jobs .
Lesson no .
4 : know the town
Especially if you are buying in a place you are n't familiar with , it 's all too easy to see a depressed market as one big clump of cheap houses .
But even in Detroit , neighborhoods run the gamut .
And an investor there needs to spend a lot of time driving around to get a feel for an area , because the changes come street by street .
The fact that a house is in a better - than - average neighborhood is little help if it's on a block spotted with vacant , crumbling homes .
( The city says more than 30,000 unsafe properties ought to be demolished . )
Look for anchors such as a hospital or university campus , which will provide a regular base of renters , a plus during an economic downturn .
Many investors in Detroit like the area around the University of Detroit Mercy , which is filled with brick homes set in well - manicured lawns .
A house there can be had for $ 20,000 , and may rent for $ 1,000 .
Other investors are targeting close - in commuting suburbs , with their well - maintained streets and , compared with some of the newer , far - flung subdivisions , solidly built homes .
Mike Sarwari , a California - based buyer , is focusing on such cities in suburban Memphis and parts of Texas .
Steve Morris is doing much the same in Detroit .
His houses are in a suburb that 's home to a General Motors tech center .
He has picked up three - bedrooms there for as little as $ 9,000 .
Many of his renters are families leaving Detroit .
Lesson no. 5 : know the tenants
Maybe the toughest part of real estate investing is that you are going to have to deal with tenants .
And in a bad economy , that relationship can get especially messy .
If your tenant can't pay the rent , not only do you lose money but you may also have to evict a person or a family from their home .
How can you avoid these problems ?
Moses
Shepherd , whose real estate firm has bought more than 100 properties in Detroit , describes an intensive screening that begins with a detailed phone interview .
Those who pass that test bring four weeks of pay stubs and other documents to his office .
He talks to their current landlord and visits their residences to see how they care for their living space .
That tells him more about a tenant than any credit report .
" Who has good credit these days ? " he says .
That said , some investors in former boom cities , particularly in south Florida , say the pool of tenants has actually improved in the past year , even if their credit scores have n't .
It stands to reason :
Three years ago almost anyone with remotely decent credit was buying , not renting .
Be realistic about the rent you 're setting .
Investigate what similar homes are going for , checking newspaper ads , websites , and Craigslist .
Newbie landlord Holmes would rather keep rents affordable and give up some profit than risk the cost of an eviction .
" Do n't be greedy , " he says .
If you 'd rather not deal with those issues , you can hire a property manager , as Holmes has .
That will cut into your returns -- managers typically charge an upfront fee plus 10 % of the rent -- but the expense can eliminate a lot of hassles .
It can also keep your home from sitting vacant .
Lesson no .
6 : Investing brings responsibility as well as rewards
Unlike stocks , an investment in real estate turns you into a businessperson .
Your actions affect your tenants ' lives , and you 're becoming part of a community .
In a region that 's struggling , absentee owners who buy a property and then do n't take care of it only worsen the situation .
Detroit native John George , president of the nonprofit redevelopment group Motor City Blight Busters , has seen too much of that .
" We do n't want to be taken advantage of , " he says .
The best way to be a responsible landlord , says George , happens to be the best way to ensure a good return :
Know what you 're buying , and be sure you have the resources to do it right .
Too often outsiders think they 're getting a good deal , and then discover that liens and repairs cost more than they have to spend -- and they walk away .
Burton Leland , the commissioner of Wayne County ( which includes Detroit ) , is lobbying for a new law that would prevent owners from buying more houses until they 've paid up taxes on the one they own .
But he does n't want to scare responsible investors away .
A buyer willing to do the work can bring a neighborhood one small step closer to recovery .

Why is the right afraid of J Street ?
Next week ’s J Street conference can already be deemed a success .
That is because it has caused the organizations and individuals who constitute the old pro-Israel lobby to drop any pretense of tolerating deviation from the status quo .
For instance , StandWithUs , which was created to smear J Street , has been urging senators and House members to take their names off the J Street “ host committee . ”
That is a listing of some 150 members of Congress who are publicly welcoming J Street ’s upcoming conference in Washington .
Advertisement
A host committee , of course , is pretty insignificant .
The legislators did not pledge to attend the event .
They simply endorsed the idea of the event .
Nonetheless , that is too much for the hard - liners who are doing everything they can to ensure that the J Street conference fails .
But here is the ironic part .
In recent years , several books and articles have been published that argue that the pro-Israel lobby effectively stifles debate on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict in the halls of Congress , in academia and even in the media .
Every time that claim is made , the lobby goes ballistic , with virtually every organization identified with the lobby arguing that such charges amount to libel .
The organizations claim they would never try to stifle dissent .
But now those tactics are being employed against J Street by the very people who insist that no such tactics have ever been used .
J Street itself does not accept the thesis that there is a concerted effort by the lobby to stifle dissent .
But its own experience seems to demonstrate that there is .
Clearly , the stalwarts of the lobby do n’t want J Street ’s message to get out .
But what is the message they ’re so afraid of ?
It is that negotiation , not war , is best for Israel .
Even worse in the lobby ’s eyes , J Street is telling President Barack Obama and Congress that being pro-Israel requires supporting diplomacy , not thwarting it .
And that has caused the pro-Israel right to declare war .
The latest tactic is to examine the personal history of everyone associated with the J Street conference in an effort to discover that a participant is not 100 percent kosher on Israel ( for instance , that he or she supported Yitzhak Rabin ’s Oslo peace process ) .
The lobby even enlisted a psychiatrist , Kenneth Levin of Harvard University , to analyze the psychological motivations of those who support J Street and the two - state solution .
In an interview in the right - wing blog FrontPageMag.com , Levin said Jewish dissenters from the Israeli government ’s positions are “ ignoring or rationalizing the genocidal agenda of Israel ’s enemies and even , in many instances , siding with those enemies . ”
And why ?
To separate themselves from a community under siege .
“ Inevitably , some elements of the besieged group will embrace the indictments of the besiegers , however bigoted or absurd .
They will do so in the hope of thereby extricating themselves from the wider group ’s dire predicament , ” Levin said .
J Street ’s critics claim that the organization ’s supporters want all the Jews dead or , to be precise , all the Jews except themselves .
The non-Jews who support J Street are just anti-Israel ( which is the same as being anti-Semitic ) .
The bottom line is that the attacks on J Street are becoming increasingly strident and ridiculous .
And that is because J Street ’s critics are terrified .
What are the pro-Israel lobby ’s stalwarts so afraid of ?
They ’re afraid that J Street ’s success will strengthen Obama in his determination to achieve “ two states , Israel and Palestine , living side by side in peace and security . ”
And then what would the right - wingers of the lobby do ?
MJ Rosenberg is a senior fellow at Media Matters Action Network .
He previously served as director of policy analysis for Israel Policy Forum .
He was also the editor of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ’s Near East Report .

Video : Maine 's first anti-equality ad -- it 's baaaaaaaaaaaad

The same federal marriage amendment that has wide , bi-partisan non-support , and that looks even more egregious in hindsight then it did back in the day .
We would suggest the same will happen with this current referendum campaign .
** MORE : As for the AP story that they clip ?
Well for starters , it 's a bogus usage , as the clipped story is all about the Roman Catholic Church 's role in this very referendum campaign , not marriage itself .
So it 's not AT ALL an example of what might happen if marriage equality becomes the nation 's reality -- it 's an example of the scrutiny that any and every church might face if they involve themselves too fully in campaign activities of any sort !
Then beyond that :
The headline they use is not a neutral AP one .
A neutral AP never uses the term " homosexual advocacy group . "
This headline comes from CNSNews , a right - wing site that picked up the AP wire story and injected the headline with their own views .
Others who picked up the exact same wire story used more more accurate , more neutral headlines .

Your thoughts
The entire premise of this commercial , that same - sex marriage will lead to discrimination lawsuits , is SUCH a red herring !
If their issue with same - sex marriage was REALLY the possibility of lawsuits , then their problem is anti-discrimination laws , NOT same - sex marriage !
Imagine if Christians released a commercial advocating for the ban of marriage between non-Christians , saying that they should have the right to discriminate against marriages which they view as ungodly .
Of all the ungrounded , anti-reason , and frankly MEAN arguments against my family 's legal and financial security , there is n't one to be found which pisses me off more than this .

I would bet money that it is the result of that study that made them go for a " working class waitress type " .
That ad will probably suggest that gays are rich and from away and are gaining something at the expense of working class women in Maine .
Promises to be a humdinger of vileness .

Here are some of the things that have been the subject of school curriculum objections over the past 10 years : - Sex
- STD prevention
- Halloween
- Harry Potter
- Yoga / Meditation
- Pres. Obama 's speech
In each of these cases , the solution to the " problem " was to address the curriculum , not to ban the subject matter in the entire world .
If you do n't wan't Halloween or Harry Potter or Yoga to be discussed in schools , then tweak the curriculum accordingly .
But you do n't ban Halloween or Harry Potter or Yoga for the whole jurisdiction - for adults - just so you can theoretically impact the school curriculum .
The whole argument has never made any sense , and I hope that No on 1 can address it well in a response ad .

If " No on 1 " fails to respond that ad word - for - word and make it widely publicized , we can already count Maine out of the equality states .

I agree that this ad is just downright bad .
It 's a virtual carbon copy of a Yes on 8 ad from California .
And I have to say that , vile though it was , our ad was better by miles .
At least our " title for informational purposes only " law professor was a bombastic yet avuncular Dr Phil type .
He had pep .
He had zazz .
He was like the Billy Mays of discrimination .
Okay , I just made all that up .
But , you have to agree , this Boston College guy just sticks to the screen like dried gum .
Also , why is it " homosexual " marriage now instead of " gay " marriage .
Did the new verbiage test better ?
I know most of you have already seen it , but here is a copy of our far superior scary gays ad : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PgjcgqFYP4 and the delicious parody that followed :

I like the counter - punching ads , yes , but I 'd also like to see some positive ads -- possibly featuring straight from Massachusetts who could talk about how gay marriage has not affected their marriage , maybe even showing some positive -- deliberately small -- benefits for it .
I 'd like to see -- and yes , star in ( were my face and voice ' air - quality ' which they are n't -- that goes like this -- all the facts are accurate , btw .
" I 'm 63 years old .
My ' birth mother ' was a lesbian , and I grew up in a lesbian household .
I am myself bi-sexual , but predominantly straight , and have been married to a woman for 19 years , so I do n't need the ' right to marry . '
I have one main reason for supporting marriage equality .
Because I know how sad I am that my mothers never had the chance to make a relationship that lasted over thirty years -- until Claire , my mother 's ' life partner ' died -- ' official ' and I want to give others the rights they never had .
" I know that everyone in the suburban NJ town knew ' what they were . '
And they never cared enough so that a naive kid who had discovered his own sexuality before he realized theirs would be condemned for their relationship .
The neighbors never saw their relationship as a threat to their own .
" When Claire , a life - long Catholic , attended weekly Mass -- as she did as long as her health permitted -- the priest did n't stand at the door to bar her .
When either was sick , the doctors and hospitals they went to accepted the other .
" But I was DAMN lucky .
I do n't want other children in the same situation to need luck -- and more today than then -- to be able to celebrate their parents ' relationship .
" Please vote No on Proposition 1 , for them , and maybe in tribute to two ordinary people , in an extraordinarily loving relationship , who did n't survive long enough even to see Stonewall and march together hand in hand . "

I just want to add that while I still believe that i would not be a suitable spokesman -- my voice makes Lynn Samuels sound like James Earl Jones , and my appearance is not the best , I 'd be glad to make such an ad if wanted .
Feel free to pass my info to anyone who would want it .

House Democrats will once again call executives of the nation ’s largest health insurance companies before Congress to defend their business practices , just as party leaders make a final push for legislation aimed at forcing private insurers to compete with a government - run healthcare program .
Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) and Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Chairman Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) will hold a hearing on Thursday , Oct. 15 , on the issue of “ underinsurance , ” what the pair described as the phenomenon of being “ insured but not covered . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
No witness list was announced .
But Waxman and Stupak have been investigating the practices of the private insurance industry – which the two Democrats believe amount to unfair treatment of consumers and patients – for months , and have already forced dozens of companies to provide volumes of documents on profits , executive compensation , and other practices that Democrats believe illustrate why drastic changes are needed in determining how Americans receive healthcare coverage .
And the two senior Democrats have managed to create a number of uncomfortable moments for the executives called to testify on behalf of their companies .
At a June hearing on “ rescissions , ” the practice of canceling individual health insurance policies only after policy holders submit claims for costly illnesses , Democrats and Republicans alike grilled executives from companies including United Health and WellPoint – two of the nation ’s largest private insurers – for refusing to promise to stop such practices .
“ Does n’t it bother you that people are going to die because you insist on reviewing a policy that somebody took out in good faith and forgot to tell you that they were being treated for acne ?
Does n’t that bother you ? ” the Energy panel ’s top Republican , Rep. Joe Barton ( Texas ) , asked at the June hearing .
“ We ’ll back you up on fraud and misrepresentation , but I do n’t think you ’re going to get a vote , at all , on rescissions that are not material to the claim being processed .
” In numerous speeches across the country , Presidenthas retold the stories of some of the very patients who testified before Waxman 's panel about retroactively losing their healthcare coverage – or seeing a family member lose theirs – in order to incite support for legislation that would force private health insurers , either by law or through economics , to change many of their controversial practices .
Americans who are underinsured are generally described as having health insurance benefits that fall short of covering their medical expenses .
Health experts generally consider a person underinsured if they spend more than 10 percent of their incomes on out - of - pocket medical expenses .
According to a recent study by the journal Health Affairs , some 25 million Americans between ages 19 and 64 were underinsured in 2007 , a number that has increased 60 percent since 2003 , according to the study , due in part to steadily increasing premiums and copays .
Waxman and Stupak have also been examining closely the profits and executive salaries at the largest insurance companies , and are planning a similar hearing on that issue for the end of October .
That , to me , is what separates him from the Clintons :
He is about what the country needs right now , not about how to triangulate the country to death just to get re-elected .
Change , and fuck the haters .
Quite frankly , I 'm almost certain that this is why he has " kicked the can down the road " on prisoner abuse , Bush investigations , etc .
He sure as hell does n't need another distraction .
This is the fight of not only one presidency , but of our country 's future , our country 's fate .
And he 's ready to go down in order to save this country and this planet in our time of need .
So forget the day - to - day chatter .
He believes , and god damn if he does n't have the will to succeed .
I 'm so proud of him .
If he really said this , then I can barely speak and hardly elaborate I 'm so moved .
Totally , ridiculous and the insurance companies wants us not to have competition for shit like this ?
Last week , the 4 month old baby was too fat , this week a toddler is too small , WTF ????
The parents of a two - year - old girl in Colorado are unable to attain health insurance for their daughter because the insurer , United Healthcare Golden Rule , claims she is too small .
In a letter sent to the family of the child , Aislin Bates , United Healthcare Golden Rule writes , " we are unable to provide coverage for Aislin because her height and weight do not meet our company standards . "
According to a Colorado news station , Aislin weighed six pounds , six ounces at birth , and now weighs 22 pounds .
When Robert Bates , the girl 's father , left his former job to start his own business , he was forced to seek out his own health insurance , and enrolled his family in an insurance plan with United Healthcare Golden Rule .
" It took me by surprise , " Bates told ABC 7 in Denver .
" I did n't think that her size was that abnormal and that it was something that you 'd consider to be unhealthy . "
As ABC 7 reports :
A spokeswoman for United Healthcare Golden Rule said 89 percent of the people who apply for insurance get it .
Ellen Laden , the company 's public relations director , told the station that most insurers have their own propriety height and weight guidelines .
" Ours are based on several medical sources , including the Centers for Disease Control , and are well within industry standards , " she said .

And both cases the fat baby and skinny toddler are in Colorado .
Lastly , these insurance companies denying people based on WHAT FACTS ?
The ones grabbed out of their @$$es ???
Representatives from the film industry paid investigators to become customers and monitor the IP ranges of ISPs Optus , Internode , iiNet and Exetel for alleged copyright infringements , the Federal Court heard this morning .
The four ISPs were allegedly shortlisted from approximately 190 ISPs included in the scope of an initial investigation by third - party firm DtecNet arranged by the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ( AFACT ) .
" The plan with DtecNet was to review the extent of copyright infringement across all ISPs , " AFACT executive director Neil Gane told the court under cross-examination .
" When we first engaged them [ DtecNet ] we actually monitored copyright across I believe 190 ISPs . "
The DtecNet investigation of the 190 ISPs began by focusing on the peer - to - peer protocols eDonkey , Gnutella , BitTorrent and DirectConnect .
This was later cut to BitTorrent and eDonkey - and eventually just to BitTorrent , Gane alleged under cross-examination .
The 190 ISPs were monitored for infringements on between " 1200 to 1300 [ film and TV ] titles " , Gane said .
This occurred " throughout the month of September 2007 " , Gane said .
The film industry 's own investigators then became customers of iiNet the following month .
General counsel for iiNet Richard Cobden asked Gane on two separate occasions whether he could identify ISPs that he had directed the industry 's own investigators to monitor other than iiNet .
Counsel for the film industry objected on both occasions .
But the second was overruled by Justice Cowdroy .
Gane said he directed the AFACT investigators to become customers of Internode , Optus and Exetel - in addition to iiNet - by the end of 2007 .
The decision to monitor for alleged copyright infringements on the IP address ranges of the four shortlisted ISPs was agreed by studio members of the Motion Picture Association in Los Angeles and Village Roadshow , which has a separate membership agreement with AFACT .
The same studios were referred copies of AFACT 's business plan and budget for approval , it was revealed in court during a session held on Friday .
" In having an [ AFACT ] investigator becoming a customer of that ISP we were able to factually corroborate the data being provided by DtecNet , " Gane alleged .
The case continues .

India has shot down China 's proposal to teach its language in Indian schools and take Indian students to China under exchange programmes , according to a report .
The rejection comes soon after reports that India 's bigger and more prosperous neighbour is issuing '' stapled ' ' visas to residents of Jammu and Kashmir , rather than stamping it on their passport .
The Chinese plan was mooted as part of the celebrations to mark 60 years of diplomatic ties between the two countries next year .
But India has shot down the proposal amid indications that China is going slow on preparations for President Pratibha Patil 's visit early next year , says The Telegraph of Kolkata , citing unnamed sources .
The ministry of external affairs said the proposals for teaching Chinese and student visits were '' unacceptable ' ' .
China had initially suggested that its teachers would come to India to teach the language .
Later , Beijing modified its proposal and said that '' it will be a locally administered programme ' ' , the paper said .
China 's proposal is to expand its ' Confucius Institute ' of language teaching into India .
But the Indian government suspects that this is a Chinese design to spread its '' soft power ' ' - widening influence by using culture as a propagational tool .
The Confucius Institute , started in 2004 , has a presence in 50 countries , including the US , Pakistan and Bangladesh .
But the institute 's two pilot centres in India - at the Vellore Institute of Technology in Tamil Nadu and Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University - have not made much progress so far .
Similar institutes started by western countries in India  such as France 's Alliance Francoise and Germany 's Goethe Institute  have proved a resounding success with students , if not with the government .
India 's attitude to China 's proposal also flies in the face of recent reports that students at premier institutes like the IIMs and the IITs are increasingly taking Chinese language courses , aware that our neighbour offers possibly more growth opportunities in the foreseeable future .
NASA'S LCROSS Captures All Phases of Centaur Impact
MOFFETT FIELD , Calif .
– NASA ’s Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) was a smashing success , returning tantalizing data about the Centaur impact before the spacecraft itself impacted the surface of the moon .
Last week , plunging headlong into Cabeus crater , the nine LCROSS instruments successfully captured each phase of the impact sequence : the impact flash , the ejecta plume , and the creation of the Centaur crater .
" We are blown away by the data returned , " said Anthony Colaprete , LCROSS principal investigator and project scientist .
" The team is working hard on the analysis and the data appear to be of very high quality .
” Within the ultraviolet / visible and near infra-red spectrometer and camera data was a faint , but distinct , debris plume created by the Centaur 's impact .
" There is a clear indication of a plume of vapor and fine debris , " said Colaprete .
“ Within the range of model predictions we made , the ejecta brightness appears to be at the low end of our predictions and this may be a clue to the properties of the material the Centaur impacted .
” The magnitude , form , and visibility of the debris plume add additional information about the concentrations and state of the material at the impact site .
The LCROSS spacecraft also captured the Centaur impact flash in both mid-infrared ( MIR ) thermal cameras over a couple of seconds .
The temperature of the flash provides valuable information about the composition of the material at the impact site .
LCROSS also captured emissions and absorption spectra across the flash using an ultraviolet / visible spectrometer .
Different materials release or absorb energy at specific wavelengths that are measurable by the spectrometers .
With the spacecraft returning data until virtually the last second , the thermal and near - infrared cameras returned excellent images of the Centaur impact crater at a resolution of less than 6.5 feet ( 2 m ) .
The images indicate that the crater was about 92 feet ( 28 m ) wide .
" The images of the floor of Cabeus are exciting , " said Colaprete .
" Being able to image the Centaur crater helps us reconstruct the impact process , which in turn helps us understand the observations of the flash and ejecta plume .
"
In the coming weeks , the LCROSS team and other observation assets will continue to analyze and verify data collected from the LCROSS impacts .
Any new information will undergo the normal scientific review process and will be released as soon as it is available .

Fox News dedicated hours to coverage of tea party protests in Washington D.C. but ignored the National Equality March for gay rights .
The Daily Show ’s Jon Stewart wants to know why .
Stewart blasted Fox News last night for covering nearly every anti-tax tea party protest ( including one a producer riled up to get ready for a shot ) but not sending anyone to cover the recent gay rights march on Washington .

Counting the minutes
Fox devoted to the march , Stewart ’s staffers found that the network had devoted just four minutes — despite the fact the protesters numbered 75,000 strong .
Fox did n’t even send a camera crew .
“ You did n’t even send your own camera crew ? ” Stewart exhorted .
“ You have a Washington bureau .
Tell them to go the window and point the camera down .
Gay people are n’t vampires .
They show up on camera . ”
The march has divided gay rights supporters , some of whom have criticized the event as diverting resources from fights over banning gay marriage in Maine and other states .
The march ’s organizer , an ally of assassinated gay rights leader Harvey Milk , has said a state - by - state fight for gay rights is too slow .
This video is from Comedy Central ’s The Daily Show , broadcast Oct. 13 , 2009 .

Privacy campaigners are threatening to sue the European Commission over its plans to release citizens ' data to the FBI .
The Commission is understood to be close to finalizing an agreementwith the United States that would allow the FBI to see the credit card historiesand internet browsing habits of European citizens .
The agreement would mark a substantial lowering of the barriers to the provision of data from Brussels to Washington .
News of the state of the talks has angered privacy organisations .
Oneleading campaigning organisation , Privacy International , said on Monday itwould consider taking legal action against the commission .
" It is very much on the cards for Privacy International , or one of the other civil rights organizations , to take legal action against Brussels , " said Simon Davies , director of Privacy International .
"
It would depend very much on how the framework has been established .
We will have to see the text , consult the legal experts and see where we stand . "
" One of the key problems is the secrecy which has surrounded the terms , " said Davies .
" We have no knowledge about where our information will flow once it reaches the U.S .
In all respects , this is a bad deal for Europeans .
It plays into the hands of the U.S. in the worst possible way .
" Davies added that U.S. laws made it impossible to exchange data fairly between Europe and America .
The United States is keen to gain access to European citizens ' data to help ittackle the threat of terrorism .
Talks to gain access to citizens ' datawere ramped up after the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks .

Bruno Senna has confirmed that he has secured a Formula 1 deal for next season - with an announcement about his move to Campos Grand Prix expected imminently .
The Brazilian has been locked in negotiations with several teams about a deal for 2010 , but there has been mounting speculation in Abu Dhabi that he finally signed a contract to join the new Campos team in the last few days .
Writing on his Twitter page on Friday night , Senna said that after weeks of pushing hard to land an F1 deal , he has finally realised his ambition .
" Guys , I 'd like to thank you all for the great support !
After many weeks of hard work and negotiations , me and my management finally made it , " he wrote .
" I 'm very happy and I 'd like to share this moment with you !
Now it 's time to focus and work hard in preparation for next season !
" Lots of hard work to come and , hopefully a great starting point !
All the best !
Valeu !! "
Senna spent this season focusing on sportscars after failing to secure an F1 drive , but made no secret of the fact that his ambition was to get into grand prix racing as soon as possible .
It is not clear if his Campos deal will prevent him from testing for Renault after the season , having had discussions about a young driver day with the French car manufacturer .

It is more than four years since I first interviewed Kevin Pietersen .
That was a couple of months before the 2005 Ashes , when his fame did not yet transcend cricket , and although he had announced his prodigious talent in a one - day series in his native South Africa the previous winter , even cricket fans were n't sure whether he should play at Test level for England .
I spent more than a hour with him that day at a cafe in Southampton : he was thoughtful , chatty , and engagingly eager that I should consider the interview worthwhile .
Just over a year later I interviewed him again , at Lord's .
By then he was a cricketing superstar .
He was also surly , uncommunicative and could barely be bothered to lift his eyes from his mobile phone .
He gave anodyne answers to my questions while simultaneously texting , and I went away lamenting this vivid example of sporting fame and burgeoning fortune going to a fellow 's head .
But perhaps he was just having a bad hair day , which brings me to my latest encounter with Pietersen , in a photographic studio near Leicester Square , the day he is being unveiled as the new Brylcreem Boy .
He has been here having photographs taken since 7.30 am .
It is now almost 4 pm .
The portents for an obliging KP are not good .
And yet , as I am ushered into his presence and he rises ( and rises , and rises , he is a very big man ) to greet me with a crushing handshake , he appears cheerful , almost zestful .
Maybe because home time beckons at long last .

Anyway , I remind him that we first met when he was a whippersnapper of 24 , and venture – it being my turn for the anodyne observation – that a great deal has happened to him since then .
" Yeah , it has mate , " he says , softly .
He has a gentle , almost girlish voice , strikingly at odds with his Olympian physique and his macho deeds .
" It most definitely has .
Captaincy , ex-captaincy , runs , no runs ... "
And injuries , of course .
He has n't played any cricket since the second Ashes Test at Lord 's , but was yesterday named in the one - day and Test squads for the tour to South Africa , which starts next month .
" I was rushed into the rehab process [ following an Achilles operation ] , which opened the wound .
I had a terrible wound on my leg .
But there 's light at the end of the tunnel now , although I wo n't rush it if I 'm not ready .
I still have five or six years left with England , I hope .
These days you can play almost 100 Test matches in six years . "
But not many of them will be Ashes - winning Test matches .
How miserable was he to have missed out at the Oval , where in 2005 his extraordinary knock of 158 from 187 balls sealed Australia 's defeat ?
" To be honest , mate , I try to take the positives out of everything I do .
And I walked off after one session at Lord 's almost in tears .
I felt like I was being stabbed every time I took a step , so I thought ' right , you 've had a roller - coaster ride , it 's time to take a back seat and recharge your batteries ' . "
He is almost as good at mixing metaphors as he is at smacking sixes , but never mind that ; surely it must have been terrible sitting through the remainder of the Ashes as a spectator , especially when it seemed , after the walloping at Headingley , as if England would lose .
" Well , that 's why I tried all those injections .
I really tried my hardest , but at the end of the day the boys won the Ashes and I had no mixed emotions at all .
I was not going to make a sob story out of my injury . "
On the whole , any year in which the Ashes are recaptured counts as a terrific year for English cricket .
For him , though , it has been something of an annus horribilis , starting in January with the England and Wales Cricket Board removing him as England captain , a consequence of the mutual dislike between him and Peter Moores , the coach .
Once Pietersen had effectively engineered the sacking of Moores , he must have assumed that his own grip on the captaincy would strengthen , not that it would be ripped from his grasp ?
A pause , and a sigh .
" I answered every question in that letter from the ECB about England cricket going forward , and all of a sudden I got a phone call from Hugh Morris [ the managing director of England Cricket ] saying I was out of a job as well .
Mentally , that was very hard , and the West Indies trip [ soon afterwards ] was ridiculously tough for me .
To be out there for 11 weeks after everything that had gone on , with my wife [ Jessica Taylor , formerly of the pop group Liberty X ] here , doing something I really wanted to support her in [ the TV talent contest Dancing on Ice ] , that was just very hard . "
Sympathy for his predicament , I seem to recall , was limited .
Did he get much support in the dressing - room ?
" Myself and Freddie [ Andrew Flintoff ] lead a different life to the other players in the dressing - room .
Away from the field nobody has what Freddie and I have , so it 's difficult to speak to somebody who does n't know . "
I invite him to give me some insight into the trials of his life away from the field .
" On a daily basis you have to tolerate intrusion , " he says .
" I married a pretty famous girl , and when we drive through town there 's usually a car following us , when I walk out of my front door in Chelsea there 's six guys waiting for me .
Jess and I do n't like red-carpet things , we 'd rather be at home with a takeaway , so the attention is hard to deal with , it makes you feel on edge .
And I know Freddie gets hassled a lot , too . "
I do n't suppose they unburden themselves much on each other , though ; they reportedly do n't get on too well , not that either ever confirms this .
" Mate , we get on fine , " says Pietersen , predictably enough .
" I did actually speak to him about a lot of stuff .
But to get total trust and support I turn to my family and my best mates . "
For a man of Pietersen 's unwavering self - belief , and for that matter his Natal background , being stripped of the England captaincy was at least as devastating as being given it was flattering .
The more so , he tells me , because he felt he was growing into the job nicely .
" It was frustrating .
I put into writing all my suggestions , as I was asked to , and [ Andrew ]
Strauss has got the benefit of all that .
I 've just had to watch it unfold this summer , which has been extremely hard for me , so maybe it was a blessing in disguise for me to be injured and away from everything so I could try to get my hunger back , because it certainly was dwindling . "
In other words , he was nursing a grievance this summer no less than a bad leg .
I ask him to be more specific about the ways in which Strauss has reaped the benefits of his suggestions to the ECB .
" He has a coach he can work with .
I never had that .
I did n't have the power or authority to run the team .
I never had that as England captain . "
He would have been delighted , he adds , to have lived on as captain with Andy Flower , who succeeded Moores , as coach .
" I had my reservations about Andy when he was second - in - command , but I promise you , now he 's doing such a fantastic job .
I speak to him regularly , I ring him about stuff , and he 's such a good listener . "
Maybe his captaincy was always doomed , I venture provocatively , if with a sweetener , on the basis that it 's rarely a good idea to make the best player the skipper .
" Not if it affects the way you perform , " he replies equably , " but I 'd like to see my stats when I was captain .
I probably averaged 60 or 70 .
No , I loved it , I enjoyed it , but now I leave it to Strauss , who 's doing such a great job . "
Can he envisage any circumstances in which he might one day regain the captaincy ?
" No , mentally I 've left it .
I respect Strauss too much to talk about the captaincy . "
Then let 's talk about the Strauss - led tour to South Africa , for which we all pray he will be fit .
" Yeah , I love playing South Africa for obvious reasons , and I have n't played Test cricket there , so I really want to do that , and be part of a team that builds on the momentum of winning the Ashes . "
Does he anticipate a hostile reception when , wherever it might be , he strides out for the first time ?
After all , in 2005 he was abused loudly and mercilessly .
He smiles .
" Well , Strauss is South African , [ Matt ] Prior is South African , so is Jonathan Trott , so it wo n't just be me . "
But he is the man those Afrikaaners in particular love to hate , is n't he ?
" Yeah , but I take that as a compliment , the same as Ricky Ponting does when he comes here .
I enjoy it , actually .
But you 're right , in 2005 it was extremely abusive , and my mum and dad were very upset .
Especially my mum .
That does n't bring fond memories , even though I scored three hundreds and was man of the series .
But I do n't expect it to be as bad this time .
I think people in South Africa respect me now for what I 've done . "
And respect is due to him as the new Brylcreem Boy , to boot .
Hair , it suddenly occurs to me , has loomed particularly large in Pietersen 's career .
In fact , no matter how neat he keeps it , he will forever be associated with the notorious " dead - skunk " stripe .
" Yeah , what on earth was I doing ?
That was so stupid .
But it was part of growing up .
And now I 'm contractually bound to keep a short back and sides . "
Thank goodness for that .
And since he mentions contracts , what are the prospects of him doing a Freddie and going freelance ?
" The realism now , " he says carefully , " is that we have the IPL , and central contracts are not everything they 're written up to be , so it 's a case of waiting to see what happens .
But I 'm not giving up playing for England .
I have some real big goals with England .
I want to become the leading Test run scorer , I want to finish with 25 to 30 Test match hundreds , and I want home and away Test match hundreds against Sri Lanka and South Africa , which are the only two I have n't got . "
Which of us would bet more than a tube of Brylcreem against the probability that , a few months from now , only Sri Lanka will remain ?
Kevin Pietersen is the Brylcreem Boy and face of the new Brylcreem product range
( PhysOrg.com ) --
The author of a new report suggests the belief that harsh interrogation and torture techniques are effective is a form of folk neuroscience that is not supported by scientific evidence , and does not fit with what we know about how the brain works .
The new paper was published in Trends in Cognitive Sciences by Professor Shane O'Mara of the Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience in Dublin .
The paper reviewed previously secret scientific documents that were released in April , to determine the effect on memory and brain function of the severe interrogation techniques used by the CIA during the Bush administration .
Professor O'Mara found that so - called " enhanced interrogation " techniques , such as prolonged sleep deprivation , exploiting phobias , being confined in stressful or painful positions , and waterboarding , result in the production of the stress hormones cortisol and the catecholamines .
The scientific evidence shows that areas of the brain most concerned with memory , the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus , can be damaged by the stress hormones , and there can be tissue loss if the stress is continued .
This makes it less likely for the subject to accurately recall information , and more likely for false memories to replace real ones .
If the stress continues long enough the subject becomes unable to distinguish between the real and false memories .
Techniques of this nature are still defended by some intelligence officers , who consider them able to extract useful information from suspects .
Other intelligence officers consider the practices counterproductive because victims supply the information they think the interrogators want to hear in order to make the torture stop .
The same phenomenon was also found in investigations of almost 250 police interrogations in which the accused was convicted and often pleaded guilty even though DNA evidence later proved they were innocent .
In many cases the interrogated person had come to believe the police allegations and incorporated them into their own memories as if they were true .
Professor O'Mara 's review of the literature on interrogation techniques reported that there is a wealth of literature showing that the extreme stress of severe interrogation and torture compromises brain function and memory .
According to O'Mara these techniques are based on bad science , and they actually destroy memories they are supposed to reveal .
There is no way to determine whether information revealed during the interrogation is true or not .
CIA representative George Little criticized the paper , saying that O'Mara did not interview interrogation subjects , and claiming the practice did produce information used by the government to disrupt terrorism activities .
Professor Stephen Soldz of the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis , on the other hand , backed the study , saying that stress has been known for some time to impair cognitive function and memory .
Many other studies have suggested severe interrogation techniques can disrupt memory processes , and a spokesman for the group Physicians for Human Rights , Dr Scott Allen , also said he has found no scientific studies supporting the use of these techniques .
The study may also have an application in processing asylum seekers who may have been victims of harsh interrogation or torture , since their memories may have been distorted and there may be inconsistencies in their stories , but this does not mean they are lying .

JERUSALEM –
In the week of Nobel Prize announcements , the most intriguing comment from the Middle East came not , as one might have expected , as a straight reaction to the shock of U.S. President Barack Obama being awarded this year ’s Peace Prize .
It came from another Nobel winner  Israeli professor Ada Yonath , one of this year ’s three recipients in chemistry .
The shock treatment prescribed for the conflict by the 70 - year - old Weizmann Institute was even more of a shock to many of her fellow Israelis .
Asked by Israeli Army Radio Saturday whether she believed the award to Obama might spur him to advance peace in the region , Yonath chose to focus not on what the U.S. president can or cannot do , but on what Israel must do .
" A change in the status quo " is what is required , she declared , somewhat off beat : " All prisoners should be returned to Palestine regardless of a prisoner exchange deal [ with Hamas ] .
I do n’t understand why we incarcerate them in Israel in the first place .
" Many Palestinians , " argued the Nobel Laureate , " have no hope for the future  despair gives them every reason to jump at the opportunity to better their prospects for a better afterlife [ by becoming suicide bombers ] . "
Israelis are currently wholly absorbed not by prospective hopes for peacemaking but on whether the Israeli soldier , Gilad Shalit , abducted three years ago by Palestinian militants , has a chance of being released in an imminent prisoner swap .
In contrast , other reactions about the choice of Obama for the peace prize were much more predictable .
Actually , there has been an unexpected show of unity among Israelis and Palestinians : even with the fresh wind blown from Oslo , skepticism dominates the mindset on both sides , widespread doubt whether the U.S. president will really push them down the peace road  and whether he has the clout to do so .
" You have already inspired so many people around the world , and I know that this award expresses the hope that your presidency will usher in a new era of peace and reconciliation , " said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
" I look forward to working closely with you in the years ahead to advance peace and to give hope to the peoples of our region who deserve to live in peace , security , and dignity , " added Netanyahu in his message to the White House .
The Israeli leader deliberately steered clear of whether that " hope " for peace would have any effect on his own policies .
Only hours before the announcement from Oslo and the warm congratulations from the prime minister , a banner headline in the liberal Tel Aviv daily Ha’aretz had referred to " fury " in the White House about " Israeli incitement against President Obama . "
Administration officials were said to be " stunned " by the attempts to portray Obama to the U.S. public as an enemy of Israel because of his efforts to restart peace talks and freeze settlement construction , the report said .
Still , not all Israeli officials were prepared to line up with what they were expected to say about the peace laureate .
" It is very strange that Obama has won , " commented a leading colleague of the prime minister , Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin .
He voiced his " concern " that " now that he has won the award , it is very possible that he might force Israel into a peace deal . "
On the Palestinian side , chief Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat played up the same expected line as Netanyahu : " We truly hope that he will be able to achieve peace in the Middle East , " he said , choosing to focus on Obama ’s role as peacemaker and steering clear of the commitment of the Palestinian Authority itself to move toward peace .
The difficulties that lie ahead for the president were exemplified by the weekend of abortive shuttle diplomacy conducted by his special envoy , former senator George Mitchell , who has been spearheading the administration ’s efforts to relaunch Israeli - Palestinian peace negotiations .
There was no surprise in the skepticism of the Islamist movement Hamas , which controls the Gaza Strip and opposes a peace treaty with Israel .
It played up the other expected line  of the peace spoilers in both camps  that the award is , at best , premature .
" Obama has a long way to go still and lots of work to do before he can deserve a reward , " said senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri .
" He only made promises and did not contribute any substance to world peace .
And , he has not done anything to ensure justice for the sake of Arab and Muslim causes . "
Uncompromising Israelis relish this kind of uncompromising Palestinian talk .
" There is no chance of an early solution to the conflict .
People just have to learn to live with it , " Israel ’s Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman had said only a day before the Oslo announcement .
Anyone who thinks Israelis and Palestinians can reach a deal " does not understand reality and is sowing illusions , " Lieberman added .
Both applauders and critics of the award to Obama agree that it was a shocking decision .
That ’s precisely what the Nobel Committee clearly intends  for the U.S. president to apply shock treatment to the Middle East .
Not necessarily the same kind of shock therapy suggested by the Israeli chemistry laureate , but one which stops the parties getting away with allowing all peace hopes to slide into a torpor .
Faced with myriad complications 
Netanyahu ’s obduracy on settlements and the virulent pressure by Palestinians on their president , Mahmoud Abbas , not to let Israel off the hook of charges that it perpetrated war crimes in Gaza  some analysts believe that Obama was on the verge of backing away from his commitment to peacemaking .
With peace hopes seeming about to flounder , the Nobel message to the White House could n’t have been clearer : Yes , Mr. President , you can ( make the parties make peace ) ;
No , you ca n’t ( walk away from your peace commitment ) .
And you must ( inflict shock treatment on the parties ) .

Tomgram : William Astore , Apocalypse Then , Afghanistan Now
Here 's the thing :
This may be our next " Vietnam moment , " but Afghanistan is no Vietnam : there are no major enemy powers like the Soviet Union and China lurking in the background ; no organized enemy state with a powerful army like North Vietnam supporting the insurgents ; no well organized , unified national liberation movement like the Vietcong , and that 's just a beginning .
Almost everywhere , in fact , the Vietnam analogy breaks down -- almost everywhere , that is , except when it comes to us .
Because we never managed to leave Vietnam behind , even when we were proclaiming that we had kicked that " syndrome , " it turns out that we 're still there .
Our military leaders , for instance , only recently dusted off the old Vietnam - era counterinsurgency doctrine that once ended in catastrophe , shined it up , and are now presenting it as an ingenious new solution to war - fighting .
Let 's face it : everything about American thinking still stinks of the Vietnamese debacle , including the inability of our leaders to listen to a genuinely wide range of options .
Now , according to Peter Baker of the Wall Street Journal , a " battle " of two Vietnam histories is underway at the White House and the Pentagon .
Think of them as dueling books .
The president and a number of his advisors have just finished reading Lessons in Disaster : McGeorge Bundy and the Path to War in Vietnam about a White House " being marched into an escalating war by a military viewing the conflict too narrowly to see the perils ahead " and backed by a hawkish national security adviser .
The other , a Pentagon favorite , A Better War : The Unexamined Victories and Final Tragedy of America 's Last Years in Vietnam , focuses on a military that by the early 1970s was supposedly winning its counterinsurgency struggle only to be " rejected by political leaders who bow[ed ] to popular opinion and end [ ed ] the fight . "
If it 's a battle of Vietnam histories that Washington wants , should the contest really be limited to these two books ?
After all , one is about a White House advisor who , like so many of " the best and the brightest , " was decades behind the curve in discovering that he had made a mistake pushing for war ; the other , a smiley - faced look at the years 1968 - 1973 in Vietnam that champions an eerily familiar " stab in the back " thesis in which pusillanimous civilian leaders lead a proud military to defeat .
If it 's a Vietnam syllabus you 're looking for , President Obama , why not start with The Best and the Brightest , David Halberstam 's brilliant dissection of the Vietnam disaster ?
Having covered Vietnam as a New York Times reporter , he knew a bankrupt war when he saw one .
Or why not consider what an American " counterinsurgency " war really meant on the ground ?
Nothing will give you a more visceral sense of the destruction visited on Vietnam and the Vietnamese in those grim years than Jonathan Schell 's double - barreled classic The Real War .
( Why does n't anyone in your administration ask Schell , who saw the worst of that war close up , for advice on our new " Vietnam moment " ? )
Or you might check out William Gibson 's devastating , sardonically entitled post - war book , The Perfect War : Technowar in Vietnam .
It 's a history of what the war managers did and , believe me , it gives the World War II acronym snafu new punch .
Or you could pick up Patriots , Christian Appy 's unique oral history of the war as seen from all sides .
It provides a perfect way to explore why , faced with overwhelming American firepower , the other side so often refuses to quit .
Not long ago , your special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan , Richard Holbrooke , picked up a phone in Kabul and called Stanley Karnow , who got a Pulitzer Prize for his 1983 middle - of - the - road , one - volume history of the war .
We do n't know how that consultation -- in the presence of Afghan war commander General Stanley McChrystal -- went , but Karnow did offer this comment to an AP reporter later : " What did we learn from Vietnam ?
We learned that we should n't have been there in the first place .
Obama and everybody else seem to want to be in Afghanistan , but not I . "
My own suggestion to you and your staff for a single - volume history is Marilyn Young 's cautionary tale , The Vietnam Wars : 1945 - 1990 .
And then give her a buzz , too , and see what she thinks about the present moment .
( Notice , by the way , that " s " on " wars " in her title , since she includes the U.S. - backed French war .
When a good history of the conflict in Afghanistan is written , its title , too , will undoubtedly have the plural " wars " in it .
After all , we 've been fighting there on and off for three decades now . )
Finally , there 's a classic from 1967 that should be front and center when discussing the future of the Afghan War .
Its title still says it all , even if the topic has yet to make it into your White House when it comes to Afghanistan .
I 'm talking about Howard Zinn 's Vietnam : The Logic of Withdrawal -- which leads me to retired Lieutenant Colonel William Astore 's latest TomDispatch post , focusing on why , then and now , administrations find themselves trapped within such a narrow ambit of opinion .

Obama at the Precipice
Tough Guys Don't Need to Dance in Afghanistan
By William J. Astore
It 's early in 1965 , and President Lyndon B. Johnson faces a critical decision .
Should he escalate in Vietnam ?
Should he say " yes " to the request from U.S. commanders for more troops ?
Or should he change strategy , downsize the American commitment , even withdraw completely , a decision that would help him focus on his top domestic priority , " The Great Society " he hopes to build ?
We all know what happened .
LBJ listened to the generals and foreign policy experts and escalated , with tragic consequences for the United States and calamitous results for the Vietnamese people on the receiving end of American firepower .
Drawn deeper and deeper into Vietnam , LBJ would soon lose his way and eventually his will , refusing to run for reelection in 1968 .
President Obama now stands at the edge of a similar precipice .
Should he acquiesce to General Stanley A. McChrystal 's call for 40,000 to 60,000 or more U.S. troops for Afghanistan ?
Or should he pursue a new strategy , downsizing our commitment , even withdrawing completely , a decision that would help him focus on national health care , among his other top domestic priorities ?
The die , I fear , is cast .
In his " war of necessity , " Obama has evidently already ruled out even considering a " reduction " option , no less a withdrawal one , and will likely settle on an " escalate lite " program involving more troops ( though not as many as McChrystal has urged ) , more American trainers for the Afghan army , and even a further escalation of the drone war over the Pakistani borderlands and new special operations actions .
By failing his first big test as commander - in - chief this way , Obama will likely ensure himself a one - term presidency , and someday be seen as a man like LBJ whose biggest dreams broke upon the shoals of an unwinnable war .
The Conventional Wisdom : Military Escalation
To whom , we may ask , is Obama listening as he makes his decision on Afghanistan strategy and troop levels ?
Not the skeptics , it 's safe to assume .
Not the free - thinkers , not today 's equivalents of Mary McCarthy or Norman Mailer .
Instead , he 's doubtless listening to the generals and admirals , or the former generals and admirals who now occupy prominent " civilian " positions at the White House and inside the beltway .
By his actions , Obama has embraced the seemingly sober , conventional wisdom that senior military officers , whether on active duty or retired , have , as they say in the corridors of the Pentagon , " subject matter expertise " when it comes to strategy , war , even foreign policy .
Do n't we know better than this ?
Do n't we know , as Glenn Greenwald recently reminded us , that General McChrystal 's strategic review was penned by a " war - loving foreign policy community , " in which the usual suspects -- " the Kagans , a Brookings representative , Anthony Cordesman , someone from Rand " -- were rounded up to argue for more troops and more war ?
Do n't we know , as Tom Engelhardt recently reminded us , that Obama 's " civilian " advisors include " Karl W. Eikenberry , a retired lieutenant general who is the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan , Douglas Lute , a lieutenant general who is the president 's special advisor on Afghanistan and Pakistan ( dubbed the " war czar " when he held the same position in the Bush administration ) , and James Jones , a retired Marine Corps general , who is national security advisor , not to speak of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency " ?
Are we surprised , then , that when we " turn crucial war decisions over to the military , [ we ] functionally turn foreign policy over to them as well " ?
And that they , in turn , always opt for more troops , more money , and more war ?
One person unsurprised by this state of affairs would have been Norman Mailer , who died in 2007 .
War veteran , famed author of the war novel The Naked and the Dead ( 1948 ) as well as the Pulitzer Prize - winning report on Vietnam - era protests , The Armies of the Night ( 1968 ) , self - styled tough guy who did n't dance , Mailer witnessed ( and dissected ) the Vietnam analog to today 's Afghan events .
Back in 1965 , Mailer bluntly stated that the best U.S. option was " to get out of Asia . "
Period .
The Unconventional Wisdom : Military Extrication Can Obama find the courage and wisdom to extricate our troops from Afghanistan ?
Courtesy of Norman Mailer , here are three unconventional pointers that should be driving him in this direction : 1 . Do n't fight a war , and clearly do n't escalate a war , in a place which means so little to Americans .
In words that apply quite readily to Afghanistan today , Mailer wrote in 1965 : " Vietnam [ to Americans ] is faceless .
How many Americans have ever visited that country ?
Who can say which language is spoken there , or what industries might exist , or even what the country looks like ?
We do not care .
We are not interested in the Vietnamese .
If we were to fight a war with the inhabitants of the planet of Mars there would be more emotional participation by the people of America . "
2 . Beware of cascading dominoes and misleading metaphors , whether in Southeast Asia or anywhere else .
The domino theory held that if Vietnam , then split into north and south , was united under communism , other Asian countries , including Thailand , the Philippines , perhaps even India , would inevitably fall to communism as well , just like so many dominoes toppling .
Instead , it was communism that fell or , alternately , morphed into a version that we could do business with ( to paraphrase former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ) .
We may no longer speak metaphorically of falling dominoes in today 's Af - Pak theater of operations .
Nevertheless , our fears are drawn from a similarly misleading image :
If Afghanistan falls to the Taliban , Pakistan will surely follow , opening a nuclear Pandora 's Box to anti-American terrorists in which , in our fevered imaginations , smoking guns will once again become mushroom clouds .
Despite the fevered talk of falling dominoes in his era , Mailer was unmoved .
Such rhetoric suggests , he wrote in 1965 , " that we are not protecting a position of connected bastions so much as we are trying to conceal the fact that the bastions are about gone -- they are not dominoes , but sand castles , and a tide of nationalism is on the way in .
It is curious foreign policy to use metaphors in defense of a war ; when the metaphors are imprecise , it is a swindle . "
To this I 'd add that , in viewing countries and peoples as so many dominoes , which by the actions -- or the inaction -- of the United States are either set up or knocked down , we vastly exaggerate our own agency and emphasize our sense of self - importance .
And before we even start in on the inevitable argument about " Who lost Afghanistan ? " or " Who lost Pakistan ? " is it too obvious to say that never for a moment did we own these countries and peoples ?
3 . Carrots and sticks may work together to move a stubborn horse , but not a proud people determined to find their own path .
As Mailer put it , with a different twist : " Bombing a country at the same time you are offering it aid is as morally repulsive as beating up a kid in an alley and stopping to ask for a kiss . "
As our Predator and Reaper drones scan the Afghan terrain below , launching missiles to decapitate terrorists while unintentionally taking innocents with them , we console ourselves by offering aid to the Afghans to help them improve or rebuild their country .
As it happens , though , when the enemy hydra loses a head , another simply grows in its place , while collateral damage only leads to a new generation of vengeance - seekers .
Meanwhile , promised aid gets funneled to multi-national corporations or siphoned off by corrupt government officials , leaving little for Afghan peasants , certainly not enough to win their allegiance , let alone their " hearts and minds . "
If we continue to speak with bombs while greasing palms with dollars , we 'll get nothing more than a few bangs for our $ 228 billion ( and counting ) .
What if LBJ Had Listened to Mailer in ' 65 ?
Not long before LBJ crossed his Rubicon and backed escalation in Vietnam , he could have decided to pull out .
Said Mailer : " The image had been prepared for our departure -- we heard of nothing but the corruption of the South Vietnam government and the professional cowardice of the South Vietnamese generals .
We read how a Viet Cong army of 40,000 soldiers was whipping a government army of 400,000 .
We were told in our own newspapers how the Viet Cong armed themselves with American weapons brought to them by deserters or captured in battle with government troops ; we knew it was an empty war for our side . "
Substitute " the Hamid Karzai government " for " the South Vietnam government " and " Taliban " for " Viet Cong " and the same passage could almost have been written yesterday about Afghanistan .
We know the Karzai government is corrupt , that it stole the vote in the last election , that the Afghan army is largely a figment of Washington 's imagination , that its troops sell their American - made weapons to the enemy .
But why do our leaders once again fail to see , as Mailer saw with Vietnam , that this , too , is a recognizably " empty war for our side " ?
Mailer experienced the relentless self - regard and strategic obtuseness of Washington as a mystery , but that did n't stop him from condemning President Johnson 's decision to escalate in Vietnam .
For Mailer , LBJ was revealed as " a man driven by need , a gambler who fears that once he stops , once he pulls out of the game , his heart will rupture from tension . "
Johnson , like nearly all Americans , Mailer concluded , was a member of a minority group , defined not in racial or ethnic terms but in terms of " alienat[ion ] from the self by a double sense of identity and so at the mercy of a self which demands action and more action to define the most rudimentary borders of identity . "
This American drive for self - definition through constant action , through headlong acceleration , even through military escalation , the novelist described , in something of a mixed metaphor , as " the swamps of a plague " in which Americans had been caught and continued to sink .
He saw relief of the desperate condition coming only via " the massacre of strange people . "
To be honest , I 'm not sure what to make of Mailer 's analysis here , more emotionally Heart - of - Darkness than coolly rational .
But that 's precisely why I want someone Mailer - esque -- pugnacious , free - swinging , and prophetical , provocative and profane -- advising our president .
Right now .
As Obama 's military experts wield their battlefield metrics and call for more force ( to be used , of course , with ever greater precision and dexterity ) , I think Mailer might have replied :
We think the only thing they understand is force .
What if the only thing we understand is force ?
Mailer , I have no doubt , would have had the courage to be seen as " weak " on defense , because he would have known that Americans had no dog in this particular fight .
I think he would intuitively have recognized the wisdom of the great Chinese strategist Sun Tzu , who wrote more than 2,000 years ago in The Art of War that " to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill .
To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill . "
Our generals , by way of contrast , seem to want to fight those 100 battles with little hope of actually subduing the enemy .
What Obama needs , in other words , is fewer generals and ex-generals and more Norman Mailers -- more outspoken free - thinkers who have no interest in staying inside the pentagonal box that holds Washington 's thinking tight .
What Obama needs is to silence the endless cries for more troops and more war emanating from the military and foreign policy " experts " around him , so he can hear the voices of today 's Mailers , of today 's tough - minded dissenters .
Were he to do so , he might yet avoid repeating LBJ 's biggest blunder -- and so avoid suffering his political fate as well .

In Chartier ’s Conscience of an Anarchist I mention an interview law professor and libertarian Gary Chartier gave .
In the interview , the left - libertarian host “ Little Alex , ” at around 59 minutes , characterizes the Rothbardian view of abandonment as follows : if you own a pencil , and drop it , you own it forever ; so if someone else finds it , you can at any time in the future reclaim it .
Chartier agrees with the host that this is a “ silly ” view .
Now , admittedly , Chartier was put on the spot , but I think this is a mischaracterization of Rothbardian - libertarian views on abandonment .
I discuss this a bit in A Critique of Mutualist Occupancy .
The mutualist view , as I understand it , is basically this : first , occupancy is a requirement of ownership–both initial , and continuing , ownership .
And the occupancy has to be done by the owner himself , not his agent .
So , if A homesteads a tract of land , Blackacre , and builds an apartment building or factory on it , if he stops using it for some time , then this is “ abandonment ” and the property can be re-homesteaded by a squatter or new user .
Moreover , if A rents the building to tenants , or if he lets his employees operate the factory , he is still not occupying it–rather , the tenants or employees are .
Thus , despite the contract between owner and current user ( tenant or employees ) , the property becomes abandoned and then the new possessor instantly re-homesteads it .
Now , I find both views utterly unlibertarian .
Carson argues that the occupancy view is just at one end of the spectrum of views on default “ abandonment ” rules , that even Lockeans have .
I disagree , as explained in greater detail in my post A Critique of Mutualist Occupancy : the occupancy rule amounts to a use or working requirement , not a default rule for abandonment .
As for title lapsing for unused property , Rothbard argues ( correctly , in my view ) , in The Ethics of Liberty that
… we are not saying that , in order for property in land to be valid , it must be continually in use .
The only requirement is that the land be once put into use , and thus become the property of the one who has mixed his labor with , who imprinted the stamp of his personal energy upon , the land .
After that use , there is no more reason to disallow the land ’s remaining idle than there is to disown someone for storing his watch in a desk drawer . [ 3 ] [ 3 ]
There are , as I have demonstrated elsewhere , excellent economic reasons why land , in particular , may remain unused ; for above - subsistence living standards depend on the supply of labor being scarcer than the supply of land , and , when that happy situation obtains , considerable land will be “ sub- marginal ” and therefore idle .
Second , even if you agree that leaving property unused means the owner gives up title , there is no justification whatsoever for the paternalistic , socialistic evisceration of the right to contract implied in the case where the owner uses another person as an agent ( such as a tenant or employee ) .
The mutualist project depends , as far as I can tell , on the right of “ workers , ” say , to seize the factories –after all the owner is “ distant ” and is not himself “ occupying ” or using the property .
So he has abandoned it .
This is ridiculous and unlibertarian , in my view .
But as for abandonment itself : the libertarian view is of course that you have the right to abandon property , as Rothbard admits ( interestingly , there are gaps in the ability to abandon property in some statutory civil law systems ) .
I am not sure if or where Rothbard wrote on the need for default rules to make a determination of when abandonment has , in fact , happened , but I see no reason to think Rothbard thinks there should not be any .
Thus , I think it ’s ridiculous to charge Rothbard with the view that if you lose a pencil in the wild , that this can never be considered an abandonment .
In my view , if you lose a pencil you do , at least after some time , abandon it .
So the position Chartier agrees is silly is not Rothbard’s .
There are two related views of Rothbard that I think the host was confusing here .
First , the Rothbardian view is that stolen property remains title of the original owner .
So if B steals A ’s watch , and B sells it to C , then A can later reclaim his watch from C ( even if C is an innocent or “ good faith ” / ” bona fide ” purchaser ) .
As Rothbard writes in The Ethics of Liberty ,
Suppose , for example , that Jones possesses a watch , and that we can clearly show that Jones ’s title is originally criminal , either because ( 1 ) his ancestor stole it , or ( 2 ) because he or his ancestor purchased it from a thief ( whether wittingly or unwittingly is immaterial here ) .
Now , if we can identify and find the victim or his heir , then it is clear that Jones ’s title to the watch is totally invalid , and that it must promptly revert to its true and legitimate owner .
Thus , if Jones inherited or purchased the watch from a man who stole it from Smith , and if Smith or the heir to his estate can be found , then the title to the watch properly reverts immediately back to Smith or his descendants , without compensation to the existing possessor of the criminally derived “ title . ”
Thus , if a current title to property is criminal in origin , and the victim or his heir can be found , then the title should immediately revert to the latter .
Now , I actually have always thought this view is subject to criticism , but this is not what the mutualists are focusing on .
In my view , it is possible that at least in some cases Jones might have a better claim than Smith .
For example , suppose Smith was negligent in letting it be stolen ; and Jones bought the watch in good faith from the thief .
Assuming the thief is not to be found , then the loss has to fall on either Jones or Smith .
It is not automatically obvious to me that it should always be Jones .
In the law , if I recall , the loss of a forged check usually falls on the bank ( who should not have cashed it with a forged signature ) , but in some cases , where the check was lost or stolen due to the negligence of the customer , it ’s more his fault than the bank’s .
Something like that could apply in a customary system of law ; who knows .
And second , consider that a thief has the practical ability in some cases to steal and destroy your property .
It could be that many private societies would view the theft of a fungible movable good and its re-sale to a good - faith purchaser as a type of “ destruction ” of the property ( title ) .
But as a prima facie rule , and especially for land ( unlike movables ) , I agree with Rothbard .
In any event , the Rothbardian view on the sanctity of title to stolen property is not what the mutualists are critiquing in Rothbard .
The other view of Rothbard ’s that the host may have been getting mixed up is his view that mere non-use of land does not amount to abandonment .
I agree with Rothbard here , but the point is that this is not the same at all as the view that there should be no default rules to abandonment .
In other words , Rothbard can maintain ( a ) that the owner never loses title to stolen property ; and ( b ) the owner of land does not lose title by mere non-use ; while he also maintains ( c ) you can abandon property in any number of ways , such as by losing a pencil .
There is a good possibility that every photo you ’ve imported to F - Spot has had its EXIF date tags altered without your permission and without F - Spot informing you that it has done so .
UPDATE : See the note from one of the F - Spot developers in the comments below .
I ’d like to publicize an issue that the F - Spot developers have been slow to address :
< rant >
There is a good possibility that every photo you ’ve imported to F - Spot has had its EXIF date tags altered without your permission and without F - Spot informing you that it has done so .
From bug reports going back over two years it is clear that F - Spot has a serious date problem .
What is the assigned severity of these bugs ?
Normal .
What is the status of these bugs ?
UNCONFIRMED .
How ’s this for confirmation :
The above is a screenshot of the EXIF date information ( as viewed by Gthumb ) of a photo I imported to F - Spot version 0.6.1.3 for testing purposes .
Prior to import , all three of the fields ( DateTime , DateTimeOriginal , and DateTimeDigitized ) had the same timestamp : 2009:10:26 13:37:11 .
This timestamp corresponds to when I took the picture : 13:37 on October 26th .
As can be seen , F - Spot has decided that the users are idiots and to update the fields with the values it thinks are best without telling anyone .
It decided to set the DateTime field to the time when the photo was imported into F - Spot ( as if that date is so important it needs to be saved for posterity ) .
For DateTimeOriginal F - Spot decided that the appropriate time is the UTC time when the picture was taken ( conveniently deciding that since my computer is currently in U.S Eastern Daylight Time , I must have been in the same timezone when I took the picture and that my camera was set to the correct time for my timezone at the time I took the picture ) .
The EXIF date fields do not have timezone information in them so setting it to UTC is meaningless because there ’s no way to tell from looking at the data that that is what you ’ve set it to !
The DateTimeDigitized field is the only one F - Spot left alone which gives us the strange paradox of the picture being digitized 4 hours before it was originally taken !
< sarcasm > Yeah , that makes sense .</ sarcasm >
This problem is so bad some users have resorted to writing perl scripts to try and fix things after the fact or launching the program in different ways to prevent the problem from happening .
I am going to take the nuclear option and simply remove F - Spot from all of my computers .
An open letter to the F - Spot devs :
To whom it may concern , Data corruption is ALWAYS a critical problem but you list bugs 340903 and 454082 as “ UNCONFIRMED ” with a severity and priority of “ Normal ” .
UNCONFIRMED ? Normal ?
Who are you kidding ?
Data corruption is always critical and these bugs are years old and have been confirmed in your own bugzilla by dozens of users .
Regardless of whatever reason you had for introducing this stupid date - changing “ feature ” , you never change EXIF data unless the user expressly tells you to .
That ’s basic common courtesy .
You ’ve known about this issue for over three years .
You need to grow up , acquire a clue , and fix F - Spot ’s terrible and destructive behavior .
Yesterday .
Until then I will distrust F - Spot and anyone who says it is anywhere close to being a good , decent , or even “ ok ” photo manager .
You and others keep telling me that F - Spot is awesome , that F - Spot is great , that it is the best Linux photo manager .
I no longer believe you .
From now on F - Spot is not getting anywhere near my photos .
I ’ve written about you before but I take all the good things I said then back .
I was younger , more impressionable , and foolish .
But those are just excuses .
The fact is I was wrong .
Yes , you appear to have some nice features , but your core has some rotten bits and I do n’t eat rotten apples ( even if only bits of them are rotten ) , I throw them away .

Audit slams ' opaque ' accounting as French EU presidency found to have spent £ 160 m on events and refurbishment
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
French financial watchdogs slammed Nicolas Sarkozy for spending £ 160 m during his country 's six - month stint in charge of the EU – including £ 250,000 on a personal presidential shower that he never used .
The vast expense is set out in a report blaming poor management and a lack of transparency by the president 's staff .
Costs soared because so many of the EU - related events were organised at the last minute , said the report .
On one occasion Sarkozy triggered the cancellation of an entire EU event he was due to host in Evian , because he wanted to sleep in his own bed at the Élysée palace .
By then , hundreds of journalists , EU officials and national delegations had either already arrived in Evian or were on their way .
A flood of complaints prompted compensation payments – adding more to the eventual presidential bill .
The total for Sarkozy 's time at the helm of the EU is set out in figures published by the French national audit office .
Every government likes to showcase its country when holding the EU presidency , which at present rotates from country to country every six months .
National funds are topped up with EU budget support to organise summits , informal ministerial meetings and EU - related promotional events , conferences and policy programmes .
Funding is shared between national and regional authorities and the EU budget .
For one three - day event alone , Sarkozy sanctioned an elaborate upgrade of the Grand Palace in Paris for an EU - Mediterranean summit – one of his pet initiatives to mark his turn at the EU helm .
The event was one of his final EU presidency flourishes last July , and involved hundreds of workmen and millions of pounds .
" The Grand Palace had to be completely refitted for the occasion .
Five hundred technicians were mobilised every day , including 300 at night , " said the report .
Spending included nearly £ 1 m for one dinner for more than 40 government leaders and heads of state who attended the event .
Nearly £ 300,000 was spent building a conference podium , nearly £ 200,000 upgrading the gardens and grounds , and a total bill for the Sarkozy shower of almost £ 250,000 .
The audit report said the cost soared because of the complications of installing a state - of - the - art shower to the president 's specifications in a listed building .
The president never used it – instead going back to the Élysée palace during the three - day summit to freshen up .
The shower has since been dismantled .
Other spending on the summit included £ 90,000 for a carpet .
In all there were about 500 presidency - related events during the six months , but Jean Arthuis , the head of the French senate finance committee , said not all of them were essential , and not all contributed to French success in its EU presidency .
He described French EU presidential accounting as " opaque " , saying it was hard to establish who paid for what .
Figures show that previous French EU presidencies were much cheaper – £ 12 m in 1995 , and £ 54 m in 2000 .
A Chinese wind - turbine company , with financing help from Beijing , has struck a deal to be the exclusive supplier to one of the largest wind - farm developments in the U.S. , a sign of how Chinese firms are aggressively capitalizing on America 's clean - energy push .
The 36,000 - acre development in West Texas would receive $ 1.5 billion in financing through Export - Import Bank of China .
Shenyang Power Group , a five - month - old alliance , would supply the project with 240 of its 2.5 - megawatt wind turbines , among the biggest made in the ...
“ A lot of it is about ideology , but a lot of it is about money , too , ” Mr. Nader said .
The election in June set off a wave of protests and national discontent , with many charging that the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , stole the election from his main reform opponent , Mir Hussein Moussavi .
That conflict and the ensuing state crackdown accelerated a reordering of Iran ’s political landscape that began with Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s election four years ago .
The old guard revolutionaries , like former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , the reformers and the clergy have been largely shoved aside .
The mainline conservatives have been divided .
But the Guards and its allies , including the president , have been emboldened and remain firmly in control .
There have been some student protests since universities reopened , and small street scuffles , but nothing like the huge protests that rocked the nation right after the election .
“ In a strategic sense , I do n’t think Iran is in a fundamentally different place than it was before elections , not in the way it approaches negotiations or the way it looks at its foreign policy , ” said Flynt Leverett , director of the Iran project at the New America Foundation and a professor of international affairs at Pennsylvania State University .
Since the protests , senior Guards officials and former officials have been moved into many important government positions .
There is now talk that the Guards ’ leadership is considering transforming the Basij militia , a volunteer force under its command , into a professional , full - time force .
Another tool for extending the Guards ’ reach at home has been privatization , initially intended as a means to improve the economy but criticized more recently as a shell game .
The takeover of Iran ’s telecommunications system followed a familiar pattern .
A private firm , initially approved by Iran ’s Privatization Organization , was excluded as an eligible bidder because of a “ security condition ” one day before shares were put on sale .
Mobin Trust Consortium , affiliated with the Guards , then won the bidding .

Until this case , the most striking instance of the Guards ’ muscling into a business involved management of the Imam Khomeini Airport .
In May 2004 the Guards shut down the airport and evicted the Turkish company that had the contract to run it .
The Guards then put its own firm in place .
The Guards also appears to have defied an edict by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to privatize its many holdings , which run from laser eye clinics and car dealerships to control of oil and gas fields , according to the RAND report .

Österreich im Ausnahmezustand : Uni brennt weiter
Ausnahmezustand an österreichischen Unis : Die Studenten haben genug von der Bildungspolitik der Regierung .
Los ging 's vor einer Woche mit der Besetzung des Wiener Audimax .
Österreichs Universitäten sind im Aufruhr .
Seit der Besetzung des Auditorium Maxiumum der Universität Wien vor einer Woche hat sich ein Ausstand und Aufstand der Studierenden auf ganz Österreich ausgebreitet .
Jeden Tag schliessen sich weitere Hochschulen den Protesten an : die technische Uni Wien , die Uni Linz , die Uni Graz , selbst die Akademie der Wissenschaften .
Es geht um die Studienbedingungen , die Finanzierung und die schleichende Verwandlung der Hochschulen in privatwirtschaftlich geführte Betriebe .
Vor einem
Jahr wurden durch eine einmalige Allianz fast aller Parteien gegen die ÖVP die von der Regierung Wolfgang Schuessel , ÖVP , eingeführten Studiengebühren weitgehend wieder abgeschafft .
Wissenschaftsminister Johannes Hahn , ÖVP , verpasst keine Gelegenheit , auf deren Wiedereinfuehrung zu drängen .
Die Unis hätten zu wenig Geld und mangels finanziellen Steuerungseffekts kämen zu viele junge Menschen in den tertiären Bildungssektor .
Bisher hat sich Koalitionspartner SPÖ stur gestellt : Freier Zugang zur Bildung sei ein notwendiger Kanal der sozialen Mobilität .
Das Audimax in Wien ist inzwischen zu einem Mobilisierungs - und Veranstaltungsort geworden : Literaten wie Robert Menasse hatten ihren Auftritt .
Peter Pilz von den Grünen , der selbst einst diesen Hörsaal frequentierte , versicherte die Streikenden der Solidarität seiner Partei .
Auch via
Twitter lassen sich die unter dem Motto " Uni brennt " fungierenden Proteste verfolgen :
Am einfachsten ist es , nach dem Hashtag #unibrennt zu suchen .
Minutiös finden sich dort Nachrichten vom Protest .
Wissenschaftssprecher Kurt Grünewald sekundierte via Aussendung : " Die Besetzung des Audi -Max an der Universität Wien ist ein klares Zeichen der Frustration der Studierenden mit der Universitäts - Politik der Regierung .
Studierende und ForscherInnen brauchen Raum , Zeit und Geld .
Letzteres ist in Österreich noch immer nicht ausreichend vorhanden .
Darin liegt das Versagen der Regierung " .
Wissenschaftsminister
Hahn verweigert den Dialog .
Den Medien erklärt er gebetsmühlenartig , Studiengebühren und Platzbeschränkungen seien " Instrumente , die in anderen Ländern gang und gäbe sind " .
Wenn sie in Österreich nicht kommen , würden " Inbalancen " entstehen .
Er hat den Rektoren geraten , auf den " Notfallparagraphen " zurückzugreifen .
Anträge auf Platzbeschränkungen in den überlaufenen Studienrichtungen Publizistik und Wirtschaftswissenschaften erteilt er bereits .
Tatsächlich herrscht auf vielen Fakultäten der Notstand .
Einführungsvorlesungen müssen über Video übertragen werden , weil nicht alle in den Hörsaal passen .
Knock - out - Prüfungen am Ende des ersten Semesters oder Studienabschnitts fungieren als inoffizielle Filter .
Und auch die Lehrenden stehen unter extremem Druck .
Assistenten und Dozenten werden nicht mehr angestellt , sondern müssen ihren Vertrag Jahr für Jahr verlängern .
Verantwortlich gemacht wird nicht nur die Regierung , sondern auch der sogenannte Bologna - Prozess auf europäischer Ebene , der die Universitäten schrittweise in marktwirtschaftlich geführte Betriebe verwandelt .
Wissenschaftsminister
Hahn wird sich mit der Misere nicht mehr lange herumschlagen müssen .
Er wurde von der ÖVP ueberraschend zum naechsten EU - Kommissar Oesterreichs nominiert .

One 's most open " secret " finally became common knowledge yesterday when Ferrari confirmed that Fernando Alonso is to take Kimi Raikkonen 's place for the next three years .
The deal has been widely predicted in the paddock for more than a year .
But recently prolonged legal negotiations to end Raikkonen 's contract , which had one more year to run , and the Renault " Crashgate " scandal , conspired to defer the expected announcement at the Italian Grand Prix earlier this month .
As anticipated , the recovering Felipe Massa remains a key part of Ferrari 's driver line - up , with Giancarlo Fisichella confirmed in the role of reserve driver .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Raikkonen will leave the team at the end of the season , and will shortly be announced as Lewis Hamilton 's 2010 partner at McLaren .
Ferrari described their relationship with the mercurial Finn as " a rewarding and fruitful partnership " .
In 2007 he narrowly pipped Hamilton to the world championship for drivers , emulating the success of his predecessor Michael Schumacher and achieving his life 's ambition .
In 2008 he also played a role in securing the world championship for constructors for the team .
But a succession of lacklustre races , and the continuing emergence of Massa who was beaten by a point by Hamilton last year , led to speculation that Raikkonen 's contract might be terminated then .
This year he was overshadowed again by Massa until the Brazilian suffered a head injury during qualifying for the Hungarian GP in July , whereupon Raikkonen staged a resurgence and won the Belgian GP in August , his first victory since Spain in May 2008 .
" We are very proud to welcome to our team another winning driver , who has demonstrated his amazing talent by winning two World Championships in his career to date , " said Ferrari team principal , Stefano Domenicali .
" Of course , we wish to thank Kimi for everything he has done during his time with Ferrari : in his first year with us , he managed to win the Drivers ' title , thus making his contribution to Ferrari 's history and he played a vital role in our taking of the Constructors ' title in 2007 and 2008 .
Even during a difficult season like this one , he has demonstrated his great talent , with several good results , including a great win in Spa , and we are sure that we can share more good times together in the final three races of this season . "
Raikkonen said : " With common consent , we have agreed to terminate the contract binding me to Ferrari to the end of 2010 , one year ahead of schedule .
I am very sad to be leaving a team with which I have spent three fantastic years , during which time I won plenty of races .
Together , we have won 50 per cent of the world titles in that period and I managed to take the Drivers ' title in 2007 , thus achieving the target I had set myself at the start of my career .
I have always felt at home with everyone here and I will have many happy memories of my time with the team . "
The confirmation of Alonso 's deal is expected to trigger several key driver change announcements .
The Spaniard , who did not make any comment yesterday , may face censure from the FIA after he upset the governing body by dedicating his podium position in last weekend 's Singapore GP to disgraced former Renault team principal Flavio Briatore , whom they recently banned for life .
A shocking stat recently caught Cosmo's eye : Nearly half of all unplanned pregnancies among young , sexually active women are due to birth - control lapses and screwups , according to a report by the Guttmacher Institute , a reproductive - health organization .
Even worse , many more women are conceiving because they are not using any birth control at all .
Granted , contraception can be annoying and even clumsy , but this info leaves us dumbfounded .
If you do n't want to get pregnant at this point in your life , you need to do everything you can to protect yourself .
( About 3 million young women deal with an accidental pregnancy each year . )
According to women 's health experts , there are lots of reasons smart females kid themselves into thinking they wo n't conceive .
Study the following ones closely .
ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN 1 : You Play Roulette with the Pill
Maybe you skip a pill every now and again , thinking one missed dose can't really affect your chances of conceiving .
Or you 've recently gone off oral contraceptives , and you assume that there must be some grace period before you ovulate again .
Hey , lots of women thought the same thing ... and they got pregnant .
Make no mistake about it : Forgetting even one combined - hormone pill and not making up for it within 24 hours by taking another ( and then doubling up with condoms for the next seven days to be safe ) can , in rare cases , allow your ovary to release an egg , says Mary Jane Minkin , MD , clinical professor of ob - gyn at Yale University School of Medicine .
And if you 're on progestin - only pills , they must be taken at exactly the same time each day .
Let 's clear this up as well :
There 's no grace period during which you can't conceive after going off the Pill ; as we explained before , your body can ovulate after just one Pill - free day .
So use another similarly reliable method the very day you intentionally go off the Pill .
If you find yourself forgetting , switch to a birth - control method that you do n't have to deal with daily , such as the contraceptive ring ( a hormonal device you insert near your cervix each month ) or the Depo - Provera shot ( which delivers a dose of progesterone that leaves you protected for three months ) .
Another option : an IUD , a device that is 99 percent effective for up to five years .
Your gyno inserts it into your uterus during a quick office visit .
ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN 2 : You 're Not Having Much Sex , So You Don't Carry Any Protection
Without a semisteady partner , staying baby - free probably wo n't be a big issue .
Why shell out cash and commit to contraception if you 're not even sure when your next hookup will be ?
Here 's why : Because when you do have sex , it 's likely to happen unexpectedly .
In the heat of the moment , if you do n't have birth control handy , you may be tempted to go without .
Look , it 's easy .
Keep a stash of latex condoms in your bedroom and a few in your purse .
Besides being an inexpensive form of pregnancy prevention ( and if used correctly , they are 98 percent effective ) , condoms will significantly reduce — although not eliminate — your chances of contracting an STD .
" Condoms should be your method of choice if you do n't know your partner 's STD status , " explains Vanessa Cullins , MD , vice president for medical affairs at Planned Parenthood Federation of America .
Chris Clinton
ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN 3 : You Are n't Vigilant Because You Maybe Want a Baby Now
It 's normal to have conflicting feelings about whether you 're really ready to have kids at this point in your life .
But unless you are certain you want to become a mother in the very near future and your guy is supportive , keep using contraception every single time .
If you are n't sure what you want , use birth control until you do decide you 're truly ready for momdom .
ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN 4 : Your Life Has Been Thrown for a Loop , and Contraception Is the Furthest Thing from Your Mind
You know how when something major goes down in your life — for example , you find out you 've lost your job or a family member suddenly becomes sick — your usual routine often falls by the wayside as you try to deal ?
Well , a woman 's birth - control routine is one of the things that tends to get lost in the shuffle early on .
After a life - changing event or experience preoccupies a woman 's mind , it 's common for her contraception habits to change unconsciously , becoming erratic or nonexistent , explains Jennifer Frost , senior researcher at the Guttmacher Institute and one of the study 's authors .
The trick is to recognize when your life has been thrown into upheaval , then be extravigilant about protection .
That may mean switching from a birth - control method you have to take care of daily or weekly — such as the Pill or the patch — to something that requires little to no attention , like the contraceptive ring ( which you insert monthly ) , the every - three - months Depo - Provera shot , or an IUD , which protects you for years .
ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN 5 : You Can't Find a Contraceptive Method You Actually Like
If you do n't like your contraception — i.e. , the Pill 's side effects ( such as breakthrough bleeding ) annoy you or inserting a new vaginal ring below your cervix every month weirds you out — you 'll be less likely to use it , and your babymaking odds will soar .
Make an appointment with your gyno and ask her if she can help you find birth control that works with your lifestyle and preferences , says Dr. Cullins .

Just keep in mind that if you 're not in a monogamous relationship with a guy who is STD - free , then you must stick with condoms each and every time .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- A CBS producer accused of trying to extort $ 2 million from " Late Show " host David Letterman pleaded not guilty Friday in a Manhattan courtroom .
Robert Joel Halderman pleads not guilty Friday to first - degree attempted grand larceny .
The producer , Robert Joel " Joe " Halderman , 51 , of Norwalk , Connecticut , allegedly told Letterman last month that he would disclose Letterman 's dalliances with his show 's staffers unless he paid the money .
Halderman is charged with first - degree attempted grand larceny .
He has been suspended from his CBS job .
Prosecutors at his arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court had sought $ 500,000 bail , calling Halderman a flight risk .
" The evidence is compelling , " Assistant District Attorney Judy Salwen told the court .
It shows that Halderman was trying to " destroy " Letterman 's reputation and " humiliate his family , " she said .
Watch to learn more about Halderman »
" The defendant was desperate and willing to do anything , " Salwen added , saying Halderman was in debt .
Defense attorney Gerald Shargel said his client has worked at CBS for 27 years and has two children , ages 11 and 18 .
After the arraignment , Shargel said he believed that Halderman would post the bond and said Halderman denies the allegations .
Halderman was seen in a car pulling away from the courthouse after the hearing .
" This story is far more complicated than what you heard this afternoon , " the lawyer said , without elaborating .
" It 's not the open and shut case you just heard about . "
Shargel said Halderman has " an impeccable reputation " and has never before been in trouble with the law .
He said he expected to take the case to trial .
Documents filed in Stamford Superior Court in Connecticut show that Halderman was required to pay about $ 6,800 a month in child and spousal support to his ex-wife .
Prosecutors declined to say whether Halderman had financial problems or other motives .
Earlier Friday , Shargel said he met with his client briefly at the jail .
" He is not dispirited , " the lawyer said .
" We 're prepared to fight this case . "
Halderman told Letterman in a proposed script that his " world was about to collapse around him " unless he received $ 2 million , Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said .
The one - page " screenplay treatment , " which was attached to a letter , referred to Letterman 's great professional success and his " beautiful and loving son , " Morgenthau said at a news conference .
The contents of the letter were not revealed at the briefing .
A screenplay treatment is similar to an outline .
It describes the proposed plot and subplots , character interactions and tone of a story , such as a melodrama or romance .
Letterman acknowledged on his show Thursday night that he'd had sexual relations with members of his staff and that he revealed those liaisons during grand jury testimony for a case involving an attempted extortion .
A representative for Letterman 's production company , Worldwide Pants Inc. , said Friday that the relationships Letterman referred to " when discussing the matter on the Late Show predated his marriage " to longtime partner Regina Lasko .
The couple , who have been together since 1986 , wed in March .
They have a son , Harry , 5 .
Morgenthau said Letterman gave Halderman , a producer for the CBS news magazine " 48 Hours , " a $ 2 million check Wednesday , and Halderman deposited it in a bank account in Connecticut .
He was arrested Thursday outside CBS offices , the district attorney said .
Halderman 's uncle , Richard Smith , told CNN's " Situation Room " that he last spoke to his nephew late Tuesday .
" We could tell that he was slightly down , " Smith said .
" He was n't his normal , bubbly , cheerful self .
He sounded very tired . "
Smith described Halderman as a " very loving individual " who " loved his job with CBS . "
Halderman could face five to 15 years in prison if convicted .
Morgenthau said the alleged extortion incidents were carried out between September 9 and September 30 .
According to the indictment , Halderman waited outside Letterman 's Manhattan home at 6 a.m. September 9 to deliver the letter and other materials .
Letterman said on his show that he saw the package when he went out to his car to leave for work .
Halderman said he needed to " make a large chunk of money " by selling Letterman the " screenplay treatment , " Morgenthau said .
The materials from Halderman also said Letterman 's " world was about to collapse around him " if the information on his private life was unveiled , leading to a " ruined reputation . "
The letter asked Letterman to meet with Halderman that day to make a deal , Morgenthau said .
He said Letterman , who had reported the alleged extortion to his attorney and the district attorney 's office , met with Halderman several times .
The last two meetings were audiotaped .
" The message of this indictment should be clear .
New York City will not tolerate the coercion or extortion of anyone , be the victim rich or poor , famous or anonymous , " Morgenthau said .
" The law prohibits conduct like the defendant 's and attaches severe penalty to it .
We intend to enforce the law . "
Letterman told his audience that he testified before the grand jury Thursday , " something I 've never done in my life . "
" I had to go downtown to testify before the grand jury " and " tell them all of the creepy things that I 've done , " referring to his sexual dalliances .
Watch Letterman say he slept with members of his staff »
" I have had sex with women who work on this show , " he said .
" Would it be embarrassing if it were made public ?
Perhaps it would , especially for the women . "
" I feel like I need to protect these people ; I need to certainly protect my family , " Letterman said .
" I need to protect myself ... hope to protect my job . "
" It 's been a very bizarre experience , " Letterman said in closing .
" I do n't plan to say much more about this . "

Ilissa Shefferman arrived at the vaccination site more than an hour before the doors opened with her 8 - month - old daughter .
Ms. Shefferman , 36 , a stay - at - home mother , brought documentation that she was asthmatic just in case she had to prove it .
As she surveyed the line , she said she was annoyed to see people who appeared not to be in the risk groups .
“ If they ’re not high - risk , they should have respect for those who are , ” Ms. Shefferman said .

Another person in line , Bill Wenthen , who is 50 , brought his young daughter to get vaccinated and said he would try to get the vaccine himself if the medical staff would allow it , even though he was not part of the high - risk population .
“ I ’ll go for it if they let me , ” Mr. Wenthen said .
Dr. Julie Morita , the medical director for the Chicago Department of Public Health ’s immunization program , said the department expected to vaccinate about 7,000 people on Tuesday .
Women who were visibly pregnant and people in wheelchairs would be allowed to move to the front of the line .
“ One thing we learned is that we do n’t want late - term pregnant women sitting around waiting for hours , ” Dr. Morita said .
The disease control centers have sent out 22.4 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine across the country through a central distributor that gets the drug from the four manufacturers , allocated to each state on a per capita basis .
While the centers resist predicting when supplies might increase , the agency insists the vaccine will be much more widely available in the coming weeks .
States distribute the vaccines to health care providers and local health departments , which in turn dole out the supplies to those best situated to reach high - risk populations .
But officials acknowledge that reaching the most at - risk population is anything but an exact science .
“ It ’s perfectly understandable that people are worried about this flu , ” said Dr. Paul Jarris , the executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials , representing health officers of the 50 states .
“ We are n’t going to give people pregnancy tests to see if they need the vaccine . ”
Some states and cities  including New York City , which begins to roll out its school vaccine program on Wednesday  have chosen to focus on distributing vaccines primarily through schools , so that children can be roundly immunized .
Other states , like Tennessee , initially focused heavily on health care workers .
Would Canadians be “ safer with a camera on every corner ” ?
I have n’t got very involved with Canadian debates on surveillance yet ( but do n’t worry , I will ! ) .
However a comment piece in Thursday ’s Globe and Mail , which demanded that Canadian cities install ubiquitous video surveillance , prompted me to pen an immediate letter , which was signed by both Professor David Lyon and myself .
It was published today , slightly edited – the full version is below .
( They also decided to edit out our respective titles , which makes me look senior to Professor Lyon.
Oops . )
“ Marcus Gee writes that “ We ’d be safer with a camera on every corner ” ( Comment , May 22nd , p.15 ) .
If only this were true .
However it simply is not the case .
Mr Gee quotes the UK as an example of where video surveillance is effective , but this is not supported by the crime figures in the UK or by academic research .
The most comprehensive evaluation of all studies done of the effects of CCTV on crime ( by the Campbell Collaboration , 2009 ) concluded that it had little or not effect on the occurrence of violent crimes like the disgraceful murder of Christopher Skinner , which prompted Mr Gee to write .
Even the limited British police assessment of CCTV conducted by the Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) in 2008 , admitted this was the case .
It is easy to demand that ‘ something must be done ’ as a response to any particular incident of violent crime , and CCTV is the currently fashionable ‘ something . ’
But let us get beyond the superficial and look at the evidence .
Then we could have a proper debate about CCTV . ”
A baby had a miraculous escape when his pushchair rolled off a station platform and under a train .

Extraordinary CCTV footage was released today of the youngster 's brush with death in Melbourne , Australia .
It shows the boy 's mother momentarily letting go of the buggy , which then rolls off the platform and on to the track - just as a train pulls into the platform .
The driver used the emergency brakes but the pushchair was still dragged about 60 yards along the rails .
When it stopped , a member of the public jumped on to the tracks and grabbed the little boy .
Police said he had " superficial injuries to his head " but was otherwise unscathed .
He was taken to the Royal Children 's Hospital in Melbourne yesterday afternoon and was discharged later in the day .
Sergeant Michael Ferwerda of Victoria Police said : " It was a lucky escape and a chance for commuters to think about heeding warnings to be more careful around platforms . "

But , lo and behold , Adaptive Marketing has pulled out the big guns for me when it filed this application for bill of discovery in Connecticut state court , alleging “ defamation , trade libel , and tortious interference with contractual relations and business expectancies . ”
Or maybe it ’s the small guns ?

I wrote a follow up using publicly available information about Freescore ’s legal and corporate history .
The New York Times fired Ben Stein , and Felix Salmon celebrated at the Oyster Bar , Grand Central Terminal , NYC .
After that , I stopped paying attention to Freescore et al .
But since they had n’t stopped paying attention to me ( and not in a good way ) , I did a little more constitutionally protected research .
Here are some other interesting things that have come out since I wrote my entry :
And some stuff I missed the first time around :
Seems to me they should have let my post and my blog die the quiet death it had settled into .
I guess we shall see . . .
PS : Felix Salmon covers my legal troubles !
Update : Ben Stein works for Yahoo ?
I ca n’t keep track of the guy .
Also , more from Paul Levy on his Consumer Law & Policy blog .
Update 2 : More coverage from techdirt .
Update 3 : Salon here .
That exodus , potentially catastrophic for Gordon Brown and for Britain , reflects not only voter discontent but the sinuous salesmanship of Mr Griffin .
Diehard socialists worried about being homeless or jobless can tune out the rants on " Third World scroungers " and tell themselves the BNP is heir to the Labour Party for which their grandparents voted .
Meanwhile , racists who wish that fascism was less furtive can glory in the belief that hatred , wrapped in the Union flag , is coming home .
On Friday the winners of this year ’s Triplification Challenge were announced at I - Semantics 2009 in Graz .
The winners are :
We received a number of very high - quality submissions and decided to award two honorable mentions to :
The advertising watchdog has banned an ad campaign by animal rights group Peta for misleading consumers that swine flu could be contracted by eating meat .
Peta 's poster campaign stated " Meat kills " in large letters .
In the background smaller text listed a range of superbugs including E.Coli , mad cow disease , swine flu and MRSA .
The words " swine flu " were more prominent than the surrounding text .
A line at the bottom of the ad said : " Go Vegetarian . Peta " .
The Advertising Standards Authority received a complaint that the poster misleadingly implied that swine flu could be caught be eating meat and that it might cause " undue fear " about how it could be contracted .
Peta said it did not intend to suggest that eating meat caused swine flu but wanted to highlight the role that livestock production played in the incubation , development and spread of fatal infectious diseases .
Adopting a purely vegetarian diet was one of the best ways to prevent the development and spread of deadly diseases that originated from livestock production and meat consumption and which threatened public health , the organisation added .
The ASA noted that the poster referred to a number of diseases , two of which were known to have originated from eating meat and two that did not .
" Although we understood the intention was to refer to livestock and meat production rather than just eating meat , we considered that the message was , at best , ambiguous , " said the ASA .
" We considered that some readers might infer from the poster , and in particular the claim " Meat kills " in conjunction with the claim " Go vegetarian " , that eating meat caused swine flu .
We concluded that the poster was likely to mislead and could cause undue fear and distress to some readers . "

Response to “ Notes on HTML 5 ”
The W3C Technical Architecture Group ( TAG ) is in the process of reviewing HTML 5 .
Noah Mendelsohn recently posted his initial , personal , not - speaking - on - behalf - of - TAG notes on HTML 5 .
Here are my initial , personal , not - speaking - on - behalf - of - WHATWG responses .
Limitations of the XML serialization
This may be old news , but I was surprised to see that document .
write ( ) is not supported when parsing the XML serialization .
This seems to put the nail in the coffin of XML as a serialization format for colloquial HTML .
I understand that there are a variety of issues in making a sensible definition of how this would work , but my intuition is that it could be done reasonably cleanly ( albeit not with most off - the - shelf XML parsers ) .
Many , many things helped drive the nail in the coffin of XML as a serialization format for colloquial HTML .
This was probably one of them .
Others that come to mind :
Draconian error handling enforced at runtime does not scale to the complexities of modern - day web applications .
Ensuring well - formedness becomes increasingly difficult when content is dynamically cobbled together from multiple sources , some of which are beyond your control ( user - generated content , third - party ad servers , and so on ) .
It provides no perceivable benefit to users .
Draconianly handled content does not do more , does not download faster , and does not render faster than permissively handled content .
Indeed , it is almost guaranteed to download slower , because it requires more bytes to express the same meaning -- in the form of end tags , self - closing tags , quoted attributes , and other markup which provides no end - user benefit but serves only to satisfy the artifical constraints of an intentionally restricted syntax .
IE never supported it , forcing you down the rabbit hole of polyglot documents .
Other applicable specifications
" Authors must not use elements , attributes , and attribute values for purposes other than their appropriate intended semantic purpose .
Authors must not use elements , attributes , and attribute values that are not permitted by this specification or other applicable specifications . "
This is one of the most important sentences in the entire specification , but it 's somewhat vague .
If " other applicable specifications " means : any specification that anyone claims is applicable to HTML 5 extension , then we can extend the langauge with most any element without breaking conformance ; if " applicable specifications " is a smaller ( or empty ) set , then this may be saying that HTML 5 has limited ( or zero ) extensibility .
The phrase " or other application specifications " is indeed quite important , and quite intentional .
It explicitly allows something that previous HTML specifications only implicitly allowed , or disallowed - but - everyone - ignored - that - part : future specifications which extend the vocabulary of previous specifications .
Ian Hickson uses RDFa as an example : " If an RDFa specification said that text / html could have arbitrary xmlns :* attributes , then the HTML5 specification would ( by virtue of the above - quoted sentence ) defer to it and thus it would be allowed .
...
Of course , if a community does n't acknowledge the authority of such a spec , and they _do_ acknowledge the authority of the HTML5 spec , then it would be ( for them ) as if that spec did n't exist .
Similarly , there might be a community that only acknowledges the HTML4 spec and does n't consider HTML5 to be relevant , in which case for them , HTML5 is n't relevant .
This is how specs work . "
In response to a question about how validators could possible work with such flexible constraints , Ian Hickson writes , " The same way validators work now .
The validator implementors decide which specs they think are relevant to their users .
The W3C CSS validator , for instance , can be configured to check against CSS2.1 rules or against SVG rules about CSS .
It ca n't be configured to check against CSS2.1 + the :- moz - any - link extension , because the CSS validator implementors have decided that CSS2.1 and SVG are relevant , but not the Mozilla CSS extensions .
...
The W3C HTML validator , similarly , supports checking a document against XHTML 1.1 , or XHTML + RDFa , or XHTML + SVG , but does n't support checking it against XHTML + DOCBOOK .
So its implementors have decided that RDFa , SVG , and XHTML are relevant , but DOCBOOK is not . "
People who think that such lack of constraints can only lead to madness go strangely silent when it is pointed out that they have already violated such constraints , and the world failed to end as a result .
URL terminology
The HTML 5 draft uses the term URL , not URI .
I was under the impression that HTML 5 uses the term " URL " because that 's what everyone else in the world uses ( outside a few standards wonks who know the difference between URLs , URIs , IRIs , XRIs , LEIRIs , and so on ) .
A few minutes of research supported my impression .
Quoth Ian Hickson : " ' URL ' is what everyone outside the standards world calls them .
The few people who understand what on earth IRI , URN , URI , and URL are supposed to mean and how to distinguish them have demonstrated that they are able to understand such complicated terminology and can deal with the reuse of the term ' URL ' .
Others , who think ' URL ' mean exactly what the HTML5 spec defines it as , have not demonstrated an ability to understand these subtleties and are better off with us using the term they 're familiar with .
The real solution is for the URI and IRI specs to be merged , for the URI spec to change its definitions to match what ' URL ' is defined as in HTML5 ( e.g. finally defining error handling as part of the core spec ) , and for everyone to stop using terms other than ' URL ' . "
It should be noted that not everyone agrees with this .
For example , Roy Fielding ( who obviously understands the subtle differences between URLs and other things ) recently stated : " Use of the term URL in a manner that directly contradicts an Internet standard is negligent and childish .
HTML5 can rot until that is fixed . "
Maciej Stachowiak , recently appointed co-chair of the W3C HTML Working Group , recently stated : " We need to get the references in order first , because whether HTML5 references Web Address , or IRI bis , or something else , makes a difference to what we 'll think about the naming issue .
We need to decide as a Working Group if it 's acceptable to use the term URL in a different way than RFC3986 ( while making the difference clear ) .
If it 's unacceptable , then we need to propose an alternate term . "
As the old saying goes , " There are only two hard problems in Computer Science : cache invalidation and naming things . "
I personally do n't care about the matter either way , but there is obviously a wide spectrum of opinion .
IRI -bis
It 's unclear whether the factoring to reference WebAddr and / or IRI - bis will be retained .
" WebAddr " refers to Web Addresses , a now - defunct proposal to split out the definition of " URL " that HTML 5 uses ( which intentionally differs from the " official " definition in order to handle existing web content ) .
The work on the " Web Addresses " specification has now been rolled into IRI - bis ; " bis " means " next , " so " IRI - bis " means " the next version of the IRI specification . "
According to Ian Hickson , so important definitions were lost in the process of splitting out " Web Addresses " from HTML 5 and subsequently merging " Web Addresses " into IRI - bis .
There is also some feedback about newlines within URLs .
Work on IRI - bis is ongoing .
As it relates to HTML 5 , it is tracked as HTML ISSUE - 56 .
Content sniffing
HTML 5 calls for user agents to ignore normative Content - type in certain cases .
HTML 5 calls for user agents to ignore normative Content - Type in certain cases because this is required to handle existing web content .
Based on [ PDF ] the research of Adam Barth and others into the content sniffing rules of a certain closed - source market - dominating browser , progress has been made towards reducing the amount of content sniffing on the public web .
( Counterpoint : two steps forward , one step back . )
Personally , I have long been opposed to content sniffing , but if sniffing is going to occur , I would vastly prefer documented algorithms to undocumented ones .
The " hope " behind documenting the sniffing rules now is that the web community can " freeze " the rules now and forever , i.e. not add any more complexity to an already complex world .
I am personally skeptical , since HTML 5 also introduces ( or at least promotes - to - their - own - elements ) two new media families , audio and video , for which undocumented or underdocumented sniffing may already occur within proprietary browser plug-ins .
And with @font - face support shipping or on the verge of shipping in multiple browsers , there may be new sniffing rules introduced there as well .
I hope my concerns are unfounded .
Still , having sniffing rules documented in HTML 5 may -- someday soon -- reduce the complexity of a shipping product .
And how often does that happen ?
Willful violations
HTML 5 acknowledges in several places that it is in " willful violation " of other specifications from the W3C and IETF .
As stated in § 1.5.2 Compliance with other specifications , " This specification interacts with and relies on a wide variety of other specifications .
In certain circumstances , unfortunately , the desire to be compatible with legacy content has led to this specification violating the requirements of these other specifications .
Whenever this has occurred , the transgressions have been noted as ' willful violations ' . "
This is the complete list of " willful violations " in the August 25th W3C Editor 's Draft of HTML 5 .
( The WHATWG draft changes almost daily , whenever a change is checked in . )
As you can probably guess from these quotes , the HTML 5 community has decided that compatibility with existing web content trumps all other concerns .
Other than the use of the term " URL , " all of the " willful violations " are instances where other specifications do not adequately describe existing web content .
I personally do not understand most of the issues listed here , so I have no opinion on whether the alleged benefit of violating existing standards is worth the alleged cost .
Versioning
In - band global version identifiers , if new implementations handle them reasonably , may be useful for ( a ) authoring applications that want to track versions used for authoring ( b ) informative error handling when applications encounter constructs that are apparently ' in error ' .
The idea of version identifiers has been hashed and rehashed throughout the 5 + year process of defining HTML 5 .
Most notably , Microsoft proposed a version identifer shortly after the W3C HTML Working Group reformed around HTML 5 .
Their proposal generated much discussion , but was not ultimately adopted .
Several months later , Microsoft shipped Internet Explorer 8 with a " feature " called X - UA - Compatible , which serves as a kind of IE - specific version identifier .
I am personally not a fan of this approach , in part because [ PNG ] it adds a lot of complexity for web developers who want to figure out why the still - dominant browser does n't render their content according to standards .
Versioning in HTML 5 is tracked as HTML ISSUE - 4 .
He has become internationally recognized as an authority on ancient potables .
When he and other museum researchers were on the budget chopping block earlier this year , nearly 4,000 supporters signed a petition , among them archaeologists , curators , and government officials from countries around the world .
Egypt 's director of antiquities was one of them .
Every evening , we all go for a walk in the park sketchup download kostenlos 32 bit .
The boys ride their bikes , while my husband and I stroll behind and chat about our day .
We take the same route every time – we walk past the park , along the creek , through the oval , until we reach the lake subtitles for free .
At the lake , again the routine is always the same .
The boys take off their helmets and scamper around filling them with honky nuts – woody gum nuts of a West Australian tree , perfect for throwing raspberry dateien .
Callum , my 4.5 yo , is exceptionally careful not to scratch his prized Spiderman helmet .
So the boys stand at the edge of the lake and throw all the honky nuts into the water , shouting , cheering and pretending to be superheros , in particular , Spiderman Download subway surfer app for free .
Then they put their helmets back on , ride to the big park , where they play more Spiderman games .
But not today .
A few moments after Callum put on his helmet , he suddenly started to shout and dance around frantically , pointing to his head , which , of course , has pictures of spiders on it bison herunterladen .
“ AHK !
AHK !
SPIDERS ! SPIDERS ! SPIDERS ! ”
It was so funny .
We all laughed at his crazy antic .
He danced a silly jig with his legs and banged his helmet with his arms basecamp download kostenlos .
And then we realised that he was NOT KIDDING .
We raced over , unclipped his helmet , and saw that his head and neck were COVERED with tiny little black spiders herunterladen .
Oh , the irony of it all .
Eighty - one years ago , architect Frank Lloyd Wright marveled at an old material that he helped give new meaning .
" What is this magic material , there but not seen if you are looking through it ? " he asked in an essay .
Mr. Wright responded to that question – one that has fascinated architects and engineers before and after his work – by calling glass a " supermaterial " and frequently incorporating it into his designs .
With prescience , Wright believed that future buildings would be constructed where " Walls themselves because of glass will become windows and windows as we know them as holes in walls will be seen no more . "
Would Wright be surprised to see how his vision of glass architecture has come true in 2009 ?
The prevalence of towering glassy skyscrapers would probably not shock him – but the changing nature of glass itself might .
" Glass has become less about abetting observation ; it is something to be observed in itself , " explains Michael Bell , a professor of architecture at Columbia University , in his recent book and DVD " Engineered Transparency – The Technical , Visual , and Spatial Effects of Glass . "
In a phone interview , Mr. Bell says that glass is no longer a single material , " but the name of the family of building materials ' rewritten ' by new technologies . "
Thanks to breakthroughs and continued stoking by architects , engineers have created glasses capable of things Wright would have never dared to attempt .
In doing so , Bell says , " glass may have become something other than glass . "
The traditional glass recipe – mix sand , soda powder , and quicklime , then heat until transparent – delivers unpredictable strength and fragility .
But in the 20th century , Wright and other architectural pioneers began designing buildings where interior daylight and landscape views were highly valued .
To accommodate their imagination , architects urged engineers to craft new glass formulations with increased capacities to predictably perform structurally and artfully .
The age of skyscrapers became possible through the invention of strengthened glass able to bear ground and weather changes , and unforeseeable human activities .
To understand the demands placed upon glass in high - rise buildings , think of a car windshield :
It consists of a sandwich of two layers of glass with a layer of a clear synthetic resin between .
The resin layer seals the glass sheets together and , in the event of a crash , prevents them from breaking into tiny shards .
These " interlayers " have since contributed to novel " hybrid glass , " possessing previously unimaginable strength under enormous loads .
In the 21st century , innovative glass technology has been driven by concerns with climate change , energy conservation , and urban sustainability .
For example , the heating and cooling needs of American buildings amount to an enormous collective energy bill – and estimates say one - third of a building 's energy expenditure comes from heat seeping through traditional windows .
Conversely , window glass can intensify the sun 's rays during summer , forcing millions to reach for the air conditioner .
However , by using argon or krypton gas between glass panes , solar heat can be better managed .
Another technological wonder is " smart glass , " or to use the proper term , " electrochromatic glass . "
It is coated architectural glass that changes its properties from moment to moment depending on changing light conditions .
Under direct light , the panes darken , controlling how much glare and heat pour through the windows without relying on curtains or blinds that can obstruct views .
" Self - cleaning glass " comes coated with a thin layer of titanium oxide that is activated by the sun 's ultraviolet rays .
The resulting reaction causes dirt on the window to dissolve .
The titanium coating also stops raindrops from beading , thus reducing spotting .
These innovations in glass technology come with a price – literal as well as artistic .
" Each manipulation for improved energy performance makes glass less like glass and more like other nontransparent materials , such as metals , ceramics , and stone , " said architect and consultant Robert Heintges at the 2007 Columbia University conference on glass in architecture that inspired Bell 's book and DVD .
Mr. Heintges 's consulting firm in New York has worked on more than 30 million square feet of building facades internationally .
He must often balance aesthetic transparency with energy performance .
When glass is tinted , sandwiched with different materials , or coated , it can boost the building 's green credentials , but it also can diminish the windows ' transparency , thus diminishing the purpose of using glass in the first place .
People might talk about wanting a " green building , " he says .
Yet how many will sacrifice dazzling views through wide expanses of glass for the sake of energy conservation ?
Such trade - offs have begun to fade , as green - minded architects and high - tech engineers collaborate more closely and more creatively .
Boston 's Institute of Contemporary Art , completed in 2006 on the city 's harbor front , features a long glass protrusion that houses its theater .
The dramatically cantilevered building offers panoramic views of Boston Harbor thanks to designs by Diller Scofidio + Renfro and technical work by Arup Engineering .
The center 's 325 - seat theater boasts a massive glass wall capable of instantly changing from transparent to opaque in synch with any performance on stage .
Sometimes the engineer and architect are the same person .
Werner Sobek showcased his dual skills with " House R 128 , " a four - level , glass - wrapped , solar - powered house he designed for himself just outside Stuttgart , Germany .
Constructed from 20 tons of glass and 12 tons of steel , the building has no definitely defined rooms and interior walls , with the exception of the bathrooms .
Every element of the house can be recycled .
Its triple - glazed walls insulate the house so well in winter that no interior heating system is needed , he says .
In North America , one of the most distinct heralds of new glass design is the Glass Pavilion of the Toledo Museum of Glass in Ohio .
Designed by SANAA , the firm led by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa , the Glass Pavilion is a capacious structure holding the Toledo Museum 's collection of glass art in an ever - changing , light - filled maze of translucence and transparency .
The museum 's lightness ( on many levels ) is made possible through large panels of curved glass that seem weightlessly suspended – an illusion created through engineering – between the museum 's concrete floor and steel roof .
Interior glass walls define galleries , and the spaces between these glass walls allow ventilation .
The continuously curving building required advanced technological expertise .
Its precisely bent , enormous glass panels shape a structure with no right angles , causing sound as well as light to travel in surprising directions , while confusing conventional perceptions of distance .
Jeff Mack , manager of the Pavilion 's Glass Studio , describes the building as " an homage to what is around us " – a park with 150 - year - old trees .
Robin Schultes , who teaches glasswork in the pavilion , says , " I 'm a weather fanatic .
I love being able to see impending storm systems coming in while feeling safe and cozy within the building . "
She also enjoys the looks of first - time visitors coming to the Glass Pavilion .
" They initially are looking completely at the pavilion – then they turn their attention to the glass collection in it . "
In a museum housing more than 5,000 pieces of glass art , this 76,000 - square - foot glass museum , made sparkling with 32,000 square feet of glass , reveals how Wright 's vision of glass walls has arrived .
Here 's something refreshing : Learning about a politician 's marriage before it's a complete trainwreck !
For this week 's New York Times magazine cover story , Jodi Kantor spoke to Barack and Michelle Obama about their relationship .
Advertisement
" I married you because you 're cute and you 're smart , " Michelle told the President when he first announced that he intended to run for the Illinois State Senate .
" But this is the dumbest thing you could have ever asked me to do . "
Fourteen years later , she might think differently about her husband 's political career , but it took a while to get there .
And you can't blame her for being irritated along the way when she mentions that " This is the first time in a long time in our marriage that we 've lived seven days a week in the same household with the same schedule , with the same set of rituals .
That 's been more of a relief for me than I would have ever imagined . "
Prior to their moving into the White House , they had n't lived together full - time since before Malia was born .
" Barack does n't belong to you , " a friend told Michelle around the time he was in Bali writing Dreams from My Father , and not long before he started going on the road constantly .
The narrative here builds toward her acceptance of that fact — or at least , that he only belongs to her in certain ways .
The rewards of her letting him go , of not insisting that he give up politics and find a job that brought him home for dinner every night , are obvious .
But then , so are the sacrifices .
She was essentially a single mom who also worked outside the home — not entirely by choice , when the girls were little — for much of his early political career , since his time - consuming work was n't bringing in enough to support the family .
She had to bring baby Sasha to her job interview at the University of Chicago Medical Center , because her sitter canceled at the last minute and Dad was somewhere else .
Says the president , " Michelle would say , ‘ Well , you 're gone all the time and we 're broke ?
How is that a good deal ? ' "
He wrote about their frequent conflict over their long - distance marriage in The Audacity of Hope ( " he may have been wise to raise the issue before anyone else , " Kantor notes ) , but says , " There was no point where I was fearful for our marriage .
There were points in time where I was fearful that Michelle just really did n't - that she would be unhappy . "
And , frankly , she was .

All those sacrifices she made leading up to his election as president make a great backstory , but Kantor is smart enough to recognize that the story 's far from over .
She asks the Obamas point blank " how any couple can have a truly equal partnership when one member is president . "
Said president hems and haws a bit before responding .
" My staff worries a lot more about what the first lady thinks than they worry about what I think , " he finally said , to laughter around the room .
The question still unanswered , his wife stepped back in : " Clearly Barack 's career decisions are leading us .
They 're not mine ; that 's obvious .
I 'm married to the president of the United States .
I do n't have another job , and it would be problematic in this role .
So that - you can't even measure that . "

Can I just tell you how much I love that Michelle does n't let him get away with turning it all into a joke ?
( Especially a hoary old , " Oh , really , my wife 's the one with all the power ! " joke .
For fuck 's sake , you 're the president of the United States .
That joke is annoying when regular guys make it to avoid directly addressing the actual inequality in their marriages , and off - the - charts annoying when you do it . )
Michelle 's gotten heaps of praise for being an Ivy League - educated lawyer with a high - powered professional background , yet dutifully taking on the role of traditional First Lady , never overstepping her bounds — unlike certain other Ivy League - educated lawyer wives of youngish Democratic presidents in recent memory .
But people are so eager to applaud her for knowing her place , they do n't seem willing to consider how , you know , it kind of sucks that after all the support she 's given her husband , the end result is that she can't even have a job of her own .
Barack does n't belong to her — but for the time being , she belongs to Barack .
And the media .
And the American People .
And the world .
Just not so much to herself .
Oh , and about that other ivy league - educated lawyer wife — not to mention her husband .
Clinton comparisons abound here , for reasons I can't quite grasp .
Sure , there are some superficial similarities , but also — as the comparisons inevitably demonstrate — so many differences , it 's hard to see why Kantor does n't compare them to Bushes or Kennedys or Roosevelts or Jolie - Pitts .
In fact , it 's not even clear who 's who in the Clinton / Obama analogy .
As a first - time candidate , Barack could be stiff ; friends remember him talking to voters with his arms folded , looking defensive .
Michelle warmed everyone up , including her husband .
" She is really Bill , and he is really Hillary , " one friend recently put it .
But like Hillary Clinton - and countless other political wives - Michelle sometimes took on the role of enforcer .
Advertisement
Which raises the obvious question :
If Michelle has both Bill 's charisma and Hillary 's ovaries of steel , why the hell is she not our president ?
That question occurred to me again while reading the passage where Kantor gets into Michelle 's " vital role in heading off the most promising female [ presidential ] candidate in United States history . "
It was essential for the Obama campaign to present some sort of accomplished female counterweight to Hillary Clinton , to convince Democratic women that they could vote for Barack Obama and a powerful female figure besides .
Consciously or not , Michelle made herself into an appealing contrast to the front - runner .
She was candid ; Hillary was often guarded .
Michelle represented the idea that a little black girl from the South Side of Chicago could grow up to be first lady of the United States ; Hillary stood for the hold of the already - powerful on the political system .
And Michelle seemed to have the kind of marriage many people might aspire to ; Hillary did not .
Advertisement
This whole passage makes me sad .
That 's partly because I voted for Clinton in large part because I regarded her as long - overdue proof that a little girl from the Chicago suburbs could grow up to be president , and it still irritates me to see her held up primarily as a symbol of the establishment , rather than a swift kick in the establishment 's shriveled white nuts .
( I think she and Obama are both about 50 /50 there . )
But it 's also because the false equivalence continues to go unquestioned , just as it did in the campaign — we 're meant to accept that becoming First Lady is basically just as momentous for a woman as becoming president would be .
Which ... you remember that Hillary Clinton is one of the people in this equation , right ?
And seriously , every time I heard that shit about a little girl from the South Side growing up to be First Lady , all I could think was , " What little girl dreams of being married to the most powerful person on the planet ? "
I do n't know , maybe some still do in the twenty - first century , but I certainly did n't in the late twentieth .
I was heartbroken when I learned in elementary school that being born in Canada makes me ineligible for the presidency ; it took many more years before it fully sunk in that my vagina does , too .
And sadder still is the fact that little African - American girls are faced with even less evidence to suggest they could ever scale those heights .
Michelle may have Bill 's charisma , Hillary 's toughness and Barack 's brains , but with racism and sexism both working against her , she could n't have made it as far as any of them if she 'd wanted to .
Fortunately for her , if not for little girls in desperate need of role models in politics , Michelle does n't seem to want to .
And being the wife of a cute , smart president who clearly adores her is not such a bad gig , even if it means her personal ambitions have to wait another three to seven years .
Despite my focus on the First Lady 's sacrifices and the inequality of the marriage here ( I am a humorless feminist , after all ) , Kantor 's portrait of the Obama 's marriage is really quite sweet , warts and all .
They joke .
They flirt .
They go on dates and ignore the conservatives who flip out about our tax dollars going toward dinner and a show .
That 's just not the whole picture , and Michelle herself believes revealing the warts has a higher purpose .
" If my ups and downs , our ups and downs in our marriage can help young couples sort of realize that good marriages take work .
. . . "
Michelle Obama said a few minutes later in the interview .
The image of a flawless relationship is " the last thing that we want to project , " she said .
" It 's unfair to the institution of marriage , and it 's unfair for young people who are trying to build something , to project this perfection that does n't exist "

The First Marriage [ NY Times ]
It 's still too early to tell , but my glowing praise of the show last week appears to be premature .
While the tone of the show remained largely the same - mysterious , the dialogue was still clunky with bold , but plainly simple declarations that seemed absurd .
Imagine Horatio from CSI : Miami and giving his lines to all the characters .
Yeah , that 's about how bad it was at times .
The writers seem to think every character needs some profound statement that blows the case wide open .
Unfortunate , the audience can understand everything with little if any logic .
There were good moments in the episode covered up by a lot of other totally unnecessary junk .
The reaction of Mark 's daughter to Olivia 's patient was very interesting and unsettling , but that story will play out slowly .
There was a nice addition of another suspect who was on the phone with suspect zero .
Demetri gets a call after putting his flash forward in the Mosaic Projects , and learns from Dina Araz ( her name in 24 ) that he dies a few weeks before the 6 months .
This was the extent of the mystery which should be the focus of the entire show .
Instead we are treated with issues of how to react to a possible future and response in the aftermath of a crisis .
Melodrama was very heavy with Olivia meeting her future mystery man who is named Lloyd Simcoe .
Mark and Olivia talk a few times and the whole time I could n't care less .
Joseph Fiennes and Sonya Walger are n't that great together though that could change over time .
The introduction of Simcoe kind of bothers me because love triangles are stupid especially this early in a show .
It had to point out a completely random scene with the boss at the FBI .
The flash forward occurred while he was on the toilet , so he comes out of the stall , sees so guy with his head in the urinal and ends up giving mouth to mouth .
It was funny and I laughed , but this kind of off - the - wall humor does n't belong on shows like this .
Flash Forward can have light moments ; there are plenty on Lost , but creating an absurd situation with the sole intent of humor is definitely misplaced .
The ratings are still good , but I 'm worried .
The storytelling does n't seem to have much focus and for a second episode , this was especially weak .

Work From Home With Google ?
Not So Fast Experts warn of scam sites that use logos for Google and news sites such as ABC .
Aug. 31 , 2009  -- Like many Americans , the recession had Christine Kufel worried about her job security .
So Kufel , an Ohio corrections officer , thought she 'd create her own safety net by earning extra income at home .
A Web site advertisement promising work - from - home opportunities seemed like a good fit , she said .
The site said customers could earn $ 300 to $ 1,000 a day by starting their own businesses .
But the affiliations suggested by the site were questionable at best :
It said that customers would earn cash " working from home with Google , " even though Google says it does not endorse such work - from - home sites .
It also claimed that it had been featured by television news organizations , including ABC News and CNN .
Both organizations say they have n't endorsed the site .
The site 's only real connection to legitimate news organizations , experts say , seems to be through paid advertisements placed on those organizations '
Web sites .
But Kufel did n't know about these dubious connections when she signed up .
The references to the popular search engine and television news , she said , gave her a sense there was " some legitimacy " to what it offered .
She thought the site would help her do some sort of sales or marketing work from home with the help of a special business kit .
" You see big names like that and you think , ' OK , well it 's valid ... it 's worth looking into at that point , ' " she said .
Now Kufel wishes she had n't .
The company , she said , tried to charge $ 84 to her credit card without ever sending her the kit .
Kufel said she called her credit card company and managed to cancel the charge before it went through , but she 's still angry .
" I was scammed , " she said .
Hundreds of Consumers Complain
The Better Business Bureau said it has received hundreds of complaints from consumers who say they 've been scammed by Web sites advertising work - from - home opportunities that appear to be affiliated with Google .
Earlier this summer , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) took one such site , Google Money Tree , to court , alleging that the companies behind the site misrepresented their affiliations with Google and did n't adequately explain to customers that they'd be charged $ 72.21 a month for signing up with the site .
Efforts to reach the defendants named in the FTC lawsuit were unsuccessful .
For its part , Google says it is fighting back against the perception that it 's involved with work - from - home scams .
" Google is not paying people thousands of dollars a week to fill out forms or to post links , " said Jason Morrison of Google 's search quality team .
" Scammers are using the Google name and logo without our permission , and we are taking whatever actions we can technically and with our legal team . "
Reputable Brands , Troubling Ads
Alison Southwick , a spokeswoman for the Better Business Bureau , said work - from - home scammers use both Google and TV logos to gain credibility for their dubious operations -- and sometimes it works .
Consumers think , " Oh , this was featured in a news story , so it must be legitimate , but usually buried in the bottom in very fine print , it says , ' We are are not affiliated with ABC , CNN , etc. , ' " she said .
What can further confuse consumers , she said , is that advertisements for the scams sometimes show up on legitimate news Web sites , including this one .
Here 's how it works : A news Web site contracts with advertising placement companies to provide small text ads and links -- the kind you 'll often see at the very bottom of online news articles .
It 's the ad placement company , not the news site , that controls the ads .
Some of the ads are placed based on context .
For instance , an ad for a tooth - whitening company may appear below a news article about a dentist .
Likewise , an ad for working - from - home operations may appear near a news article about careers .
Google has an ad placement service , and the Web giant concedes that it just can't stop all scam ads , including scam work - from - home sites , from being delivered to its clients .
" We have hundreds of thousands of advertisers , " said Google 's Morrison .
" We can't look at every ad , so we have to rely on automated methods . "
He added , " It 's an arms race .
Every time we clamp down , they find a work around . "
AOL Defends Ad Quality
One of the largest online ad placement companies is Quigo , which is owned by AOL .
The company places ads with ABC News , Fox News and USA Today , among others .
" AOL makes efforts to maintain high quality advertising standards , " AOL said in a written statement .
" However , advertisers are ultimately responsible for complying with obligations concerning their consumers . "
Legitimate Web sites continue to contract with ad placement firms despite the risk of scam ads because the revenue brought in by the ads is large compared to the minuscule financial cost of hosting the ads , said Eric Clemons , a professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania .
The same is n't true , he said , for ads running on television and in newspapers , where commercial time and ad space , respectively , are more expensive .
" Basically , every little bit helps , and firms are not thinking about the reputational impact of accepting ads on a Web site that they would never accept either for print or broadcast , " Clemons said .
Real News , Scam Ads : Making the Distinction
Career expert Tory Johnson , the CEO of Women For Hire and a workplace contributor to " Good Morning America , " says it is important for consumers to recognize the difference between news articles and ads placed on news sites .
Johnson has found links to apparent work - from - home scams on pages containing her own ABCNews.com articles .
" That 's a key distinction , " she said .
" Consumers , Web site visitors should look for the fine print that says ' sponsored ads , ' ' advertisement ' or ' sponsored link . ' "
The ads to suspicious work - from - home sites do n't necessarily lead directly to the sites themselves .
Often , the links lead to what appear to be newspaper sites .
Such sites , the Better Business Bureau 's Southwick said , are typically fake .
It 's those phony newspaper sites that then link to work - from - home sites , including those that mislead consumers by using logos for Google and news organizations .
Kufel said that 's how she wound up on the work - from - home site that ultimately scammed her -- she saw an advertisement for it on a news site , followed the ad link to what appeared to be a newspaper site and followed links from there to the work - from - home site .
After removing the company 's charge from her credit card , Kufel was still worried that the company might try to charge her again , so she cancelled her card and asked that a credit reporting agency put a fraud alert on her credit report .
She also reached out to Meiselman , Denlea , Packman , Carton & Eberz , a New York law firm considering a class action lawsuit against companies perpetuating apparent work - from - home scams using the Google name .
Lawyer Jerome Noll said the companies have been hard to track down .
" If you try to hunt them down , they 've got P.O. boxes , their phone numbers are disconnected , " he said .
" Unfortunately , there really is n't a defendant worth suing .
...
They 're fly - by - night operations that just are there to scam as many consumers as possible out of their money and then disappear . "
The Whack - a- Mole Dilemma
Even finding and stopping one company may not do much about the larger problem .
Experts say that trying to shut down such Web sites is like playing a game of " whack - a - mole " -- as soon as you hit one , another pops up .
A consumer 's best bet , Women For Hire 's Johnson said , is to watch out for themselves .
" I think especially given the economy , with more pressure than ever to find a way to generate income , more and more people are suspending the average common sense , " she said .
" This is the time you have to be even more critical -- you have to be more vigilant than ever before . "
ABC News ' Becky Worley contributed to this report .
A very invigorated and activist Michelle Caruso - Cabrera points out what Zero Hedge has been claiming for some time : that the SEC should be disbanded post haste ( although it appears Michelle 's gripe is more with the lack of individual responsibility by the American citizen ... alas that is arguably the mootest point in the history of the universe - exhibit A : McDonalds desert wrappers that claim " contents may be hot , " to avoid frivolous multimillion dollar lawsuits from idiot customers ) .
At least the former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt confirms that the SEC ( and the Rating Agencies ) has been an abysmal failures in detecting and preventing any form of market abuse , and frankly , does not deserve a one cent budget , let alone $ 900 million :
Those who sit back and think that they can rely either on the government or rating agencies or even third party experts , are making a huge mistake .
Thank you Harvey , we could not have said it any clearer ourselves .
As a former Chairman of the agency you should know .
Yet Pitt is correct in the following :
" I think the most important thing for the government to be doing is getting a constant flow of significant data from everyone who takes money from the investing public and then analyze that information , and disseminate it back to the markets .
We are not seeing that and therefore our markets are not transparent . "
Start immediately with those who now effectively run the markets .
It ’s amazing how some seemingly technical problems can be very dangerous to solve by IT in isolation .
One such issue is the question whether to merge similar code from different projects into a shared base or not .
It looks as if it is completely in the IT domain , but it essentially lies on the critical business path and the answer to the question depends very much on the market situation in which the business operates and marketing plans of the company .
A few of us met up two weeks ago to continue the discussion from the AltNetUK 2009 conference on domain driven design beyond basic patterns and building blocks , or “ the second half of the blue book ” as Ian Cooper called it .
Stuart Campbell raised the question of merging - should two similar projects be refactored and similar parts extracted into a shared kernel .
The discussion that followed made it clear to me how dangerous is to consider this question without looking at the big picture from a business side ( or again using the terms from the second half of the blue book , considering what really is the core domain and what makes the system worth writing ) .
This is again where the question ‘ Why ? ’ should be raised before we discuss ‘ How ? ’ and ‘ What ? ’ , something that should in my opinion be raised much more often on software projects .
Merging common parts of similar projects and extracting a shared component makes a lot of sense , as it can reduce management costs and make changes to both projects easier to synchronize in the future .
But that might actually be counter - productive .
If the end client or the company that is developing software for its own operations is in a fairly stable , low margin market where everyone delivers the same old service but their competitive advantage is being able to deliver it cheaper , then consolidating and merging makes sense .
Losing a few bits of functionality or making it slower to deliver individual projects does n’t really matter much , as the market and products should be fairly stable .
On the other hand , if the company is in an emerging innovative market , with high margins and competing on functionality , the overhead of maintenance for two separate projects might be negligible compared to potential gains of delivering faster and being more flexible with features .
For a shared kernel to work , it has to be accompanied by serious change management procedures and a lot more integration testing .
This introduces a significant overhead on implementing new features in that shared part .
It also makes two previously independent projects reliant on the quality and delivery timelines of that shared part .
Also , in a dynamic market , opportunities change and lots of code gets deprecated quickly – it is easier to throw it away if it does not belong to a “ core ” library .
Very often , these “ shared ” , “ util ” , “ api ” or “ core ” libraries are essentially some kind of limbo where undead code lurks because nobody has the time or power to drop it .
The point I ’m trying to make is that there is no right or wrong answer to the question of merging in general .
In particular , cheaper maintenance is not always the competitive advantage of the business and the main business goal , although it seems as a good idea .
Sometimes more expensive maintenance with more flexible delivery makes a lot more sense from a business perspective , especially for companies that claim to be innovators .
Unfortunately , if this question is considered in isolation by the IT , it might actually turn out to shoot the business in the foot with the best of intentions .

Like a complete unknown : Bob Dylan frogmarched to collect ID after rookie policewoman fails to recognise scruffy music legend
He has sold albums by the million and was the idol of the 1960s protest movement .
But yesterday Bob Dylan discovered what it 's like to be just a face in the crowd .
Police were called in a quiet seaside town after he was spotted freewheelin ' down the street and apparently acting suspiciously .
A 22 - year - old female officer demanded to see his identification papers .
He assumed she would at least recognise the name if not the face .
But she ordered him into the back of her car and took him to his hotel to check his story .
Music legend : Bob Dylan had been taking an afternoon stroll when residents of Long Branch , New Jersey complained of a man ' acting suspiciously '
Then she radioed her older colleagues at the police station to ask if anyone knew who Bob Dylan was .
' I'm afraid we all fell about laughing , ' said Craig Spencer , a senior officer in Long Branch , New Jersey .
' If it was me , I 'd have been demanding his autograph , not his ID .
' The poor woman has taken rather a lot of abuse from us .
I offered to bring in some of my Dylan albums .
Unfortunately , she does n't know what vinyl is either . '
It was in 1965 that Dylan wrote Like A Rolling Stone , with its line : ' How does it feel to be on your own , a complete unknown ? '
He found out while staying at the Ocean Place Resort in Long Branch .
Before taking part in a concert with Willie Nelson and John Mellencamp , he decided to take a stroll through the town 's Latin quarter .
' Residents called to complain there was an old scruffy man acting suspiciously , ' said officer Spencer .
' It was an odd request because it was mid-afternoon .
But it 's an ethnic Latin area and the residents felt he did n't fit in . '
This is not the first time that Dylan has wandered off alone while on tour .
After a concert in Belfast in 1991 , he shunned his chauffeur - driven limo and was captured by a TV crew waiting at a bus stop .
And in the middle of an American tour he popped unannounced into the childhood home of author Mark Twain .
When the stunned curator asked if he was really Bob Dylan , he said : ' I guess I am . '
Government legal officials are still investigating whether aspects of the £ 1.2bn e-Borders scheme are illegal , a year after concerns were raised by Eurostar .
Lawyers for the cross - channel train operator believe the system will require it to break European data privacy laws .
They have been pressing the UK Border Agency to clarify the situation since November last year .
At their most recent meeting in September , officials told Eurostar they were still mulling the problem .
" There 's been no progress at all , " said a spokesman for the firm .
" They said they were still looking into it . "
The ultimate goal of e-Borders is to centrally log every single traveller in and out of the UK , which will mean obtaining personal details before they travel .
The UK Border Agency wants carriers to collect the data abroad on its behalf .
Eurostar believes this will mean driving an express train through French and Belgian data legislation , both of which implement the EU data laws .
" We believe , and the legal advice we have had is that it is not legal to export the sort of data required by e-Borders within the EU , and it is only legal to export that data outside of the EU , " the firm 's customer service director told the Home Affairs Select Committee back in June .
Even then , Eurostar expressed frustration at the government 's lack of response to the possibility it will be " caught in a position that we are abiding by UK law but breaking EU law " .
" I would feel very uncomfortable if I had waited seven months to respond to a letter from the UK Borders Agency on an e-Borders matter , " Noaro said .
Eurostar also has more immediate commercial worries about e-Borders over the costs and potential for check - in delays .
Today the Home Office rejected Eurostar 's concerns , apparently contradicting what the firm said it was told in September .
" We are confident that e-Borders is compatible with the European Data Protection Directive , " said Brodie Clark , head of UK Border Force .
Air carriers already feed the system 's Manchester operation centre with the details of millions of passengers before they fly .
Clark said : " We have already proven e-Borders is a success , with it running effectively on many routes for four years .
We have been working with Eurostar and the carriers industry for the past two years , and have performed successful trials scanning 96 per cent of documents in seconds .
" We continue to work with carriers to avoid delays to passengers . "
He added that e-Borders has led to more than 4,500 arrests for crimes " including murder , rape and assault and significant counter - terrorist interventions " .
It 's planned that e-Borders will log every single journey in and out of the UK by 2014 .
In June , ferry operators echoed Eurostar 's concerns over the legality of its data gathering regime , and said they expect significant delays to the system as a result . ®
Devotees carry a statue of the Hindu elephant god Ganesh , the deity of prosperity , for immersion in the sea on the last day of " Ganesh Chaturthi " in Mumbai September 3 , 2009 .
Clay statues of Ganesh are made two to three months before the day of " Ganesh Chaturthi " , a popular religious festival in India .
The idols are taken through the streets in a procession accompanied by dancing and singing , to be immersed in a river or the sea symbolizing a ritual see - off of his journey towards his abode in " Kailash " , while taking away with him the misfortunes of all mankind .

Sun has dropped JSR 296 : Swing Application Framework ( SAF ) from Java 7 .
Writing on his blog spec lead Alexander Potochkin said :
" After much discussion it 's become clear that the Swing Application Framework API as it is today has n't reached consensus and we feel still needs further design work done .
Since the SAF API was committed to milestone 5 of JDK7 and that time is already here , this date is now impossible , and we need to decommit SAF from any specific JDK 7 milestone . "
Only two new features , Elliptic - Curve Cryptography and the Swing JXLayer component , made it into the original Milestone 5 schedule .
In response Sun has merged Milestones 5 and 6 , extending the period for Milestone 5 to 29th October .
Milestone 5 will now be the feature complete build and will include the new features from Project Coin , the JXDatePicker for Swing , and updates to the JAXP , JAXB , and JAX - WS APIs that make up Java 's XML stack , bringing them up to the most recent stable versions .
Following the feature complete build at the end of October Sun plans a further 14 builds ( until February 2010 ) to prepare a release candidate .
The complete list of Java 7 features can be found on the OpenJDK website here .
Since Potochkin made his announcement about SAF , at least two forks of the framework ( BSAF , SAFF ) have sprung up .
Jonathan Giles expressed his frustration at this on his blog :
" We went from the original SAF project whose requests for help fell on deaf ears ( although admittedly there was not much visibly happening on Sun 's side either ) to two actives forks .
If we had offered our time back when it was still JSR - 296 we could have had this integrated into JDK 7 , but because we waited for it to effectively die , we now have to most probably wait until JDK 8 , if ever , before an app framework for Swing can be integrated into a Java release . "
On the SAF mailing list Giles further suggested ditching one of the two forks so all the efforts can coalesce around one fork
" Assuming the two fork owners agree , pick one of the forks that presently exist , and call that SAF .
next .
Immediately stop and preferably delete the other fork to save any confusion . "
Potochkin has also confirmed to InfoQ that another much requested feature , Cascading Style Sheet ( CSS ) based styling for Swing components , which was a possible part of the Milestone 5 Swing Updates package , wo n't be in Java 7 either .
JavaFX has this capability , and Ethan Nicholas created a fairly comprehensive prototype for Swing , blogging about this project in summer 2008 .
Nicholas has also provided a tutorial with downloadable code at the project 's website .
Nobel Peace Prize recipient Barack Obama will soon escalate military operations in Afghanistan .
The president plans to increase the current force of 68,000 soldiers by at least 10,000 ( likely more ) and has discounted major withdrawal as an option .
“ We are not leaving Afghanistan , ” Defense Secretary Robert Gates said .
“ This discussion is about next steps forward and the president has some momentous decisions to make . ”
As we wait for escalation , we ’re left to wonder why withdrawal remains off the table .
American public opinion on the conflict has soured , and international opinion remains overwhelmingly opposed .
“ Majorities or pluralities in 21 of 24 countries want the U.S. and NATO to remove their troops from Afghanistan as soon as possible . ” ( Pew Research Center )
And , most importantly , a plurality of Afghans want foreign troop levels reduced , with a majority saying attacks against coalition forces are justifiable .
Civilian casualties , which number somewhere in the tens of thousands , have contributed to this ill - will and have undoubtedly fueled recruitment for al - Qaeda .
With so many opposed , what drives Obama ’s commitment to further engagement ?
No decisive change can come from an additional 40,000 soldiers – not peace , not stability and not an end to terrorism .
What , then , are we fighting for ?

A little noticed policy at two California airports allows properly qualified passengers to fly the friendly skies carrying up to a half pound of marijuana , news agencies revealed Friday .
RELATED : Gallup poll finds record level of support for legalizing marijuana
“ The policy [ at Oakland International Airport ] is spelled out in a three - page document quietly enacted last year by the Alameda County Sheriff ’s Office , ” Mercury News reported .
“ It states that if deputies determine someone is a qualified patient or primary caregiver as defined by California law and has eight ounces or less of the drug , he or she can keep it and board the plane . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
San Francisco International Airport shares the policy , CBS 5 in Oakland reported .
But passengers travel with the drug “ at their own risk , ” the agency added .
Sgt. J.D. Nelson with the Alameda County Sheriff ’s Office told Mercury News that officers and airport security will issue warnings to those bringing marijuana into areas where it is not legal , but do not call the passengers ’ destination to notify them of a traveler carrying the drug .
“ We ’re certainly within our right to , but we never have , ” he said .
“ Our notification of the passengers [ legal risk ] is for their own safety and well - being . ”
In a state that has allowed medicinal marijuana for over a decade , the policy of these two airports is hardly surprising .
Newsweek , in a recent feature , declared Oakland , California to be America ’s “ Potopia , ” highlighting a nine - block area of the city as “ a model for what a legalized - drug America could look like . ”

“ Nestled among what was once a rash of vacant storefronts , [ is … ] a kind of urban pot utopia , where everything moves just a little bit more slowly than the outside world .
Among the businesses [ … ] are the Blue Sky Coffeeshop , a coffeehouse and pot dispensary where getting an actual cup of Joe takes 20 minutes but picking up a sack of Purple Kush wrapped neatly in a brown lunch bag takes about five .
There ’s Lee ’s Bulldog Café , a student lounge with a not - so - secret back room where the haze - induced sounds of “ Dark Side of the Moon ” seep through thick smoke and a glass - blowing shop where bongs are the art of choice .
Around the corner is a taco stand [ … ] that has benefited mightily from the university ’s hungry students . ”
The local institution of higher learning , referred to as Oaksterdam University , is like a mecca for marijuana enthusiasts , the magazine reported .
“ An education at Oaksterdam means learning how to grow , sell , market , and consume weed — all of which has been legal in California , for medicinal use only , since 1996 , ” Newsweek added . “…
But Oakland is unique in that it has four licensed and regulated dispensaries , each taxed directly by the city government .
This past summer , Oakland voters became the first in the nation to enact a special cannabis excise tax — $ 18 for every $ 1,000 grossed — that the city believes will generate up to $ 1 million in the first year .
Approved by 80 percent of voters , and unopposed by any organization , including law enforcement , the tax was pushed by the dispensary owners themselves , who hope the model will prove to the rest of California that a regulated marijuana industry can be both profitable and responsible . ”

“ Oakland ’s airport policy was enacted in February 2008 , but [ Oakland attorney Robert ]
Raich said he did n’t want to publicize it until recently lest the Bush administration change federal regulations , or lest it become an issue in Obama administration drug officials ’ confirmation hearings , ” Mercury News added .
A Field Research Corporation poll of Californians found in May that for the first time ever , a majority in the state support legalizing marijuana and taxing it similarly to alcohol .
ADVERTISEMENT
The poll ( PDF link ) , an “ independent and non-partisan survey , ” centered mostly on tax issues .
Results were culled from the answers of 901 registered California voters , with a margin of error of +/- 3.4 percent .
“ Three in four support increasing two so - called “ sin taxes ” – the state tobacco tax and the state alcohol tax .
Majorities also endorse several other forms of sin taxes that are not currently taxes , including a special tax on the sale of pornography , which an overwhelming 80 % support , and legalizing marijuana and taxing its proceeds , supported by 56 % , ” the poll found .
“ Such action would also send the state into a headlong conflict with the U.S. government while raising questions about how federal law enforcement could enforce its drug laws in the face of a massive government - sanctioned pot industry , ” the Associated Press noted earlier this month .

President Barack Obama has said repeatedly that the legalization of marijuana is not in his vocabulary .

Environmentalists are lousy metaphysicians .
To which claim environmentalism might reply , Whoever said that we ought to be metaphysicians ?
Here we are , keepers of the china shop of fragile nature and we ’ve got lunatics in every corner randomly dropping fine crystal goblets , thoughtlessly , like demented children , and we ’re rushing about trying to save one out of five , at the least , and you say we should be thinking about metaphysics ?
Yes , I do say that .
I do think that you should be , as Freud put it , trying to take a look over the garden wall .
Because , ultimately , environmentalism ’s problems are metaphysical ( or spiritual if you will ) and not legal , political , bureaucratic , scientific , or , least of all , technological .
This has always been the case .
After all , the origin of what we now call environmentalism was not in science and technology .
In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries , science and technology were busy helping to create the polluting industries ( the “ dark satanic mills , ” as William Blake wrote ) that would soon enough create the need for environmentalism .
Rather , the origin of what we now call environmentalism was with philosophers of the late Renaissance like Benedict de Spinoza and the poet / philosophers of German and English Romanticism .
Many of these poets were a bit crazed , as poets tend to be , and had a comical tendency to drift off into the neo-Platonic mists .
But they were also the first to find the voice of “ honest indignation ” that , for Blake , was “ the voice of God . ”
They objected to the rationalist dualism that separated humanity from nature , and they objected to the destruction of both the natural and human worlds that this dualism seemed to allow .
Instead , figures like Goethe , Schlegel , Schelling , Novalis , and many others caught up in the philosophical fever of Romanticism argued that nature is inhabited by the divine , that humans are one with it , and that we can have transcendental experiences of the oneness of Being through immersion in the natural world .
Theirs was a philosophy of yearning for the Absolute , the experience of a oneness with God .
They discovered that the finite , the sensuous world , was related to the infinite .
In fact , the chief point of the evolution of nature was the gradual perfection of human consciousness itself .
The only thinking worthy of the name was , as Spinoza first saw , thinking that was “ adequate to God . ”
This was the thought to which our own Ralph Waldo Emerson was introduced during his fateful visit to England and to Thomas Carlyle .
This is the metaphysical / spiritual vision that made Thoreau , Whitman , John Muir and even the Sierra Club possible .
Is it too much to say that this tradition is now mostly lost to environmentalism ?
That it denies the primacy of art and poetry as mediators to nature ?
That it has made common cause with its own enemy , the world of quantitative reason , of risk assessment , data , the “ best science , ” and technological fixes ?
That it has mostly abandoned in embarrassment the spiritual vision of Muir ?
What we ’ve been left with are numbers .
The problem of climate change will be solved if we can reduce the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to 350 ppm. 350 ppm : that ’s the holy grail of environmentalism .
As a consequence of this approach , environmentalism can tell you that a problem exists ( the polar bears are going extinct ) , but it ca n’t tell you why you should care .
Environmentalism leads now with science and technologies for creating “ sustainability ” and for “ greening capitalism ” because these are solutions that it finds within its reach .
They are solutions that the “ technostructure ” ( J. K. Galbraith ) of state and corporate bureaucracy understands .
But in so doing environmentalism creates , in Simone Weil ’s words , a “ good without light . ”
Karl Marx once argued that capitalism understands that it will have enemies .
But if it must have enemies it will create them itself and in its own image .
Ken Burns ’ recent PBS film , The National Parks : America ’s Best Idea , has done us the favor of showing how this worked in the development of the national park system .
First , the spiritual visionaries ( John Muir ) , then the millionaire heroes come in ( Stephen Mather , George Melendez Wright , John D. Rockefeller ) , and finally the whole thing is turned over to biologists .
Obviously , the natural world has benefited in spectacular ways from this process .
But the reigning economic order has gained something too .
Instead of having to deal with the unruly , often revolutionary zeal of poets , musicians like Richard Wagner , and uncompromising spiritualists like Muir , it can now deal with something it is very comfortable with : science and quantitative reason .
Risk assessment .
Data .
The reign of Numbers .
It has also succeeded in transforming a movement that was originally not only a protest against the denaturalization of the world but the dehumanization of the world .
It has remade that movement in its own image .
Labor markets , working conditions , and the poor are not part of environmentalism ’s problem .
And it is certainly not part of an ecologist ’s problem .
But it should be .
The failure of science is not with science as such , its discoveries , but with its failure to become what Morse Peckham called “ romantic science ” ; that is , a science whose first job is to use its knowledge to undermine ideologies of power , to destroy their “ regnant platitudes . ”
Instead , science , even environmental science , has put itself at the service of these ideologies .
In the end , it is one thing to ask John D. Rockefeller to give millions for the creation of a national park , but quite another to ask him to take responsibility for how he made those millions in the first place : oil , monopolies , the exploitation of workers , and even the massacre of workers ( as in the 1913 Ludlow mine massacre , although it was his son that was responsible for that ) .
It is one thing to ask capital to contribute to certain sites that provide “ spectacle , ” but another to ask it to stop the profitable destruction of the rest of the world through behavior that is little more than systematic violence ( factory farming , for instance ) .
Ken Burns ’ film is marked by this contradiction : his sponsors are nearly all conduits of corporate philanthropy .
He knows where the boundaries of the possible are just as he knows that national parks have boundaries beyond which is the slowly dying world we are becoming ever more familiar with .
“ These machines are to the video industry what the Internet was to the music business — disaster , ” said Ted Engen , president of the Video Buyers Group , a trade organization for 1,700 local rental stores .
Mr. Engen is enlisting lawmakers to attack Redbox for renting R- rated movies to underage viewers — the machines simply ask customers to confirm that they are 18 or older by pressing a button — and trying to rally the Screen Actors Guild and other unions .
“ It ’s going to kill the industry , ” said Gary Cook , business manager for UA Local 78 , which represents studio plumbers .
Mr. Lowe , meanwhile , is portraying the studios as greedy giants scheming to trample the little guy .
“ Do n’t let a few movie studios prevent you from seeing the latest DVDs for an affordable price , ” reads a headline on a new Redbox Web site , savelowcostdvds.com .
Redbox , formerly owned by McDonald ’s and now part of Coinstar , is only the biggest of a host of DVD vending companies .
DVDPlay , whose kiosks are also red , has been aggressive in California , while MovieCube is big in Canada .
Blockbuster is scrambling to introduce its own rental kiosks .
There are now about 500 Blockbuster Express machines , and plans call for 2,500 more by the end of the year ; the company expects to open 7,000 in 2010 , a spokesman said .
The kiosk boom is fed by several consumer and business currents , all related to the recession .
For starters , the dismal economy has made people think twice about buying DVDs , especially as the likes of Redbox have made renting easier .
Consumers are also tiring of the clutter :
The average American household with a DVD player now has a library of 70 DVDs , according to Adams Media Research .
Over all , DVD sales are down 13.5 percent for the first half of 2009 compared to the first half of 2008 , according to the Digital Entertainment Group , a trade organization .
Studios say some new titles are selling 25 percent fewer copies than expected .
Rental revenue is up about 8 percent over the same period , according to the group .
Retailers , struggling to keep people shopping , have realized that having a DVD kiosk in a store creates foot traffic , making it easier for companies like Redbox to sign wide - ranging installation agreements .
Some partners , like Walgreens , have offered discounts that essentially make rentals free .
Redbox is also getting a hand because of Hollywood ’s troubles .
Analysts say Sony and Paramount signed agreements with the company in part because their home entertainment units are under pressure to meet financial targets , set before the DVD decline .
Sony ’s five - year deal is worth about $ 460 million in DVD sales to Redbox .
Paramount ’s deal starts with a four - month test ; if the studio decides Redbox represents a net gain to its home entertainment business , it can extend its relationship for five years and a guaranteed $ 575 million .
Paramount ’s deal involves revenue - sharing , a rarity for Redbox .
The kiosk operator primarily follows the mom and pop model : it seeks to buy discs wholesale and makes a profit with repeat rentals .
( Revenue - sharing deals typically allow a rental store to buy discs for half the wholesale cost or less . )
Redbox can price rentals at $ 1 and still make money because its machines eliminate so much overhead .
The $ 1 price is not the main issue for the studios , although they do not like that , either ; it is the timing .
New DVDs sell for about $ 25 .
Video - on - demand services price them at about $ 5 .
Multiday rentals of new titles cost $ 4.99 at Blockbuster .
Now there is a $ 1 option at the same time .
That could put downward pressure on the industry ’s price structure .
“ Anyone whose business involves selling movies should be enormously concerned , ” said Richard Greenfield , an analyst at Pali Research .
Analysts also see a threat to studios in Redbox ’s practice of selling about half of its DVDs into the used market ( after renting them about 15 times at an average of $ 2 a transaction ) .
By signing deals with Redbox , Paramount and Sony got the kiosk operator to agree to destroy their discs rather than resell them .
“ Our position is that this is a strong consumer trend , and we figured out a way to minimize the negative aspects and maximize the positive ones , ” said David Bishop , president of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment .
Rob Moore , vice chairman of Paramount Pictures , said , “ This trial gives us access to information that will allow us to make an informed decision about Redbox ’s impact on our home entertainment business . ”
Mr. Lowe dismissed worries about the cannibalization of sales .
He cited internal research indicating that 20 percent of Redbox ’s volume is additive — people who did not previously buy or rent DVDs — and that partners like Wal - Mart have had only a 1 percent decline in sales after Redbox machines have been installed at their entrances .
The kiosks hold about 500 DVDs and focus on new mainstream releases .
Customers follow a series of touch - screen prompts to use the kiosks , which vend from slots on the side .
Once a selection is made , the customer swipes a credit card through the reader .
The card is charged a dollar ( and tax ) for each DVD rented ; the charges for additional days , if any , are added when discs are returned .
The charge for lost DVDs is $ 25 .
“ If you make renting affordable and fun , people are going to watch a whole lot more movies than they did before , ” Mr. Lowe said .

SUBTERFUGES AND SYRINGES
THE REAL WORLD OF VACCINATIONS
By Thomas Smith
February 1 , 2003
NewsWithViews.com
Vaccination programs in the late 19th and early 20th century decimated the populations of many countries where government sponsored vaccination programs were introduced .
Japan suffered 48,000 deaths from smallpox vaccination ; England and Wales experienced 45,800 smallpox deaths in a population that was 97 % vaccinated against smallpox .
Australia and Germany combined with a total of 120,000 deaths from the very smallpox for which they had been vaccinated .
European deaths amongst the vaccinated portion of the population totaled 3,000,000 .
Deaths from smallpox vaccination programs began to decline when a revolt against mandatory vaccination programs emerged from the chaos .
The revolt started in England .
In the late 19th century , England was jailing an average of 2000 parents a year for refusal to vaccinate themselves and their children .
Property seizure and prosecution were commonplace for refusal to participate in vaccination programs .
The battle was a political one .
The people started to win when a number of leading scientists went public with the truth about these vaccination programs .
Doctor Edgar Crookshank Professor of Biology at Kings College led the charge against mandatory vaccination programs with his book " The history and Pathology of Vaccination . "
Other leading scientists of his generation soon jumped on the bandwagon .
They demonstrated the scientific poverty of the entire vaccination concept .
The revolt was successful .
Within twenty years mandatory smallpox vaccination laws in England were repealed .
In 1919 the death rate from smallpox promptly plummeted to a total of 28 deaths in a population of almost 40,000,000 people .
Previously , with mandatory vaccinations they had averaged over 44,000 deaths from smallpox .
Meanwhile at the same time in the Philippine Islands , with a population of 10,000,000 , a compulsory smallpox vaccination program administered by the US government produced over 47,000 deaths from smallpox .
Over the entire ten year span of the vaccination program mandated by the US government in the Philippines 25,000,000 vaccinations were forced on a population of 10,000,000 people in a series of three per person .
This produced 170,000 cases of smallpox of which 75,000 were fatal .
In the USA , an article in the July 1969 issue of Prevention Magazine described how 300 children had died from smallpox vaccination in the period from 1948 to 1969 .
In that very same reporting period there were no incidences of smallpox in the country .
In the USA in 1937 , Dr. William Hay in his address to the Medical Freedom Society on the Lemke bill to abolish compulsory vaccination said : " I have thought many times of all of the insane things we have advocated in medicine , that is one of the most insane - to insist on the vaccination of children , or anybody else , for the prevention of smallpox when , as a matter of fact , we are never able to prove that vaccination saved one man from smallpox . "
We are indebted to the work of Ian Sinclair for the excellent investigative work involved with the discovery of many of the relatively suppressed facts in the archives of history .
He has published this information in his book " Vaccination : The Hidden Facts " [ 1 ]
The true story of the horror produced by compulsory vaccination somehow seems to be totally lacking in today 's media reporting .
The theory of vaccinations .
In theory , vaccinations are designed to provoke a healthy immune system to manufacture antibodies to defend itself against some future exposure to disease .
Vaccinations are specific .
Each vaccination is purported to offer protection against a single specific disease or combination of diseases .
There is no evidence whatsoever , that vaccination provides immunity beyond what the immune system without vaccination would normally provide .
There is much evidence that the " one size fits all " philosophy of the vaccines overwhelms the childhood immune system , those with weakened immune systems , those already coping with some other disease and those with allergies and sensitivities .
Our immune systems are more unique than our fingerprints .
To presume that all will have the desired response to vaccination is not just bad science , it borders on lunacy .
Albeit , it is a very profitable lunacy for the drug companies .
In an article that appeared in the New York Journal of Medicine in July 1899 Charles Rauta , Professor of Hygiene and Material Medical in the University of Perguia says : " Vaccination is a monstrosity , a misbegotten offspring of error and ignorance ; it should have no place in either hygiene or medicine ....
Believe not in vaccination , it is a world wide delusion , an unscientific practice , a fatal superstition with consequences measured today by tears and sorrow without end . "
Professor Rauta was involved with the horrible smallpox epidemics in Italy at a time when Italy had achieved 98.5 % compliance with the compulsory vaccination laws of the country .
Professor Ari Zuckerman , a member of the World Health Organization advisory panel on virus ' said : " Immunization against smallpox is more hazardous than the disease itself . "
The British medical Journal in January 1976 stated : " It is now accepted that the risks of routine smallpox vaccination outweigh those of natural infection in Britain . "
Doctor Robert Gallo a well known AIDS researcher said : " I have been saying for some years that the use of live vaccines such as that used from smallpox can activate a dormant infection such as that from AIDS ( HIV ) . "
The active ingredient in each vaccine usually consists of an attenuated form of the infectious agent .
When the infectious agent is simply weakened it will multiply in the host body and theoretically stimulate the production of antibodies by forming a pocket of rapidly growing infection without producing the disease .
Historic practice was to grow the active agent in animal tissue and then use it in human tissue .
This greatly reduced its virulence in human tissue .
For example when smallpox is grown in cow tissue it acclimates to the cow tissue .
When the vaccine thus made is then transferred to human tissue it is found to be much less virulent to humans .
When its virulence is thought to be sufficiently attenuated by successive cow hosts , it can be harvested and used for humans .
The term " vaccine " actually comes from the root word " vaca " meaning cow .
However , it is now applied to any vaccine used in any vaccination program and now often has little or no association with a cow .
However , this process is slow , marginally profitable and subject to whatever contamination exists in the animal tissue .
So a variety of chemical ways to attenuate or kill these agents have been developed amongst which are : the use of carbolic acid , formaldehyde and heat treatment .
Modern practice is to attenuate the active agent with chemistry and to grow it in a more controlled environment such as human fetal tissue .
This speeds up the process and unfortunately places late term abortion on the firm commercial base needed to insure profitability for the industry .
It also often leaves traces of carbolic acid , formaldehyde and fetal serum in the retail version of the vaccine .
The vaccination itself , in addition to the presumably attenuated infectious agent , contains adjuvenants , preservatives and a remnant of the media in which the vaccine was grown .
In theory these contaminants are of little or no consequence .
In practice they are of immense importance .
For example one theory of the origin of the AIDS virus is that it was caused by contamination of the Hepatitis and Smallpox vaccines by growing the virus ' in monkey serum media .
When the active agent is killed however , it does not rapidly reproduce or spread in our bodies .
Our immune system then has a tendency to dispose of it quickly before a satisfactory development of antibodies throughout the body can occur .
To prevent this , adjuvenants are added to the vaccine .
These adjuvenants prevent the rapid assimilation of the active agent throughout the body .
They cause the active agent to be localized in a small pocket of foreign protein thus providing a longer stimulus to the immune system .
In theory this will result in the increased production of host antibodies .
Thus the adjuvenant actually inhibits the natural tendency of our immune response to remove the foreign proteins from our system .
Since the active agents consist of proteins that have been killed or attenuated , it is necessary to include preservatives in the vaccine in order to provide a profitable shelf life for the product .
Thimerosol is the preservative of choice in our vaccines .
Thimerosol is an extraordinarily toxic Mercury compound .
The amounts contained in a single vaccination contain up to 125 times the EPA permissible amount of toxic mercury .
This mercury comes in a particularly toxic form that has been known since 1929 to severely damage the nervous system and to overwhelm the kidneys , liver and immune systems of children .
Thimerosol has now been determined to be a causal agent in the exploding epidemic of autism , ADD , ADHD devastating our children .
Instead of simply removing the cause of these disorders , the State , in many cases , has mandated the use of Ritalin to counteract their symptoms .
Vaccinations are routinely given in childhood on the theory that they will confer immunity upon the child in the event of future exposure to infectious disease .
Before the age of five many children are required to have over 30 vaccinations , many of them are multiple vaccinations .
Some of these vaccination requirements are simply idiotic , for example a Hepatitis vaccine for an infant .
Drug users and the promiscuous are at risk for Hepatitis , certainly not the large majority of infants .
Congressman Burton , in a recent congressional hearing on the use of Thimerosol in vaccines , has threatened criminal charges against the government agencies that are responsible for this horrific example of negligence .
In the hearings it was revealed that the dangers of Thimerosol had been well understood since 1929 .
The only test ever conducted on the safety of this preservative was conducted in 1929 .
All patient participants in the test died and all investigations as to the safety of Thimerosol were abruptly discontinued .
This poison was finally removed from veterinary vaccines in the early 1990's .
However , it was retained in human childhood vaccines until just recently when the huge numbers of vaccine damaged children could no longer be ignored .
Dr. Rimland MD when discussing this said : " When the link between unsafe mercury laden vaccine and autism , ADHA , asthma , allergies and diabetes becomes undeniable , mainstream medicine will be sporting a huge , self inflicted and well deserved black eye .
Then will come the billion dollar awards , by enraged juries , to the children and their families .
I can't wait " .
It was the explosive growth of diabetes in America that directly caused this investigative reporter to become interested in the medical community .
He contracted a serious case of Diabetes and quickly discovered that the medical community no longer cures it .
This , despite the fact that a cure has been well understood since the late 1950's .
After having to cure his own diabetes because his doctor would not cure it , he began to take a good hard look at some other widespread medical practices , particularly the highly profitable ones .
Deceptive medicine .
Note that the vaccination itself does not confer immunity .
The immunity , in theory , results from the body successfully developing sufficient antibodies quickly enough to avoid acquiring the disease conferred by the vaccination .
The childhood immune system is heavily dependent upon the antibodies it receives from its mother 's milk .
To stimulate the immature immune system in an effort to produce antibodies that it can not yet produce is at best insanity ; at worst it is a most culpable criminal activity .
Neither the kidneys nor the liver of an immature child can clear the relatively huge amounts of mercury poison given along with the active agent in these vaccines .
Perhaps the most pernicious of the incredible deceptions foisted upon a trusting public is the idea that vaccination programs ended the smallpox epidemics of the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
The only thing about these vaccination programs that ended the epidemics was the discontinuance of the programs .
Sometimes many people were jailed and disenfranchised by an arrogant and unresponsive government before they changed the law .
What then did finally eradicate smallpox , which at one time really was a serious matter irrespective of vaccines ?
The great improvements in the health of people came through the eradication of diseases of filth and of filthy water .
These advances consisted of major improvements in diet , hygiene , sanitary and health measures , underground sewage disposal , availability of uncontaminated water , as well as refrigeration and better preservation and distribution of food .
The Center for Disease control in their Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , July 20 , 1999 , 48:621-628 stated that improvements in water quality , sanitation and hygiene were the most important factors in the improvement of health and the control of infectious disease .
Vaccines were not even considered to be among the factors .
Scientist 's John and Sonia McKinlay show the same thing in their research .
In fact they were able to quantize these findings .
They stated that 97 % of the increase in life span since the beginning of the twentieth century is due to the enormous improvements in sanitation of food , water and environment .
World Health statistics Annual 1973 - 1976
Volume II also attributes the vanishing of infectious disease to improved standards of cleanliness in our food , water and environment .
Do vaccinations really reduce either the incidence of or the severity of smallpox ?
From the many , many quotations from responsible knowledgeable , and honest , medical professionals that could be used to answer this question perhaps this one will give the most focused response .
This quotation is by J.W. Hodge MD .
In his book " The vaccination superstition " he states : " After a careful consideration of the history of vaccination gleaned from an impartial and comprehensive study of vital statistics , and pertinent data from every reliable source , and after an experience derived from having vaccinated 31,000 subjects , I am firmly convinced that vaccination cannot be shown to have any logical relation to the diminution of cases of smallpox .
Vaccination does not protect , it actually renders its subjects more susceptible by depressing the vital power and diminishing the natural resistance , and millions of people have died of smallpox which they contracted after being vaccinated "
Perhaps the second most damaging deception provided by the modern medical propaganda ministry is that medical intervention , particularly vaccinations , played a decisive role in the reduction of infectious disease .
The real truth is just exactly the opposite .
Coincident with the rise in improved sanitation , massive compulsory vaccinations were discontinued and the disease epidemics disappeared very shortly thereafter .
We often hear the statement " there is no doubt that vaccines save lives " .
Actually there is a very great deal of doubt that vaccines are helpful at all and a great deal of evidence that they are quite harmful .
That information just does n't make it into the popular conciousness .
It often does n't even make it to the retail medical practitioner .
The American propaganda ministry makes sure that popular belief is well controlled .
By taking credit for something that they did not do and by suppressing the history of what really happened , our medical elite set the stage for the calamities that now face us as a nation .
Criminal government legislation .
The Model States Health Powers
Act contained provisions to mandate compulsory vaccination .
Property confiscation , incarceration in " quarantine " centers and the use of law enforcement to ensure compliance was all carefully detailed .
This is reminiscent of the " concentration " camps employed by another twentieth century despot when he was redesigning the government of his country .
This was to be essentially a state activity .
However , many States failed to adopt this totalitarian monstrosity as being alien to our American sense of fitness .
Many States tabled it , one State , Alabama , rejected it outright .
To many , it appeared to provide too much power to a government that is showing disturbing signs of being willing to kill large numbers of people any way that they can just so long as they can accomplish their hidden goals .
When it became clear that mandatory vaccination was dead at the State level , it was included in the most totalitarian piece of legislation ever attempted here in America .
It was included in The Homeland Security Bill which recently passed and will soon be signed into law by the president .
Even many that voted on this bill do not realize what it contains .
Many congressmen did not even read the final draft upon which they voted .
This bill provides for " mandatory vaccination of the entire population at the discretion of the director of Homeland Security . "
All options for refusal of the vaccine have been deleted .
Personal , religious and medical exemptions have been deleted ; informed consent is no longer required .
Refusal will lead to arrest , property confiscation and imprisonment .
Tommy Thompson , Secretary of Health and Human Services is already on record as saying " I have a vaccination with the name of every American on it . "
This bill also authorizes " other medical interventions " as specified by the director of Homeland Security .
One of the most outrageous clauses in this bill is known as the " vaccine injury indemnity clause . "
This clause holds the makers and distributors of vaccines harmless for any injury that they cause .
The theory is that vaccination is a necessary response to terrorism and that any injury caused by the vaccine is an unavoidable collateral casualty .
This clause removes any redress at law .
If , as will happen to many , you are injured by the vaccine you or your survivors cannot even sue for damages .
Prior to the passage of the Homeland Security bill , federal law required all suits against vaccine makers to go before a special court before any civil action could be brought in the State civil court system .
This court is known as the " vaccine court . "
It was set up to help protect vaccine makers against large punitive awards provided by outraged jurors in the State courts .
This court is presently facing over 1000 suits brought by parents of autistic children whose autism was caused by MMR vaccines .
On November 25 , 2002 the Bush administration asked this court to order the evidence from hundreds of cases of autism by vaccine be kept from the public .
The " special master " , George Hastings , of this court has promised a " speedy " ruling on this request .
If this request by the Bush administration is approved it will make it very difficult for the parents of these damaged children to obtain redress in the State civil courts .
It is to be noted that the State civil courts were set up to handle precisely this sort of action .
Michael Hugo , a Boston lawyer , in commenting on this situation said : " We dealing with real injury to real children in a program that is funded by taxpayer dollars .
It is unbelievable to me that the president of the United States , in the name of trying to help the drug industry , would put the interests of the drug industry over the interests of neurologically impaired sick children and their parents . "
In another current vaccine issue , Boyd E. Graves J.D. has been given the right to file a lawsuit in a federal court of his choice .
Mr. Graves is charging the federal government with " the creation , production and proliferation of HIV ( AIDS ) through the secret federal virus development program . "
Mr. Graves is a civil rights lawyer and decorated naval veteran .
He charges in his lawsuit that " The United States purposefully and intentionally , complemented the " smallpox " vaccine that went to Africa and the " Hepatitis B " vaccine with the HIV virus and that this latter was then given to homosexuals in the United States recruited for that purpose . "
Graves and his supporters say that they are confident that the evidence of the laboratory birth of the AIDS virus as a biowarfare agent is irrefutable .
Making sense out of nonsense .
When we observe highly educated and intelligent men and women in government doing heinous criminal things with our health and life expectancy , our tendency is to think that they really do not understand .
We think that it is all a horrible mistake and that it will soon be corrected .
It is only when we observe carefully that we see a frightening pattern emerge in the posture of modern governments toward their people .
Modern medical practice is deadly to those that must depend upon it .
Disease is no longer cured ; it is treated .
The defenseless unborn are now fetus ' to be murdered at will .
In our schools great pressures exist to turn our young people into ignorant promiscuous homosexuals .
All of these practices as well as many other similar politically correct cultural norms are being forced upon a people that really do not want them .
Promiscuous homosexuals have no issue ; an ignorant citizenry need never realize the motivations of government ; aborted children never burden our commercial system ; vaccination no matter how criminal and deadly , is to be presumed an Orwellian public good regardless of the facts of the matter .
It all makes sense when we realize the underlying motives of our governing elite .
These problems of our people can be summed up in the words of Robert McNamara , when he was president of the World Bank .
During an address to a group of international bankers that he gave on October 2 , 1979 he remarked : " We can begin with the most critical problem of all , population growth ... short of a nuclear war itself , it is the greatest issue the world faces over the decades ahead ...
Either the current birth rates must come down more quickly , or the current death rates must go up .
There is no other way . "
This same Robert McNamara was later quoted by the French j" ai tout compris " as saying " One must take draconian measures of demographic reduction against the will of the populations .
Reducing the birth rate has proved to be impossible or insufficient .
One must therefore increase the mortality rate .
How ?
By natural means .
Famine and sickness "
A major , politically contrived , famine is going on in Africa at this time .
An unprecedented program to innoculate the masses is being forced upon America .
Henry Kissinger , speaking before a Bilderburg conference in Evian France May 21 , 1992 made quite clear the management policies of the US government when he stated : " Today Americans would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore order ; tomorrow they will be grateful .
This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond , whether real or promulgated , that threatened our very existence .
It is then that all peoples of the world will plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil .
The one thing that every man fears is the unknown .
When presented with this scenario , individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world government . "
Many in our trusted leadership very much subscribe to these expressed beliefs of Robert McNamara and Henry Kissinger .
These beliefs are widely taught in our Universities .
Many in high government office in the US are now known to have been involved with the murder of Africa by the use of smallpox vaccines contaminated with the biowarfare virus ( AIDS ) .
This agent is known to have been developed here in the US .
These same people , obsessed with the population problem of the world , also administered a contaminated Hepatitis B vaccine to the gay population of both New York and San Francisco .
Now we are asked to trust this same group of government administrators , as they ready a sneaky and unconstitutional program for the compulsory vaccination of America .
The underlying cover story offered to justify this act is that some terrorist might attack us with the very same agents that America developed in its laboratories .
The underlying assumption is that the vaccines work as advertised .
At this point , it would be smart for Americans to do their homework .
We must make sure that any decision we make about the vaccination issue is a voluntary one that does n't outrage our trust in government and grossly violate our common sense .

Why , indeed .
Thanks to the Venezuelan president 's surprise endorsement of " Hegemony or Survival : America 's Quest for Global Dominance  during a vitriolic address at the United Nations , the paperback edition of Chomsky 's 2003 book has catapulted to No.1 on Amazon.com 's list of best - sellers , ahead of such eternally popular authors as John Grisham and Lemony Snicket .
Suddenly , the left - wing linguist who taught for years at MIT is a celebrity .
" All the media hoopla -- I do n't know what else to call it -- is not entirely pleasant , " said Chomsky 's wife , Carol , who picked up the phone at the couple 's Lexington home after just one ring today .
" Noam is flooded , absolutely flooded . "
The problem , she said , and the likely reason her husband of 56 years would not return our call , is the nature of the questions Chomsky is being asked .
They 're not serious enough , she said .
" Everyone wants to know what his reaction is , " Carol Chomsky said .
" And that 's on the level of gossip and of no consequence at all . "
Speaking to The New York Times yesterday , Noam Chomsky told the paper " I continue to work and write , " correcting Chavez , who mistakenly said while speaking at the UN that Chomsky was dead .
The retired professor also added he was " quite interested " in Hugo Chavez 's policies .
" Personally , I think many of them are quite constructive , " Chomsky said .
" I would be happy to meet with him . "
