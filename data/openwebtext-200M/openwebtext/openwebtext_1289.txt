( CNN ) --
What a difference a decade makes .
Since the turn of the millennium environmental issues have come to the forefront with a marked shift toward all things green in politics , technology and perhaps most importantly , society .
An understanding of climate change was no longer limited to a small group of scientists or environmentalists , and environmental concern started to change the way more of us live our lives .
Eco Solutions looks back at 10 environmental developments that defined this as the most green decade yet .
Do you agree with our list ?
What do you think the most significant environmental moments of the decade were ?

The game - changer : The Toyota Prius
In 2001 , the Toyota Prius became the first mass - produced hybrid vehicle to be sold worldwide .
It heralded the beginning of an era - commercially - viable and even successful green goods .
Industry insiders called it a game - changer attracting buyers despite its higher - than - average cost and unique look .
Buying a Prius was n't simply about fuel efficiency , it was making a statement about the environment .
To date , more than one million Priuses have been sold worldwide , and other major manufacturers have followed suit to develop their own hybrid and electric - only vehicles .
The summit : COP15
December 's U.N. summit on climate change held in Copenhagen , Denmark garnered unprecedented attention from around the world .
Intended to find a successor to the Kyoto Protocol , the fifteenth Conference of Parties ( COP15 ) was meant to produce a definitive agreement for future emission cuts .
Yet even before the summit began , leaders tried to temper expectations by saying that firm targets were " highly unlikely . "
In then end the accord that was reached fell short of the expectation of nearly every interested party gathered in the Danish capital .
U.N. secretary - general Ban Ki-moon put a brave face on the conference saying leaders were " united in purpose , but were not yet united in action . "

Al Gore 's star power : " An Inconvenient Truth " and the Nobel Peace Prize
It might not be an exercise in cinematic artistry but Al Gore 's 2006 " An Inconvenient Truth " has its place in history .
The film was instrumental in spreading the message of climate change and had the rare opportunity of having a wide - spread release ( it was one of the highest grossing documentaries of all time ) .
The 100 - minute documentary was based on a simple premise of a Powerpoint presentation , but it was the content not the form that caught the world 's attention .
Since it 's release , it has been maligned by some critics for " fear - mongering . "
The most contentious assertion in the film described a six meter sea level rise as a realistic short term prospect - a projection that disagrees with U.N. findings .
Yet despite its doomsday scenarios , it explained the basics of climate change to an audience that till then had no access to .
The film brought Al Gore an unexpected accolade in 2007 , the Nobel Peace Prize .
The Former U.S. Vice President was applauded by the Nobel Committee for " efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change . "
The Rise of CFLs
Compact Fluorescent Lightbulbs ( CFLs ) brought environmentalism into the home .
Despite some initial objections to cost and its less than ideal performance ( an initial flicker and the inability to use it with a dimmer ) , producers overcame those hurdles and in 2007 , sales of CFLs reached record heights worldwide .
Australia has already implemented a ban of traditional incandescent light bulbs while the European Union and Canada are also phasing out the old bulbs .
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , the average CFL uses 75 percent less energy than the traditional incandescent light bulb .
This translates into a $ 30 saving which would pay for itself in 6 months .
It was an important coup for the environmental movement , but green groups now say much more needs to be done to establish recycling programs to deal with CFLs so they do n't end up in landfills .
Heating up : A decade of extreme weather
Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , a string of deadly hurricanes devastating Haiti in 2008 and the heat wave in Europe in 2003 , just some examples that this decade was plagued by wild weather .
While scientists say it is not possible to make a direct link between extreme weather and man-made climate change , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency say " climate change may increase the probability of some ordinary weather events reaching extreme levels or of some extreme events becoming more extreme . "
Recently , the U.N. 's weather agency said that this decade was the hottest on record .
Noughtie talk : " Carbon Footprint "
This decade saw a flurry of green jargon enter our everyday vocabulary .
Growing awareness for the environment meant that noughties vocabulary included words like " carbon footprint , " " carbon neutral " and " greenwashing . "
Perhaps the most significant step was when they were accepted into the Oxford English Dictionary in 2007 .
Carbon footprint was defined as " the amount of carbon dioxide emitted due to the activities , especially the consumption of fossil fuels , of a particular person , group , etc . "
The devil is in the details : The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report
In 2007 , climate scientists from around the world met in Paris to lay out what we knew about climate change .
It was a significant attempt to amalgamate decades of climate data from around the world .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) issued the first scientific consensus on climate change , which included an unprecedented acknowledgement that it was " very likely " that climate change was caused by human activity .
The report went on to project a temperature rise of 1.8 to 4 degrees Celsius and a sea - level rise of between 28 to 43 cm by the end of the century .
Ten years of growth : Renewable Energy
Most scientists agree that there is no silver bullet for climate change but some believe that a healthy mix of existing technologies especially in the renewable energy sector will be enough to significantly cut emissions .
Wind , solar , hydro all saw significant support in the past ten years .
In 2008 , global power capacity from renewables topped 280,000 MW , according to the International Energy Agency .
That is three times more than what nuclear power plants in the United States currently produce .
There are also new players in the sector : India and China are now among the leaders in the installation and manufacture of renewable energy .
In 2008 , China 's wind power capacity doubled for the fourth year running .
The technology itself has also developed significantly - solar technology had a few key breakthroughs including improved energy yields ( it now tops 20 percent ) and the creation of ultra - thin solar panels .
It 's going to cost you : The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change
Can you put a price on climate change ?
Yes , according to British economist Sir Nicholas Stern .
In 2006 , the former vice president of the World Bank issued a 700 - page report calculating the cost of climate change to the world 's economy .
Green groups called the report a wake - up call for governments who saw a concrete financial impact of climate change for the first time .
The report estimated that climate change would cost at least 5 percent of global GDP annually , now and forever .
The worst case scenario would be 20 percent a year ( $ 7 trillion ) .
The Stern Review was the first of many reports that tried to put climate change under an economic perspective .
The UN Framework Convention for Climate Change suggests that climate change could cost between $ 70 to $ 100 billion by 2030 , that 's the cost of 3 Beijing Olympics .
Cap and trade
Carbon trading , also known as " cap and trade , " became a hotly debated policy that many hope will help counter climate change .
Using free - market principals and government regulation , participants in cap and trade schemes buy and sell permits to emit carbon dioxide .
Governments limit the amount of emissions allowed and slap heavy fines on those who exceed those limits .
Reducing the amount of permits issued over time should then reduce pollution levels .
The EU has the largest emissions trading market , set up in 2005 and more than 30 countries have adopted , or plan to adopt similar models .
But there are many critics who point to the lack of a global market for carbon trade , which would make it more effective .
There are also questions over regulation and accounting for pollution offsets .
Many see " offsetting " in cap and trade schemes as an escape hatch for businesses to avoid making real reductions in their polluting activities .
It 's a complex and controversial issue but one that looks set to a key feature of mainstream climate change solutions in years to come .

School officials agreed Tuesday that a West Linn teacher crossed a line when he used sexual vulgarity as part of a classroom lesson on censorship .
Michael Diltz , an Athey Creek Middle School teacher and librarian , wrote two profane words on the board in front of eighth - graders last week as a part of a districtwide " Banned /
Challenged Book " project that explores the limits of free speech .
Diltz was using the words to illustrate how language can often lead to the banning of books , said Assistant Superintendent Thayne Balzer .
Reached at the school Tuesday , Diltz said school officials had not authorized him to discuss the incident but expressed dismay at the fallout .
" I just wish it had n't backfired like this , " he said .
On Monday , parents objected at a school board meeting .
School board members said they supported the banned - book program but not Diltz 's use of the objectionable words .
Superintendent Roger Woehl agreed .
" We still do n't think it was good judgment to use the language , " he said .
In past years , teachers have not used profanity as part of the project , and the objections to last week 's lessons were the first regarding any aspect of the program , Woehl said .
Last week , Athey Creek Principal Carol Egan issued an apology to parents through an e-mail list .
" It was meant to provoke student understanding and experience how words , taken out of context , can lose their significance .
When taken out of context , an author 's words can move a community to ban that author 's book from a school library , " Egan wrote .
The district refused to comment on any administrative actions with Diltz , who is in his second year at Athey Creek and his fifth within the district .
Woehl called him an excellent teacher .
Several parents phoned in their support for the teacher , with some supporting the actual lesson , said Woehl .
Students and parents leaving school Tuesday had mixed reactions .
" It 's probably inappropriate , but it 's probably nothing that they have n't heard before , " said Shannon Anderson , the mother of an Athey Creek eighth - grader .
Terrell Eaton , another parent , regretted that she had not complained after hearing about the situation .
" I was surprised and upset , " she said .
" I thought he could have taught that lesson in a different way . "
Eaton 's son , Ellis , thought the lesson was a bit " odd , " but he was n't offended .
" I thought it was fine , " Ellis Eaton , 14 , said .
" It was kind of funny . "
The banned - book curriculum , which the district has taught for 10 years , requires students to read a book that has been banned or challenged outside of the district .
Afterward , students write an essay that argues why a book should or should n't be banned .
The books range from Joseph Heller 's " Catch - 22 " to E.B. White 's " Charlotte 's Web . "

ClimateGate -- the controversy surrounding the leaked e-mails from the Climatic Research Unit at Britain 's University of East Anglia -- means not only a credibility problem for some of the world 's leading climate researchers .
It also means a credibility problem for the U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , whose latest influential report , known as the AR - 4 , calls evidence of global warming " unequivocal . "
These IPCC findings are largely based on the work of CRU , whose scientists are shown in the leaked emails to ...

He was speaking on the World Today on BBC World Service .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Stephen Krasner has written that “ organized hypocrisy ” is common practice in world politics .
He means states often paper over conflicts with sham accords while each continues to pursue its own interests .
Thus , 187 nations have signed the Kyoto Protocol , resoundingly declaring the signatories ’ resolve to curb greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions .
Most of them are exempt from emission controls , and the ones that are not have acted largely as they would have had no agreement been reached .
Global emissions of carbon dioxide have continued to grow .
The United Nations Conference of Parties in Copenhagen will follow this pattern .
While all countries proclaim a wish to lower GHG emissions , developing countries refuse to pay the requisite costs to do so .
Most developed countries also are reluctant to incur GHG control costs , and they clearly are unwilling to pay the very large costs required for China and India to significantly restrain their fast - growing emissions .
Yet without tight global emission limits , atmospheric levels of GHGs will continue to rise .
In recent weeks , leaders at the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation summit endorsed a scaled - back climate strategy .
President Obama and congressional leaders continue to speak as if an effective agreement is possible and further U.S. concessions are key to achieving it .
These claims make no sense .
China and India insist that the developed world must pay them to reduce emissions .
However , for the United States alone , fully compensating the developing countries for the cost of controls would entail annual income transfers of $ 200 billion by 2020 and of nearly $ 1 trillion by 2050 .
Yet the United States , as a developed country with a temperate climate , has less to fear from climate change than do most other nations .
Therefore , it has less to gain from an accord .
Why , then , should the United States consent to pay other countries to make emission cuts that are more valuable to much of the rest of the world than they are to America ?
The goal pursued by an agreement ’s supporters has little to do with saving the world from climate change .
Given the stance of China and India , no emission - control accord will have much effect on climate .
It has a lot to do with enacting U.S. GHG controls .
A powerful business coalition supports such controls .
While controls will slow the growth of the U.S. economy as a whole , some firms will gain from them - mostly because emission caps will raise their competitors ’ prices more than their own .
Then too , emission traders hope to profit from the expected large swings in emission - permit prices and to find investors in complex schemes packaging risky financial products .
Also , environmental groups have promised their funders that they will enact U.S. GHG curbs - not that the controls will solve climate change or yield net benefits to America .
To have any chance of enacting domestic GHG controls , the Obama administration must somehow produce the appearance of emission reductions from China and India .
Real emission cuts from these countries carry too high a price tag , but the appearance of cuts might be another matter .
The outlines of such an agreement are already visible .
Third World governments will announce “ no regrets ” policies - policies that they might adopt absent concerns about climate change .
Such policies will not have much impact on emissions , but the proponents of GHG controls will not inquire too deeply on that point .
Thus , China and India will pretend to curtail their emissions , and the supporters of U.S. emission curbs will pretend to believe that they are doing so .
This arrangement will impose potentially high costs on U.S. consumers while doing almost nothing to halt climate change .
Realistic talks on climate change must start with the facts that emission cuts yield net benefits only if they start small and become gradually larger , that new technologies must be developed to make deep future cuts feasible and that emission limits are not the only way to prevent harm from climate change .
Negotiations should allow countries to make and exchange pledges to take a wide variety of actions .
Some countries might still wish to offer caps .
Others might pledge energy research and development spending , sectoral emission caps , money to help poorer countries cope with warming , or more funding for climate science .
Some might even explore new technologies that could lower temperatures despite rising GHG levels .
Such talks , it must be admitted , would not produce dramatically lower emissions even in the medium term , but then again , neither will any other form of negotiation .
Setting a more realistic basis for climate talks would , though , require nations to forgo the comforts of organized hypocrisy .
So far , the Obama administration seems unwilling to pay this price .

NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD - 30th Anniversary DVD Special Edition Published at : Sept. 19 , 1999 , 8:32 p.m. CST by headgeek
I have had some pretty awful experiences in my life .
As well as quite a few wonderful ones .
The worst , I always thought , would be having to stand in the room while the authorities pulled the melted jewelry from my mother ’s burnt corpse .
That was a bad experience .
Then there were the two rusty nails that slammed into my knee to the hilt .
Oh yeah ... and not being able to move my legs .
I always thought that nothing I could see in film could even approach the misery of these personal moments .
But then , I could never in a thousand years imagine the creative still - birth of the 30th Anniversary NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD DVD .
Now I know what you are thinking , or at least I think I do .
You may be thinking that I have grossly overstated the level of personal offense with which I take this DVD , but I swear to you I am having to control myself sooo much right now from merely ranting ...
How can I tell you exactly how they pissed on this film ?
NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is one of my first favorite movies .
Every week , for the first 6 years of my life , I watched NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD projected in 16 mm .
It was the first film that I had memorized .
It scared me away from wanting to ever frequent cemeteries .
And it made me ask my Dad how they make movies .
And he handed me my first Famous Monsters of Filmland , along with a book on LON CHANEY ... a little thin blue book .
And that is how it began .
Also at the time I was addicted to KING KONG , GORGO and THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD .
I was seeing each of those ... constantly alongside LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS ( Corman version ) and REEFER MADNESS .
In fact earlier this day I had watched the Alamo Drafthouse ’s last night of the Cannibal fest where they screened NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD .
I was in a great mood .
I ’d been saving watching this 30th Anniversary edition till after I saw this screening at the Drafthouse .
Quint came over to watch it with Father Geek and I ... and my god ... the horror .
I feel as though I have just watched a personal family member gang - raped by a pack of super sodomites .
If you love NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD do n’t even pick up the box that encases this dung heap .
First off , John Russo should be buried alive and fed through an IV and given adequate oxygen for the next 30 years .
He has butchered , defaced and ruined one of the greatest horror films of all time .
From his additions ( as well as subtractions ) to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD , I can say with the utmost confidence that talent does not in any way reside within this shell of a so - called writer .
He has created something that at it ’s best moments perhaps achieves the utter stupidity of ‘ GREEDO FIRED FIRST ’ , but mostly resides with floating turds in a city sewer system .
There is not one instance in the entirety of the DVD that even begins to be good .
And I ’m even talking about the original footage .
They have ruined every single second of the film through laughably awful sound effects and mixing , through a HORRENDOUS new bit of noise shat out by talentless hack , Scott Vladimir Ligina .
They have erased all grain from the film , making it stark and crisp and in focus where it was once gloriously creepy and atmospheric .
Sigh ...
Perhaps I should just begin ... at the beginning .
Gone are the opening shots of the film .
Instead we begin upon the Chevy truck , that we later see Ben driving .
But for now , it is driven by two redneck types hauling the body of the ‘ cemetery ghoul ’ in a coffin in the back of their truck .
Terrible dialogue about how he was a child murderer has been created as if to give some sort of backstory to the first zombie we ever see .
This is HORRIBLE .
REALLY REALLY HORRIBLE .
The dialogue and acting between the two corpse handlers is terribly written and delivered with all the subtlety and nuance of a kindergarten play about butterflies and toast .
When we finally arrive at the cemetery we get a look at this abominable tone deaf synthesizer addicted skinhead , Scott Vladimir Licina .
Not only did he piss on the entire film with the single most offensive score I have ever listened to in my life , he and his gigantic teeth , have decided to bookend this film with an overbearing and painfully awful portrayal of a Reverend .
They have the cemetery zombie attack the two drivers and then we cut straight to Barbara and Johnny parked at the cemetery .
All the foreboding shots of the drive ... gone .
Now , new thunder sounds pounding the entire scene .
Drowning out their dialogue .
This is ... awful .
I really have never known the meaning of that word till I witnessed this atrocity .
Let ’s cut forward a bit .
Remember where Ben and Barbara have first gone into the house together ?
When he tells her to go turn on all the lights , and then he begins searching for nails and hammer and wood ?
Well ... we see him find the toolboxes .
We no longer see him put the screwdriver in his back pocket , gone is the search for wood ... he no longer looks under the sink , the initial nailing of wood is gone ....
Oh yeah ... as a matter of fact ...
When Barbara leaves the room here , it instantly cuts straight to her at the music box .
All of the in - between and dialogue has been cut .
Remember Ben relating to Barbara what happened to him ?
Remember him talking about a tanker truck ... describing that ?
GONE .
Remember Barbara telling the story of Johnny and her ?
Well , they got to the cemetery ... but all of her fantastic hysterical fits ...
GONE !
Gone .
So much character development .
Gone gone gone .
Remember the scene between Harry and Helen in the basement where Harry talks about the Radio up stairs and Helen begins screaming at him about that .
About how they do n’t like one another .
Well now ...
Harry goes down in the basement .
Does his initial bit about , “ We ’ll see who ’s right .
We ’ll see when they come pleading for me to let them in ”
And then ... cut to our all around swell guy , Tom pleading with Harry to come on back up ... a mere minute and a half after he ’s entered the cellar ... there by making it seem as if ...
Tom instantly had a change of heart .
Gone is the development between Harry and Helen about their marriage problems , the issues with Harry ’s superiority complex .
If fact ... throughout the entire film all of this basic fundamentally important to the story work is GONE , to be replaced with Reverend Wide Teeth and his bunch of morons .
Also ... all the radio broadcasts are now different .
It no longer feels like a radio broadcast from the period , but now feels like someone trying to impersonate a radio broadcast .
Gone is most of the Venus probe stuff .
Gone is the information about the Rescue Centers .
Gone Gone Gone .
They hacked the hell out of this film .
Remember the naked zombie ?
GONE !
Instead we have additional stumblers .
No useful or even intriguing zombie additions .
You remember how the film ends ?
Well , Ben still does what Ben does , but the instant still photography stuff is gone .
Now .
Oh boy ...
Now we get this insanely stupid ... “ ONE YEAR LATER ” bullshit where Reverend Big Teeth begins ranting about how GOD has saved him from the plague sweeping the nation like St Michael before him , and yada yada yada .
See Reverend Big Teeth gets bit on the cheek by Cemetery Ghoul ... and now it seems as if the whole film is a religious sermon about God .
What bollocks !
This wankerous piece of shite should be burned like the dead .
All extras on this piece of shit DVD are created Extras .
Annoying newly created trailer .
Awful DANCE OF THE DEAD music video .
Interviews and documentary footage with a bunch of nimrods and idiots that took a shit on this great film .
The sound effects alone should be enough to sentence them all to jail .
Combine that with the utter contempt with which they treat the original film .
IMAGINE : if in addition to the little things George Lucas did to Star Wars , he cut out the scenes between Luke and Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru .
Imagine if half the dialogue between Luke and OB1 was removed .
If a third of all dialogue between R2 and 3PO was removed .
If all new sound effects were brought in .
If additional music written by Christopher Young was added ( In a Different Style ) .
If Light Sabers sounded DIFFERENT .
If Darth Vader ’s heavy breathing was done by an asthmatic with a microphone .
THEN they added in scenes with a new character called Voltent and Wodstar , and they were on another planet all together where everything was fine .
Then they added additional Stormtroopers running around halls and bumping into one another .
GOD , this is the most repellent evil thing ever created .
George Romero should be allowed to sue and win the master negative for this shit heap and then set it ablaze .
It is an abomination to the eyes of mankind .
It ruins not only NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD , but fucks up the entire arc of the trilogy .
THIS IS THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE !
Beware .
If you have to see it ....
DON’T !
It will hurt you .
You ’ll froth at the mouth and you are likely to break something .
If you tried to ruin a film .
Set out to destroy it .
You could not do a worse job .
I promise you that .
This is unbearable and unwatchable .
I tried to leave 4 times during the showing , and Dad would n’t let me .
Said it would n’t be fair for me to rip it apart if I did n’t watch the whole thing .
I did .
I not only want my money back , but I want compensatory damages to my psyche by this ... this sin to man .
I HATE EVERYONE THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS THING !
I am not kidding .
I ’m not ‘ being funny ’ .
I ’m deadly serious .
NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is one of my favorite all time films .
When you read the review of watching the old scratched to hell print that was screened in 16 mm at the Alamo Drafthouse ... you ’ll see my love for this film .
But this is not that movie .
Not for one single second .
This is another , bizarro world adaptation made by a bunch of evil frat rats that wanted to be in a classic movie and somehow got the chance to live their fucked up dream then spit it into our stores for us ...
Lovers of the film to be soiled with .
Never in my life have I been more angry .
Nothing that Joe Farrell or Jack Valenti or any studio head or any human on the planet in history has done anything that has angered me more .
SURE ...
My priorities are pretty much OUT OF WHACK .
I should probably be far more upset about that sicko up in Ft Worth that killed those people .
BUT I do n’t know those people .
I know NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD .
I love this film .
It ’s one of the first films that made me love filmgoing and film fandom .
And these perverted fucking assholes have fucked that , and I goddamn bought the piece of shit , and I ’m broke right now and I ’M PISSED CAUSE I WOULD RATHER BUY AN EXTRA 100 PACKETS OF TOILET PAPER AND TAMPONS FOR MY SISTER .
I would rather own those things ... hell .... even keep em once they are soiled , than own this piece of shit .
It is festering in my house and getting me into a fit of anger just knowing I ’m sharing the same house as it .
In fact , I am going to tell Dad to go put it in the Brown Van .
A vehicle that is DEAD ...
Worthless .....
The place where worthless shite should be stored .
THIS IS ABOMINABLE !
Beware .
I will ban anyone that likes this piece of shit from my talkback .
WHY ?
Simply because
If you like this piece of shit abortion of a product , I could really give a shit if you ever read my site .
No nice words will be spoken about John Russo or that Reverend Big Teeth in any place that I have created .
Those intellectually deprived , artistically bankrupt hacks should be shunned from society .
ANY magazine that has promoted this festering pussbucket of a product should be BURNED !
It is terrible in the ways that ... I do n’t know what way .
Cause I ’ve never experienced anything that sucked this hard .
STAY AWAY !
Do not order it .
Do n’t buy it for a dollar ... 50 cents or even a penny .
That shiny coppery Lincoln will be worth more someday than this .
The change has been significant over the last five years , Mr. Geisser said .
“ Now we ’re at a crossroads , ” he said , of a complicated European anxiety that stems from economic crisis ; the fear of globalization ; the perceived increase in immigration as European birthrates fall ; and the subsuming of national states into an enlarged Europe .
“ There is an angst over identity in Europe , ” he said .
“ There ’s a feeling that Europe is becoming smaller and less important .
Europe is like an old lady , who whenever she hears a noise thinks it ’s a burglary . ”
This generalized anxiety and fear is translated into a specific one , he argues : Islam , “ a box in which everyone expresses their fears . ”
The European Union is believed to have more than 15 million Muslims and perhaps as many as 20 million .
France has five million to six million Muslims , the most in Western Europe .
In general , relations between Muslims and other Europeans have been good .
But the terrorism associated with attacks in France in 1995 and 2001 in the United States has resonated through the years , reinforced by the Madrid train bombings in 2004 ; the killing that year of the Dutch film director Theo van Gogh , a critic of conservative Muslims ; the London bombings of 2005 ; and the controversy over Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad published the same year .
In 2004 , France banned the head scarf ( and other signs of religious affiliation ) in public schools .
It is now debating a ban on the burqa , by which the government seems to mean any full facial covering , including the niqab , which shows the eyes .
That controversial measure is caught up in a government - sponsored debate over national identity , led by the ministry that also handles immigration .

Both measures have been widely criticized as political maneuvers by President Nicolas Sarkozy , capitalizing on social fears to unite the center - right and co-opt the far - right National Front before regional elections in March .
He has tried to play down the religious element in the debate , but he has also urged Muslims to show “ humble discretion ” and avoid “ ostentation and provocation ” ; a junior minister , Nadine Morano , said young Muslims should dress better , find jobs and stop using slang and wearing baseball caps backward .
There 've been satellites orbiting Earth for half a century .
But getting information to and from them is still a pain .
Which is why Pentagon research arm Darpa is looking to finally hook the orbiting spacecraft up with reliable broadband connections .
It 's part of a larger movement to extend terrestrial networks into space , and eventually build an " Interplanetary Internet . "
In the meantime , we might even get less - than - crappy satellite internet service – if the project works out , of course .
Darpa recently issued a request for information about supplying " persistent broadband ground connectivity for spacecraft in low - Earth orbit . "
The idea would be to give these satellites a near - constant feed of " 100 kbps or higher " two - way connectivity , with end - to - end transmission latency of less than a second .
Unlike most Darpa projects , which are meant to pay off years or decades in the future , this would be a near - term attempt .
The agency wants the system " operational in the 2012 to 2013 time frame . "
Brian Weeden , a former officer with U.S. Air Force Space Command and a technical adviser with the Secure World Foundation , says Darpa 's help would be most welcome .
" The protocol that the internet uses – TCP / IP – was n't really designed with space in mind .
For one , the delay times between nodes can be big .
One way to GEO [ geosynchronous orbit ] is 300 milliseconds at the speed of light , there and back over half a second of built - in network lag before anything else adds to it .
That 's one reason why getting internet from satellites sucks right now , " he tells Danger Room .
" If you go lower than GEO , then of course satellites are always moving and thus not always overhead .
It would be a huge help to have a protocol that can automatically store and forward packets when the satellite is present or not , " Weeden adds .
For years , Darpa – which backed much of the early research into the internet – has been working with other networking godfathers to put together an " interplanetary internet . "
" We 're pretty used to it but the internet is actually a pretty revolutionary construct .
That you can drop a packet of data on it with only a starting and destination address and it finds its way there without any directions is pretty astonishing , " Weeden explains .
" The payloads on most satellites do n't work that way – payload operators need to configure specific transponders for specific users and applications .
So part of this is trying to bring those internet concepts of automatic routing and network config to satellite constellations , and perhaps to make them extensions of the land - based internet infrastructure . "
Darpa 's deadline for ideas of how to pull it off is Nov. 5 .

Gropenhagen Conference Prostitutes Offer Free Climate Summit Sex
Copenhagen Mayor Ritt Bjerregaard sent postcards to city hotels warning summit guests not to patronize Danish sex workers during the upcoming conference .
Now , the prostitutes have struck back , offering free sex to anyone who produces one of the warnings .

Man cleavage -- plunging necklines slit open to reveal chest hair , pectoral muscles , maybe more -- is back .
Until recently , male décolletage was an androgynous fashion affectation limited mainly to sporadic appearances on European runways .
But the look , including deep V - necks and scoop - neck tops , hit the U.S. in full force at New York 's September Fashion Week , turning up at shows by Duckie Brown , Michael Bastian and Yigal Azrouël .
This time around , the styles were more blatantly sexual and the models had a more studly swagger .
New York designer Mr. Bastian said his show 's vibe was inspired in part by " Latin guys " he noticed wearing their shirts unbuttoned , as well as the unabashed machismo of Latin American men in general .
" We wanted to go back to a more natural body , a more '70s body with the models , getting away from the super skinny , " says Mr. Bastian .
Plenty of men , from regular Joes to " Dancing With the Stars " contestants , have loosened to the trend .
On HBO's hit series " True Blood , " 29 - year - old ex-model Mehcad Brooks rarely went an episode without removing his shirt .
Mr. Brooks also frequently displays his perfect pecs off - screen , wearing rib-hugging T's with deep V - necks or shirts with the top buttons suggestively undone .
New Mexico women 's soccer defender Elizabeth Lambert has been suspended indefinitely after engaging in rough play -- including hauling an opposing player to the ground by her pony tail -- in the Lobos ' 1 - 0 loss to BYU in the Mountain West Conference semifinals .
Lambert is prohibited from taking part in practices , games and conditioning , coach Kit Vela announced Friday .
" Liz is a quality student - athlete , but in this instance her actions clearly crossed the line of fair play and good sportsmanship , " Vela said .
Video footage of the game shows Lambert , a junior , committing a series of excessively rough plays , including kicking , tackles , a forearm shiver to the back -- in response to an elbow to the ribs -- and yanking BYU forward Kassidy Shumway to the ground by her hair .
Lambert was assessed a yellow card during the 76th minute , apparently for tripping .
On Friday , Lambert apologized for her actions , saying she was " deeply and wholeheartedly regretful . "
" I let my emotions get the best of me in a heated situation .
I take full responsibility for my actions and accept any punishment felt necessary , " Lambert said .
" This is in no way indicative of my character or the soccer player that I am .
I am sorry to my coaches and teammates for any and all damages I have brought upon them .
" I am especially sorry to BYU and the BYU women 's soccer players that were personally affected by my actions .
I have the utmost respect for the BYU women 's soccer program and its players . "
The Mountain West said it endorsed New Mexico 's discipline of Lambert , saying her actions violated the conference 's sportsmanship policy .
The conference said it would continue an internal review of " the overall dynamic involved in the match " and said it would not comment further .
" Liz 's conduct on the field against BYU was completely inappropriate , " said Paul Krebs , New Mexico 's vice president for athletics .
" There is no way to defend her actions . "
BYU athletic director Tom Holmoe , in a news release , said Krebs had contacted him after the incident .
" It 's an unfortunate incident that occurred in the game Thursday afternoon , " Holmoe said .
" The University of New Mexico and the Mountain West Conference have reviewed the situation and have acted appropriately ... I am pleased with his immediate response to the matter . "
New Mexico ( 13 - 5 - 3 ) was the No. 4 seed in the tournament .
Top - seeded BYU ( 17 - 2 - 2 ) , ranked No. 17 in the NCSAA / adidas College Soccer Women 's Top 25 , advanced to the tournament final against San Diego State with the win .
The Cougars scored the game 's lone goal on a Carlee Payne header off a direct kick in the 31st minute .
Recent issues of Third Way have discussed the music of Public Enemy and the politics of Malcolm X. Both are generally classified as Black Separatists or Nationalists ( although the designation may not be an entirely accurate description of Malcolm X's ideology in the last year of his life , when he moved toward a " we are all brothers under Islam " perspective ) .
The major media all uniformly uphold a racial integrationist perspective and the implication of their massive propaganda machinery is that all those opposed to vast social , racial and cultural mingling are bigots motivated by hatred .
We are constantly being told that unless we support inter-racial marriage and overall amalgamation of our unique ways of life , we must be " haters " .
Of course , a good case could be made that just the reverse is true , that those who sincerely care about the races of men are concerned with preserving , not destroying them .
In fact those who push for wholesale integration are generally those who are indifferent to the history and traditions of both European and African peoples .
As part of the media attempt to convince us that the destruction of all differences between people is the only way to brotherhood among men a deliberate censorship is imposed on all those who have attempted and are attempting to offer an alternative vision .
Increasingly , as imposed integrationism fails to satisfy both Black and White , the establishment seeks to eradicate the memory of those who have spoken out for racial pride and solidarity in the past and ignore those doing so at present .
Third Way has broken this silence , but the true tale needs to be told at greater length .
Indeed , racial pride , a sense of a people 's link to past and future has been forcefully and ably articulated over the past two centuries by scores of Black Leaders .
Alas , they are unlikely to have a TV mini-series on their live commissioned .....
It should be pointed out that among Blacks there have been three general positions on race .
The first which may be labelled integrationist sees race as of no significance whatever and hopes to bring about a time when racial traits will be completely irrelevant .
To this group , the characteristics , traditions , myths , songs , customs , collective memories and natural loyalties of a people are not deserving of respect and love nor of defence and perpetuation .
The second group are best described as believers in racial solidarity yet devoted to multi-racialism .
This positions ' ideology is difficult to pin down .
It refers to Blacks and Whites as collective bodies , seeks legislation based on racial distinctions , associations socially with its own race , but calls for the elimination of race as a factor of any import .
In this group fall large numbers of establishment tolerated Black leaders and movements .
Third are the Black Nationalists who see their people as unique with a distinct past , present and future .
They hope to reverse the process of integration , advocating anything from a return to Africa and ( or ) the granting of territory within North America and Europe for independent Black Nations or , at the very least , local autonomous government for Black communities .
Our concern at present is with the third position just outlined .
The advocates of the second stance often possess a sense of racial awareness which conflicts with their political rhetoric and might make them also worthy of study .
The confused nature of their position , however , places them outside the confines of our topic .
Despite the fact that they may be Black Nationalists in thought and perhaps deed , they are not in word .
Black Nationalism : Early Stirrings
Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the largest population of displaced Black people was to be found in America .
It was there that the notions of solidarity and autonomy that would pave the way for Separatists Doctrines were born .
In 1789 the Free African Society of Newport .
Rhode Island ( a Black fraternal organisation ) sent a proposal to its sister group in Philadelphia appealing for a return - to - Africa movement .
By 1815 actual steps in this direction by a wealthy Black Shipowner , Paul Cuffee , who began repatriating Blacks to Sierra Leone .
In 1817 shortly before Cuffee 's death the American Colonisation Society ( ACS ) was founded to accomplish with greater efficiency his plan .
The ACS founded Liberia and between 1822 and 1861 approximately 15,000 Blacks choose to return there under its auspices .
Support for a return to Africa was growing amongst American Blacks .
In 1827 the country 's first Black newspaper Freedom 's Journal was published in New York City and after some initial internal battles its editor John B Russwurm firmly embraced emigration .
Practising what he preached he eventually settled in Liberia himself as a superintendent of schools , sponsored by the ACS .
After the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850 which required that all escaped slaves be returned to their owners large numbers of Blacks embraced colonisation because of what they saw as the hopelessness of their situation in America .
Among prominent Black leaders who supported emigration during this period were Alexandra Crumwell , Samuel Ward , Henry Highland Barrett and Martin R. Delany .
Howard Bell in his monumental study A Survey of the Negro Convention Movement , 1830 - 1861 maintains that by the mid 1850 's the majority of Black leaders favoured repatriation .
Delany and Barrett felt that the ACS was too dominated by Whites .
They associated with the Black controlled African Civilisation Society .
Delany spent lengthy periods of time in the Niger Valley and is the source for the oft quoted slogan , " Africa for the African Race , and Black Men to Rule Them " .
Crumwell was a Black Preacher who eventually settled in Liberia and as an official of that Government frequently journeyed to America to persuade Blacks to return to Africa .
He was a deeply religious man who wrote : - " Races , like families , are the organisms and the ordinance of God and race feeling like family feeling is of Divine Origin . "
In passing it is worth noting that President Abraham Lincoln who freed the slaves was a strong advocate of either establishing a Black colony in the Caribbean or aiding a general return to Africa .
Even in August 1862 , in the midst of the Civil War , when a delegation of Black Leaders visited him at the White House he told them he favoured repatriation - which was " better for us both " .
Post Civil War Separatists
The turmoil of reconstruction after the Civil War in which the Federal government used draconian measures to enforce mult - racialism on the South resulted in the violent resistance of the Ku Klux Klan .
It was a scenario to be frequently repeated up till the present day .
Forced integration provoking hatred and leading to violence .
Eventually the South restored segregation , but this was far from the " separate but equal " principle demanded by the nineteenth century courts .
Blacks were second class citizens deprived of elementary rights to vote , go to school or earn a living .
They were seen as inferior people with no identity or need for self - determination .
In response to this horrid situation Blacks organised the Liberian Exodus Joint Stock Steamship Company which in 1878 brought the steamship Azor to Liberia full of repatriates .
Financial problems followed and only one trip was made .
This failure was followed by a fascinating experiment in Black Separatism .
Benjamin Singleton known among his followers as the " Moses of the Coloured Exodus " led some eight thousand Blacks from the South to settle in virgin territory in Kansas during the winter of 1879 .
The community survived for a brief time , but soon racism had infected Kansas and Singleton began to look elsewhere .
In 1885 he founded the United Transatlantic Society to expedite Black transportation to Africa .
The Society never put its goals into practice , but it went on record supporting " separate Negro national existence " .
The most prominent Black Nationalist of the Pre-World War One period was Bishop Henry M. Turner .
In 1891 he visited Africa and encouraged by what he saw returned a year later to outspokenly advocate emigration .
That same year he was in the forefront of those lobbying in congress for passage of the Butler Bill which would have committed the government to financially aid all Blacks wanting to return to Africa .
Turner and the still existing ACS were aided in their lobbying by Professor Edward W. Blyden of Liberia .
Blyden is generally seen as the father of Pan - Africanism - the belief in racial unity among Blacks world wide .
A West Indian by birth he settled in Africa in 1851 .
Although the Butler Bill was defeated ( it is interesting to imagine what the future development of America and Africa would have been had it been passed ! )
Byden 's extensive writings had a tremendous effect on a young Jamaican called Marcus Garvey .
Bishop Turner continued the Nationalist struggle helping to found the International Migration Society .
This group originally followed by the Liberian Colonisation Society sent ships full of repatriates to Africa in the late 1890's .
Money , however , was always short .
The emigrants could not afford to pay their own way and the government refused to help .
" My Race Is Mine " Bishop Turner 's efforts reaped little practical fruit and he died in 1915 .
Yet , his death almost coincided with the spiritual genesis of the greatest Black Nationalist movement of all time .
In 1913 Marcus Garvey , a Jamaican living in London , read Booker T. Washington 's Up From Slavery .
Washington advocated Black Economic self - determination , not political and social autonomy , but Garvey saw the three as linked .
Washington 's book changed his life .
He later wrote of that time , " My doom - if I may so call it - of being a race leader dawned on me .
Where is the black man 's government , his army , his President ?.... I could not anymore remain in London .
My brain was afire " .
Arriving back in Kingston in mid-summer 1914 Garvey founded the United Negro Improvement and Conservation Association and African Communities League .
The name was later shortened and it became known as the UNIA : a group with a multi-purpose program .
Members devoted to themselves to Black self - help programs , African independence struggles , back - to - Africa plans , and the promotion of racial pride .
After a year , though , Garvey recognised that his movement was struggling .
Talk about the glories of ancient Africa meant little to those suffering in the present .
Thus , in 1916 at age 28 Garvey went to America to raise funds and enthusiasm for his movement .
It was a trying time as he worked part - time and gave speeches on assorted street corners in New York 's Harlem area .
After three months he began to cross America all the while speaking for the UNIA .
Eventually in 1917 he was able to found a UNIA chapter in New York city .
In 1918 he began publishing what was to become the internationally distributed newspaper Negro World .
At its peak circulation would reach over 60,000 .
The paper 's masthead said it all -- " One God , One Aim , One Destiny " .
It was a direct message of racial solidarity and a popular one at that .
By 1919 the UNIA had thirty chapters world - wide and two million members .
It was to be a furious yet short period of success for Garvey .
He held huge national conventions , staged uniformed parades in Black communities , founded a shipping company to raise money for his cause , sent a delegation to the League of Nations asked for African Independence and preached long and hard the message of Black pride and solidarity : -
The time has come for the Asiatics to govern themselves in Asia , as the Europeans are in Europe .
So too it is wise for the Africans to govern themselves at home ......
There is no other way to avoid the threatening war of the races that is bound to engulf all mankind ; there is not better method than by apportioning every race to its own habitat .
It was a powerful doctrine and one that was firmly opposed by both the integrationist and white supremacist forces of that period .
The result was swift .
In January 1922 Garvey was imprisoned on trumped - up charges of mail fraud .
He was kept in prison for fifteen months before ever being brought to trial .
On June 21 , 1923 he was sentenced to five years imprisonment .
All appeals proved futile , and in 1925 Garvey began serving his sentence in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary .
From the prison cell his activities continued .
It was there he wrote the poem The Tragedy of White Injustice with the memorable stanza :-
Every man on his own foothold should stand
Claiming a nation and a fatherland !
White , Yellow and Black should make their own laws
And force no one - sided justice with flaws ...
In 1927 President Coolidge commuted Garvey 's sentence .
He was released , but apparently it was all a set - up for shortly thereafter the government deported him .
Back in Jamaica he set to work strengthening the local UNIA chapter .
In 1928 he journeyed to England to launch a European chapter of his movement .
From then on things took a downward turn for Garvey .
Although the organisation 's 1929 convention held in Kingston was successful , overall support was dwindling .
Garvey 's efforts to rebuild his once great Association from Jamaica failed and in 1935 he returned to England .
Membership declined steadily despite a last attempt on his part , the founding in 1937 of the School of African Philosophy .
Marcus Garvey 's last years were lived in poverty and relative obscurity .
He died on June 10th 1940 , shortly after suffering a stroke .
Of his family he said , " I have nothing to leave for them , but the service I have cheerfully given my race . "
The battle between integrationists and White Supremacists was fought in the West after World War Two .
Victory went to the former .
Yet , the Black man still suffers .
He is still persecuted , impoverished and alienated .
Lingering doubts remain .
White supremacy is evil , but is integration the answer ?
Large numbers of Blacks do not believe it is .
Either ignored or castigated by the media for their beliefs they continue to maintain that all races are special with unique needs and destinies .
Some like the Black Power advocates of the late sixties and early seventies , via organisations such as the Black Panther Party in America , called for black economic and communal self determination .
Although shying away from talk of repatriation or statehood their movement was one of exclusionist racial memory , pride , culture and self - defence .
Bobby Seale , Huey Newton and Eldridge Cleaver led the party while the likes of Stokely Carmichael and H. Rapp Brown functioned as movement spokesmen .
One of the oldest Separatist groups is the Nation of Islam or , as they are commonly called , Black Muslims .
Founded by Elijah Muhammad and currently led by Louis Farrakhan they maintain , amidst a backdrop of unique religious doctrine , a commitment to territorial secession from White America .
All they ask is that they be granted " four or five fertile States " and " twenty years of government assistance " to make their new nation work .
Osiris Akkabala carries on the Garvey tradition via his Pan -African International movement .
His program calls for an eventual return to Africa and emphasises black history , pride and racial solidarity .
It is continuation of the old Garvey tradition - a call for a return of the black race to its former African greatness .
There are others .
UNIA itself struggles on , and Elijah Muhammad 's son Wallace leads an alternative Muslim organisation .
Indeed , it seems safe to say that most black street activists although demanding a non-racist attitude in their rhetoric are , in reality , primarily racial nationalists at heart .
Practically Speaking Obviously members of all races interested in their particular heritage 's and respective ways of life are a minority today .
Most whites and blacks pledge their loyalty to nothing more than vapid consumerism and shallow " fun " .
Hollywood and Wall Street dominate all races .
In this climate of " hollow men " it is foolish to speak of repatriation , of a return to ancestral soil , be it of Europe or of Africa .
Before social policy can change there must be a change in the minds and hearts of men .
We must strive to present the beauty of community , of being together with others , those alive , dead , and yet unborn ; we must emphasise that quality of life is man 's highest goal and his greatest source of joy .
Third Way is devoted to developing a true sense of community and to the dignity of men living with their fellows .
For black and white alike it means a return to one 's innermost self .
Only after we are in touch with who we are can we turn to the practical questions of land , autonomy and the like .
Marcus Garvey was a giant , a hero for both Black and White .
Before his death he said , " When I am dead look for me in the whirlwind of the storm , look for me all around you , for , with God 's grace , I shall come ... to aid you in the fight for Liberty , Freedom and Life . "
In the Third Way the fight goes on .

Silvio Berlusconi's followers today pounced on the attack in which he was injured , blaming his political enemies and courtroom adversaries for inciting the violence , and announcing plans for new restrictions on demonstrations and the internet .
In a tumultuous debate , the leader of Berlusconi 's parliamentary party in the chamber of deputies , Fabrizio Cicchitto , said : " The hand of he who attacked Berlusconi was primed by a pitiless campaign of hatred . "
He went on to name the organisations and individuals he said were behind it .
Top of the list was the group that owns the daily newspaper La Repubblica and the weekly magazine L'Espresso , which earlier this year made the running in coverage of successive sex scandals involving Italy 's prime minister .
Next came a new , radical daily , Il Fatto , which Cicchitto described as " the morning paper of the prosecution service " .
After losing his immunity from prosecution in October , Berlusconi now faces trial for bribery and fraud .
The leader of the majority in the lower house then singled out Marco Travaglio , author of a recently re-published book about Berlusconi 's links with the mafia , whom he denounced as a " media terrorist " .
Finally , Cicchitto pointed the finger at " certain prosecutors who go on television " and two of Italy 's opposition parties , including the biggest , the Democratic party , whose leader , Pierluigi Bersani , visited Berlusconi in hospital on Monday .
Bersani told parliament : " The risk is that someone is dressing up as a fireman in order to play the arsonist . "
The leader of the other group named , Antonio Di Pietro of the Italy of Principles party , said : " We will not be intimidated .
Ours is not an opposition of hatred , but of love for our country . "
His words were lost on the members of Berlusconi's Freedom People movement , who walked out of the chamber after he got up to speak .
Using some of the most inflammatory language heard in the Italian parliament in recent years , one of Di Pietro 's MPs shouted after them that they were " mafia people " .
The clash erupted on a day when the interior minister , Roberto Maroni , announced that Thursday 's cabinet meeting will discuss two new bills , one dealing with demonstrations and the other with " groups on the internet who laud the prime minister 's assailant " .
These , he said , " represent an out - and - out instigation to crime .
We are considering shutdowns , with solutions I intend to table at the next cabinet meeting " .
The wisdom of closing websites was questioned , however , by one of his own cabinet colleagues , the defence minister , Ignazio La Russa .
Maroni told parliament that Sunday 's attack , which left the prime minister with a broken nose , two chipped teeth and cuts on his top lip , had been premeditated .
Today , a witness came forward to say he thought the attacker , Massimo Tartaglia , who has a long history of mental instability , might have been passed the plaster souvenir he hurled at Berlusconi .
Andrea Di Sorte , a top organiser of Berlusconi 's political clubs , said : " I saw that there was a movement behind , as if he were wriggling to get hold of something from someone who , obviously , I did n't see . "
The prime minister is due to leave hospital " with a recommendation not to take on demanding public engagements for at least two weeks " , said his personal doctor , Alberto Zangrillo .
He said the attack had aggravated a neck complaint from which the prime minister already suffered and that he was being given more painkillers .
The Freedom People 's website carried a message from Berlusconi thanking all those who had wished him well , and adding : " Love always wins out over envy and hatred . "
But Zangrillo gave a strikingly different account of his patient 's humour .
He said the state of his morale was " worrying " , though improving , and that Berlusconi felt " deep bitterness over what has happened " , adding cryptically " and over certain things [ that happened ] afterwards " .
US expects no climate deal during Obama China visit

Cooling towers are demolished in an attempt to save energy and reduce emissions , at a power plant in Xinxiang , Henan province , October 28 , 2009 .
The United States does not expect to reach an agreement on climate change with China during President Barack Obama 's visit to Beijing next month , the country 's senior climate change envoy said on Wednesday .
[ Agencies ]
SHANGHAI : The United States does not expect to reach an agreement on climate change with China during President Barack Obama 's visit to Beijing next month , the country 's senior climate change envoy said on Wednesday .
" I do n't think we are getting any agreement per se , " said Todd Stern , US Special Envoy for Climate Change .
" I think ( Obama ) is trying to talk to President Hu , to push towards as much common understanding as we possibly can in order to facilitate an agreement in Copenhagen , " Stern told reporters .
Negotiators gather in the Danish capital in December to draft a new accord aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions , with the first phase of the Kyoto Protocol set to expire in 2012 .
Progress in the talks has remained slow , with the United States reluctant to commit itself to a deal that does not oblige developing countries to agree to mandatory CO2 reduction targets .
Chinese negotiators have also said the industrialised world should bear the bulk of the burden in cutting carbon emissions .
The meeting between Obama and President Hu Jintao is seen as a crucial component in the efforts to build a consensus around any new global climate pact .
Maria Cantwell , a Democratic Senator from Washington State , said in Beijing last month that China and the United States are likely to sign a bilateral agreement during Obama 's visit .
But Stern said Washington was not trying to cut a separate deal .
The two sides are likely to discuss further cooperation next month on issues like carbon capture and storage , but the differences between the two sides will make it difficult to formulate any substantive agreement , analysts said .
" There will be lots of kind words and lots of talk but I do n't think it will amount to much , not least because we are moving towards Copenhagen and I do n't think they want to show their hand yet , " said Paul Harris , professor of global and environmental studies at the Hong Kong Institute of Education .
With Copenhagen six weeks away , Stern warned that success was by no means guaranteed .
" Copenhagen can be a success , " said Stern , " There 's a deal to be had , but it does n't mean we can get it . "
The Obama administration 's attempt to push through its own climate plan before the end of the year is expected to be crucial , analysts suggest .
The US Senate Enviroment Committee is holding hearings on a new climate bill this week .
The administration has been urging Congress to move forward , and further delays might dent the credibility of the United States during the Copenhagen talks .

Tea -party style activism has taken some nutty turns before — the Hitler references , the Holocaust pictures .
But Walter Fitzpatrick III may be about to push anti-Obama activism to new heights .
On Tuesday , he plans to walk into the Monroe County courthouse in tiny Madisonville , Tennessee , and attempt to convince a local grand jury to indict the president on treason and fraud charges .
Fitzpatrick is one of those alternate - reality Americans who believe that Barack Obama is actually one Barry Soetoro , a man who is not an American citizen and thus ineligible to serve as president .
Fitzpatrick claims that since March , he has been trying to get federal prosecutors in Tennessee to bring treason charges against the president .
All that effort earned him , however , was a visit from the Secret Service .
But then Fitzpatrick evidently discovered that Monroe County has rather liberal rules about grand juries .
In most places , only a local prosecutor can present evidence to a grand jury and request an indictment .
In Monroe County , any private citizen can show up with a petition and seek an indictment .
The most common initiators of such proceedings are usually victims of robberies or assaults , however , not activists trying to unseat the president .
Fitzpatrick tried this once already , filing a brief in late August that read , in part :
OBAMA - SOETORO IS MY SWORN ENEMY ! –
And as there were TRAITORS to Italy in Caesars day , I report to this GRAND JURY with force and authority there are senior military officers no more obedient to the CONSTITUTION than their criminal DICTATOR , OBAMA - SOETORO .
But the attempt did n’t go very well .
JB Williams , a frequent contributor to the conservative website Town Hall and apparently something of an unofficial spokesman for Fitzpatrick , wrote that the local DA and the grand jury foreman threw Fitzpatrick out of court .
( Fitzpatrick could not be reached for a response , and the district attorney was unavailable to comment on this account . ) *
Fitzpatrick ’s supporters frequently cite his status as a retired Navy lieutenant commander as proof of his integrity and patriotism .
What they fail to mention is that in 1990 he was court - martialed for financial negligence , a move that essentially ended his military career .
He runs a blog called JAG Hunters , and reportedly lives in Sweetwater , Tennessee .
His website provides all the information activists need to file their own treason charges against Obama , and he invites people to copy him on their filings so that he can publicize their efforts .
He lists seven others who ’ve joined the crusade so far .
Fitzpatrick is hardly the first to attempt legal proceedings against Obama , but his scheme is unique in that it involves criminal allegations .
Those challenging Obama ’s citizenship in court have usually done so via civil suits ( most of which have been thrown out by unsympathetic judges ) .
Others have convened mock “ citizens ” grand juries to “ indict ” the president , sending the charging documents to local prosecutors in North Carolina and elsewhere .
So far , no prosecutors have taken up the case .
Fitzpatrick is trying to appeal directly to the people through a grand jury comprised of average citizens who volunteer their time .
Still , unless the jurors of Monroe County are truly rabid Obama haters , it seems unlikely that they will be persuaded — or that they even have the power to indict the president in the first place .
Treason , after all , is a federal crime , not a county - level offense .
When I asked a court employee whether the Monroe County grand jury has jurisdiction to indict a sitting president , she seemed rather baffled : “ I would n’t think so .
That would not go before a local court . ”
She observed that the grand jury wo n’t issue any decision on the case until December 7 .
But for any real criminal charges to go forward , the local district attorney would have to agree to take up the case , a move that any sane prosecutor would be reluctant to make .
Still , the futility of Fitzpatrick ’s enterprise has n’t deterred self - declared “ patriots ” across the country from rallying around the news of his testimony and planning caravans to descend on Madisonville to lend moral support .
The Tennessee chapter of Sons of Liberty Riders , for instance , will be convening at the Sweetwater Comfort Inn at 7 a.m. before riding their choppers to the courthouse .
The planned rally came as a big surprise to courthouse employees .
When I told one staffer about the caravan , she was shocked , noting that Madisonville was a tiny place where not much ever happens .
She exclaimed , “ Maybe we should tell the restaurant across the street ! ”
* UPDATE : James Stutts , the Monroe County District Attorney , left a message Monday night saying that in fact , Fitzpatrick testified for two hours before the grand jury in August and the jury declined to bring any charges based on his testimony .
He also disputes Fitzpatrick ’s characterization of that appearance and says the former Navy man was not physicially restrained in any way nor was he forced from the courtroom .

We analyze the welfare cost of inflation in a model with cash - in - advance constraints and an endogenous distribution of establishments ’ productivities .
Inflation distorts aggregate productivity through firm entry dynamics .
The model is calibrated to the United States economy and the long - run equilibrium properties are compared at low and high inflation .
We find that , when the period over which the cash - in - advance constraint is binding is one quarter , an annual inflation rate of 10 percent leads to a decrease in the steady - state average productivity of roughly 0.5 percent compared to the optimum ’s steady - state .
This decrease in productivity is not innocuous : it leads to a doubling of the welfare cost of inflation .
It has been very difficult to find substantial costs for inflation , in a large part because it is difficult to make money matter in significant ways in a microfounded model .
This attempt is different in that the welfare cost comes from productivity losses through the firm entry and distribution .
The resulting impact of money and inflation is indirect yet important .

BERT ( Binary ERlang Term ) is a new serialization format based on Erlang ’s external term format .
It supports rich data types such as atoms ( symbols ) , heterogenous lists , tuples , and binary data .
BERT - RPC is a simple , dynamic RPC protocol built on top of BERT providing both synchronous and asynchronous requests , caching directives , streaming , and even callbacks .
Ernie is an Erlang / Ruby hybrid server that makes it dead simple to write your RPC functions in Ruby .
Together , these technologies power GitHub ’s new federated architecture and allow us to independently and horizontally scale both frontend and backend layers .
pool ( n.2 )
game similar to billiards , 1848 , originally ( 1690s ) the name of a card game played for collective stakes , from pool " collective stakes of players in a game , " which is from French poule " stakes , booty , plunder , " literally " hen , " from Old French poille " hen , young fowl , " from Vulgar Latin * pulla , fem . of Latin pullus " young animal , " especially " young fowl , " from PIE root * pau- ( 1 ) " few , little . "
Perhaps the original notion is from jeu de la poule , supposedly a game in which people threw things at a chicken and the player who hit it , won it , which speaks volumes about life in the Middle Ages .
The notion behind the word , then , is " playing for money . "
The connection of " hen " and " stakes " is also present in Spanish polla and Walloon paie .
By 1868 it came to mean " combination of a number of persons , each staking a sum of money on the success of a horse in a race , a contest in a game , etc. , the money to be divided among the successful bettors , " thus also " collective stakes " in betting .
The sense of " common reservoir of resources " is from 1917 .
Meaning " group of persons who share duties or skills " ( typist pool , etc. ) is from 1928 .
From 1933 as short for football pool in wagering .
Pool shark is from 1898 .
The phrase dirty pool " underhanded or unsportsmanlike conduct , " especially in politics ( 1951 ) , seems to belong here now , but the phrase dirty pool of politics , with an image of pool ( n.1 ) is recorded from 1871 and was in use early 20 c .
WASHINGTON 
In a surprise setback for Democratic leaders , Senator Joseph I. Lieberman , independent of Connecticut , said on Sunday that he would vote against the health care legislation in its current form .
The bill ’s supporters had said earlier that they thought they had secured Mr. Lieberman ’s agreement to go along with a compromise they worked out to overcome an impasse within the Democratic Party .
But on Sunday , Mr. Lieberman told the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , to scrap the idea of expanding Medicare and abandon any new government insurance plan or lose his vote .
On a separate issue , Mr. Reid tried over the weekend to concoct a compromise on abortion that would induce Senator Ben Nelson , Democrat of Nebraska , to vote for the bill .
Mr. Nelson opposes abortion .
Any provision that satisfies him risks alienating supporters of abortion rights .
Australia will open its World Cup campaign against three - time champion Germany in Durban .
The draw was staged at a glittering ceremony in Cape Town early this morning , with the Socceroos also being pitted against Ghana and Serbia in Group D .
The first match against Germany will kick off on Monday , June 14 at 12:00 am ( AEST ) .
The Socceroos then take on Ghana in Rustenburg on Saturday , June 16 at 9:30 pm before rounding out their group clashes against the Serbs in Nelspruit on Thursday , June 24 at 4:30 am .
Sixth - ranked Germany will be the Socceroos ' most difficult opponent , having qualified for the last four Cup finals as well as reaching the Euro 2008 decider .
Their last clash was a thrilling 4 - 3 win for Germany at the 2005 Confederations Cup in Frankfurt .
Ghana joined Australia in reaching the last 16 of the 2006 World Cup , while Serbia topped its qualifying group in front of 1998 world champion France .
The Serbs are currently ranked 20th in the world , one place ahead of Australia , while Ghana , which features Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien , is 37th .
" [ It ] could have been better , could have been worse , " Socceroos coach Pim Verbeek told SBS of the draw .
" Germany 's one of the best teams in the world - it's a great opponent for the first game .
" Ghana is very strong and Serbia beat France .
" Every game is full of challenges .
We have a good record against Ghana , we 've never lost against them . "
German team manager Oliver Bierhoff said : " We are glad we did not draw France or Portugal , but Australia , Serbia and Ghana will also not be easy . "
Coach Joachim
Loew added : " We are quite happy with this draw , it 's an interesting group . "
Australia last met Ghana in a friendly international last May , winning 1 - 0 courtesy of a goal from Perth Glory marksman Mile Sterjovski .
The Socceroos have never played Serbia .
Australia needs to finish either first or second in the group to progress to the round of 16 , where it would face either the winner or runner - up of Group C .
That could potentially mean a mouth - watering clash with England , whose odds were cut by many bookmakers , some installing it in second place behind Spain following a dream draw .
Group A : South Africa , Mexico , Uruguay , France
Group B : Argentina , South Korea , Nigeria , Greece
Group C : England , United States , Algeria , Slovenia
Group D : Germany , Australia , Ghana , Serbia
Group E : Netherlands , Japan , Cameroon , Denmark
Group F : Italy ( holder ) , New Zealand , Paraguay , Slovakia
Group G : Brazil , North Korea , Ivory Coast , Portugal
Group H : Spain , Honduras , Chile , Switzerland .

Video : Tavakoli Structured Finance President Janet Tavakoli on Treasury 's possible cover up of Goldman Sachs ' role in the mortgage and AIG crisis -- Aired December 21 , 2009
The answer is an obvious ' yes , ' as I 've written extensively .
Stephen Friedman , Geithner 's boss at the FRBNY and board member of Goldman Sachs , with the help of Lloyd Blankfein and Hank Paulson ( and former Goldman exec Edward Liddy , who became AIG's interim CEO ) , likely orchestrated the ' payouts at par ' to AIG counterparties , then conspired to pressure AIG executives NOT to disclose the details to shareholders in violation of SEC rules .
What Janet discusses , though less well - known , is equally true -- that Goldman Sachs created the AIG liquidity crisis by demanding billion - dollar collateral bumps in the days before AIG 's bailout , but long before , by securitizing toxic MBS CDOs and offloading to them to Wall Street and European banks .
Then OVER - HEDGING it's own exposure to to MBS CDOs all with AIG , to the extent that their hedges effectively KILLED AIG and forced a government takeover , resulting in ( you guessed it ) a bailout of AIG 's counterparties at 100 cents on the dollar , instead of the 10 - 15 cents that Janet demonstrates would have been the likely alternative .
From Janet 's email to us we have this introduction :
Now that the crisis is over , and given the special circumstances of the crisis , and Goldman ’s contribution to value - destroying securitizations , it is in the public interest to claw back the money paid to Goldman Sachs .
AIG did not need to settle for 100 cents on the dollar in November 2008 , and in September 2008 , a good negotiator would have refused to hand over more collateral , and should have clawed some back ( or insisted it was a temporary loan ) .
Money should be clawed back before Goldman pays out taxpayer subsidized bonuses .
In late July 2008 , SCA settled with Merrill for $ 500 million on $ 3.7 B of contracts , or around 13.5 % .
On August 1 , 2008 , Ambac settled $ 1.4 B with Citi for $ 850 million , or around 60 % on the dollar , but unlike SCA and AIG , Ambac was n’t on the brink of insolvency at the time .
Calyon , a French bank also involved in AIG ’s transactions , settled similar contracts with FGIC , another bond insurer , for only ten cents on the dollar in August 2008 , yet $ 13.9 billion of Goldman ’s contracts with AIG were settled for 100 cents on the dollar in November 2008 via purchases by Maiden Lane III .
Ambac recently settled similar credit default swaps for ten cents on the dollar ( $ 5 billion in contracts for around $ 500 million ) as Ambac needed capital , and MBIA has made deeply discounted settlements .
----------
From the Huffington Post
In November 2009 , I wrote in the Huffington Post that Goldman Sachs Group nearly bankrupted AIG .
In December , the Wall Street Journal explained to the general public that Goldman fueled AIG 's gambling and played a much bigger role in the mortgage bets that nearly felled American Insurance Group ( AIG ) than the Treasury , the Fed , or Goldman itself publicly disclosed .
The TARP Inspector General 's November 17 report missed the most damaging facts .
Intentionally or otherwise , it was evasive action or just plain whitewash .
The report failed to clarify Goldman 's role in AIG 's near collapse , and that of all the settlement deals , the U.S. taxpayers ' was by far the worst .
Goldman originated or bought protection from AIG on about $ 33 billion of the problematic $ 80 billion of U.S. mortgage assets that AIG " insured " with credit derivatives , about twice as much as the next two largest banks involved .
Goldman acted as middle - man on $ 14 billion of that amount , after it took the risk of mortgage assets originated by other banks and insured all of it with AIG .
Goldman may wish to claim it " was only following orders , " but since Goldman also originated many of the mortgage assets ultimately protected by AIG , it should have been well aware of the risk posed to itself and to AIG .
The risk was then Goldman's .
If AIG failed , Goldman Sachs would have had to make good on those trades .
Goldman stuffed so much risk into A.I.G. that Goldman nearly killed its own " hedge . "
In November 2008 , the New York Fed paid 100 cents on the dollar for the $ 14 billion of mortgage assets related to Goldman 's trades .
Goldman estimated the assets had lost $ 9.6 billion , or around two - thirds of their market value .
Overall , the government 's bailout out of AIG allowed Goldman to avoid losses on its trades covering $ 22 billion in assets .
The U.S. taxpayer deserved a much better deal .
In late July 2008 , SCA , another bond insurer , settled similar contracts for only around thirteen cents on the dollar .
In August 2008 , Calyon , a French bank also involved in AIG 's transactions , settled disputed financial guarantees with FGIC , a bond insurer facing bankruptcy , for only ten cents on the dollar .
Ambac , another bond insurer in need of capital , recently canceled similar trades for ten cents on the dollar .
Defenders argue that circumstances surrounding AIG were different from the other bond insurers .
They are correct ; the circumstances were worse .
The Fed should have made sure any payments that originated from AIG , before or after the bailout , were only temporary loans to be repaid as soon as possible .
This link provides a snapshot from January 2008 of two of Goldman 's value - destroying securitizations that were protected by AIG .
( You will have to enlarge the image after clicking , and the document is a bit awkward . )
The first is Abacus 2005 - 2 ; Goldman originated and bought protection on these mortgage assets .
The second is Davis Square Funding IV .
Goldman originated this deal , and French bank Societe General bought protection from AIG against it .
Inside Goldman 's mortgage assets were value - destroying assets created by other Wall Street firms .
Everyone bought each others ' junk so prices stayed artificially high , and the risk could be dumped on someone else .
Of course , this doomed strategy eventually fell apart .
At the time of the AIG bailout , losses were quickly eating away at the insides of these products cooked up in Wall Street 's financial meth labs .
Among the many shards of glass masquerading as gems , you will find Tourmaline CDO 2005 - 1 .
It was managed by Blackrock , the manager of the AIG assets that the Fed purchased with public money .
Perhaps the Fed 's theory in handing out no bid contracts to Blackrock has something to do with the diligence displayed by a fox watching a hen house .
The Fed gave the U.S. taxpayer a raw deal .
At the time Goldman got its give - away , Henry Paulson was treasury secretary -- he was also Goldman 's CEO when it put on its trades with AIG -- and former Goldman chairman Stephen Friedman was then chairman of the New York Federal Reserve Bank .
Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein was the only Wall Street executive at one of Paulson 's bailout meetings .
Goldman was inside the tent advising on the most self - serving way to save itself and gain unfettered access to public funds .
In the fall of 2008 , Goldman Sachs became a bank holding company before switching to a less regulated financial holding company in August 2009 * .
This prevented a run on Goldman Sachs and gave it permanent access to Fed funds , taxpayer money .
Goldman pays rates near zero for short - term borrowing while it earns profits on the higher rates paid on the capital it is required to deposit with the Fed .
Goldman also issued nearly $ 21 billion in debt guaranteed by the FDIC .
Most valuable of all , however , is the perception that Goldman is so well - connected , that the government will never let it fail .
Goldman paid mega bonuses in past years subsidized by selling hot air .
Now it proposes to again pay billions in bonuses based on earnings made possible by taxpayer dollars .
Now that the crisis is over , we should ask Goldman Sachs -- and all of AIG 's other trading partners involved in these trades -- to buy back these mortgage assets at full price .
Alternatively , we can impose a special tax .
Instead of calling it a windfall profits tax , we might label it a " hot air " profits tax .
A Goldman spokesman denies it could have known these mortgage assets were a problem , but Goldman also acknowledged I had warned about them -- and the grave risks they posed -- at the time they were created .
It said my opinion was in the " minority . "
As it happens , Goldman 's opinion was proved tragically wrong , and mine was proved correct .
It is not in the public interest to rely on Goldman 's opinion about the greater risk it now poses to the global markets , and the Treasury should exact a much greater financial cushion .
The global financial crisis and the special circumstances surrounding AIG 's bailout were extraordinary .
It is unconscionable to reward value destroying activity that damaged not only AIG , but enabled massive damage to the U.S. economy .
It is in the public interest to claw back public money .
Goldman should buy back these mortgage assets at full price , or we should impose a reparations tax .
Furthermore , Goldman should pay off its FDIC guaranteed debt , and once again become an investment bank with no access to Fed borrowing , before it pays taxpayer - subsidized bonuses to its employees .

The following is the first ( long promised and awaited ...;-) essay from writer / financial analyst Gregor Macdonald .
Gregor is a long time reader of The Oil Drum , frequenter of ASPO conferences , and general zeitgeist monitor who lives and writes in Massachusetts .
His website and newsletter are at www.gregor.us .
The below " Project For A Revolution In Philadelphia " , is an epistolary essay in which the author makes the case for an accelerated urban energy transition .
PROJECT FOR A REVOLUTION IN PHILADELPHIA :
Dear Campfire ,
I 'm sitting before a photograph of the completion of the transcontinental railroad - - 140 years ago this May , in 1869 .
The driving of the golden spike poetically combined the symbolic with the hard , physical world -- an event that should have carried forth well into this century .
Instead , we were interrupted and led astray by oil , and the automobile .
So I lament the passing of the 19th century when the United States , with its railroads and waterways , was almost perfectly positioned for the challenge it faces today .
My decade long research into energy and energy transition , and the post - war economic seigniorage enjoyed by the United States , suggests strongly to me that the prospect for future income growth here in America is now of a wholly different order , than was enjoyed in the past 100 years .
While I 'm not quite ready to sign on fully to the Orlovian Slope of Dysfunction , I certainly agree with its direction .
Flat incomes , slow growth , and a very rough energy transition are not only dead ahead -- they have arrived .
We will do well just to maintain alot of the infrastructure we currently have .
To build new infrastructure will only become more difficult as the inventory of liquid energy declines .
We also face a badly broken political structure .
The Housing , Automobile , and Financial sectors have emitted a powerful signal that good portions of those industries are no longer needed .
At the federal level , those signals go unheard .
Suddenly , the supersized states of California and New York , and the United States itself , appear as wrongly - scaled platforms from which to effect any change .
But I am trying to look past the rising probability for the kind of social rupturing that inevitably follows these conditions .
America 's cities , for example , would appear to be rightly scaled for our energy and economic transition .
Therefore , I 'm going to suggest there 's hope for our cities as long as they realize a difficult truth : they 're on their own , and Washington is unlikely to help them .
I recently spent an afternoon at a hosted event by MIT 's Senseable City Lab in Cambridge , Massachusetts -- and was treated to a good overview lecture of that working group 's various urban projects .
This gave me a chance to collect long - standing thoughts I 've had about the future of cities from my years living in Boston , NY , Los Angeles , and London .
The ideas I want to write about today could apply to most American cities .
Specifically , I 'd love to see my recommendations put into practice in a city like Oakland , California .
However , for reasons I will explain , I decided to use Philadelphia as my tableau .
It 's nothing less than astonishing to consider the map of metro Philadelphia 's total rail transport coverage .
Only in London have I seen such an overlay of underground , above ground , and additional connectivity to longer - distance rail transport systems .
My plan for Philadelphia is called FEW : Food , Energy , Wheels .
And in Wheels , Philadelphia has an enormous head start on the rest of the country .
Sadly , it 's a transport system that 's overlaid on a city that 's lost nearly 25 % of its population in the past five decades .
We can't afford to let built systems such as these go to waste .
Philadelphia needs to be repopulated .
In its current position , the city is quite reminiscent of London after the devastating serial recession - depressions of the 1970's and early 1980's .
As in many other American cities , I am forecasting that a good portion of the industrial - commercial real estate inventory is headed towards zero .
My experience in real - estate and environmental law suggests that alot of this property will fall into the hands of the city , through tax - takings .
Indeed , Philadelphia is already a dirt - cheap residential real - estate destination for artists , who are busily carving out neighborhoods with art galleries and 100 K green homes , and renovations of industrial buildings .
Because Philadelphia is already so low to the ground economically , it is a perfect city to conduct energy transition in the new paradigm of a flat economy .
A great deal of Philadelphia 's land , especially its vacant lots , will need to be marshaled to build out its urban farming and energy system , so again , just as with London coming out of 1982 , it 's a benefit that the city is so neglected and cheap .
In the new economy , most " profit " margins whether measured in energy or capital terms will be slim .
So starting with input costs nearer to zero is a great help .
Food , Energy , Wheels
The United States desperately needs a mayor or a governor to send a loud and frankly outrageous message to the country ( and the world ) that a radically new direction will be taken .
In part , this message will be necessary to attract a new population of like - minded individuals and businesses , looking to sign on to a new paradigm .
While we have seen an early example of this new population come to a city like Detroit , to take part in the wide - open , urban - prairie , libertarian - lab experiment that city has become , Philadelphia should adopt a more intentional program .
The buildout of urban farms , urban in - fill solar PV , and the development of a bicycle and rail oriented transport system should be more fully integrated into a citizenship model that leverages young people in particular .
Indeed , I see FEW as a plan that would be incorporated into the school curriculum .
It will also be necessary for Philadelphia to adopt a hostile position towards the automobile and federal automobile infrastructure .
Philadelphia needs to become a city where capital previously exported to automobile manufacturers stays at home .
As with others cities , Philadelphia should consider dismantling its highways ( see : Braess Paradox ) , and should reject any federal attempt to build more roads .
For the annual capital required for bridge repair and surface - road maintenance , a road tax should be levied on all cars and trucks entering the city , much in the same fashion as in London .
Every effort should be made to connect the lines of road costs directly to road users .
Philadelphia should declare its intention to become the most bike friendly city in the US , which wo n't be easy given the great leap already made by Portland , Oregon .
To be taken seriously , several long city streets or boulevards should be converted into bike highways .
Neighborhoods should be anchored by community bike shops , and young people should learn how to repair bikes .
The city should give tax breaks to bike manufacturers willing to relocate to Philadelphia .
Bike transport should be made part of workplaces and the school system .
There should be several races conducted each year from a European style road race , to a celebratory parade .
In the same way that the emergent bike system should be integrated into schools , so should the Food and Energy portion of my FEW plan be integrated into public school curricula and summer work programs .
Philadelphia , again , already has a robust urban farming culture that is making good gains but the city should boost these efforts to a much higher level .
As a stated goal , agriculture yield targets should be raised significantly .
All fast food franchises within city limits should be taxed exorbitantly .
Urban food production should be fed directly into the schools , with surpluses sold at neighborhood anchor stores ( in similar mappings to the neighborhood bike shops ) .
Graduating high school students should be educated in soils , nutrition , and the business aspects of food production .
In addition , the city should give incentives to attract a new class of restauranteur looking to source organic food locally .
Again , this is already happening in many US cities but Philadelphia should ramp it up .
It would be beneficial to add some glamour and panache .
Attracting a few celebrity chefs who have their produce delivered by bike from city farms makes for good images .
Advertising Philadelphia's new approaches to the world will be a key strategy to lend momentum to its transition .
Receding Ricardo
There is no shortage of vacant land in Philadelphia for urban agriculture and , as with most US cities , there 's no shortage of brownfield ( s ) either .
In addition to seeing that every remaining oil - fired heating system is ripped out from its public buildings , I see a great opportunity for Philadelphia to partner with solar manufacturers to both produce and install utility grade solar PV .
This is yet another way for cities to retain their capital more locally .
As a broader point I see the age of Ricardian comparative advantage not at an end , but in decline .
With the price of urban dirt going to a dollar , and the price of the dollar going to dirt it seems not unreasonable to project that many American cities will eventually become competitive with emerging market manufacturing .
Especially after shipping costs are factored in , and once the inevitable revaluation of emerging market currencies extends itself further .
My recent ( internet ) tour of commercial and industrial buildings for sale here in New England , combined with the my outlook for a permanently smaller US economy , suggests to me that the crash in commercial real estate will not only carry onward for some years , but is actually a good thing .
Here 's why : given the mistaken federal policy to try and support a full spectrum of asset prices and obsolete industries , commercial - industrial real estate may be one of the few asset classes allowed to head to zero .
And zero is rich with opportunity .
We need to see Philadelphia with fresh eyes , and recognize that in a world of soaring costs to build new infrastructure , the City of Brotherly Love is a treasure trove of land , housing stock , and commercial architecture all tied together by a massive rail network and a waterway .
What 's not to like ?
As usual , the artists know a good thing when they see it , and they move in early to make their score .
If Philadelphia would adopt FEW as its core strategy , it could potentially leap - frog ahead of other cities .
Some of those cities will waste years and capital trying to retain alot of systems that are naturally ebbing away .
Other US cities are either not on waterways , or face a topography almost barren of rail transport .
Here is my thesis : were all US cities to decide collectively that energy transition on an urban level had to commence at once , the embedded advantages of Philadelphia would suddenly become glaringly obvious .
Whether Food , Energy ,
Wheels is the appropriate framework for all US cities would be made clearer if just one US city were to take action .
A number of US cities now have little left to lose .
My choice of Philadelphia is made , in part , because I think the country desperately needs to see an example of the kind of economic vibrancy possible once we start to recoil from the automobile .
And I think Philadelphia is set - up nicely .
Some leader , some mayor I suspect , needs to show the rest of the country that this rough economic and energy transition can be confronted .
To do so will indeed take a level of courage and leadership not currently found anywhere in Washington , DC .
Yes , there is little doubt the US has collapsed .
But that 's not the end of the American story .

I ’ve just found this interesting 1927 news item from Science magazine lambasting the rise of ‘ quack psychologists ’ that were apparently troubling the American public at the time .
It ’s interesting because it has a dig a two very specific groups of unorthodox psychological groups :
PSEUDO -PSYCHOLOGISTS , who promise , like fairy godmothers , to turn every - day human beings into fascinating personalities or into great financial successes , are creating large groups of discontented individuals , according to Dr. E. A. Shaw and George E. Gardner , of the Harvard University Psycho - Educational Clinic .
These two clinical psychologists state in a report to the National Committee for Mental Hygiene that “ character analysts ” and “ practical psychologists ” are responsible for many of the dissatisfied , badly adjusted cases that come to the Harvard Clinic .
Gilt edge promises made to all , irrespective of ability and training , lead individuals to false hopes and discontent with kinds of work for which they are suited .
And repeated failures to attain the heights so glowingly described as well within reach can lead an individual to serious mental upsets .
The psychological quack , half informed concerning scientific psychological principles , undertakes in a conference or by lectures , and for no small fee , to advise men and women about their mental and vocational ills .
The two Harvard psychologists explain that “ these men , we maintain – and their numbers are growing day by day – are a detriment to the mental health of the community .
In their doctrines and platitudes there is just enough of truth and of falsity to make them dangerous . ”
One serious result of the situation pointed out is that the work of the “ analysts ” becomes confused in the eyes of the public with the work of well - trained vocational advisers and directors of personality clinics who conscientiously and carefully study the individual who comes to them for help and who advise him according to his real possibilities .
The reference to “ character analysts ” and “ practical psychologists ” is not just a general dismissal of the poorly trained practitioner , it refers to two specific movements that departed from the established mainstream .
“ Character analysts ” undoubtedly refers to followers of analyst Willhelm Reich who was originally a follower of Freud before foolishly engaging in some free - thinking which got him kicked out of the inner circle .
His book Character Analysis departed from the traditional Freudian focus on individual symptoms to consider the interplay of the whole personality .
It has become a classic in psychoanalysis but as he wandered from the Freudian path , he and his followers were ostracised .
Reich took a distinctly odd turn in later years , believing the power of orgasm , called orgone , could be stored in batteries and could be absorbed from the sky by the use of a special machine called a cloudbuster .
Incidentally , this story inspired the Kate Bush song Cloubusting , which describes Reich ’s obsession with the machine and his eventual downfall .
“ Practical psychologists ” refers to a movement of amateur psychologists that created their own popular clubs to discuss and ‘ translate ’ lab findings to the populace .
They saw themselves as liberating psychology from the ivory towers of the university but they were despised by academic psychologists for their uncritical thinking and , probably worse in their eyes , popularism .
The Psychologist had a great article on the growth of this movement in the UK , if you want more on what pop psychology looked like in the early 20th century .
Some years before the publication of this news piece , Freud had written his famous paper on ‘ Wild Psycho - Analysis ’ which clearly stated that true analysts had to toe the line and had to be taught by one of the initiated – everyone else was to be considered a dangerous amateur .
I have no idea who Dr E.A. Shaw was , but George E. Gardner was a orthodox Freudian psychoanalysis based at the prestigious McLean Hospital in Massachusetts , so you can see how they were using the talk reported in the Science piece to bolster the established Freudian approach to the mind .

So what on earth is O'Neill doing now by falling backwards into the bottomless pit that is the beauty myth ?
When quizzed by Judith Warner in The New York Times as to why a tax on Botox was '' devaluing ' ' women '' for being middle - aged ' ' , O'Neill argued that access to cosmetic surgery – Botox , breast enhancement , face lifts etc – is an important contemporary feminist issue .
In a nutshell , this leading feminist is suggesting that if middle - aged women are serious about getting - or keeping - a job , then they must buy into the myth that they are only as good as they look , and spend money on a good plastic surgeon .
'' I know a lot of women whose earning power stalled out or kicked down as they entered into their 50s , unlike their male counterparts ' , whose really went up ' ' , she told Warner .
And no doubt that is very true .
But is cosmetic surgery really the answer ?
And are women really the problem ?
This issue is hot in the US right now because the massive health care reform bill currently before Congress includes a 5 per cent excise tax on cosmetic surgery and ' ' related procedures ' ' .
It 's been dubbed the ' ' Bo - Tax ' ' .
O'Neill is arguing against it because she says it hits middle - aged women hardest : which it no doubt does .
But her claim that cosmetic surgery is not a luxury , but rather a modern day necessity is where she comes unstuck .
Her argument that it's up to women to nip , tuck and enhance themselves as much as they can afford , because ' ' we live in a society that punishes women for getting older ' ' , is where her particular brand of feminism not only falls apart , but shatters with contradiction .
As president of NOW , surely O'Neill is aware of her own organisation 's '' Love Your Body ' ' campaign ?
In its website blurb women are told how dreadful it is that Hollywood and the fashion , diet and cosmetic industries '' make each of us believe that our bodies are unacceptable and need constant improvement ' ' .
The campaign calls on women to rally and '' together we can fight back ' ' .
So , where 's the ' ' fight back ' ' in encouraging middle - aged women to believe that the battle has been lost , and their best weapon of defence is the cosmetic surgeon 's scalpel , or the beautician 's syringe ?
There is no doubt cosmetic surgery is no longer an '' if ' ' but a '' when ' ' proposition for many women .
And as a dull '' sameness ' ' pervades celebrity circles , where it 's getting increasingly harder to tell one puffed lip and expressionless brow from the other , perhaps it just does n't matter .
Perhaps it 's just an exercise in choice .
But where is the feminist scrutiny of that choice ?
What hope is there of women receiving any respect and admiration for the wisdom and maturity they 've achieved by middle - age , if even NOW is telling them they 're old hags ?
Ironically the NOW '' Love Your Body ' campaign appears aimed at girls and young women , rather than those in their 40s , 50s or beyond .
And yet it's that older demographic most at risk of being socially sidelined and rendered invisible .

Is the rally over ?
Not at all !
The world ’s bankers say the economy is recovering .
Investors believe them ; they ’re bidding up stocks .
The Dow rose 155 points on Friday .
And today , stocks are rising in Asia .
Oil is over $ 74 .
Gold rose $ 13 on Friday to close at $ 954 .
And the dollar is killing us softly sinking to $ 1.43 per euro on Friday .
Stocks and oil are at their highest levels so far this year .
With such profits at hand people figure they do n’t need the dollar .
Investors run to the safety of the greenback when financial storms approach .
But now they think it will be clear sailing .
 Worlds bankers suggest rebound may be under way ,  says a headline at The New York Times .
Is the world economy really recovering ?
Should you buy stocks now to take advantage of this new bull market ?
You already know the answer , dear reader .
After a fall comes a bounce .
And along with the bounce come a lot of silly ideas .
You see how it works ?
 Markets make opinions ,  say the old timers on Wall Street .
When stocks are going up investors find reasons why they are going up .
Pretty soon , they ’ve convinced themselves that they ’ll go up forever .
Financial Reckoning Da ... Addison Wiggin , Will B ... Best Price : $ 2.36 Buy New $ 2.49 ( as of 04:30 EST - Details )
But bounces do not last forever .
They are n’t giant turtles they ’re moths .
After a few months of flitting around bright lights , they dry up .
When exactly this summer of winged love will end , we do n’t know .
September or October is our guess .
But we have little doubt it will come to an end soon .
Ultimately , stock prices depend on earnings .
People compare the rate of return they can get from stocks to what they can get from other investments .
Rising earnings signal higher rates of return , so investors pay more .
During the great credit expansion of 1945 — 2007 , businesses could anticipate , generally , rising earnings .
People were buying more and more things on credit .
In a national economy , businesses pay wages and then the employees use the wages to buy products .
The wages are a u201 Ccostu201D to the business but they are also the source of business revenue .
When sales come from credit , on the other hand , businesses have the revenue but no wage cost .
Profits go up .
Now , the cycle has turned .
Businesses still have the wage cost .
But instead of using the money to buy things , the employee uses it to repay loans for purchases made last year or the year before .
Now the business has the cost but not the revenue .
As they say in the economic textbooks : bummer .
The process of de-leveraging will be slow .
Maybe five years .
Maybe 15 . Maybe 25 .
It will go up and down with high unemployment ( businesses will cut their wage costs as sales fail to recover ) low prices ( at least in real terms ) low profits and slow growth , or none at all .
Is that bad ?
No , not at all .
It ’s good .
Economies need to adjust to the new realities of the post - credit bubble world .
It will take time .
And with the world ’s financial authorities fighting it every step of the way it could take a LONG time .
As we ’ve explained in these daily reckonings , government is a profoundly conservative , parasite - protecting enterprise .
It cannot draw forth the future — it has no idea what the future will be .
Instead , all it can do is to try to recover the past .
That ’s the idea of the u201 Crecovery u201D to try to coddle , protect and pay - off yesterday ’s success stories .
From Wall Street to welfare governments attempt to prevent correction .
Of course , it makes sense .
Government ’s only real function is providing protection and order .
What can it protect ?
Only what is not what is to be .
And so the feds try to forestall and prevent the future from ever happening .
Will they succeed ?
Of course not .
The future will happen whether they like it or not .
They ca n’t stop it .
The future will come .
But they can still make a mess of it .
The Obama administration announced that it expects $ 9 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years .
One of the great mysteries of our time is : where will the money come from ?
As we pointed out last week , even if every dollar of US savings is applied to the task , the feds will still be short .
And if they make up the difference with funny money — from their quantitative easing scam — the Chinese vigilantes are likely to get cheesed off and dump their US Treasury bonds .
The evidence shows that the Chinese and other Asians are already trying to lighten up on their US debt holdings .
This from The New York Times :
Meltdown : A Free - Marke ...
Thomas E. Woods Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 20.00 ( as of 02:20 EST - Details )
 Figures released by the Treasury Department this week indicated that China reduced its holdings of Treasury securities by $ 25 billion in June , the most China had ever sold in a month .
 Monthly figures can be volatile , and can be revised , so it is risky to draw conclusions from one month ’s data .
In May , China increased its holdings by $ 38 billion , according to the Treasury figures .
 Nonetheless , the decline highlighted a fact Asia ’s appetite for Treasury securities is not growing as fast as it once did .
That means the United States will have to turn to other buyers , including American citizens , who are now saving as they did not do during the boom years , to finance the deficits
In the first half of 2009 , China and Hong Kong acquired only 9 percent of the more than $ 800 billion worth of Treasuries that were sold .
 Japan , which was replaced by China as the largest foreign holder of Treasuries last year , has been a larger buyer this year , taking up 11 percent of the new supply of Treasuries .
 Ownership of US Treasuries by China , Hong Kong , Japan , South Korea , Singapore , Taiwan and Thailand — since 1994 — rose to 25 percent , from less than 8 percent .
Since then , as budget deficits in the United States grew , the share has fluctuated within a narrow range .
In June , it was 24.7 percent . 
If Asians do n’t finance US debts , who will ?
We do n’t know But the fewer bonds Asians buy the more they are bought with funny money by the Fed .
And the more the Fed buys with funny money the fewer Asians want to buy with real money .
How will this end ?
Badly we keep saying .
There is no way out .
Either the feds cease spending more than they can raise honestly , by taxation and reasonable borrowing .
Or , the system runs into chronic , megadeficits like the chronic deficits in the private sector during the bubble years .
Then , it blows up .
That is why we caution readers against the dollar and against Treasuries .
Most likely , they will both go up this autumn as investors flee to safety from the next market downturn .
But the chances of them blowing up completely are too great .
That ’s why we stick with gold — even though we would not at all be surprised by a period of weakness in the gold market .

PARIS  The Dutch financial services group ING , which came close to collapse last year , said Friday that it would repay half of the 10 billion euros , or $ 14.6 billion , provided by the government during the height of the financial crisis .
The bank joins other lenders in Europe and the United States , like UBS of Switzerland and Bank of America , in repaying at least some government funds earlier than had been expected .
The Dutch state provided the funds to ING in October 2008 by purchasing nonvoting preferred shares .
ING also received state guarantees for 21.6 billion euros ( $ 31.8 billion ) worth of assets related to mortgages in the United States this year .
The repayment , planned for later this month , is part of ING ’s efforts to reinvent itself as a better - focused financial business .
Under pressure from European authorities , it is planning to divest itself of its insurance operations and sell its asset management operations .
In the aftermath of the failed Christmas day plane bombing , in which the alleged bomber set himself on fire before being subdued by unarmed passengers , every Republican politician in sight has become Dick Cheney .
Appearing on MSNBC's Morning Joe breakfast show yesterday , former Republican presidential contender Pat Buchanan argued that the alleged bomber , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , should be denied pain medication for his burns as a part of " hostile interrogation . "
" I 'm not arguing for torture , " Buchanan said with a straight face .
As Spencer Ackerman , a senior reporter with the Washington Independent who was appearing opposite Buchanan , pointed out : " You 're arguing for torture but with a different euphemism for it . "
Denying someone treatment is n't merely a matter of comfort – it can also affect survival rates .
Furthermore , Buchanan 's recommendation , that American authorities deliberately cause Abdulmutallab pain in order to extract information , is a textbook definition of torture .
In some ways , the GOP 's reaction is transparently partisan .
Despite all the shrieking over treating the alleged bomber as a criminal , Republicans did n't believe that it was a threat to democracy when the Bush administration tried Abdulmutallab 's predecessor , the shoe bomber Richard Reid , in a civilian court .
Nevertheless , Buchanan has n't been the only Republican arguing for a return to inhumane lawlessness in the aftermath of the failed attack .
Appearing on CNN , supposedly moderate Republican Tom Ridge said of Abdulmutallab : " He 's a terrorist , and I do n't think he deserves the full range of protections of our criminal justice system embodied in the constitution of the United States . "
Over at the National Review , former Bush speechwriter Marc Thiessen – who once arguedthat torturing suspected terrorists who have n't been convicted of anything was necessary because of their religion – declared that the US " no longer " interrogates terror suspects .
Back when the Bush administration was claiming that " the United States does n't torture , " Republicans were in the difficult position of rationalising torture techniques through the euphemism of " enhanced interrogation techniques " .
Now that Obama is in office , Republicans can revel fully in their embrace of torture – and the GOP has chosen the failed underwear bomber as its latest battlefield .
The strategy has the short - term benefit of making the president look weak on national security , with the long term benefit of using public opinion to insulate former Bush administration officials from the potential legal consequences of breaking domestic and international laws against torture .
There 's also the base emotional appeal of exacting revenge against the bad guys .
The bureaucratic errors that led to Abdulmutallab being able to board a plane bound for the US would not have been solved by waterboarding .
The GOP 's faith in torture is misplaced .
Not only is Abdulmutallab reportedly co-operating with authorities – despite being held as a criminal rather than a soldier – but the most experienced interrogators in the country work for the FBI , not the CIA .
Those interrogators have been emphatic in warning that torture does n't work .
It 's not just that it 's illegal .
It 's not just that torture produces faulty information , with the victims saying whatever they think is necessary to make the treatment stop .
It 's also that it is a strategic disaster for the US , drawing sympathy to terrorist groups and swelling their ranks , placing American civilians and servicemen captured abroad at risk of the same treatment , undermining strategic cooperation with other nations , and making the future prosecution of terrorist suspects impossible .
For all these reasons , General David Petraeus has said torture is " neither useful nor necessary . "
Sadly , the Democrats assumed their usual position of learned helplessness in the face of a sustained assault on the president by the torture wing of the Republican party .
Ironically , other than encouraging Americans to panic every time a terror attack is foiled , torture is virtually the only national security policy that the Obama administration has failed to adopt from its predecessors .
Its copious use of the state secrets doctrine to block court scrutiny of torture , for example , is paving the way for torture to be resurrected as US policy if and when the GOP retakes the White House .
The Republican assault on the president is a transparently political one , and it has gone for the most part unanswered – which makes a return to torture all the more likely .
Al - Qaida will never defeat the US militarily .
There will be no Islamic Caliphate in the US .
They can only hope to warp our society by forcing us to abandon our values and democratic institutions through fear .
As Salon blogger Glenn Greenwald has pointed out , what the GOP is counselling is n't toughness .
It 's surrender .

With a very personal and caring approach , I provide solutions to all clients with Sonoma County interests in disputes involving income and property arrangements in the family , trust & estates , and business settings .
Steorn is back , and it is still hawking its perpetual - motion machine , the Orbo .
We spent several carefree days back in the summer of 2007 ridiculing the whole project , which purported to use spinning wheels and magnets to generate more electricity than the little Orbo took to run .
Now , the Orbo has relaunched .
Ireland - based Steorn ’s CEO , Sean McCarthy , explains the mechanics behind the machine , which exploits a magnetic anomaly discovered “ during the course of developing another technology ” .
“ The anomaly is that we could gain power from magnets with no apparent source ” [ emphasis added ] .
No apparent source .
Perhaps there is a man behind the curtain ?
If you want to see the Orbo in action , it is now being demonstrated at the Waterways Centre in Dublin , and can also be viewed on a live stream .
This is at least a step further than Steorn managed last time , when six sets of precision watch bearings , designed to last 25 years , all broke at the same time due to “ hot lights ” .
So how does the Orbo work ?
The device is a simple motor — a battery is connected to magnetic coils which then exert a turning force on the magnets in an internal wheel .
On top is a generator which feeds a rectified current back into the battery .
If those bearings hold up , the Orbo should run forever , and should also power other devices hooked up to it .
The trick is “ time variant magnetic interactions ” , which make it possible to “ contravene the principle of the conservation of energy ” .
This appears to be something like the Flux Capacitor , which as we all know is “ what makes time travel possible ” .
Poor Orbo .
We tease , but we love your plucky never - say - die attitude .
If your gadget turns out to truly be a world - changing , free - energy machine , then we ’ll happily hook up our laptops to one of your magic spinning - wheels .
We have a feeling , though , that this snake - oil may just be another publicity stunt .
A stunt we just keep falling for , again and again , perpetually .

The White House warned political foes Sunday not to provoke a partisan tug of war over terrorism , with President Barack Obama yet to publicly address the thwarted attack on a US airliner .
A political storm erupted over the attempt by a 23 - year - old Nigerian to bring down a Northwest jet carrying 290 people , as senior Obama aides cranked up a sweeping national and homeland security operation .

But the president , vacationing in Hawaii , conspicuously has not commented on television about the Christmas Day drama , apparently seeking to project calm and avoid the political trauma and panic unleashed by past terror incidents .
“ The president believes strongly that this has to be a non-partisan issue , ” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told NBC in one of a string of television appearances he and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano made Sunday .
“ This should not be a tug of war between the two political parties .
I hope everyone will resolve in the New Year to make protecting our nation non-partisan — rather than what happens in Washington , devolving into politics , ” he said .
Obama got a 6 am ( 1600 GMT ) briefing on latest developments in the probe into the airborne terror bid from top national security aides , the White House said in the latest regular bulletin on his response to the crisis .
Gibbs also said that Obama ordered a review of US no -fly watch - lists and demanded information on how a suspected radical could board the Detroit - bound airliner rigged with explosives .

After his security briefing , Obama headed to the gym for a game of pick - up basketball , as the native son recharged in balmy Hawaii .
But the president ’s Republican foes made the first political thrusts following Thursday ’s attack on a Northwest jet heading to Detroit , accusing him of softening the US focus on radical Islamic terror threats .
They also questioned Napolitano ’s statement that the air security system “ worked , ” referring to the fact that alert passengers and crew jumped Nigerian suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab before his device could fully detonate .

New York Congressman Peter King said there was no need for Obama to “ rush for a microphone ” but noted the president ’s media ubiquity over the past year and asked him for a “ calm , reassuring ” pep talk .
“ Tell the American people , ‘ this is what we ’re doing ; we ’re on top of this ; we ’re going to win , but this is a reminder of why we always have to be alert to the evils of Islamic terrorism , ' ” King told CBS .

“ There has been a virtual vacuum for the last day - and - a - half . ”
The White House countered that Obama has constantly monitored the situation , ordered probes into airline security and the use of intelligence and hiked airport precautions .
“ The president refuses to play politics with these issues as he said at West Point ( in December ) .
We must put aside petty politics and recapture the unity that we had after 9/11 , ” said another Obama spokesman , Bill Burton in Hawaii .

Democrats repeatedly accused ex-president George W. Bush ’s administration of exploiting terror scares for political gain .
But Republicans leveraged Thursday ’s drama to bolster their theme that Obama ’s policies , including reaching out to the Muslim world and closing the Guantanamo Bay terror camp , were making Americans less safe .
“ This whole thing should remind us , that the soft talk about engagement , closing Gitmo — these things are not going to appease the terrorists , ” said South Carolina Republican Senator Jim DeMint on Fox .
“ They ’re going to keep coming after us . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Republican congressman Pete Hoekstra added “ What do we have here ?
this is an international movement of radicalization .
“ The Obama administration came in and said , ‘ We ’re not going to use the word terrorism anymore ’ … trying to , you know , I think , downplay the threat from terrorism . ”
Obama aides have been less prone to use the phrase “ war on terror ” than the previous White House , but insist they have refocused the US anti-terror fight .
“ The president certainly has taken steps in his time in office to re-orient our priorities as it comes to fighting that war on terror , ” Gibbs said .

“ We are drawing down in Iraq and focusing … on Pakistan and Afghanistan , the place where the attacks of 9/11 originated , ” and also focusing on Yemen and Somalia , he added .
Chinese Farmers Sell Blood To Make Ends Meet
According to news sources , many farmers in Central China ’s Hubei Province are so poor that they have been selling their blood regularly in order to meet their financial responsibilities .
During the last 11 years , almost 20,000 people have sold their blood for $ 25 a pop to the blood plasma collection station authorized by the local health bureau in Yunxian county .
Sadly , more than 6,000 farmers claim that selling blood is the only way the can earn enough to pay their bills .
Usually , it ’s 600 ccs at a time every two weeks , and the money earned is considered a “ nutrition and traffic subsidy , ” according to officials .
According to the central government that has done little to alleviate the plight of its destitute citizenry , this province of China , which is located along the Han River , has been considered one of the poorest areas in the country for decades .
For one couple , Gao Congfen and her husband , their son ’s middle school and university education could n’t have been provided for without the money they have gotten since the year 2000 from selling their blood .
Another 53 year - old woman named Zhou Wenfen , began selling her blood some two years ago when her three - year - old grandson was diagnosed with aplastic anemia .
For her , the donation process involves an arduous journey that begins at 4 am ; first one hour climbing a mountain , and then four hours traveling by boat down the Han River .
She arrives at the blood collection station about noon .
“ I have no other choice .
I just want to get more money for my grandson for whom we have spent nearly half a million yuan in medical bills , ” said Zhou .
Li Guangcheng , former deputy director of the county health bureau , established the station back in 1998 , and every year since , they receive about 60 , 000 packages of donated blood for which donors are paid some 10 million yuan ( about 1.5 million US dollars ) in total .
“ The station ’s establishment and management including the subsidy are all in accordance with relevant laws and standards …
We cannot forbid farmers from donating blood only because they come here for the subsidy , ” said a blood plasma station official named Chen .
A sad state of affairs for China ’s poverty - stricken .
One can only wonder :
Who will give them blood should it be needed ?

The Year That Changed the World : The Untold Story Behind the Fall of the Berlin Wall , by Michael Meyer , New York : Scribner , 272 pages , $ 26
The Rebellion of Ronald Reagan : A History of the End of the Cold War , by James Mann , New York : Viking , 416 pages , $ 27.95
We do n't know the exact hierarchy of motives , but it is certain that Chris Gueffroy was willing to leave his family and friends to avoid conscription into the army .
Considering the associated risks , it 's likely that the 20 - year - old was also strongly motivated to escape the stultifying sameness , the needless poverty , the cultural black hole that was his homeland .
In his passport photo , he wore a small hoop earring , an act of nonconformity in a country that prized conformity above all else .
But Gueffroy 's passport was yet another worthless possession , for he had the great misfortune of being born into a walled nation , a country that brutally enforced a ban on travel to " nonfraternal " states .
On February 6 , 1989 , Gueffroy and a friend attempted to escape from East Berlin by scaling die Mauer — the wall that separated communist east from capitalist west .
They did n't make it far .
After tripping an alarm , Gueffroy was shot 10 times by border guards and died instantly .
His accomplice was shot in the foot but survived , only to be put on trial and sentenced to three years in prison for " attempted illegal border - crossing in the first degree . "
Twenty years ago this month , and nine months after the murder of Gueffroy , the Berlin Wall , that monument to the barbarism of the Soviet experiment , was finally breached .
The countries held captive by Moscow began their long road to economic and cultural recovery , and to reunification with liberal Europe .
But in the West , where Cold War divisions defined politics and society for 40 years , the moment was not greeted as a welcome opportunity for intellectual reconciliation , for fact - checking decades of exaggerations and misperceptions .
Instead , then as now , despite the overwhelming volume of new data and the exhilaration of hundreds of millions finding freedom , the battle to control the Cold War narrative raged on unabated .
Reagan haters and Reagan hagiographers , Sovietophiles and anti-communists , isolationists and Atlanticists , digested this massive moment in history , then carried on as if nothing much had changed .
A new flurry of books timed to coincide with the 20th anniversary of communism 's collapse reinforces the point that the Cold War will never truly be settled by the side that won .
It is bizarre to revisit pre-1989 journalism and punditry on Soviet communism .
The suffering of the bit players , those pitiable citizens stranded behind the Iron Curtain , was largely ignored in favor of larger political goals .
If Ronald Reagan believed the Kremlin to be the beating heart of an " evil empire , " many of his angriest critics believed , then Moscow could n't be all bad .
Writing in The Nation in 1984 , historian Stephen F. Cohen hissed that , in a perfect world , " fairness would not allow us to defame a nation that has suffered and achieved so much . "
Although uniformly anti-Soviet , some conservatives too were guilty of a Cold War–induced moral blindness , defending authoritarian governments in Africa , Latin America , Asia , and Iberia as bulwarks against communist expansion .
Columnist Pat Buchanan celebrated the authoritarian leaders Augusto Pinochet of Chile and Francisco Franco of Spain as " soldier - patriots " and referred quaintly to the racist regime in South Africa as the " Boer Republic . "
Others accused America 's most anti-Soviet president of impuissance .
As early as 1983 , neoconservative writer Norman Podhoretz proclaimed that Reagan 's policies toward the Soviet Union amounted to " appeasement by any other name . "
When the whole rotten experiment suddenly failed , eventually bringing to an end not just Moscow 's Warsaw Pact client governments but the proxy civil wars it fought in the Third World , instead of engaging in overdue self - criticism many commentators clung to shopworn shibboleths .
In 1990 the academic Peter Marcuse , also writing in The Nation , bizarrely claimed that East Germany " had never sent dissidents to gulags and rarely to jail " and expressed outrage that the " goal of the German authorities is the simple integration of East into West without reflection , " instead of heeding the pleas of the intellectual class who were at work on a more humane , less Russian brand of socialism .
The weeks and months following the fall of the Wall saw relentless worries , from left and right , about the corrosive influence of Western capitalism , consumerism , and commercial television on the untainted comrades of the Ost .
The " prospect of rampant consumerism , " CBS News reported in July 1990 , " has East Germany 's newly elected Christian Democratic Prime Minister , Lother De Mozier , worried . "
By 1993 Ukrainian National Self Defense , a right - wing populist movement that loathed Russian power , was rallying against the " Americanization of Ukraine through Coca - Cola culture . "
Even the famously anti-communist Pope John Paul II warned that " the Western countries run the risk of seeing this collapse of Communism as a one - sided victory of their own economic system , and thereby failing to make necessary corrections in that system . "
When the " shock " of capitalism did n't jump - start the moribund economies of the East within a calendar year , many in the Western news media declared the entire project dead on arrival .
In 1990 ABC Evening News told viewers that East Germany was already a " victim of an overdose of capitalism . "
In Southeast Poland , CBS reported , " the transition from communism to capitalism is making more people more miserable every day . "
Every new election , even in firmly Western - oriented countries such as Hungary and Poland , was greeted with scare stories about backsliding into communism , lurching into neo -Nazism , or both .
Even some of the early 20th - anniversary retrospectives last summer trotted out the same familiar story lines , exponential gains in freedom and prosperity notwithstanding .
With the proliferation of " Old Hopes Replaced by New Fears " stories , the long - running intellectual battle over the Cold War retreated into the halls of academia , where the newly ( and , it turned out , briefly ) opened Soviet archives further undermined the accepted narratives about Alger Hiss , Julius and Ethel Rosenberg , I.F. Stone , and scores of other causes célèbres of the anti-anti-communists .
Western intellectuals were more interested in Francis Fuku - yama 's contention that we were witnessing " the end of history " than in who was most responsible for bringing that history to an alleged close .
But when that debate began to revive , it took up right where it left off in the 1980s : at the feet of the decade 's most controversial figure , Ronald Reagan .
To his legion of critics , Reagan was an unalloyed Cold Warrior , recklessly dragging America toward the precipice of nuclear confrontation and taking the credit that rightfully belonged to reform Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev .
This school of interpretation was influential enough that the anti-communist commentator Arnold Beichman , writing in Policy Review in 2002 , accused liberal academics and pundits of " trying to write President Reagan out of history . "
But after the Berlin Wall fell , the pendulum swung the other way .
Reagan 's loyal foot soldiers have persistently argued , with some degree of success , that the inspirational rhetoric of the 40th president , in the words of Margaret Thatcher , " won the Cold War without firing a shot . "
No phrase is more associated with Reagan 's presidency — and his lifelong crusade against communism — than his 1987 exhortation that Gorbachev , if he really believed in freedom , would come to Berlin and " tear down this wall . "
Reagan 's national security adviser , Colin Powell , thought the line needlessly provocative ; the State Department cautioned against " condemn[ing ] the East too harshly . "
The day after the speech , which would become Reagan 's most famous , Washington Post foreign policy columnist Jim Hoagland derided it as a " meaningless taunt " that history would surely ignore .
Reagan 's acolytes , on the other hand , would strenuously argue that the speech was , if not directly responsible for the events of November 1989 , at the very least helpful and prescient .
Neither of these readings is accurate , argues journalist James Mann in The Rebellion of Ronald Reagan : A History of the End of the Cold War .
While the Gipper loathed Soviet totalitarianism — his aide Ken Adelman commented that it was the " only thing he actually hated " — Reagan was , Mann argues , a pragmatist who rejected the more belligerent figures in the Republican foreign policy establishment and helped enable Gorbachev 's reforms through engagement , not confrontation .
That Reagan was more dovish than his contemporary critics would allow is n't a particularly radical argument , having been made previously by historians Paul Lettow and John Patrick Diggins and by former Reagan official Jack Matlock .
And it is no longer controversial to claim , as Mann does , that Reagan was driven to the bargaining table by a combination of a deeply held revulsion for nuclear weapons and a gut instinct that Gorbachev was a different type of Soviet leader , a man Thatcher believed the West " could do business with . "
While Reagan supporters often provide a simple narrative of the Soviet Union 's collapse in which resolve alone won the Cold War , Mann 's attempt at balancing the historical record leads him to ignore evidence that might muddle his thesis .
For instance , he gives short shrift to the financial costs of Reagan 's economic warfare — from the arms race to the embargo of the Soviet gas pipeline — that , according to Russian estimates , sucked billions out of the Soviet economy .
Instead , he writes , it was " Reagan 's willingness to do business with Gorbachev that gave the Soviet leader the time and space he needed to demolish the Soviet system . "
But were it not for the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl , the American - funded anti-Soviet insurgency in Afghanistan , and a withering economy — events not seriously engaged by Mann — would Gorbachev have chosen the path of radical reform ?
The author of perestroika privately acknowledged that , unless concessions were made to Reagan , the Soviet Union would " lose because right now we are already at the end of our tether . "
And Mann comments , in passing , that Gorbachev was " eager , if not desperate … to work out agreements that would limit Soviet military spending . "
As historian Christopher Andrews and former KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin wrote in The World Was Going Our Way , their accounting of Soviet operations in the Third World , Gorbachev inherited , and for a time continued , the " ruinously expensive flow of arms and military hardware to Afghanistan , Nicaragua , Vietnam , Syria , South Yemen , Ethiopia , Angola , Algeria , and elsewhere . "
The idea that Reagan 's Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI , or " Star Wars , " as it was derisively known ) single - handedly bankrupted the Soviets , as commonly presented by the president 's most partisan defenders , is , as Mann argues , almost certainly wrong .
But it was n't just the conservatives at Human Events who believed the SDI narrative .
After the collapse of the Soviet Union , the dissident author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn maintained that " the Cold War was essentially won by Ronald Reagan when he embarked on the Star Wars program and the Soviet Union understood that it could not take this next step . "
Gen. Nikolay Detinov , a high - ranking Red Army official and member of Soviet arms control delegations , admitted that " the American defense spending increase , SDI , and other defense programs greatly troubled the Soviet leadership . "
But it did n't necessarily bankrupt them .
Recent disclosures from Russian archives suggest that Soviet defense spending , which the CIA could only roughly estimate at the time ( only four members of the Kremlin 's inner sanctum reportedly knew the true numbers ) , did not increase significantly in response to SDI .
This was perhaps because the system , so battered by the time Gorbachev took the reins of power , simply did n't have the money .
Mann is surely correct that Reagan 's instincts " were much closer to the truth than were those of his conservative critics . "
And he is also right that , contra those same conservatives , Gorbachev too deserves tremendous credit for opening , and therefore destroying , the Soviet system .
But as Henry Kissinger — himself a fierce critic of engagement with Gorbachev at the time — later observed , the Soviet empire may have disintegrated on President George H.W. Bush 's watch , but " it was Ronald Reagan 's presidency which marked the turning point . "
Mann writes that there is " no reason to think " Reagan opposed nuclear weapons upon entering the White House , putting the starting date of his conversion to antinuclearism at " late 1983 . "
But Reagan expressed a deep dislike of nuclear weapons long before his presidency , a fact well - documented by historian Paul Lettow , and there is an obvious continuity between his liberal activism in Hollywood , during which he agitated against atomic warfare , and the 1986 Reykjavik summit with Gorbachev where , to the horror of his advisers , Reagan nearly surrendered America 's entire nuclear arsenal .
Michael Deaver , who worked for Reagan during his tenure as both California governor and president , later said that " even in those early years …he would say , ' That 's our goal .
We want to get rid of them altogether . ' ? "
The details of the Cold War are still disputed enough that a market exists for books claiming to hold the new key that unlocks the truth .
Michael Meyer , a former correspondent for Newsweek and current flack for United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , covered Germany and Eastern Europe during the waning years of the Cold War .
In The Year That Changed the World : The Untold Story Behind the Fall of the Berlin Wall , Meyer declares that his is the " largely unknown " account of the Cold War 's end , finally " shorn of mythology . "
Meyer offers a combative , journalistic rendering of the events of 1989 , bookended with warnings that the triumphalist ( read : Reaganite ) reading of the Cold War was " tragically costly , " because " it was a straight line from the fantasy of Cold War victory to the invasion of Iraq . "
This might be a unique , if unconvincing , theory of the Cold War 's ultimate costs , but contrary to the book 's subtitle there is little , if any , information here that makes for an " untold story . "
Nor is it easy to take The Year That Changed the World seriously when it is threaded with so many factual mistakes and dubious claims .
Meyer asserts that the great post - communist film The Lives of Others , which dramatizes Stasi surveillance , is an example of Ostalgie ( nostalgia for the East ) , when in fact Ostalgie was its target .
Yuri Andropov , contrary to Meyer 's claim , certainly did not see substantial " flaws in the Soviet system . "
It is risible to call East German novelist ( and , it turned out , former Stasi collaborator ) Christa Wolf a " dissident . "
Gorbachev 's book Perestroika is hardly the " ultimate indictment of communism , " considering Gorbachev 's admonition that the world " must learn from Lenin " and keep on celebrating the October Revolution .
The famous Berlin Wall mural of two Communist leaders kissing , skillfully used by the Hungarian opposition party Fidesz , is of East German President Erich Honecker and Leonid Brezhnev , not Honecker and Gorbachev .
The opposition movements in Hungary and Czechoslovakia were hardly " nonexistent . "
There are larger errors too .
Meyer is right that President George H.W. Bush was often disengaged from the world - changing events unfolding in Eastern Europe , but he mangles the truth in making this point .
While ignoring Bush 's shameful address in Kiev warning Ukrainians against independence ( famously dubbed his " Chicken Kiev " speech by New York Times columnist William Safire ) , Meyer instead oddly mocks Bush 's 1990 visit to Poland , when " at a reception in Warsaw , he regaled guests with a list of Polish baseball ' greats ' … Stan Musial , Tony Kubek , Phil Niekro . "
Meyer adds that " as they followed the president around Warsaw and Gdansk , many reporters wondered whether he was fully in touch .
Baseball greats ? "
What Meyer neglects to mention , besides any detail of the backroom diplomacy behind the trip , was that Bush 's " reception " was a brief stop to visit 30 kids inaugurating Poland 's first - ever chapter of Little League Baseball .
Meyer is exercised by the onerous Cold War " myths " that we all cling to , yet he never engages or identifies those who supposedly propagate them .
He rightly denounces the America - centric view of Cold War history but barely mentions the pivotal role played by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in reunification .
France 's Francois Mitterand , Great Britain 's Thatcher , and Pope John Paul II are similarly absent from the narrative .
( As Polish dissident writer Adam Michnik later observed , " It will be a long time before anyone fully comprehends the ramifications of [ the Pope 's ] nine - day visit " to occupied Poland in 1979 . )
In place of the old myths , Meyer erects new ones : " For all the problems they faced … most East Germans had no desire to leave their country , " he insists , " contrary to the impression fostered in the West .
Many if not most were perfectly comfortable with the socialist system that guaranteed them work , low - cost housing and free lifelong health care and schooling . "
There is no source for this fantastical claim .
That a certain measure of nostalgia for the East German dictatorship exists from a distance of 20 years is undeniable , but an opinion poll taken in 1990 showed that 91 percent of East Germans favored unification and , by definition , the dissolution of the " worker 's state . "
When a free election was finally held in Poland , Meyer writes , " Here and there , a fair - minded minded few appreciated that communists such as General Czeslaw Kiszczak and others had made [ elections ] possible . "
In Meyer 's view , totalitarians deserve praise because , abandoned by Moscow , they ultimately buckled to mounting pressure from the independent trade union Solidarity .
In essence , he is asking the abducted to thank their captors for allowing them to go free .
Most Poles likely had feelings closer to those of Adam Michnik , who in 1983 wrote a letter to Kiszczak calling him a " disgrace to the nation and a traitor to the Motherland " and a " dishonorable swine . "
In his epilogue , with its digressions on the second Iraq war , Meyer flagellates himself for a post - 1989 article he wrote that had a " triumphalist tone , " and he urges readers to ponder the wisdom of a Lewis Carroll metaphor : " The world is always partly a mirror of ourselves . "
As Meyer explains , " We see all things , enemies especially , through the lens of our own hopes and fears and desires , inevitably distorted . "
One wonders if Meyer believes the Soviet Union — responsible for the forced starvation of Ukrainians in the 1930s and for Stalin 's bloody purge trials , to name just two of countless atrocities — deserves that notoriously crude yet ultimately accurate label , " evil empire . "
Reagan , of course , had his flaws , as voluminously documented by scholars , enemies , and sympathizers alike .
But Gorbachev , Time 's " Man of the Decade " for the 1980s ( unlike Reagan ) and a Nobel Peace Prize winner ( unlike Reagan ) , often escapes similar scrutiny .
Meyer is more interested in score settling , pointing out that many hard - liners in the Reagan and Bush administrations , several of whom later joined George W. Bush 's administration , misjudged Gorbachev 's seriousness .
Gorbachev 's economic reforms were vague and ad hoc , and they wound up being tremendous failures .
His chief foreign policy aide , Anatoly Chernyaev , grumbled during glasnost that Gorbachev " has no concept of where we are going .
His declaration about socialist values , the ideals of October , as he begins to tick them off , sound like irony to the cognoscenti .
Behind them — emptiness . "
As historian Robert Service has observed , Gorbachev intended glasnost as " a renaissance of Leninist ideals , " while his books " still equivocated on Stalin . "
He avoided repeats of 1956 and 1968 , when the Soviet military ruthlessly cracked down on its restive satellites , but did send troops to murder residents of Vilnius , Tblisi , and Baku .
As Mary Elise Sarotte observes in her new book 1989 : The Struggle to Create Post - Cold War Europe , Gorbachev " had not sought to introduce completely democratic politics into the Soviet Union . "
Both Mann and Meyer are correct that without Gorbachev , the end of the Cold War would n't have arrived so quickly .
And Vaclav Havel is surely right when he argues that Gorbachev 's " historical achievement is enormous : communism would have collapsed without him anyway , but it might have happened 10 years later , and in God knows how wild and bloody a fashion . "
But Mann 's case is convincing that the man of the decade , the great peace laureate , destroyed the Soviet Union " unintentionally , " not as an expression of any democratic desires .
It is difficult to accept heroic portrayals of those who were complicit in the mass enslavement and murder of their unwilling subjects .
The Soviet Union 's leaders , out of at least partial desperation , opened the door to democracy a crack , and their restless captives barged right through .
On the other side they found VHS players , compact discs , supermarkets overflowing with fresh produce , press freedom , the hurly - burly of markets , multiparty democracy — and an army of fallible historians , journalists , politicians , and pundits , all desperate to prove that they had been right all along .

In taking the identity theory ( in its various forms ) as a species of physicalism , I should say that this is an ontological , not a translational physicalism .
It would be absurd to try to translate sentences containing the word ‘ brain ’ or the word ‘ sensation ’ into sentences about electrons , protons and so on .
Nor can we so translate sentences containing the word ‘ tree ’ .
After all ‘ tree ’ is largely learned ostensively , and is not even part of botanical classification .
If we were small enough a dandelion might count as a tree .
Nevertheless a physicalist could say that trees are complicated physical mechanisms .
The physicalist will deny strong emergence in the sense of some philosophers , such as Samuel Alexander and possibly C.D. Broad .
The latter remarked ( Broad 1937 ) that as far as was known at that time the properties of common salt cannot be deduced from the properties of sodium in isolation and of chlorine in isolation .
( He put it too epistemologically : chaos theory shows that even in a deterministic theory physical consequences can outrun predictability . )
Of course the physicalist will not deny the harmless sense of " emergence " in which an apparatus is not just a jumble of its parts ( Smart 1981 ) .
Some philosophers hold that though experiences are brain processes they nevertheless have fundamentally non-physical , psychical , properties , sometimes called ‘ qualia ’ .
Here I shall take the identity theory as denying the existence of such irreducible non-physical properties .
Some identity theorists give a behaviouristic analysis of mental states , such as beliefs and desires , but others , sometimes called ‘ central state materialists ’ , say that mental states are actual brain states .
Identity theorists often describe themselves as ‘ materialists ’ but ‘ physicalists ’ may be a better word .
That is , one might be a materialist about mind but nevertheless hold that there are entities referred to in physics that are not happily described as ‘ material ’ .
The identity theory of mind holds that states and processes of the mind are identical to states and processes of the brain .
Strictly speaking , it need not hold that the mind is identical to the brain .
Idiomatically we do use ‘ She has a good mind ’ and ‘ She has a good brain ’ interchangeably but we would hardly say ‘ Her mind weighs fifty ounces ’ .
Here I take identifying mind and brain as being a matter of identifying processes and perhaps states of the mind and brain .
Consider an experience of pain , or of seeing something , or of having a mental image .
The identity theory of mind is to the effect that these experiences just are brain processes , not merely correlated with brain processes .
The identity theory as I understand it here goes back to U.T. Place and Herbert Feigl in the 1950s .
Historically philosophers and scientists , for example Leucippus , Hobbes , La Mettrie , and d'Holbach , as well as Karl Vogt who , following Pierre - Jean - Georges Cabanis , made the preposterous remark ( perhaps not meant to be taken too seriously ) that the brain secretes thought as the liver secretes bile , have embraced materialism .
However , here I shall date interest in the identity theory from the pioneering papers ‘ Is Consciousness a Brain Process ? ’ by U.T. Place ( Place 1956 ) and H. Feigl ‘ The " Mental " and the " Physical " ’ ( Feigl 1958 ) .
Nevertheless mention should be made of suggestions by Rudolf Carnap ( 1932 , p. 127 ) , H. Reichenbach ( 1938 ) and M. Schlick ( 1935 ) .
Reichenbach said that mental events can be identified by the corresponding stimuli and responses much as the ( possibly unknown ) internal state of a photo - electric cell can be identified by the stimulus ( light falling on it ) and response ( electric current flowing ) from it .
In both cases the internal states can be physical states .
However Carnap did regard the identity as a linguistic recommendation rather than as asserting a question of fact .
See his ‘ Herbert Feigl on Physicalism ’ in Schilpp ( 1963 ) , especially p. 886 .
The psychologist E.G. Boring ( 1933 ) may well have been the first to use the term ‘ identity theory ’ .
See Place ( 1990 ) .
Place 's very original and pioneering paper was written after discussions at the University of Adelaide with J.J.C. Smart and C.B. Martin .
For recollections of Martin 's contributions to the discussion see Place ( 1989 ) ‘ Low Claim Assertions ’ in Heil ( 1989 ) .
Smart at the time argued for a behaviourist position in which mental events were elucidated purely in terms of hypothetical propositions about behaviour , as well as first person reports of experiences which Gilbert Ryle regarded as ‘ avowals ’ .
Avowals were thought of as mere pieces of behaviour , as if saying that one had a pain was just doing a sophisticated sort of wince .
Smart saw Ryle 's theory as friendly to physicalism though that was not part of Ryle 's motivation .
Smart hoped that the hypotheticals would ultimately be explained by neuroscience and cybernetics .
Being unable to refute Place , and recognizing the unsatisfactoriness of Ryle 's treatment of inner experience , to some extent recognized by Ryle himself ( Ryle 1949 , p. 240 ) , Smart soon became converted to Place 's view ( Smart 1959 ) .
In this he was also encouraged and influenced by Feigl 's ‘" The Mental " and the " Physical " ’ ( Feigl 1958 , 1967 ) .
Feigl 's wide ranging contribution covered many problems , including those connected with intentionality , and he introduced the useful term ‘ nomological danglers ’ for the dualists ' supposed mental - physical correlations .
They would dangle from the nomological net of physical science and should strike one as implausible excrescences on the fair face of science .
Feigl ( 1967 ) contains a valuable ‘ Postscript ’ .
Place spoke of constitution rather than of identity .
One of his examples is ‘ This table is an old packing case ’ .
Another is ‘ lightning is an electric discharge ’ .
Indeed this latter was foreshadowed by Place in his earlier paper ‘ The Concept of Heed ’ ( Place 1954 ) , in which he took issue with Ryle 's behaviourism as it applied to concepts of consciousness , sensation and imagery .
Place remarked ( p. 255 )
The logical objections which might be raised to the statement ‘ consciousness is a process in the brain ’ are no greater than the logical objections which might be raised to the statement ‘ lightning is a motion of electric charges ’ .
It should be noticed that Place was using the word ‘ logical ’ in the way that it was used at Oxford at the time , not in the way that it is normally used now .
One objection was that ‘ sensation ’ does not mean the same as ‘ brain process ’ .
Place 's reply was to point out that ‘ this table ’ does not mean the same as ‘ this old packing case ’ and ‘ lightning ’ does not mean the same as ‘ motion of electric charges ’ .
We find out whether this is a table in a different way from the way in which we find out that it is an old packing case .
We find out whether a thing is lightning by looking and that it is a motion of electric charges by theory and experiment .
This does not prevent the table being identical to the old packing case and the perceived lightning being nothing other than an electric discharge .
Feigl and Smart put the matter more in terms of the distinction between meaning and reference .
‘ Sensation ’ and ‘ brain process ’ may differ in meaning and yet have the same reference .
‘ Very bright planet seen in the morning ’ and ‘ very bright planet seen in the evening ’ both refer to the same entity Venus .
( Of course these expressions could be construed as referring to different things , different sequences of temporal stages of Venus , but not necessarily or most naturally so . )
There did seem to be a tendency among philosophers to have thought that identity statements needed to be necessary and a priori truths .
However identity theorists have treated ‘ sensations are brain processes ’ as contingent .
We had to find out that the identity holds .
Aristotle , after all , thought that the brain was for cooling the blood .
Descartes thought that consciousness is immaterial .
It was sometimes objected that sensation statements are incorrigible whereas statements about brains are corrigible .
The inference was made that there must be something different about sensations .
Ryle and in effect Wittgenstein toyed with the attractive but quite implausible notion that ostensible reports of immediate experience are not really reports but are ‘ avowals ’ , as if my report that I have toothache is just a sophisticated sort of wince .
Place , influenced by Martin , was able to explain the relative incorrigibility of sensation statements by their low claims : ‘ I see a bent oar ’ makes a bigger claim than ‘ It looks to me that there is a bent oar ’ .
Nevertheless my sensation and my putative awareness of the sensation are distinct existences and so , by Hume 's principle , it must be possible for one to occur without the other .
One should deny anything other than a relative incorrigibility ( Place 1989 ) .
As remarked above , Place preferred to express the theory by the notion of constitution , whereas Smart preferred to make prominent the notion of identity as it occurs in the axioms of identity in logic .
So Smart had to say that if sensation X is identical to brain process Y then if Y is between my ears and is straight or circular ( absurdly to oversimplify ) then the sensation X is between my ears and is straight or circular .
Of course it is not presented to us as such in experience .
Perhaps only the neuroscientist could know that it is straight or circular .
The professor of anatomy might be identical with the dean of the medical school .
A visitor might know that the professor hiccups in lectures but not know that the dean hiccups in lectures .
Someone might object that the dean of the medical school does not qua dean hiccup in lectures .
Qua dean he goes to meetings with the vice - chancellor .
This is not to the point but there is a point behind it .
This is that the property of being the professor of anatomy is not identical with the property of being the dean of the medical school .
The question might be asked , that even if sensations are identical with brain processes , are there not introspected non-physical properties of sensations that are not identical with properties of brain processes ?
How would a physicalist identity theorist deal with this ?
The answer ( Smart 1959 ) is that the properties of experiences are ‘ topic neutral ’ .
Smart adapted the words ‘ topic - neutral ’ from Ryle , who used them to characterise words such as ‘ if , ‘ or ’ , ‘ and ’ , ‘ not ’ , ‘ because ’ .
If you overheard only these words in a conversation you would not be able to tell whether the conversation was one of mathematics , physics , geology , history , theology , or any other subject .
Smart used the words ‘ topic neutral ’ in the narrower sense of being neutral between physicalism and dualism .
For example ‘ going on ’ , ‘ occurring ’ , ‘ intermittent ’ , ‘ waxing ’ , ‘ waning ’ are topic neutral .
So is ‘ me ’ in so far as it refers to the utterer of the sentence in question .
Thus to say that a sensation is caused by lightning or the presence of a cabbage before my eyes leaves it open as to whether the sensation is non-physical as the dualist believes or is physical as the materialist believes .
This sentence also is neutral as to whether the properties of the sensation are physical or whether some of them are irreducibly psychical .
To see how this idea can be applied to the present purpose let us consider the following example .
Suppose that I have a yellow , green and purple striped mental image .
We may also introduce the philosophical term ‘ sense datum ’ to cover the case of seeing or seeming to see something yellow , green and purple : we say that we have a yellow , green and purple sense datum .
That is I would see or seem to see , for example , a flag or an array of lamps which is green , yellow and purple striped .
Suppose also , as seems plausible , that there is nothing yellow , green and purple striped in the brain .
Thus it is important for identity theorists to say ( as indeed they have done ) that sense data and images are not part of the furniture of the world .
‘ I have a green sense datum ’ is really just a way of saying that I see or seem to see something that really is green .
This move should not be seen as merely an ad hoc device , since Ryle and J.L. Austin , in effect Wittgenstein , and others had provided arguments , as when Ryle argued that mental images were not a sort of ghostly picture postcard .
Place characterised the fallacy of thinking that when we perceive something green we are perceiving something green in the mind as ‘ the phenomenological fallacy ’ .
He characterizes this fallacy ( Place 1956 ) :
the mistake of supposing that when the subject describes his experience , when he describes how things look , sound , smell , taste , or feel to him , he is describing the literal properties of objects and events on a peculiar sort of internal cinema or television screen , usually referred to in the modern psychological literature as the ‘ phenomenal field ’ .
Of course , as Smart recognised , this leaves the identity theory dependent on a physicalist account of colour .
His early account of colour ( 1961 ) was too behaviourist , and could not deal , for example , with the reversed spectrum problem , but he later gave a realist and objectivist account ( Smart 1975 ) .
Armstrong had been realist about colour but Smart worried that if so colour would be a very idiosyncratic and disjunctive concept , of no cosmic importance , of no interest to extraterrestrials ( for instance ) who had different visual systems .
Prompted by Lewis in conversation Smart came to realize that this was no objection to colours being objective properties .
One first gives the notion of a normal human percipient with respect to colour for which there are objective tests in terms of ability to make discriminations with respect to colour .
This can be done without circularity .
Thus ‘ discriminate with respect to colour ’ is a more primitive notion than is that of colour .
( Compare the way that in set theory ‘ equinumerous ’ is antecedent to ‘ number ’ . )
Then Smart elucidated the notion of colour in terms of the discriminations with respect to colour of normal human percipients in normal conditions ( say cloudy Scottish daylight ) .
This account of colour may be disjunctive and idiosyncratic .
( Maxwell 's equations might be of interest to Alpha Centaurians but hardly our colour concepts . )
Anthropocentric and disjunctive they may be , but objective none the less .
David R. Hilbert ( 1987 ) identifies colours with reflectances , thus reducing the idiosyncrasy and disjunctiveness .
A few epicycles are easily added to deal with radiated light , the colours of rainbows or the sun at sunset and the colours due to diffraction from feathers .
John Locke was on the right track in making the secondary qualities objective as powers in the object , but erred in making these powers to be powers to produce ideas in the mind rather than to make behavioural discriminations .
( Also Smart would say that if powers are dispositions we should treat the secondary qualities as the categorical bases of these powers , e.g. in the case of colours properties of the surfaces of objects . )
Locke 's view suggested that the ideas have mysterious qualia observed on the screen of an internal mental theatre .
However to do Locke justice he does not talk in effect of ‘ red ideas ’ but of ‘ ideas of red ’ .
Philosophers who elucidate ‘ is red ’ in terms of ‘ looks red ’ have the matter the wrong way round ( Smart 1995 ) .
Let us return to the issue of us having a yellow , purple and green striped sense datum or mental image and yet there being no yellow , purple and green striped thing in the brain .
The identity theorist ( Smart 1959 ) can say that sense data and images are not real things in the world : they are like the average plumber .
Sentences ostensibly about the average plumber can be translated into , or elucidated in terms of , sentences about plumbers .
So also there is having a green sense datum or image but not sense data or images , and the having of a green sense datum or image is not itself green .
So it can , so far as this goes , easily be a brain process which is not green either .
Thus Place ( 1956 , p. 49 ) :
When we describe the after - image as green ... we are saying that we are having the sort of experience which we normally have when , and which we have learned to described as , looking at a green patch of light .
and Smart ( 1959 ) says :
When a person says ‘ I see a yellowish - orange after - image ’ he is saying something like this : " There is something going on which is like what is going on when I have my eyes open , am awake , and there is an orange illuminated in good light in front of me " .
Quoting these passages , David Chalmers ( 1996 , p. 360 ) objects that if ‘ something is going on ’ is construed broadly enough it is inadequate , and if it is construed narrowly enough to cover only experiential states ( or processes ) it is not sufficient for the conclusion .
Smart would counter this by stressing the word ‘ typically ’ .
Of course a lot of things go on in me when I have a yellow after image ( for example my heart is pumping blood through my brain ) .
However they do not typically go on then : they go on at other times too .
Against Place Chalmers says that the word ‘ experience ’ is unanalysed and so Place 's analysis is insufficient towards establishing an identity between sensations and brain processes .
As against Smart he says that leaving the word ‘ experience ’ out of the analysis renders it inadequate .
That is , he does not accept the ‘ topic - neutral ’ analysis .
Smart hopes , and Chalmers denies , that the account in terms of ‘ typically of ’ saves the topic - neutral analysis .
In defence of Place one might perhaps say that it is not clear that the word ‘ experience ’ cannot be given a topic neutral analysis , perhaps building on Farrell ( 1950 ) .
If we do not need the word ‘ experience ’ neither do we need the word ‘ mental ’ .
Rosenthal ( 1994 ) complains ( against the identity theorist ) that experiences have some characteristically mental properties , and that ‘ We inevitably lose the distinctively mental if we construe these properties as neither physical nor mental ’ .
Of course to be topic neutral is to be able to be both physical and mental , just as arithmetic is .
There is no need for the word ‘ mental ’ itself to occur in the topic neutral formula .
‘ Mental ’ , as Ryle ( 1949 ) suggests , in its ordinary use is a rather grab - bag term , ‘ mental arithmetic ’ , ‘ mental illness ’ , etc. with which an identity theorist finds no trouble .
In their accounts of mind , David Lewis and D.M. Armstrong emphasise the notion of causality .
Lewis 's 1966 was a particularly clear headed presentation of the identity theory in which he says ( I here refer to the reprint in Lewis 1983 , p. 100 ) :
My argument is this :
The definitive characteristic of any ( sort of ) experience as such is its causal role , its syndrome of most typical causes and effects .
But we materialists believe that these causal roles which belong by analytic necessity to experiences belong in fact to certain physical states .
Since these physical states possess the definitive character of experiences , they must be experiences .
Similarly , Robert Kirk ( 1999 ) has argued for the impossibility of zombies .
If the supposed zombie has all the behavioural and neural properties ascribed to it by those who argue from the possibility of zombies against materialism , then the zombie is conscious and so not a zombie .
Thus there is no need for explicit use of Ockham 's Razor as in Smart ( 1959 ) though not in Place ( 1956 ) .
( See Place 1960 . )
Lewis 's paper was extremely valuable and already there are hints of a marriage between the identity theory of mind and so - called ‘ functionalist ’ ideas that are explicit in Lewis 1972 and 1994 .
In his 1972 ( ‘ Psychophysical and Theoretical Identifications ’ ) he applies ideas in his more formal paper ‘ How to Define Theoretical Terms ’ ( 1970 ) .
Folk psychology contains words such as ‘ sensation ’ , ‘ perceive ’ , ‘ belief , ‘ desire ’ , ‘ emotion ’ , etc. which we recognise as psychological .
Words for colours , smells , sounds , tastes and so on also occur .
One can regard common sense platitudes containing both these sorts of these words as constituting a theory and we can take them as theoretical terms of common sense psychology and thus as denoting whatever entities or sorts of entities uniquely realise the theory .
Then if certain neural states do so too ( as we believe ) then the mental states must be these neural states .
In his 1994 he allows for tact in extracting a consistent theory from common sense .
One cannot uncritically collect platitudes , just as in producing a grammar , implicit in our speech patterns , one must allow for departures from what on our best theory would constitute grammaticality .
A great advantage of this approach over the early identity theory is its holism .
Two features of this holism should be noted .
One is that the approach is able to allow for the causal interactions between brain states and processes themselves , as well as in the case of external stimuli and responses .
Another is the ability to draw on the notion of Ramseyfication of a theory .
F.P. Ramsey had shown how to replace the theoretical terms of a theory such as ‘ the property of being an electron ’ by ‘ the property X such that ...’. so that when this is done for all the theoretical terms , we are left only with ‘ property X such that ’ , ‘ property Y such that ’ etc .
Take the terms describing behaviour as the observation terms and psychological terms as the theoretical ones of folk psychology .
Then Ramseyfication shows that folk psychology is compatible with materialism .
This seems right , though perhaps the earlier identity theory deals more directly with reports of immediate experience .
The causal approach was also characteristic of D.M. Armstrong 's careful conceptual analysis of mental states and processes , such as perception and the secondary qualities , sensation , consciousness , belief , desire , emotion , voluntary action , in his A Materialist Theory of the Mind ( 1968a ) with a second edition ( 1993 ) containing a valuable new preface .
Parts I and II of this book are concerned with conceptual analysis , paving the way for a contingent identification of mental states and processes with material ones .
As had Brian Medlin , in an impressive critique of Ryle and defence of materialism ( Medlin 1967 ) , Armstrong preferred to describe the identity theory as ‘ Central State Materialism ’ .
Independently of Armstrong and Lewis , Medlin 's central state materialism depended , as theirs did , on a causal analysis of concepts of mental states and processes .
See Medlin 1967 , and 1969 ( including endnote 1 ) .
Mention should particularly be made here of two of Armstrong 's other books , one on perception ( 1961 ) , and one on bodily sensations , ( 1962 ) .
Armstrong thought of perception as coming to believe by means of the senses ( compare also Pitcher 1971 ) .
This combines the advantages of Direct Realism with hospitality towards the scientific causal story which had been thought to have supported the earlier representative theory of perception .
Armstrong regarded bodily sensations as perceptions of states of our body .
Of course the latter may be mixed up with emotional states , as an itch may include a propensity to scratch , and contrariwise in exceptional circumstances pain may be felt without distress .
However , Armstrong sees the central notion here as that of perception .
This suggests a terminological problem .
Smart had talked of visual sensations .
These were not perceptions but something which occurred in perception .
So in this sense of ‘ sensation ’ there should be bodily sensation sensations .
The ambiguity could perhaps be resolved by using the word ‘ sensing ’ in the context of ‘ visual ’ , ‘ auditory ’ , ‘ tactile ’ and ‘ bodily ’ , so that bodily sensations would be perceivings which involved introspectible ‘ sensings ’ .
These bodily sensations are perceptions and there can be misperceptions as when a person with his foot amputated can think that he has a pain in the foot .
He has a sensing ‘ having a pain in the foot ’ but the world does not contain a pain in the foot , just as it does not contain sense data or images but does contain havings of sense data and of images .
Armstrong 's central state materialism involved identifying beliefs and desires with states of the brain ( 1968a ) .
Smart came to agree with this .
On the other hand Place resisted the proposal to extend the identity theory to dispositional states such as beliefs and desires .
He stressed that we do not have privileged access to our beliefs and desires .
Like Ryle he thought of beliefs and desires as to be elucidated by means of hypothetical statements about behaviour and gave the analogy of the horsepower of a car ( Place 1967 ) .
However he held that the dispute here is not so much about the neural basis of mental states as about the nature of dispositions .
His views on dispositions are argued at length in his debate with Armstrong and Martin ( Armstrong , Martin and Place , T. Crane ( ed. ) 1996 ) .
Perhaps we can be relaxed about whether mental states such as beliefs and desires are dispositions or are topic neutrally described neurophysiological states and return to what seems to be the more difficult issue of consciousness .
Causal identity theories are closely related to Functionalism , to be discussed in the next section .
Smart had been wary of the notion of causality in metaphysics believing that it had no place in theoretical physics .
However even so he should have admitted it in folk psychology and also in scientific psychology and biology generally , in which physics and chemistry are applied to explain generalisations rather than strict laws .
If folk psychology uses the notion of causality , it is no matter if it is what Quine has called second grade discourse , involving the very contextual notions of modality .
It has commonly been thought that the identity theory has been superseded by a theory called ‘ functionalism ’ .
It could be argued that functionalists greatly exaggerate their difference from identity theorists .
Indeed some philosophers , such as Lewis ( 1972 and 1994 ) and Jackson , Pargetter and Prior ( 1982 ) , have seen functionalism as a route towards an identity theory .
Like Lewis and Armstrong , functionalists define mental states and processes in terms of their causal relations to behaviour but stop short of identifying them with their neural realisations .
Of course the term ‘ functionalism ’ has been used vaguely and in different ways , and it could be argued that even the theories of Place , Smart and Armstrong were at bottom functionalist .
The word ‘ functionalist ’ has affinities with that of ‘ function ’ in mathematics and also with that of ‘ function ’ in biology .
In mathematics a function is a set of ordered n- tuples .
Similarly if mental processes are defined directly or indirectly by sets of stimulus - response pairs the definitions could be seen as ‘ functional ’ in the mathematical sense .
However there is probably a closer connection with the term as it is used in biology , as one might define ‘ eye ’ by its function even though a fly 's eye and a dog's eye are anatomically and physiologically very different .
Functionalism identifies mental states and processes by means of their causal roles , and as noted above in connection with Lewis , we know that the functional roles are possessed by neural states and processes .
( There are teleological and homuncular forms of functionalism , which I do not consider here . )
Nevertheless an interactionist dualist such as the eminent neurophysiologist Sir John Eccles would ( implausibly for most of us ) deny that all functional roles are so possessed .
One might think of folk psychology , and indeed much of cognitive science too , as analogous to a ‘ block diagram ’ in electronics .
A box in the diagram might be labelled ( say ) ‘ intermediate frequency amplifier ’ while remaining ) neutral as to the exact circuit and whether the amplification is carried out by a thermionic valve or by a transistor .
Using terminology of F. Jackson and P. Pettit ( 1988 , pp. 381–400 ) the ‘ role state ’ would be given by ‘ amplifier ’ , the ‘ realiser state ’ would be given by ‘ thermionic valve ’ , say .
So we can think of functionalism as a ‘ black box ’ theory .
This line of thought will be pursued in the next section .
Thinking very much in causal terms about beliefs and desires fits in very well not only with folk psychology but also with Humean ideas about the motives of action .
Though this point of view has been criticised by some philosophers it does seem to be right , as can be seen if we consider a possible robot aeroplane designed to find its way from Melbourne to Sydney .
The designer would have to include an electronic version of something like a map of south - eastern Australia .
This would provide the ‘ belief ’ side .
One would also have to program in an electronic equivalent of ‘ go to Sydney ’ .
This program would provide the ‘ desire ’ side .
If wind and weather pushed the aeroplane off course then negative feedback would push the aeroplane back on to the right course for Sydney .
The existence of purposive mechanisms has at last ( I hope ) shown to philosophers that there is nothing mysterious about teleology .
Nor are there any great semantic problems over intentionality ( with a ‘ t ’ ) .
Consider the sentence ‘ Joe desires a unicorn ’ .
This is not like ‘ Joe kicks a football ’ .
For Joe to kick a football there must be a football to be kicked , but there are no unicorns .
However we can say ‘ Joe desires - true of himself " possesses a unicorn " ’.
Or more generally ‘ Joe believes - true S ’ or ‘ Joe desires - true S ’ where S is an appropriate sentence ( Quine 1960 , pp. 206–16 ) .
Of course if one does not want to relativise to a language one needs to insert ‘ or some samesayer of S ’ or use the word ‘ proposition ’ , and this involves the notion of proposition or intertranslatability .
Even if one does not accept Quine 's notion of indeterminacy of translation , there is still fuzziness in the notions of ‘ belief ’ and ‘ desire ’ arising from the fuzziness of ‘ analyticity ’ and ‘ synonymy ’ .
The identity theorist could say that on any occasion this fuzziness is matched by the fuzziness of the brain state that constitutes the belief or desire .
Just how many interconnections are involved in a belief or desire ?
On a holistic account such as Lewis 's one need not suppose that individuation of beliefs and desires is precise , even though good enough for folk psychology and Humean metaethics .
Thus the way in which the brain represents the world might not be like a language .
The representation might be like a map .
A map relates every feature on it to every other feature .
Nevertheless maps contain a finite amount of information .
They have not infinitely many parts , still less continuum many .
We can think of beliefs as expressing the different bits of information that could be extracted from the map .
Thinking in this way beliefs would correspond near enough to the individualist beliefs characteristic of folk and Humean psychology .
The notion ‘ type ’ and ‘ token ’ here comes by analogy from ‘ type ’ and ‘ token ’ as applied to words .
A telegram ‘ love and love and love ’ contains only two type words but in another sense , as the telegraph clerk would insist , it contains five words ( ‘ token words ’ ) .
Similarly a particular pain ( more exactly a having a pain ) according to the token identity theory is identical to a particular brain process .
A functionalist could agree to this .
Functionalism came to be seen as an improvement on the identity theory , and as inconsistent with it , because of the correct assertion that a functional state can be realised by quite different brain states : thus a functional state might be realised by a silicon based brain as well as by a carbon based brain , and leaving robotics or science fiction aside , my feeling of toothache could be realised by a different neural process from what realises your toothache .
As far as this goes a functionalist can at any rate accept token identities .
Functionalists commonly deny type identities .
However Jackson , Pargetter and Prior ( 1982 ) and Braddon - Mitchell and Jackson ( 1996 ) argue that this is an over - reaction on the part of the functionalist .
( Indeed they see functionalism as a route to the identity theory . )
The functionalist may define mental states as having some state or other ( e.g. , carbon based or silicon based ) which accounts for the functional properties .
The functionalist second order state is a state of having some first order state or other which causes or is caused by the behaviour to which the functionalist alludes .
In this way we have a second order type theory .
Compare brittleness .
The brittleness of glass and the brittleness of biscuits are both the state of having some property which explains their breaking , though the first order physical property may be different in the two cases .
This way of looking at the matter is perhaps more plausible in relation to mental states such as beliefs and desires than it is to immediately reported experiences .
When I report a toothache I do seem to be concerned with first order properties , even though topic neutral ones .
If we continue to concern ourselves with first order properties , we could say that the type - token distinction is not an all or nothing affair .
We could say that human experiences are brain processes of one lot of sorts and Alpha Centaurian experiences are brain processes of another lot of sorts .
We could indeed propose much finer classifications without going to the limit of mere token identities .
How restricted should be the restriction of a restricted type theory ?
How many hairs must a bald man have no more of ?
An identity theorist would expect his toothache today to be very similar to his toothache yesterday .
He would expect his toothache to be quite similar to his wife 's toothache .
He would expect his toothache to be somewhat similar to his cat 's toothache .
He would not be confident about similarity to an extra- terrestrial 's pain .
Even here , however , he might expect some similarities of wave form or the like .
Even in the case of the similarity of my pain now to my pain ten minutes ago , there will be unimportant dissimilarities , and also between my pain and your pain .
Compare topiary , making use of an analogy exploited by Quine in a different connection .
In English country gardens the tops of box hedges are often cut in various shapes , for example peacock shapes .
One might make generalizations about peacock shapes on box hedges , and one might say that all the imitation peacocks on a particular hedge have the same shape .
However if we approach the two imitation peacocks and peer into them to note the precise shapes of the twigs that make them up we will find differences .
Whether we say that two things are similar or not is a matter of abstractness of description .
If we were to go to the limit of concreteness the types would shrink to single membered types , but there would still be no ontological difference between identity theory and functionalism .
An interesting form of token identity theory is the anomalous monism of Davidson 1980 .
Davidson argues that causal relations occur under the neural descriptions but not under the descriptions of psychological language .
The latter descriptions use intentional predicates , but because of indeterminacy of translation and of interpretation , these predicates do not occur in law statements .
It follows that mind - brain identities can occur only on the level of individual ( token ) events .
It would be beyond the scope of the present essay to consider Davidson 's ingenious approach , since it differs importantly from the more usual forms of identity theory .
Place answered the question ‘ Is Consciousness a Brain Process ? ’ in the affirmative .
But what sort of brain process ?
It is natural to feel that there is something ineffable about which no mere neurophysiological process ( with only physical intrinsic properties ) could have .
There is a challenge to the identity theorist to dispel this feeling .
Suppose that I am riding my bicycle from my home to the university .
Suddenly I realise that I have crossed a bridge over a creek , gone along a twisty path for half a mile , avoided oncoming traffic , and so on , and yet have no memories of all this .
In one sense I was conscious : I was perceiving , getting information about my position and speed , the state of the bicycle track and the road , the positions and speeds of approaching cars , the width of the familiar narrow bridge .
But in another sense I was not conscious : I was on ‘ automatic pilot ’ .
So let me use the word ‘ awareness ’ for this automatic or subconscious sort of consciousness .
Perhaps I am not one hundred percent on automatic pilot .
For one thing I might be absent minded and thinking about philosophy .
Still , this would not be relevant to my bicycle riding .
One might indeed wonder whether one is ever one hundred percent on automatic pilot , and perhaps one hopes that one is n't , especially in Armstrong 's example of the long distance truck driver ( Armstrong 1962 ) .
Still it probably does happen , and if it does the driver is conscious only in the sense that he or she is alert to the route , of oncoming traffic etc. , i.e. is perceiving in the sense of ‘ coming to believe by means of the senses ’ .
The driver gets the beliefs but is not aware of doing so .
There is no suggestion of ineffability in this sense of ‘ consciousness ’ , for which I shall reserve the term ‘ awareness ’ .
For the full consciousness , the one that puzzles us and suggests ineffability , we need the sense elucidated by Armstrong in a debate with Norman Malcolm ( Armstrong and Malcolm 1962 , p. 110 ) .
Somewhat similar views have been expressed by other philosophers , such as Savage ( 1976 ) , Dennett ( 1991 ) , Lycan ( 1996 ) , Rosenthal ( 1996 ) .
A recent presentation of it is in Smart ( 2004 ) .
In the debate with Norman Malcolm , Armstrong compared consciousness with proprioception .
A case of proprioception occurs when with our eyes shut and without touch we are immediately aware of the angle at which one of our elbows is bent .
That is , proprioception is a special sense , different from that of bodily sensation , in which we become aware of parts of our body .
Now the brain is part of our body and so perhaps immediate awareness of a process in , or a state of , our brain may here for present purposes be called ‘ proprioception ’ .
Thus the proprioception even though the neuroanatomy is different .
Thus the proprioception which constitutes consciousness , as distinguished from mere awareness , is a higher order awareness , a perception of one part of ( or configuration in ) our brain by the brain itself .
Some may sense circularity here .
If so let them suppose that the proprioception occurs in an in practice negligible time after the process propriocepted .
Then perhaps there can be proprioceptions of proprioceptions , proprioceptions of proprioceptions of proprioceptions , and so on up , though in fact the sequence will probably not go up more than two or three steps .
The last proprioception in the sequence will not be propriocepted , and this may help to explain our sense of the ineffability of consciousness .
Compare Gilbert Ryle in The Concept of Mind on the systematic elusiveness of ‘ I’ ( Ryle 1949 , pp. 195–8 ) .
Place has argued that the function of the ‘ automatic pilot ’ , to which he refers as ‘ the zombie within’ , is to alert consciousness to inputs which it identifies as problematic , while it ignores non-problematic inputs or re-routes them to output without the need for conscious awareness .
For this view of consciousness see Place ( 1999 ) .
Mention should here be made of influential criticisms of the identity theory by Saul Kripke and David Chalmers respectively .
It will not be possible to discuss them in great detail , partly because of the fact that Kripke 's remarks rely on views about modality , possible worlds semantics , and essentialism which some philosophers would want to contest , and because Chalmers ' long and rich book would deserve a lengthy answer .
Kripke ( 1980 ) calls an expression a rigid designator if it refers to the same object in every possible world .
Or in counterpart theory it would have an exactly similar counterpart in every possible world .
It seems to me that what we count as counterparts is highly contextual .
Take the example ‘ water is H 2 O ’ .
In another world , or in a twin earth in our world as Putnam imagines ( 1975 ) , the stuff found in rivers , lakes , the sea would not be H 2 O but XYZ and so would not be water .
This is certainly giving preference to real chemistry over folk chemistry , and so far I applaud this .
There are therefore contexts in which we say that on twin earth or the envisaged possible world the stuff found in rivers would not be water .
Nevertheless there are contexts in which we could envisage a possible world ( write a science fiction novel ) in which being found in rivers and lakes and the sea , assuaging thirst and sustaining life was more important than the chemical composition and so XYZ would be the counterpart of H 2 O .
Kripke considers the identity ‘ heat = molecular motion ’ , and holds that this is true in every possible world and so is a necessary truth .
Actually the proposition is not quite true , for what about radiant heat ?
What about heat as defined in classical thermodynamics which is ‘ topic neutral ’ compared with statistical thermodynamics ?
Still , suppose that heat has an essence and that it is molecular motion , or at least is in the context envisaged .
Kripke says ( 1980 , p. 151 ) that when we think that molecular motion might exist in the absence of heat we are confusing this with thinking that the molecular motion might have existed without being felt as heat .
He asks whether it is analogously possible that if pain is a certain sort of brain process that it has existed without being felt as pain .
He suggests that the answer is ‘ No ’ .
An identity theorist who accepted the account of consciousness as a higher order perception could answer ‘ Yes ’ .
We might be aware of a damaged tooth and also of being in an agitation condition ( to use Ryle 's term for emotional states ) without being aware of our awareness .
An identity theorist such as Smart would prefer talk of ‘ having a pain ’ rather than of ‘ pain ’ : pain is not part of the furniture of the world any more than a sense datum or the average plumber is .
Kripke concludes ( p. 152 ) that the
apparent contingency of the connection between the mental state and the corresponding brain state thus cannot be explained by some sort of qualitative analogue as in the case of heat .
Smart would say that there is a sense in which the connection of sensations ( sensings ) and brain processes is only half contingent .
A complete description of the brain state or process ( including causes and effects of it ) would imply the report of inner experience , but the latter , being topic neutral and so very abstract would not imply the neurological description .
Chalmers ( 1996 ) in the course of his exhaustive study of consciousness developed a theory of non-physical qualia which to some extent avoids the worry about nomological danglers .
The worry expressed by Smart ( 1959 ) is that if there were non-physical qualia there would , most implausibly , have to be laws relating neurophysiological processes to apparently simple properties , and the correlation laws would have to be fundamental , mere danglers from the nomological net ( as Feigl called it ) of science .
Chalmers counters this by supposing that the qualia are not simple but unknown to us , are made up of simple proto-qualia , and that the fundamental laws relating these to physical entities relate them to fundamental physical entities .
His view comes to a rather interesting panpsychism .
On the other hand if the topic neutral account is correct , then qualia are no more than points in a multidimensional similarity space , and the overwhelming plausibility will fall on the side of the identity theorist .
On Chalmers ' view how are we aware of non-physical qualia ?
It has been suggested above that this inner awareness is proprioception of the brain by the brain .
But what sort of story is possible in the case of awareness of a quale ?
Chalmers could have some sort of answer to this by means of his principle of coherence according to which the causal neurological story parallels the story of succession of qualia .
It is not clear however that this would make us aware of the qualia .
The qualia do not seem to be needed in the physiological story of how an antelope avoids a tiger .
People often think that even if a robot could scan its own perceptual processes this would not mean that the robot was conscious .
This appeals to our intuitions , but perhaps we could reverse the argument and say that because the robot can be aware of its awareness the robot is conscious .
I have given reason above to distrust intuitions , but in any case Chalmers comes some of the way in that he toys with the idea that a thermostat has a sort of proto-qualia .
The dispute between identity theorists ( and physicalists generally ) and Chalmers comes down to our attitude to phenomenology .
Certainly walking in a forest , seeing the blue of the sky , the green of the trees , the red of the track , one may find it hard to believe that our qualia are merely points in a multidimensional similarity space .
But perhaps that is what it is like ( to use a phrase that can be distrusted ) to be aware of a point in a multidimensional similarity space .
One may also , as Place would suggest , be subject to ‘ the phenomenological fallacy ’ .
At the end of his book Chalmers makes some speculations about the interpretation of quantum mechanics .
If they succeed then perhaps we could envisage Chalmers ' theory as integrated into physics and him as a physicalist after all .
However it could be doubted whether we need to go down to the quantum level to understand consciousness or whether consciousness is relevant to quantum mechanics .
Well now color me confused .
I thought FOX News was Fair and Balanced ?
But today we learn from Media Matters that in fact FOX has been peddling a “ quote ” from White House communications director Anita Dunn , supposing claiming that she turns to Mao and Mother Teresa “ the most ” in her life , and in fact , that ’s not what she said at all .
Dunn said that she turns to them most “ to basically deliver a simple point , which is , you ’re going to make choices . ”
The difference is n’t insignificant .
The FOX quote says that Dunn turns to Mao the most in her life , on any and every issue – that there is no one in the world ( other than Mother Teresa ) who Dunn looks to for guidance on everything in her life than Mao .
What Dunn actually said is that , on the singular lesson of “ having to make choices ” in life , her favorite quotes are from Mao and Mother Teresa .
A rather huge difference , especially since FOX News is now claiming that Dunn is a Maoist who endorsed the murders of countless Chinese during the Cultural Revolution .
It ’s really rather sick what FOX is doing .
And , ironically , FOX has now proven Dunn ’s point she made last week , that FOX is nothing more than a political operation of the Republican party .
FOX also needs to answer the question of whether their own “ news ” host Chris Wallace was the secret “ concerned parent ” they had on Glenn Beck ’s show yesterday to , again , slur Anita Dunn .
Newsweek ’s Richard Wolffe was on Olbermann last night asking what ties Chris Wallace may have had to this entire smear .
If Wallace was truly involved , then any lingering questions about his status as a GOP activist , rather than a real journalist , will be resolved .
At some point , someone needs to ask Democratic members of Congress why they keep going on FOX .
Someone needs to ask them whose side they ’re on – the White House ’s , or FOX’s .
It 's official : Nylander to Grand Rapids

That means he 's off Washington 's 23 - man roster , and more importantly , his $ 4.875 million cap hit is off the books .

Abu Dhabi is trying to rip up its disastrous $ 7.5 bn ( £ 4.6 bn ) agreement to invest in Citigroup , saying the banking giant misled the country 's sovereign wealth fund about the state of its finances when the deal was signed in 2007 .
The dispute came to light as Citigroup was attempting to stoke investor demand for a massive share issue yesterday and contributed to underwhelming investor demand .
Faced with crystallising a loss on its bailout investments , the US Treasury abandoned plans to sell part of its Citigroup stake at the same time .
The oil - rich emirate is committed to buying Citigroup shares over the next two years at what is now 10 times the prevailing share price , and it has launched an arbitration claim for compensation to the tune of $ 4bn .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ( Adia ) said Citigroup made " fraudulent misrepresentations " in connection with the agreement , but declined to provide specifics .
" It is the policy of Adia to pursue its legal rights fully , " a fund spokesman said .
" Adia declines to comment further due to binding confidentiality obligations , which Adia intends to respect . "
Citigroup promised to vigorously defend the arbitration claim .
The $ 7.5 bn investment in Citigroup was unveiled by Adia in November 2007 , when it seemed that money from the sovereign wealth funds of developing nations , particularly in the Middle East where the benefits of high oil prices were being felt , might be the best way to recapitalise the US banking system .
Citigroup had begun to show losses on its sub - prime mortgage investments earlier in the year , but said it was moving to strengthen its balance sheet .
The subsequent collapse of the company , which twice had to be bailed out by the US government during the financial panic of last year , is therefore a big embarrassment to Abu Dhabi .
" Citi possesses a unique position in the financial markets throughout the world , " Adia 's managing director , Sheikh Ahmed bin Zayed al - Nahayan , had said at the time .
" We see in Citi a highly respected company with a premier brand and with tremendous opportunities for growth .
This investment reflects our confidence in Citi 's potential to build shareholder value . "
Under the complex structure of the deal , Abu Dhabi agreed to buy shares in Citigroup at what was then close to the prevailing share price , but in several tranches in 2010 and 2011 .
Adia has been paid an 11 per cent dividend in the meantime , but now faces buying 236 million shares at $ 31.83 – when Citigroup was trading yesterday lunchtime at $ 3.57 .
The dispute comes at a critical moment for the finances of both sides .
Abu Dhabi committed this week to lend $ 10 bn to bail out fellow emirate Dubai , and Citigroup was yesterday trying to raise $ 17bn as part of its scheme to pay back US government bailout funds .
Its bankers were working on a share sale that they hoped to price significantly higher than the $ 3.25 - per - share level at which the US government invested a $ 25 bn tranche of bailout funds last year .
The US Treasury put $ 45 bn into Citigroup in all , because as one of the largest investment and retail banks in the country it was deemed too big to fail .
The company said on Monday that it would pay back a $ 20bn loan immediately and the government would start selling its $ 25 bn equity stake this week .
Last night the US government reversed course saying it would not sell its stake for 90 days after tepid investor demand .
The new shares are expected to be priced as low as $ 3.15 .

Based on the employment data it is very hard to believe that US interest rates can remain at zero for much longer .

My totally non blue chip economic forecast for GDP goes as follows :
4th Q 2009 = 4 %
1st Q 2010 = 4.5 % !!
2nd Q 2010 = 2.5 %
3rd Q 2010 = 1 %
4th Q 2010 = 0 %
These numbers are not too far from the thinking at Goldman .
They see things chugging along and then slowing .
My numbers are more extreme then theirs for end of 2010 .
My guess is that we are going to hit a wall sometime around mid-year .
By then most of the monetary and fiscal stimulus will be gone .
Without the oxygen we are are going to stall .
Bernanke has stuck to his guns and set out a timetable for the end of the Agency purchases as “ March ” .
This certainly means that there will be no increase in the Funds target until at least then .
After that it gets a bit murky .
The Fed Funds Futures closed Friday at levels that I think are a pretty reasonable assessment of what might happen .
My read on what those numbers say :
- It is a pretty decent bet ( 70 - 30 ) that the Funds rate will be increased 25 BP by June .
- It is almost certain that the Funds target will go up 25 BP by August of 2009 .
Let ’s say that that is wrong .
Take a scenario with a more extreme outcome than suggested by the futures market .
Assume Ben shows his muscle and tightens the Funds rate by a whopping 50 BP by September 1st .
Who cares ?
That is nothing .
So now it is September 2010 , the economy is again clearly decelerating .
Unemployment will be at best 9 % .
Does anyone think that Bernanke will increase rates by more than 50 BP given the economic backdrop that he will be looking at ?
Not a chance .
When people get to understand that this low rate environment is going to be with us for a long time , the seduction of the carry trade will again be the dominant theme .
The price action on Friday killed the leveraged players .
I talked with a lady on Friday night .
She runs big money in liquid macro trades .
She got beat up .
She said ,
“ The carry trade is like an orchid .
It looks beautiful , but when you get too close it smells like rotting meat ” .
The rest of the conversation was about timing and entry points to put the trade back on .
Nothing has changed .
I got just what I was hoping for !
A international SS who gave me a piece of their international treasure ( mainly since I 've not once had an opportunity to leave USA ) .
My SS hails from Singapore , and gave me a bunch of ' Capsule Toys ' .
Little toys in little capsules .
Super awesome !
They 'll make great cube decorations .
Also included was a 2 gb flash drive ( which was actually much needed ) .
Also included was a ' Worst Case Scenario Dating and Sex Address Book ' which - as my SS kindly pointed out - I should n't have much trouble filling up ;)
But the kicker was the packaging !
red_pencil decorated the gift with wrapping paper befitting to his name .
He even made packaging for the thumb drive so awesome looking I did n't even notice it was a picture of ME stolen from MY Facebook !
If like me you 're an avid traveller ( of the virtual or standard variety ) you 'll probably know that in the last few months the Street View team has been working with tourist agencies ,
and partners from across the world to bring a new kind of imagery to Street View , focusing on putting tourist spots and iconic cultural landmarks on the map in all their 360 degree beauty .
As part of this effort , we 're delighted to be announcing a global alliance with UNESCO ( United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ) to put imagery of World Heritage sites into Street View .
To whet your appetite we 've released new imagery for 19 UNESCO sites around Europe , including places in Czech Republic , France , Italy , Netherlands , Spain and the United Kingdom .
You can explore the sites directly in Google Maps , or visit the microsite to learn more .
In the coming months Google will work with UNESCO to select additional World Heritage landmarks , in countries where Street View imagery is being collected , which will be photographed for the project .
The aim is to collect imagery from diverse regions throughout the world including Australia , Brazil , Canada , Japan , Mexico , South Africa , US and many countries throughout Europe .
With permission from the site manager / owner such places look set to one day be available to millions of people around the world who may never have the chance to visit them in person .
Fancy a little tour of your own ?
Why not start with a walk alongside the Seine .
From the Louvre to the Eiffel Tower , from the Place de la Concorde to the Grand and Petit Palais , the evolution of Paris and its history can be seen from its banks .
The Cathedral of Notre - Dame and the Sainte Chapelle are architectural masterpieces while Haussmann 's wide squares and boulevards influenced late 19th - and 20th - century town planning the world over .

Personally , I could n't resist going one step further back in time by visiting Stonehenge , in Wiltshire , one of the most famous groups of megaliths in the world .
The circles of menhirs are arranged in a pattern whose astronomical significance is still being explored , and the site has captivated acheologists for hundreds of years .
There are plenty more sites you can visit too - like the
Mill Network at Kinderdijk - Elshout in the Netherlands
, the old town of
Cáceres in Spain
and the historic
Center of Prague in Czech Republic

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran has charged three detained U.S. citizens with espionage , the official IRNA news agency quoted a prosecutor as saying on Monday , but Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said there was no evidence to back the charges .
Missing American hiker Sarah Shourd is seen here in this undated photo released by freethehikers.org , August 20 , 2009 .
REUTERS/freethehikers.org / Handout
The three , Shane Bauer , 27 , Sarah Shourd , 31 , and Josh Fattal , 27 , were held after crossing into Iran from northern Iraq at the end of July .
Their families said they were hiking and had strayed across the border accidentally .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the case was for the judiciary to decide , but also said that some Iranians had spent many years in U.S. jails without doing anything wrong .
“ We would like all prisoners to be released , ” he told a news conference at an Islamic summit in Istanbul .
“ Hopefully all these problems will be resolved . ”
The case comes at a time of higher tensions between Iran and the West over Tehran ’s nuclear plans and after Iranian officials accused foreign nations of fuelling the widespread unrest after a disputed presidential election in June .
“ The three are charged with espionage , ” Tehran general prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi told IRNA .
“ Investigations continue into the three detained Americans in Iran . ”
Both Clinton and the detainees ’ families called on Iran to exercise “ compassion . ”
“ We believe strongly that there is no evidence to support any charge whatsoever , ” Clinton said in Berlin .
“ And we would renew our request on behalf of these three young people and their families that the Iranian government exercise compassion and release them so they can return home , and we will continue to make that case , ” she added .
“ CONVINCE THE JUDGE ”
In a joint statement , the families said : “ The allegation that our loved ones may have been engaged in espionage is untrue ...
“ We again call on Iran to show compassion to our loved ones and release them without delay .
This has already gone on for too long . ”
Ahmadinejad said the three had crossed the border illegally .
“ Hopefully they would convince the judge that they did n’t have the intention to cross the border illegally , and we hope that will happen , ” he said , speaking through an interpreter .
Under Iran ’s Islamic law , espionage is punishable by death .
Some Iranian officials linked the illegal entry of the Americans to the turmoil that erupted after Iran ’s June poll .
Ahmadinejad referred to the case of an Iranian pilgrim he said had been “ kidnapped ” by the Americans in Mecca , Saudi Arabia , and another Iranian he said they had abducted in Turkey .
He was apparently alluding to former deputy defense minister Ali Reza Asgari who went missing in Turkey in February 2007 .
Iran ’s police chief said at the time that Western intelligence services might have kidnapped him .
Dolatabadi , the Iranian prosecutor , said the case of a Danish student detained during a rally on November 4 to mark the 30th anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. embassy was under investigation .
“ This accused Danish citizen has introduced himself as a reporter but he holds no official press accreditation .
Investigations about him continue , ” he said .
“ Today the Danish embassy lawyer was allowed to meet the prisoner . ”
Police detained more than 100 people during clashes with opposition supporters in Tehran last week .
IRNA said a reporter from Agence France Presse who was detained in the protests was among five people released on Saturday .
Clotilde Reiss , a French teaching assistant , was arrested in Iran on spying charges on July 1 in connection with the post - vote unrest .
She was released on bail in August but not allowed to leave the country .
I got this awesome watch .
When I opened the pacakge , I thought it was just the container , which has an awesome design .
I was so shocked to see a watch inside .
I actually do n't have a watch , so this is awesome .
Thank you so much !

Michael Schumacher has told Ferrari that there is a " very , very , very strong possibility " that he will race for Mercedes - Benz in Formula 1 next year , team president Luca di Montezemolo has revealed .
Although there has not yet been any official word from the Schumacher or Mercedes - Benz camps about the progress of talks in relation to an amazing comeback for the seven - time world champion , di Montezemolo has given away just how far advanced the situation now is .
Speaking to selected media , including AUTOSPORT , at Ferrari's Christmas lunch in Fiorano on Thursday , di Montezemolo shed fresh light on the Schumacher developments .
" I had n't spoken to him since Abu Dhabi but I spoke to him yesterday ( Wednesday ) , " said di Montezemolo about Schumacher 's Mercedes - Benz situation .
" He phoned me and he told me that there is a very , very , very strong possibility [ of racing for Mercedes - Benz ] .
Having said that , it is not 100 per cent decided .
But that is what he said yesterday morning . "
Di Montezemolo confirmed that Ferrari had agreed to release Schumacher from any remaining commitments he had to the Italian team so he could make the switch to Mercedes - Benz in the event of a deal coming off .
Sources have told AUTOSPORT that a deal between Schumacher and Mercedes - Benz has been agreed in principle , but that the matter cannot move forward until the German has been told by medical experts that his neck is 100 per cent ready for an F1 return .
Schumacher hurt his neck in a big motorbike accident earlier this year , and it was the legacy of that injury which forced him to abandon a comeback for Ferrari in the middle of last year .
Once Schumacher has got the medical news that he and Mercedes - Benz need , then it will be a matter of finalising his contract prior to an announcement being made .
Di Montezemolo said that he believed that it was a ' new Schumacher ' who was pursuing a future with Mercedes - Benz .
" The real Michael Schumacher always told me he would finish his career at Ferrari , " he said .
When asked what he had said to Schumacher during their conversation , di Montezemolo paused before saying : " Do n't forget that when you start collaboration with a driver as long ago as we did with Michael , in 1995 , over 14 years ago , you are also a friend .
" You can agree and disagree but you remain friends .
I wo n't forget what he did for Ferrari and he wo n't forget what we did for him . "
Di Montezemolo also spoke at length about the struggles Ferrari faced during 2009 , having been unable to take the challenge to title rivals Brawn GP and Red Bull Racing .
" All our car architecture - the dimensions of the gearbox , everything - was based on a different interpretation of the rules and , also , we were pushing very hard until the last corner of the last race of ' 08 , " he said .
Di Montezemolo also admitted that the season had marked the closest point in his experience to seeing Ferrari quit F1 .
" This year was the only one moment since I became chairman in 1991 that I was really minded to stop F1 , " he said .
" It was the unanimous decision of the board that there was too much credibility being lost , too much polemics over the rules and not enough research .
" Now I say thank God that everything is over although we paid a big price because not to have Toyota and BMW and to have Renault in a different situation is not good for F1 . "

My friend Peter Toft just blogged about an important change in the Windows EULA that could very well affect a large part of us .
His original blog post ( in danish ) is available here
But the short story is that Windows Vista allowed you to contact the manufacturer for a refund for the software if you did n't accept the EULA and Windows 7 appears to have removed that option .
You can know contact the manufacturer to cancel the entire order or have them tell you which rights you no longer have because you did n't accept the EULA .
Given how stubborn manufacturers are about refunding the windows license here in Denmark and several other countries I guess the Microsoft tax is pretty much impossible to escape now .
The way I understand it this EULA change practically makes it mandatory paying for Microsoft Windows if you want a laptop for professionel use at least .
The exact part of the Windows Vista EULA mentioned by Peter is :
The same part from the Windows 7 EULA is now : I know of two current cases where Lenovo refuses to follow the Vista EULA and refund the Windows license .
One being in Denmark where FreeBSD developer Poul - Henning Kamp is suing Lenovo and the other being in Hong Kong I 'm curious how people think this EULA change will affect future refunds in different countries and how it relates to the different court cases in the european union and elsewhere that have already taken steps to limit Microsofts abuse of it's de-facto monopoly and secure free competition .
Please comment if you know of other current cases or have any information that can help keep open source operating systems an option when buying laptops .
This is what our Republican Governor , Jodi Rell , said about the Charter Oak Plan last month on its one - year anniversary :
" A little over a year ago , I announced the start of a program I said would change the face of health care in Connecticut – change it for the better and change it forever , " Governor Rell said .
" Today that program is covering 10,257 individuals and another 5,884 applicants are eligible for coverage as soon as they select from one of three contracted health plans and begin paying monthly premiums .
" That means more than 10,000 people who – a year ago – had no health coverage or could not afford the coverage they had now have affordable health care , " the Governor said .
" That is an accomplishment worth celebrating .
From routine checkups to treatment for life - threatening illness , the program is filling a critical gap . "

This is how her press release describes the Charter Oak Plan :
There is no income test or asset limit to qualify for Charter Oak coverage .
Enrollees earning more than 300 percent of the federal poverty level ( FPL ) currently pay a flat , unsubsidized monthly premium of $ 259 .
Enrollees with incomes below 300 percent of the FPL pay reduced , subsidized premiums ranging from $ 75 to $ 200 monthly , depending on income and family size .
Charter Oak ’s annual , income - based deductible ranges from $ 150 to $ 900 .
The deductible does not apply to primary and specialist doctor visits , ambulance and emergency room care , behavioral health services , pre- and post-natal care , prescription medications and certain other benefits .
The Charter Oak Health Plan is administered by the Department of Social Services .
link : http://www.charteroakhealthplan.com/...
It 's still a new plan , but it 's there , so I have some questions for my Honorable Senator from the State of Connecticut :
Is he planning on filibustering a federal public option because he feels that the people of the State of Connecticut do n't want the rest of the country to enjoy a public option , even when they do ?
Is Senator Lieberman to the right of Republican Governor Jodi Rell when it comes to health care , and does he believe that the people of the state of Connecticut are also the to the right of Governor Rell on this issue ?
Is Senator Lieberman willing to come out and make a statement on the Charter Oak Plan - and for that matter the very popular Husky Plan - as these are both government - run health care plans ?
Is he in favor of one , or both , or neither ?
Gosh , I would hate to say that any of this had to do with Senator Lieberman putting his personal political interests above his solemn duty to represent the people of the State of Connecticut .
It 'd be nice to hear from the Senator on these open questions just so he can put that concern to rest .
UPDATE :
Oh , this just gets better :
" I think that a lot of people may think that the public option is free .
It 's not , " Mr. Lieberman said .
" It 's going to cost the taxpayers and people that have health insurance now , and if it does n't , it 's going to add terribly to our national debt . "
link : http://online.wsj.com/...
Who ?
Who among your constituents who live in Connecticut think their public option is free ?
Name ten .
UPDATE 2 : Personal testimony on the Charter Oak Health Plan from dragonfire in the comments ...
The Charter Oak Plan is yes a Public Option - I am in the program - I have gotten better service through Charter Oak & Community Health here then Blue Cross .
Lab work 100 % Covered
Preventive care 100 % covered
1 Physical a year
Emergency room visit covered 100 %
I went to a UCONN dermatologist - $ 35 co pay A good program - I pay a fraction of what I paid with Blue Cross .
This Public Option works well - Lieberman need to be held accountable for not bringing this issue up .
Others across the nation deserve the same type of program .
The people of Connecticut are good , kind , generous people .
My friends and neighbors would not want to deny a fellow citizen access to healthcare just because they live in a different state .
Senator Lieberman severly underestimates the character of his constituents if he 's planning on filibustering a health care bill with a public option in their name .

The mindset that each party has in an M/s relationship is one of the most crucial factors for success .
However , I see little discussed online about this critical idea .
It seems that many focus on the actions as opposed the mindset one has .
This often leads to confusion and frustration .
What is the proper mindset of a slave ?
This is a question that is almost impossible to answer completely since there are individual factors which always come into play .
Since relationships are personal to those involved , it is difficult to offer a list of what is required for success .
Ultimately , that is up to the two parties ( or more if the situation is poly ) .
Nevertheless , I can offer some of my beliefs in this area .
To start , a slave needs to have the idea ofdrilled into his or her being .
A slave 's place is to serve the Master / Mistress .
That is one of the most basic tenets of the M/s world .
Service is the idea of making one 's life easier .
It is a slave 's position to handle whatever responsibilities that is thrown his or her way .
Another mindset quality that I feel is necessary is .
I use the word complete because many seem to feel this is a negotiable issue .
Many ( if not most ) will attempt to engage in manipulation in an effort to " get their way " .
This is not obedience .
Obedience is doing what you are told without question .
This is another fundamental difference between BDSM and the traditional world .
The total exchange of power means that all decision - making is with the one in charge .
Disputing those choices is not a slave 's place .is another trait that needs to be developed .
There are going to be many times when a Master / Mistress 's decisions go contrary to what one desires .
This is the way it is .
A slave needs to accept that decision while obediently following it .
I see too many who take the action yet have offer an attitude that would kill a bear .
Everyone within a thousand yards knows exactly how he or she feels .
This is intolerable and potentially embarrassing to a Master / Mistress .
is something else that I believe every slave needs .
There are many times when a Master / Mistress is off on other affairs .
Whether it is work or play , dominant types often can have many areas of responsibility .
This is something that a slave needs to accept .
The timing of things is another area which is determined by the one in charge .
The role of a slave is often to wait until the Master / Mistress is ready for him or her .
Another factor I feel is crucial is .
I see many who come to BDSM without the emotional maturity to handle reality .
This is one of the major areas where real time differs from online .
Those who believe online is reality tend to be unprepared for what transpires when they make the transition .
Putting one 's faith in fantasy is a form of psychosis that tends to receive professional help .
For example , we institutionalize those who believe in purple elephants .
Sadly , they are as real as many online people .
A slave needs to have the inner strength to handle the different emotions that one goes through when living in M/s .
Part two will offer up some other ideas for the successful mindset of a slave .

Filmmaker Patrick
Shen shares his thoughts how the fear of death influences ourselves and society in very real ways .
By most accounts , the state of the world is in dire shape .
The collective madness of humanity seems unable and perhaps unwilling to change its destructive habits , both on the environment and each other .
But what if we could dig deep into our psyche , to understand the root causes of many of our behaviours on a psychological , spiritual , and cultural level ?
That was the goal set forth by Patrick Shen , a documentary filmmaker who set out to uncover the source of “ death anxiety ” and how it influences our lives on a daily basis .
The result : Flight From Death : The Quest For Immortality .
( watch the trailer ) .
I caught up with Patrick to discuss the film , the nature of death anxiety , and how to make our own lives a work of art .
BNT : How did you come up with the concept for Flight From Death ?
PATRICK SHEN : I stumbled upon Ernest Becker ’s monumental , Pulitzer Prize - winning book Denial of Death one day at a used book store .
I had never heard of it , but the title intrigued me and and I had been asking a lot of the same questions that , according to the back cover , this book seemed to address ; so I picked it up .
I was totally awakened by it .
Reading Denial of Death marked a major intellectual shift in my life .
I wanted everyone to know about the ideas in this book and immediately began exploring the possibility of translating it into documentary form .
Making the film and getting to explore it more in such an intense way , marked yet another major shift in my life .
You mention the shoot took 4 years .
How did the length of the shoot impact your vision of the film ?
Further , how did you change from the beginning to the end ?
The whole production , inclusive of post - production , took about four years .
We shot the film over a period of about two and a half years .
I remember feeling like the scope of the film kept expanding with every month that went by .
The more time we had to think about the movie , the more we wanted to include in it and the more ambitious we became .
Director Patrick Shen
I love that one film critic in Australia would later refer to Flight from Death as “ one of the most ambitious movies ever made . ”
Four years gave us a lot of time to painstakingly craft what is possibly the most thorough introduction to Becker ’s ideas that our little brains could possibly muster at the time .
The events of 9/11/01 certainly had an impact on the vision of the film .
9/11 gave us an opportunity to examine Becker ’s ideas within the context of a current event that the entire world was now discussing and attempting to process .
As devastated as we were , not to mention distraught over having lost a friend and fellow crew member that day , I knew we needed to act quickly to incorporate it into the movie .
In the film we focus on the work of three experimental social psychologists who created Terror Management Theory based on the ideas of Ernest Becker .
In a nutshell , the theory states that humans , in order to function properly in light of our impending death , need to feel like we are a significant participant in a meaningful worldview .
Without the meaningful context within which we live out our lives , we are stripped of all things that make us feel human and must confront the possibility that we are no more significant than an ant or a fern .
“ In order to function properly in light of our impending death , need to feel like we are a significant participant in a meaningful worldview . ”
Naturally , an attempt to weaken or to suggest that one ’s worldview is invalid , is not taken lightly .
At the time , the trio of psychologists had already conducted close to 300 experiments to substantiate this claim .
After the events of 9/11 , we found ourselves in the middle of a terror management theory experiment taking place on a grand scale .
It allowed us to show that Becker ’s ideas were as relevant then as they were when Denial of Death was first published in 1973 .
I changed pretty dramatically throughout the course of making the film .
I began the journey of making Flight from Death with a predominantly academic and intellectual point of view .
I was a man of scientific thought and logical inquiry and it was exactly those elements of Becker ’s work that had resonated most with me initially .
Upon a closer and more honest investigation of Becker ’s work , I began to see that he asks much more of us , beyond just a scientific approach , in our exploration of the problem of the human condition .
Many people mistake Denial of Death for being an atheistic text – as I did in the beginning – and often use Becker ’s ideas to bolster an atheistic point of view .
Becker was not interested in debunking religion , though I think he probably had his doubts .
In fact , I think Becker was very curious about religion , judging by his documented correspondence with a priest for many years and his fondness for reading Psalms .
In addition , Becker ’s work borrows heavily from Kierkegaard , a devout Christian .
It ’s very possible that Becker considered the religious solution as a viable means to combatting our anxiety .
I ’m not suggesting that we all run out and go to church , but I am suggesting that we approach the problem of death anxiety – of the human condition – with a multi- disciplinary approach , just as Becker had done with his work and just as we should approach all things so significant in scope .
You assert that all culture can be attributed to dealing with death anxiety .
Can you elaborate further on your point ?
From anthropology we learn that a culture , or shared set of beliefs about the nature of reality , is specific to a particular region or people group .
There may be some underlying general commonalities ( i.e. Most cultures have a creation story ) but the particular beliefs and practices of one culture can differ significantly and often even appear contradictory to those of another .
Filming an interview
As the film points out , a gifted basketball player whom we shower with fame , fortune , and praise in the United States has much less relevance in another culture which might value more the ability to catch a fish or sustain hours of uninterrupted meditation .
Success , or heroism , in one culture clearly does not necessarily translate to another .
Becker theorizes that it is our shared set of beliefs that make it possible for us to feel like we are significant participants in a meaningful universe and that without them , we are confronted with the possibility that we are nothing more than a living , breathing , decaying piece of meat no different than the next life form .
Culture then essentially elevates us beyond the physical world – and its limitations along with it ( i.e. death ) – and provides definition for our symbolic world , the world within which we truly live out our lives .
In the physical world , we ’re doomed .
We ca n’t win .
We ’ll die someday and there ’s nothing we can do about it .
Culture provides us the rules and the formula by which we can win , at least symbolically .
“ The more people we surround ourselves with that believe the same things we do about the nature of reality , the more confident we can feel that what we believe is true . “
There are two general methods we employ to do this .
Heroism is our attempt to transcend the natural order of things .
When we achieve more than what others have , effectively transcending the natural order , we enter into the super - natural .
The hero stands out amongst the crowd and achieves a sense of symbolic immortality for now he is more than just that decaying piece of meat and also stands a better chance at never being forgotten .
The other method is to immerse ourselves in a cause or belief system that is larger and more permanent than we are .
Organisms often have a better chance at survival when they stick together ( i.e. strength in numbers ) .
As symbolic creatures , we do the same to survive .
The more people we surround ourselves with that believe the same things we do about the nature of reality , the more confident we can feel that what we believe is true .
More importantly , when we are a part of something that will continue on long after we have gone , we too feel like a part of us will go on after we die .
Gabriel Byrne makes a poignant comment about how editing a film is made up of choices : such as a person walking , or a bird taking flight .
He compares these disconnected moments as much like life itself .
What are your thoughts on his comment ?
I think what he meant was that life is inherent in everything around us .
Our mental capacity as humans allows to see that life is an incredible phenomenon and if we take the time to notice it , there ’s evidence of this phenomenon infused in every movement we make .
Some immortalists believe that science will eventually eliminate aging and death altogether .
In the film , you insist that ending “ natural death ” may actually increase death anxiety , as we can never eliminate accidental death .
What do you say to futurists like Ray Kurzweil who continue to pursue immortality through science ?
I think it ’s an interesting endeavor for sure and I ’d be lying if I said I was n’t curious about what it would be like to live forever .
As you point out in your question however , the potential for us to be robbed of our immortality because of an accidental death is even more terrifying than if we are being robbed of say 50 years .
I worry that if we have not found a way to constructively process our death anxiety then we are n’t ready to live forever .
In the film , there is a lot of evidence and experimental data to suggest that much of our aggressive behaviors and the violence in the world stems from our inability to reconcile with death anxiety .
If this is true , what will happen if our death anxiety is increased even two - fold , let alone ten or twenty ?
How has the film been your own attempt to deal with death anxiety ?
How has meeting your death head on affected your outlook on life ?
Admittedly , this film and all films I make , serve a vital role for me in dealing with my own death anxiety .
It is certainly my way of leaving my mark on the world .
Flight From Death / BUY DVD
It ’s an attempt at heroism .
It ’s proof of my existence and that maybe I mattered in some way .
The creative solution to the problem of death anxiety is an intriguing one .
Van Gogh , and his longing to make his mark , left us with many great works of art .
I think transferring our anxieties onto creative works whether they are artistic endeavors or not , can be a very satisfying , and at the same time , constructive way to deal with death anxiety .
Making Flight from Death and dwelling on death for so many years both heightened my anxiety and at the same time soothed it .
Because I ’m perhaps more aware of death and how it lurks in every shadow and around every corner , I ’m more careful .
Because I now have a family , that awareness has heightened even more .
It ’s sometimes troubling how much it influences me .
The challenge for me is to take that anxiety and rather than let it discourage me from fully engaging the world around me , use it to fuel my passion for living .
I have developed a real passion for creating a masterpiece out of life , which is probably the ultimate creative endeavor .
My level of appreciation for the opportunity to continuing living each day has evolved into a genuinely overwhelming sense of gratitude .
A healthy awareness of death – surely a constant work - in - progress for us all – has given each moment in my life , on most days , a whole new dimension that is now impossible to ignore .
It struck me that much of what you call “ death anxiety ” in the film is really what Buddhists would call “ ego death anxiety . ”
Further , Buddhists offer a concrete method , meditation , to transcend the ego and acheive a profound inner calm .
I ’m curious why you never explored this connection in the film ?
It ’s an intriguing solution for sure .
We actually interviewed two Buddhists in the film , David Loy and a close friend of Becker ’s , Ron Leifer .
In Buddhism as you might know there is this notion of “ no self ” .
If our ego does not exist and if we can train ourselves to realize this through meditation and essentially disconnect from our - selves , there will be no death anxiety to contend with .
I think the problem lies in the meditation .
To achieve that kind of discipline and consistency of focused ( or should I say un- focused ? ) meditation can take most of us a lifetime to master .
Also , the ego and the threat of losing our egos to death , has driven humanity to do great things , to innovate , and achieve great feats .
What happens to this spirit of progress and creation when the ego is removed from the equation ?
These are all really interesting things to continue discussing .
We did n’t explore this nor any other religious solutions in the film because it would have required that the film be twice as long and twice as more expensive to make .
It ’s really deserving of its own film .
Why have humans continuously chosen a “ life destroying illusion ” for so many years ?
What is needed to shake us out of our collective dellusion ?
Humans are a pretty immature form of life in the grand scheme of things .
We ’re like a five year - old being handed the keys to a Corvette .
Our brains are capable of incredible things that are both beautiful and horrific and we have n’t quite figured out how to stay out of trouble .
We take the lives of others because we ’ve convinced ourselves that killing is a viable means of solving our problems .
“ Since we can not see as the angels see , everything we look at , even if it is demonstrably real , is at best a shadow of the truth .
To take the next step , to claim that we are in full posession of the truth , is to put ourselves in the place of angels – without noticing that we passed from knowledge ( angelic ) to belief ( human ) . ” - James Carse
Generation after generation , we ’ve inherited this belief .
It is the animal inside the human that is merely trying to survive and dispose of any threats .
If mice had the capacity to build a tank and an atom bomb , I ’m sure there would be no cats left in the world .
We are , as Freud calls it , a “ sick animal ” .
In my opinion , what needs to happen is a re-examination of our definition and our relationship with truth .
To prove one set of beliefs more true than another is not only unknowable but un-winnable .
We ’ve tried that route and have created enemies out of one another and have left billions dead in our path .
Our notion of truth , or perhaps we should call it belief , is nothing more than an estimation of reality .
There may sometimes be accurate estimations , but they are speculative nonetheless .
What we believe to be true as five year - olds is not always the same as what we believe as 70 year - olds .
If belief can change , then belief cannot be absolutely true .
It is as James Carse writes in his book The Religious Case Against Belief , “ belief is not privileged over knowledge , it is fully open , unfinished , and tentative . ”
In other words , truth is a work in progress .
Rigid belief leaves no room for our worldviews to be inclusive of other people .
We would all forever remain “ the other ” to one another each living within the context of our exclusive and flawed worldviews .

ClimateGate gets even more bizarre
By Detector | 04 June 2008
Every significant Internet provider around the world is currently in talks with access and content providers to transform the internet into a television - like medium : no more freedom , you pay for a small commercial package of sites you can visit and you ’ll have to pay for separate subscriptions for every site that ’s not in the package .
This is not a rumor ; this is just clear fact for violation the principles of net neutrality and freedom of any internet user .
If “ they ” ( ISP ’s companies ) succeed with their plans every smaller websites / services / blogs will disappear and multinationals with big budgets will finally success with their secret plans .
Debate for net neutrality has several years history .
There have been many lawsuits in cases where an ISP ’s blocked access to a certain competitor ’s site ( small or big ) .
Other example is that ISP ’s in several occasion crippled download speeds on services that they felt were using up too much of their bandwidth .
Insider contacts of some major ISP ’s confirmed that informations .
All of this happened because Internet users are very active and focused : they only go to the sites and services they want , users simply switch to something else if one service becomes too commercialized with annoying advertisements .
With that users go around classical mayor medium industries which offer psychological chew informations and advertisement .
With this users freedom , it ’s no surprise that the past 6 years the industries have secretly been planning a ‘ take - over ’ to secure the Internet as a purely commercial playground .
Major Internet providers are currently making agreements and planning to switch simultaneously , somewhere in the year 2012 .
This is currently all going on under very strict Non-Disclosure Agreements because the last thing they want is the masses speaking out against it .
The guys from the video are well - known net neutrality activists , and they have contacts with many big internet industry insiders .
They a part of I Power website which is platform for joining forces , sharing ideas and spreading awareness ( http://ipower.ning.com).
What we can do about this conspiracy ?
The answer is simple : Spread the word and use any political or media contacts you may know .
Together let ’s make sure that by 2012 , ISP ’s will not dare to think about anything that goes against the principles of net neutrality .
People are becoming aware of the conspiracy of those internet industries .
Free people can pressure those ISP’s .
People must keep pushing for net neutrality laws and must start spreading awareness on a massive scale to make sure that ISP ’s think twice before signing anything that ’ll go against the freedom of Internet as open medium like it is today .
And , on the end : ask yourself a questions :
Why ISP ’s constantly growing their bandwidths for internet mass users ?
Is that just for reading emails or writing blogs for those masses ?
Or , there is something else behind that ?

For Immediate Release
( Washington , D.C. , December 14 , 2009 )
The holiday season is in full - swing , and humanists across the country are joining the merriment and revelry with their own , secular holiday : HumanLight .
Celebrated on or about December 23 , HumanLight is a time for celebration and community for those who wish to affirm the positive values of humanism during the time period of the “ traditional ” winter holidays .
“ Humanist families enjoy the holiday season in many of the same ways that other people do , ” said Roy Speckhardt , American Humanist Association ( AHA ) executive director and father of two .
“ Many people are under the false assumption that humanists are a bunch of Scrooges who do n’t celebrate the winter holidays , but actually , we humanists appreciate and enjoy the season in ways that reflect and promote the humanist values of reason , hope , community and compassion . ”
“ Because humanists shy away from rigid rituals , the specific elements of HumanLight celebrations will differ from region to region , and even year to year , ” continued Speckhardt .
“ But they often include a meal with friends and family , dance , song , gift exchange , and short talks , discussions or readings .
Some aspects are similar to religious observances while others are different . ”
In 2001 humanists in New Jersey inaugurated HumanLight as a specifically humanist observance .
Since then it has spread to dozens of cities around the United States .
The American Humanist Association ( www.americanhumanist.org) advocates for the rights and viewpoints of humanists .
Founded in 1941 and headquartered in Washington , D.C. , its work is extended through more than 100 local chapters and affiliates across America .
Humanism is the idea that you can be good without a belief in God .

In his classic MMA training manual B.J. Penn 's Mixed Martial Arts : The Book of Knowledge , " The Prodigy " writes : " The rear - naked choke is the best move ever invented .
Once you 've got it locked in , you 're pretty much guaranteed the victory .
However with most fighters spending lots of time polishing their submission defense , it can sometimes be a difficult submission to lock in . "
B.J. has applied his formidable jiu jitsu mind to several ways to foil the submission defense of even the most skilled and experienced fighters .
Diego Sanchez has to be planning on beating up Penn on the feet and then getting and keeping top position on the ground .
Because if B.J. Penn gets on Diego 's back , we 're likely in for a very short night and if B.J. wins by submission , it 's very likely to be by way of " the best move ever invented " -- the Rear - Naked Choke .
Five out of B.J. 's six professional submission wins have come by way of the rear - naked choke .
Let 's look at a couple of examples of the bag of tricks that B.J. uses to set up his dreaded rear - naked choke in the full entry , with animated gifs .
In the gif on the right we see Penn working from back control on Jens Pulver at The Ultimate Fighter 5 Finale .
He 's threatening to wrap his left arm around Pulver 's neck and get the choke finish .
Penn is using his right arm to push Pulver 's right arm down by his waist .
This forces Pulver to using his own left arm to defend himself .
Once Pulver lifts his left arm , Penn pulls it further back and then grabs Pulvers fingers and pulls the arm down .
At the same time Pulver is fighting to raise his right arm and he thinks he 's succeeding .
That 's when B.J. springs the trap and wraps his left leg around Pulver 's left arm , pinning it helplessly to his side .
On the left we see the completion of the play .
Once he 's got Pulver 's arm trapped , it 's like a 2 on 1 play in basketball .
Pulver gamely tries to defend his throat , but with Penn having two arms with which to attack , it 's a deeply uneven contest .
In fact , B.J. Penn on your back is a lot like having a sort of combination giant spider - octopus on your back seeking to strangle you .
Note how he hooks his right arm under Pulver 's right armpit which totally renders Pulver 's throat defenseless as Penn threads his left arm under the chin and he 's got the choke .
Then he unhooks his right arm from under Pulver 's right and locks in the figure four and finishes the choke .
Here on the right we see the culmination of B.J. 's most recent title defense against Kenny Florian at UFC 101 .
Florian has some advantages over Pulver .
He 's got longer arms and a great deal more jiu jitsu expertise .
Initially he 's doing quite a bit better than Pulver as well .
Penn 's not able to force either of Florian 's arms down to his side so there 's no opening to use his leg to trap an arm .
In fact , Florian has his own version of the 2 - on - 1 going against Penn 's left arm .
But look at B.J. 's right heel .
He starts driving it into Florian 's short rib and liver in a nasty little series of three heel kicks .
Annoyed by the blows , Florian seemingly can't resist dropping his right forearm down to block the kicks and protect his liver .
Then he raises his arm again to throw an ineffectual elbow back toward 's Penn 's face .
Penn throws one more heel kick and then a second .
That 's when Florian makes the fatal mistake of dropping his right wrist down to protect himself .
Like lightening , Penn immediately cinches his left arm around Florian 's throat and sinks in the choke .
If Diego " The Nightmare " Sanchez has been watching too much of Penn 's old fight footage , I would n't be surprised if he 's the one having the nightmares .

It is common to argue that intellectual property ( IP ) in the form of copyrights and patents is crucial for the creation of innovative ideas and inventions such as machines , drugs , software , books , and music .
Proponents argue that IP is just like ordinary property in houses and cars .
In fact , empirical evidence shows that IP does not promote innovation and that , unlike ordinary property , it is detrimental to the social good .
What does the Constitution say ?
Contrary to popular myth , the US Constitution does not provide authors or inventors with special rights :
It merely gives Congress the option of " securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries . "
The purpose of granting such private monopolies is solely to " promote the progress of science and useful arts . "
Is Congress justified in granting such private monopolies ?
Is the judiciary correct in continuously extending their areas of enforceability ?
Do they in fact " promote the progress of science and useful arts " ?
These are not abstract issues .
The outcome of the Bilski v. Kappos case currently before the US Supreme Court may substantially alter what is patentable .
As economists , we are convinced that incentives matter .
So how can we argue that offering a reward in the form of monopoly does not increase creation and innovation ?
Incentives cut both ways
As a matter of theory , intellectual property is a double - edged sword .
On the one hand , giving a reward increases the incentive to innovate .
On the other , allowing the monopolization of existing ideas taxes the creation of new ones , thereby decreasing the incentive to innovate .
The bottom line : Contrary to widespread belief , economic theory does not provide support for the continuous extension of IP .
The only answer to the question of whether IP serves the desired purpose must be empirical .
Does it work in practice ?
A great deal of applied economic research has tried to answer this question .
The short answer is that intellectual property does not increase innovation and creation .
Extending IP rights may modestly boost the incentive for innovation , but this positive effect is wiped away by the negative effect of creating monopolies .
There is simply no evidence that strengthening patent regimes increases innovation or economic productivity .
In fact , some evidence shows that increased protection even decreases innovation .
The main finding is that making it easier to get patents increases … patenting !
The heavy price we pay for patents
Ideas kept under lock and key are much less useful than those that are freely available .
So we find Africans dying of AIDS because they cannot afford to pay monopoly prices to patent holders of certain drugs .
Or , at a more mundane level , we cannot legally watch movies on our new Android phones because " rights holders " do not wish us to .
And we must suffer through such indignities as being sued by voting machine companies over copyright violation when their malfunctioning software is revealed to the public .
To these direct and visible costs other , most likely larger , hidden costs should be added .
These are the legal costs of the patent and copyright system and the social costs of lobbying , rent - seeking , and patent - peddling .
While their dollar amount is difficult to quantify , their pervasiveness is in front of us daily .
Do you remember the threat to shut down the BlackBerry network over a patent dispute ?
Did you read about yet another company wasting money accumulating a large portfolio of patents with which to defend itself against " trolls " ?
And for what ?
If we got more innovative new products , perhaps it would be worth it .
But the evidence shows we do not .
We get only more legal fights and more congressional lobbying .
Is intellectual property needed as a shield for the weak against the strong ?
Those of us who have yet to make our name in the media markets should fear obscurity rather than piracy .
Nor is intellectual property protection against merciless corporations .
Rather , it is a tool these corporations use against the small .
Patents are no real protection
Your patent is simply a ticket to lifelong litigation against a giant .
Read up on the story of Philo T. Farnsworth – the inventor of television died a broken man trying to enforce his patent against the monster RCA .
Contrast that with Eli Whitney , who after unsuccessfully trying to profit from his patent on the wildly successful cotton gin , gave up on intellectual property , moved on , and made a fortune by inventing the modern factory .
Rather than trying to continually fix the existing system with band - aids , it would be far better to eliminate it entirely .
The resulting drastic restructuring of industry would lead to new , more competitive business models – and an environment far more favorable to the small entrepreneur .
Why are we keeping alive a system of legally protected private monopolies that does not deliver on its promises and , instead , generates a vast number of socially damaging activities ?
The answer seems twofold : legislative and political inertia on the one hand , and vested monopolistic interests exploiting the status quo on the other .
If we wish to innovate our way out of the current economic crisis , we must start by dismantling the myth of intellectual property , and then search for a system of property rights capable of genuinely fostering innovation and productivity .
David K. Levine and Michele Boldrin are professors of economics at Washington University in St. Louis , and the authors of " Against Intellectual Monopoly . "

Opinion :
In a Wikipedia age , should all ideas be free ?
Just when you thought this situation could n’t get any worse .
Chicago Bulls head coach Vinny Del Negro is already fired according to a report from ESPN ’s Chris Broussard , but because the Bulls have been unable to decide on a replacement they are keeping Del Negro on as the head coach .
The report gets even weirder :
There were discussions recently within the organization about having John Paxson , Chicago ’s executive vice president of basketball operations , take over the team , but Paxson ultimately decided against it .
Then , according to sources , Chicago contacted former Bulls coach Doug Collins , a candidate for the job two years ago when Del Negro was hired , but Collins was not interested in coaching the club .
You ca n’t blame Collins for not wanting to walk into this .
It ’s also now apparent that John Paxson and Gar Forman are n’t sure what they want to do , and they certainly have n’t done much planning .
It ’s shocking .
They decide to can Del Negro and they pick up the phone to call Doug Collins ?
Nothing against Doug — he would have been the best choice 2 years ago — but he said no then .
Coaches are hired to be fired .
You know when you start making contingency plans for a new coach ?
The day that you hire a new coach .
Every GM should have an idea of who they want as their next coach because you never know what could happen .
This organization made some decent strides to become contenders again .
But somewhere along the way we took a U - turn .
This year is so done .
Trade all the pieces you can to maximize free agency in 2010 .
Hire a coach with that in mind too .
Can you get Amar’e Stoudemire from Phoenix for Tyrus Thomas ?
Can you get Joe Johnson in free agency ?
Can you draft a starting 2 guard with your lottery pick– Avery Bradley , Xavier Henry or Evan Turner ?
Can you get Chris Bosh by signing Sam Mitchell to coach the Bulls ?
I hope the Bulls are spit - ballin’ like this .
If they are calling Doug Collins , chances are they are n’t .
On a veteran board known as Hadit.com where I have been a member since October 2002 James Scripps posted this notice at 1230 am this morning , excited to say the least
On November 2 , 2009 , I won the first ever VA claim for Agent Orange exposure , " inside the Continental United States . "
The claim was granted for Chloracne , Diabetes and Heart Disease with ICD implant , as due to Agent Orange exposure at Fort Gordon GA. , in the years 1967 - 1969 .
You will be able to read the Board Of Veterans Appeals detailed decision along with the supporting evidence at WWW.va.gov in a couple of months when it is posted .
From the web site choose Board of Veterans Appeals , then click on Decisions .
Next type in the search box Docket No.08 - 11 937 .
Due to the AICD implant , Class 3 CHF and a LVEF of 25 % there should be a 100 % P&T award .
Other than a $ 15.00 Medicare copay , here and there , no money was spent on an IMO , so take heart , you do n't have to be rich to win !
James M. Cripps ,
Vietnam Veterans OF America Tennessee Agent Orange Committee Chairman .
In otherwords he recieved his notification letter from the Board of Veteran Appeals .
This tells me two things , that veterans with heart disease will now have their claims granted as being related to Agent Orange exposure , as this is the first grant known by the Board since Secretary Shinseki made the conditions presumptive .
This shows other veterans where ever they were exposed to AO that if they have heart disease , they will get their veterans benefits , thanks to President Obama 's appointee making this decision to make heart disease presumtive to AO exposure .
Many veterans have felt that their heart problems were somehow related to the dioxin exposure , other medical studies had shown this relationship , but the federal government relied on research data from a study named " Ranch Hand " which was conducted by the Air Force as it was mostly Air Force planes that sprayed the toxic substances in Vietnam .
Many people had complained that the study ignored to many suspected medical issues like heart disease , due to the high cost of liability if that connection was ever made , even Admiral Zumwalt was concerned about this , his son died from cancer related to AO exposure he received while on military service in Vietnam .
This is a great day for James Scripps and his family , it is a greater day for all of this nations veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange either in Vietnam or anyplace else in the world , if they can prove they were exposed even in CONUS or as the rest of us call it the United States , and they have heart disease , the nation will now keep the " PROMISE " and most of the future veterans making the same claim that James Scripp made will not have to wait four and a half years to obtain their veterans benefits .
Congratulations to James and his family , and my eternal thanks to Secretary Shinseki for doing the right thing regardless of the cost in making the right call to add these three medical conditions as presumptive and stopping the denial of compensation to these veterans and their families .
It has been 34 years since the Vietnam war ended officially , this win for the nations veterans was a long time in coming , and I do n't believe it would have happened without Eric Shinseki making that call .
President Obama picked this nations veteran the best advocate they have had in years .
Thank you .
UPDATE
It has been pointed out to me that James Scripps claim was handled similar to those of Vietnam Veterans exposed to AO they get diagnosed with Diabetes type 2 then get cardiac problems service connected as a secondary conditions to their DM2 diagnosis and this may not have anything to do with Secretary Shinseki 's recent decision to make cardiac conditions as a presumptive condition as a stand alone issue .
We will not know the real reason for the BVA award until the decision is posted online at the BVA site in about 2 months , the only difference is that this is the first case of AO that has been service connected for exposure in the United States , yes all Nam vets are automatically considerd to have been exposed to Agent Orange veterans in other places have to fight on a case by case basis , Guam , Thailand , Korea , Panama etc , this man was at Fort Gordon Georgia where he sprayed the AO himslef as part of his military duties .
So the whole truth wo n't be known for a few months yet .
The eight Americans that died yesterday in a suicide bombing at a military base in eastern Afghanistan were all CIA agents , according to US officials .
The bombing happened at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost province near the border with Pakistan .
The US officials said they could not provide details pending notification of the agents ' families .
CIA officials were not immediately available to comment .
The deaths were confirmed late in the evening by an American official in the Afghan capital Kabul .
A senior US official in Washington said the Americans were killed by an attacker wearing a suicide vest .
He said there were conflicting reports on the number of casualties and that other people were wounded in the attack .
The attack came on the day that an Afghan presidential delegation investigating the deaths of 10 people in eastern Afghanistan concluded that civilians — including children — were killed in an attack involving foreign troops , disputing Nato reports that the dead were insurgents .
Asadullah Wafa , a senior adviser to President Hamid Karzai , said eight children between the ages of 12 and 14 were among the dead discovered in a village house in the Narang district of Kunar province .
A Nato official has said initial reports from troops involved in the fighting on Sunday indicated that those killed were insurgents — all young males .
Several hundred Afghans protested against the deaths yesterday in the eastern city of Jalalabad and in Kabul .
In Jalalabad they burnt US President Barack Obama 's effigy and an American flag , chanting “ death to Obama and Karzai ” .
In Kabul protesters chanted : “ Unity , unity , death to the enemy of Islam ! ” , and a protester with a bullhorn called on Mr Obama to “ take your soldiers out of Afghanistan ” .
Mr Wafa said he was convinced that all those killed in the Kunar incident were innocent civilians .
“ I have talked to the principal of the school in the village and he gave us details about the killed children , ” he said .
“ The schoolchildren can not be al - Qaida .
I confirm they are innocent people killed by mistake .
I talked to President Karzai about the findings . ”
The bodies had already been buried by the time Mr Wafa 's team arrived .
A joint Afghan - Nato probe will continue to investigate what happened .
Col Wayne Shanks , spokesman for Nato's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan , said at a news conference yesterday that the allegations were being investigated together with Afghan authorities .

Diabetes can lead to damaged feet and toes
The number of people in England having a limb amputated because of type - two diabetes has risen dramatically , a study has shown .
Between 1996 and 2005 , below - ankle amputations doubled to more than 2,000 , and major amputations increased by 43 % .
However the number of amputations in people with type - one diabetes dropped , an Imperial College London team found .
A charity said more early diagnosis was needed , as diabetes can go undetected for more than 10 years .
The number of people diagnosed with type - two diabetes had increased greatly in the past decade , which could partly explain the findings , the researchers said .
In the UK , 2.35 million people have type - two diabetes , which is caused by the body not properly responding to the insulin it produces , and is often a result of lifestyle factors such as obesity .
DIABETES AND AMPUTATION
Type - one diabetes is caused by the body failing to produce insulin Type - two diabetes accounts for 90 % of cases and is caused by the body not responding properly to insulin or not producing enough Both types can impair blood flow to the feet People with diabetes can also suffer nerve damage and might not immediately notice a problem
If left unattended a small injury could develop into a hard - to - treat ulcer that could become infected , leading to the need for amputation Along with complications such as heart attacks and strokes , people with diabetes are far more likely to develop foot problems , including ulcers , which can become infected and lead to gangrene .
Writing in the journal Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice , the researchers said the number of the most major amputations , above the ankle joint , had risen by 43 % .
And the average age of those having above - ankle amputations fell from 71 to 69 years , which followed the pattern of people being diagnosed younger , they said .
More men underwent amputations than women , a gap that widened during the 10 - year period .
Study leader Dr Eszter Vamos said they had expected to see long - term complications of diabetes rising to some extent because the number of people diagnosed with the condition had increased .
" But at the same time there is very strong evidence that with a multidisciplinary team approach you can prevent up to 80 % of the amputations .
The findings of this study are especially interesting because they indicate a particular rise in the number of type - two diabetes related amputations
Sara Spiers
Diabetes UK
" It highlights the importance of frequent foot checks and that it is very important to get glycaemic control and blood pressure and cholesterol control . "
Diabetes UK care manager Sara Spiers said there were about 100 diabetes - related amputations each week in the UK .
" The findings of this study are especially interesting because they indicate a particular rise in the number of type - two diabetes related amputations , " she said .
" This rise could be for a number of reasons , including type - two diabetes not being diagnosed early enough , people not getting the education they need to manage their condition effectively , and swifter treatment of foot problems , meaning people are more likely to have an amputation than die because of foot ulcers . "
She added more early diagnosis was needed , as the condition could go undetected for more than 10 years and most people already had complications when they were diagnosed .

JRuby has made great progress with regards to performance .
A year ago , JRuby was the fastest implementation for Ruby 1.8 code .
JRuby performance has been raised with every release , and further improvements are on the horizon with the new intermediate representation ( IR ) that is beeing developed by Subbu Sastry .
InfoQ talked to Subbu to learn how this new IR looks and what benefits it will bring to JRuby .
Before talking about the new intermediate representation , how does the compiler currently do its work without the IR ?
Strictly speaking , the AST ( abstract syntax tree ) is also an IR ( intermediate representation ) – since it is not quite the source , and not quite the target language .
An IR , in the abstract , is a representation ( in - memory data structures , output " assembly " , etc. ) that has been chosen to capture the semantics of the source language but that also best enables the implementation in place .
Given that JRuby started off as an interpreter ( the best and easiest way to get a reference / prototype implementation of a language ) , and had to be fully compliant with the C MRI implementation which operates off the AST ( and possibly other reasons ) , the AST makes sense as the IR of choice .
( The JRuby AST is the output of the parser and is just a tree representation of the source code , containing different kinds of nodes , for example for classes , methods , variables .
It is also used by tools that analyze code , for example to provide automated refactorings . )
Over the last few years , performance concerns led to the development of a compiler that translated the AST into native bytecode so that interpretation overheads could be reduced and also so that HotSpot could get a go at optimizing ( inlining , etc. ) and compiliation down to hardware - native code .
The compiler does n't blindly compile everything though I think it can be deployed as an ahead - of - time ( AOT ) compiler .
It kicks in whenever method execution counters trip over some threshold .
Tom Enebo adds that " the JIT threshold is just a method invocation counter .
The counter can be configured ( it defaults to 50 right now ) by setting :
-J - D jruby.jit.threshold=<invocation count >
We have a couple of other tunables for the JIT for things like controlling how many methods we JIT " .
So how does the new representation look like , compared to the AST ?
The AST , while good for interpretation , is probably not the best choice of IR when it comes to implementation of " traditional " ( and other Ruby - specific ) compiler " optimizations " .
The new IR translates the AST into a series of instructions which are somewhat like high - level assembly .
An instruction is simply an operation ( branch , call , receive arg , return , etc. ) that operates on a bunch of operands ( which can either be variables , or fixnums , floats , arrays , closures , etc. ) .
At the start , a lot of operations end up being method calls , but the expectation is that some of these will optimized away ( inlined , etc. ) into native ( jvm-native , i.e. ) operations .
( Take a look at this post on the JRuby mailinglist to get an idea how the IR looks like . )
The IR will also include a bunch of other data structures like control flow graphs ( to represent the flow of control ) , class and method hierarchies , and later on , possibly static single assignment ( SSA ) forms for even better optimizations .
The goal throughout has been to represent the source in canonical form while preserving as much information from the front end as possible .
As the compiler passes run , the higher - level IR instructions might get broken down into lower - level IR ( call can get broken into lookup , method table load , and dispatch ) or other implicit information gets explicit ( heap frame allocation , heap frame loads and stores ) so that they can get further optimized .
As a bunch of " assembly " instructions , this new IR is also more linear in its representation – it is not a tree – but as noted above , there are other auxiliary data structures ( graphs ) that explicitly represent control flow , and sometimes data flow .
What other benefits does this new representation bring ?
This new IR is more suited for implementation of traditional compiler optimizations .
In addition , we are going to experiment with techniques that ( a ) inlines closures ( b ) inlines method calls ( c ) converts fixnum / float calls to native integer / long / float / double operations while unboxing them ( d ) for non- inlined closures , reduce heap load / store overheads .. and possibly others .
These would be much harder to do with an AST .
In addition , the expectation is that this IR will also consume less memory ( if implemented properly , of course ) – with memory peaking only during optimization phases .
As a canonical representation of operations , it might enable a simple interpreter implementation ( based off the IR instructions ) which now has to only work off a bunch of 10s of operations , as opposed to 100s of ast node types .
Do you already have a plan when the IR will be used in JRuby ?
We expect that it 'll be a while before the benefits of the new IR will materialize .
I would rather not put my feet in my mouth and say when this will be , but it will happen when it will happen .
For me , this is a fun project :-) .
But , the first steps we are planning to take is to build an interpreter that is based off the new IR instruction operations rather than AST nodes .
This will help give us confidence that we have covered our bases with respect to capturing all information that needs to be captured , test our hypotheses about improved interpreter performance ( we could be really off base , after all ) , and providing a base for implementing profiling ( that will in turn feed the compilation system as to where it needs to turn its attention to ) .
But , the IR is partly in place ( there are still some AST nodes which have n't been handled ) , control flow graphs are in place , some local optimizations are in place , dataflow framework is in place , some dataflow analyses and passes are in place , closure heap load / store optimization is in place , and more things will be added in the coming months .
In short , I do n't think there is any real alternative to building a tiered implementation on top of the jvm simply because of the semantic mismatch between ruby and the jvm .
We cannot expect the jvm to optimize away all the dynamic semantics of ruby which is a different and lengthy discussion altogether .
The code for the IR can be found on GitHub .
[ An outrageous $ 150 - a - month cable bill , cable boxes , Apple TV , Roku , Vudu , and half a dozen other TV devices ] are all behind me now .
I disconnected everything , threw it to the side and canceled the cable months ago .
Instead , now I have a Mac Mini , wireless mouse and a Microsoft Xbox hooked up to my television .
This quest for cable freedom has been a couple of years in the works .
Before I called the cable company to bid my farewell I imagined that I would need a vast array of devices to fill the entertainment void : a device for games , something for television shows , a contraption for streaming movies through Netflix and , finally , something to control all of the above .
But it turns out a computer can do all those tasks with some software upgrades and a wireless keyboard and mouse .

The United States is on the doorstep of comprehensive health care reform .
It 's a staggering achievement , about which I 'll have more to say later .
but the under - appreciated thing that strikes me at the moment is that it never would have happened if the Republican Party had played its cards right .
At the outset of this debate , moderate Democrats were desperate for a bipartisan bill .
They were willing to do almost anything to get it , including negotiate fruitlessly for months on end .
We can't know for sure , but Democrats appeared willing to make enormous substantive concessions to win the assent of even a few Republicans .
A few GOP defectors could have lured a chunk of Democrats to sign something far more limited than what President Obama is going to sign .
And remember , it would have taken only one Democrat to agree to partial reform in order to kill comprehensive reform .
I can easily imagine a scenario where Ben Nelson refused to vote for anything larger than , say , a $ 400 billion bill that Chuck Grassley and a couple other Republicans were offering .
But Republicans would n't make that deal .
The GOP leadership put immense pressure on all its members to withhold consent from any health care bill .
The strategy had some logic to it :
If all 40 Republicans voted no , then Democrats would need 60 votes to succeed , a monumentally difficult task .
And if they did succeed , the bill would be seen as partisan and therefore too liberal , too big government .
The spasm of anti-government activism over the summer helped lock the GOP into this strategy -- no Republican could afford to risk the wrath of Tea Partiers convinced that any reform signed by Obama equaled socialism and death panels .
The role of Olympia Snowe is interesting here .
Snowe negotiated seriously for months , and Democrats met what seemed to be her substantive concerns , but , like the Russian army retreating before Napoleon , she insisted that the bill be drawn out indefinitely .
Snowe demanded that the process not be rushed , but she never defined what a reasonable time frame would be .
In the summer , " taking your time " and " doing it right " meant waiting until after the August recess .
In the fall , it meant until after Thanksgiving .
Now it means until after Christmas .
If it lasted until next year , eventually Republicans would demand that the process not be rushed before the midterm elections , and that the fair thing would be to let the people decide in the 2010 elections .
The GOP leadership has every incentive to stretch the process out as long as possible .
It runs out the clock on the first two years of the Obama presidency , after which high unemployment and the natural effects of an off - year election would produce a Congress far less likely -- perhaps totally unwilling -- to cooperate with Obama .
Snowe might have diverged from the party line on substance , but she seems to have agreed to hold the line on process .
At some point , process becomes substance .
Thus Snowe effectively removed herself from the negotiations .
This was the final question last week at Pub Trivia , and our team won the evening with the same answer to this question that almost everyone else gave , probably the answer you ’ve heard before : a blue moon means two full moons in one calendar month .
This month , December 2009 , has a blue moon on the 31 , since it also had a full moon on the 2nd .
But I had the nagging feeling that I ’d read or heard somewhere ( probably on QI ) that the popular definition is wrong , that the real blue moon is n’t that straightforward .
When I got home , Google confirmed it :
We were wrong , quizmasters and all .
This idea that a month with two full moons is unusual points out the incongruity between the lunar cycle and our familiar 12 month , 365 day calendar .
Month and Moon are nearly the same word –why do n’t they mean the same thing ?
The answer , of course , is that they once did .
But nature seems to hate an integer * as much as it reportedly hates a vacuum , so a year is n’t an even 365 or 366 days or 12 orbits of the moon around the Earth ; neither does the moon take exactly 29 or 30 days to go around .
So the problem is one of successive approximation , dividing one number by another and dealing with the remainder .
A first approximation : the lunar calendar
The moon was a useful timekeeper , despite its reluctance to synchronize with the cycles of the seasons .
Instead of having to remember “ day 237 after the winter solstice is wheat - planting day ” , a farmer simply knew that the eighth moon is the wheat - planting moon .
The wheat did n’t care much if one year ’s full moon was 11 days earlier ( or 18 days later ) than the last year ’s .
Before the unveiling of the Julian calendar in 45 BC ( more on that later ) nearly all cultures on the planet used a calendar based on the cycles of the moon .
( The Mesoamericans are a notable exception , and that 2012 thing is complete malarkey .
Just saying . )
So here ’s the first rounding error :
Twelve cycles of the moon take between 354 and 355 days , but it ’s 365 or 366 days between winter solstices .
Or in other words , every two or three years will have thirteen full moons in it instead of twelve .
And this is where the “ blue ” moon comes in , the moon that ’s different from the others .
( Though at this time , months and moons were the same thing so there ’s not any question of having two of one in the other . )
If you have a Stonehenge or other primitive - but - awesome celestial observatory handy ( robed druids included ) to tell you exactly when the solstice occurs you ’ll notice that the phase of the moon and the solstice just about line up every 19 years .
( But not exactly .
Again , nature versus integers . )
And even if you do n’t , you ’d eventually notice that , on average , 7 of every 19 cycles of the seasons need 13 months instead of 12 to keep everything in sync , or you ’ll planting your wheat at the wrong time of year .
One interesting exception to this is the Islamic calendar , which has twelve lunar months and does n’t adjust to match the seasons .
This calendar is used for civil and religious purposes ; a separate solar calendar must be used for agriculture .
An Islamic , or hijri , year is on average 354.36 days long , so their calendar shifts forward by around 11 days each year relative to the seasons .
Ramadan is n’t just on different dates every year ( which would be more alarming to us if we did n’t have to deal with Easter ) , it crosses the seasons and returns to the same time of year every 33 years .
This also means their years are counting up around 3 % faster than seasonal years :
It ’s currently 1430 AH in the Islamic calendar , but in the year 20874 ( AH and AD ) their years will “ catch up ” with ours .
Next approximation : the solar calendar
In the Roman Republic the months were determined , as in most other cultures at the time , by priests ( or imams , robed druids , etc. ) who announced the presence of a new moon–and thus a new month–just after sunset .
( The word “ calendar ” comes from the Latin calare “ to call out , announce ” , by way of kalends , the first day of the Roman month . )
The Pontifex Maximus , high priest of the Roman religion , had the additional task of determining how long the year would be , 12 or 13 months , and therefore which day of the week important holidays would fall on–important stuff for a superstitious lot like the Romans .
Originally , this was a purely religious role , but by the middle of the first century BC Roman politics had become particularly nasty and the Pontifex Maximus could use the calendar as a political tool , choosing to add an extra month to years when allies were in power or denying an extra month to his enemies .
To what extent Julius Caesar did this after becoming Pontifex Maximus in 63 BC is n’t clear , but 17 years later , in 46 BC , Caesar reformed the calendar , taking the power to define the year away from the position .
The Julian reform declared that the Roman Republic would use a 365 day calendar with an extra day every 4 years .
( Sound familiar ? )
In other words , the year was approximated at 365 1/4 days .
To align the new calendar with the equinox , though , he had to add another two months to the already extended year , making 46 BC 445 days long .
Cicero called this “ the last year of confusion ” .
One last tweak : our modern calendar
By the end of the Middle Ages , it had become apparent that the Julian calendar had drifted away from the seasonal calendar .
This distressed the Catholic Church terribly because the most important thing in the world for the Catholic Church was celebrating Easter on the correct day .
It had spent the previous thousand years trying to sort it out and now it found that their calendar , the calendar that Caesar had set in motion 1600 years before , was missing the equinox by more than a week .
During this time , some very clever people had figured out that the Julian calendar was moving forward around 3 days every 400 years , and came up with a modification to the leap year scheme :
Every 100 years would not be a leap year , except for every 400 years .
( You may remember that 2000 was a double exception year–it would n’t have been a leap year , but it was .
So if you were n’t paying attention , you did n’t really miss anything . )
In 1582 , Pope Gregory XIII announced a reform of the calendar , the new leap year scheme along with a 10 - day shift to get the calendar synced back up with the seasons .
The Church and a number of Catholic countries adopted the new calendar on Friday , October 15th of 1582 , one day after ( Julian ) Thursday , October 4th .
Protestant Europe resisted this papist conspiracy until the 18th century ; the British Empire ( including the American colonies ) saw Thursday , September 14th follow Wednesday the 2nd in 1752 .
Sweden tried to make a gradual change by ignoring leap years until their calendar matched the Gregorian , but lost its nerve and switched back to the Julian calendar after 12 years .
To make up for a day gained in the interim , they added a 30th of February to 1712 .
In Alaska , the change took place in 1867 when US took possession of the territory from Russia , which still used the Julian calendar .
Because the international date line shifted at the same time , Friday , October 6th was followed by another Friday , the 18th of October .
Time in the future
Modern astronomy tells us that a year is , to within one day in a million years , 365.242199 days long .
The Julian calendar put 1 year as 365.25 days , for an error of 7.8 days per 1000 years .
The Gregorian calendar put 1 year as 365.2425 days , for an error of 0.3 days every 1000 years .
The astronomer Sir John Herschel proposed that the year 4000 and every 4,000th year after should not be a leap year in order to reduce this remaining error to about half a day every 10,000 years , but the standard has not yet been adopted .
New calendars have been proposed ( mostly to solve the problem of figuring out which day of the week any given date is ) but the Gregorian calendar ’s ordering of leap years is sufficient to keep the calendar aligned to the seasons as far into the future as we need .
Well , almost .
At this scale we begin to see that the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis is n’t constant , or even predictable .
The pull of the moon ’s gravity is slowing the rotation of the Earth , making each day longer by a fairly constant 2.3 milliseconds per century , but other factors , most notably shifting mass on and inside the planet , add to or subtract from this by a different amount every year .
Since 1967 , when the length of a second was standardized in precise atomic terms , days have been between 0.3 and 1 ms longer than the traditional 24 * 60 * 60 = 86,400 seconds .
As a result , every once in a while astronomers add a “ leap second ” to UTC , Coordinated Universal Time .
Surprisingly , while just about every year between 1972 and 1999 required a leap second to keep the clock synchronized with the Earth ’s rotation , there have only been two leap seconds added in the last ten years .
The Earth has sped up just a bit , and no one knows why .
Time in Cocoa
Since this is a Panic Engineering post , I should probably write something about calendars and programming .
If you ’re not a Cocoa programmer ( and even if you are ) , feel free to skip this –it wo n’t be on the test .
First , here ’s the code I used to find the year that the Islamic and Gregorian calendars meet .
The NSCalendar and NSDateComponents classes were introduced in OS X 10.4 to replace NSCalendarDate , and are also available on the iPhone OS .
They provide calendar operations such as converting NSDate objects to and from units of years , months , days , etc. , and finding the difference between two NSDates .
( Since we mentioned it above , it ’s worth noting that as far as the OS is concerned every day is 86,400 seconds long .
NSCalendar does not know about leap seconds . )
NSCalendar * gregorian = [ currentCalendar ] ; gregorian NSCalendar currentCalendar NSCalendar * islamic = [ [ alloc ] initWithCalendarIdentifier : NSIslamicCalendar ] ; islamic NSCalendar allocinitWithCalendarIdentifierNSIslamicCalendar NSDateComponents * components = [ [ alloc ] init ] ; components NSDateComponents allocinit [ components setDay : 1 ] ; [ components setMonth : 11 ] ; [ components setYear : 20874 ] ; //
Always use a format string in NSLog , even if it 's just @ " %@ " !
NSLog ( @ " %@ " , [ gregorian dateFromComponents : components ] ) ; NSLog ( @ " %@ " , [ islamic dateFromComponents : components ] ) ;
And here ’s a snippet showing the jump from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar on October 15th , 1582 .
Be aware that the default NSCalendar uses the Julian calendar before this date .
( For “ fun ” , check out October 1582 in iCal … )
[ components setDay : 15 ] ; [ components setMonth : 10 ] ; [ components setYear : 1582 ] ; NSDate * date = [ gregorian dateFromComponents : components ] ; dategregorian dateFromComponentscomponents NSLog ( @ " %@ " , date ) ; //
1582-10-15 00:00:00 -0800 NSDateComponents * offset = [ [ alloc ] init ] ; offset NSDateComponents allocinit [ offset setSecond :- 1 ] ; date = [ gregorian dateByAddingComponents : offset toDate : date options : 0 ] ; NSLog ( @ " %@ " , date ) ; //
1582-10-04 23:59:59 -0800
OS X 10.4 provided Gregorian , Buddhist , Hebrew , Islamic , Islamic Civil , and Japanese calendars .
10.6 added Republic of China ( for calendrical operations only , not formatting ) , Persian , Indian , and ISO8601 , the traditional calendar of ISO8601istan .
NSDateFormatter can format dates in any of these calendars :
NSDateFormatter * formatter = [ [ alloc ] init ] ; formatter NSDateFormatter allocinit [ formatter setDateStyle : NSDateFormatterFullStyle ] ; ( @ " Today's Gregorian date : %@ " , [ formatter string FromDate : [ date ] ] ) ; NSLogformatter stringFromDate NSDate date NSCalendar * buddhist = [ [ alloc ] initWithCalendarIdentifier : NSBuddhistCalendar ] ; buddhist NSCalendar allocinitWithCalendarIdentifierNSBuddhistCalendar [ formatter setCalendar : buddhist ] ; ( @ " Today 's Buddhist date : %@ " , [ formatter string FromDate : [ date ] ] ) ; NSLogformatter stringFromDate NSDate date NSCalendar * islamic = [ [ alloc ] initWithCalendarIdentifier : NSIslamicCalendar ] ; islamic NSCalendar allocinitWithCalendarIdentifierNSIslamicCalendar [ formatter setCalendar : islamic ] ; ( @ " Today 's Islamic date : %@ " , [ formatter string FromDate : [ date ] ] ) ; NSLogformatter stringFromDate NSDate date
Blue Moons
The article that told me I was wrong about what “ blue moon ” means ( and hilariously refers to that definition as “ trendy ” ) explains that the “ two full moons in a month ” definition is due to a misreading of the Maine Farmers ’ Almanac : the real Blue Moon is the third full moon in a season that has four full moons .
Why the third ?
The first full moon of the season is particularly significant ; e.g. , the Easter moon .
The moons before and after have names as well –the Lent Moon precedes the Easter Moon , whether it ’s the third or fourth moon of the winter–so the third moon of four is the extra one .
By this definition , 2009 does not have a blue moon , since the full moon on December 31st is after the solstice and belongs to next year ’s winter .
For an example of the importance of the sequence of the moons to daily life , consider Charlemagne ’s naming of the months of the year ( a solar year , but even so ) , used for over 700 years after his death :
Wintarmanoth , winter month
Hornung , the month when the male red deer sheds its antlers
Lentzinmanoth , Lent month
Ostarmanoth , Easter month
Wonnemanoth , love - making month
Brachmanoth , plowing month
Heuvimanoth , hay month
Aranmanoth , harvest month
Witumanoth , wood month
Windumemanoth , wine month
Herbistmanoth , autumn harvest month
Heilagmanoth , holy month
One etymology claims “ blue ” comes from belewe , “ betrayer ” .
Imagine if an extra moon showed up and delayed Wonnemanoth for 29 days .
Betrayer moon !
A : The third of four full moons in a season
The next day I emailed the quizmaster to let her know how we were all terribly , horribly wrong , that we ’d need to recount the scores , possibly have a do - over .
She said they ’d take either answer .
* A Correction
“ Nature hates integers ” is a gross oversimplification and ignores not just all of chemistry , where everything happens in even ratios , but the surprising phenomenon of orbital resonance .
Pluto and Neptune , for example , are phase - locked in a stable 2:3 resonance : Pluto orbits the sun exactly twice for every three of Neptune ’s orbits , and has for millions of years .
Our moon ’s rotation is locked to its orbit around the Earth due to tidal forces , which is why we only ever see one side of it .
For the same reason , the Earth ’s rotation is also slowing down and will eventually match the orbit of the moon .
At that point , billions of years from now , both a day and a month will last for around 47 of our current 86,400 - second - long days .
One side of the Earth will face the moon ; the other will never see it again .
The trial was the first by any government to scrutinise the CIA 's extraordinary rendition program , which human rights advocates say was the agency 's way to outsource the torture of prisoners to countries where it is practised .
A US State Department spokesman said : " We are disappointed by the verdicts against the Americans and Italians charged in Milan . "
Like Christmas decorations , as we get into December , down from the attic come the grunters and moaners , hypocrites , dogmatists and self - righteous sinners .
It 's the season of ill will and miserableness .
The usual suspects – schools , local authorities , Muslims , Hindus , Sikhs – are rounded up , charged with plotting to kill Christmas , or lethally wounding the celebrations with something called PC .
PC GONE MAD !!! , to be exact .
On a popular daytime TV show I was asked what I thought of Dundee council , which decided to have blasphemous " winter lights " this year because , say their accusers , they were too scared of offending other religions .
Bin Laden must be hiding in Dundee and beheadings would have followed if stars and angels had garlanded the streets .
The Lord Provost of the city fought back and reinstated " Xmas lights " .
The audience roared with approval when the presenter laid the blame on PC GONE MAD !!!
What if , I asked , there was only good intent behind the winter lights ?
November and December herald joyous festivals for many communities – why not share them with each other as people of these isles ?
Ca n't we even do that ?
These protests are not raised at all when " Christmas " lights are bought up by big business to advertise their goods – Disney in Regents Street , for example .
Ho !
Ho !
Ho ! and a bottle of Coke .

Next fight .
Nativity plays , say sections of the press , are now being banished from schools eager to suck up to us ethnics with Diwali dress - ups and Eid delights .
My children loved the story of Mary and the babe though they were always only goats and sheep .
How many schools ?
Which ones ?
Where ?
Can we have a league table please , Ed Balls ?
There is a real , nameless anxiety beneath these absurd and disagreeable national spats .
The meaning of this foundational and affirming festival seems to be crumbling away , a precious edifice falling to ruin like so many lonely churches .
But who did this ?
Who neglected to care and keep up the true spirit of Christmas and Easter ?
Not the so - damned army of PC enforcers but Christians themselves .
They who did not halt the Un - Christianing of Britain .
( Let us call it UC . )
Ralph Waldo Emerson asked in his essay on self - reliance : " Every Stoic was a Stoic ; but in Christendom where is the Christian ? "
By throwing themselves into displacement activity , church leaders can avoid responsibility for the faith drain .
Two Anglican Bishops , one of them Rev Jonathan Gledhill of Lichfield , urged Christians to wear crosses , not to show commitment but to become martyrs against PC GONE MAD !!!
Our fine - robed obfuscator , the Archbishop of Canterbury , a decent man and deep scholar , complained at the weekend that the political classes sidelined Christians and Christianity and were " focusing intently on Muslims " .
He chooses to ignore the crusading high church ex-PM and his worshipful Cabinet .
The whine about Muslims makes the grave man sound like a complaining , selfish child whose toy is not as big as the one given to the boy next door .
Meanwhile values that determine Christian belief and behaviour – generosity , love , forgiveness , modesty , fidelity , simplicity , spirituality – fall away .
Covetousness , adultery , vengeance , greed and consumerism spread through the land .
Forgive me for sounding like a fire and brimstone preacher .
The boy born under the star , son of God for Christians , was a lean ascetic who exhorted his flocks to sell what they owned to give to the poor .
St Nicholas , the original Father Christmas , born into a wealthy Christian family , did just that until his fortune was all gone .
Somehow he mutated into the obese bringer of excess and surfeit – gluttony personified .
The fat man won , pushed aside the saviour and the saint .
Archbishop Rowan Williams does not boldly call out against our capitalist dystopia .
And he should .
Rev Gledhill warns us , especially non-Christian Britons : " Christians are n't going to disappear quietly from the marketplace " .
The marketplace , he will be glad to hear , is teeming – flush with credit cards and shoppers buying drinks , party canapé trays , frocks and shoes , pure silver napkin claspers for the discerning lobster eater , snakeskin shoes , giant TVs and diamond bracelets .
The churches are empty and cold .
The people do not go in .
Too busy or not sure what the religion stands for .
Most powerful Christians do not fight robustly enough for progressive values .
There is fudge or surrender to conservatism on feminism and gay rights , for example .
They could have – but did n't – deafeningly condemned Blair 's war and told him not to wrap himself in their faith .
A whimper here and there is all we got from the church Establishment .
( The exception is Archbishop Sentamu of York . )
And so it is with the lost and disenfranchised .
Many humble Christian leaders do understand their role and the crisis .
They live by the eternal tenets of their faith , applying them to modern life and its myriad challenges .
Take one example .
Doctors from several of the Royal Colleges have called for incarcerated asylum children to be released this Christmas , as have dozens of children 's authors .
And so Rev. Canon James Rosenthal and Rev. Professor Nicholas Sagovsky took presents to the asylum children held in Yarl 's Wood detention centre .
The guards would n't let the kind men through .
Many of the young there are severely traumatised ; some self - harm and may never recover .
Mary had to seek refuge .
Here , today , she would have had to nurse her infant behind razor wire and kept in her place by hardened guards .
How heartening it would be if Rowan Williams , instead of moaning about the status of Christianity , had chosen instead to seriously take on the government at this time , animating the central motif of his great religion .
I have often said that some Muslims and our leaders are betraying the Islam I grew up with – their brutal Islamism steps on the faith in our hearts .
Christianity too is being failed by its own and needs to rediscover its beatific roots .
Love Divine is what makes this religion great and good .
I do n't see a vast amount of that as Christmas approaches .

Overview
Eight years after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 , Americans see Muslims as facing more discrimination inside the U.S. than other major religious groups .
Nearly six - in - ten adults ( 58 % ) say that Muslims are subject to a lot of discrimination , far more than say the same about Jews , evangelical Christians , atheists or Mormons .
In fact , of all the groups asked about , only gays and lesbians are seen as facing more discrimination than Muslims , with nearly two - thirds ( 64 % ) of the public saying there is a lot of discrimination against homosexuals .
The poll also finds that two - thirds of non-Muslims ( 65 % ) say that Islam and their own faith are either very different or somewhat different , while just 17 % take the view that Islam and their own religion are somewhat or very similar .
But Islam is not the only religion that Americans see as mostly different from their own .
When asked about faiths other than their own , six - in - ten adults say Buddhism is mostly different , with similar numbers saying the same about Mormonism ( 59 % ) and Hinduism ( 57 % ) .
By a smaller margin , Americans are also inclined to view Judaism and Catholicism as somewhat or very different from their own faith ( 47 % different vs. 35 % similar for Judaism , 49 % different vs. 43 % similar for Catholicism ) .
Only when asked about Protestantism do perceived similarities outweigh perceived differences , with 44 % of non-Protestants in the survey saying Protestantism and their own faith are similar and 38 % saying they are different .
Results from the latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press and the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life , conducted Aug.
11- 17 among 2,010 adults reached on both landlines and cell phones , reveal that high levels of perceived similarity with religious groups are associated with more favorable views of those groups .
Those who see their own faith as similar to Catholicism , Judaism , Mormonism and Islam are significantly more likely than others to have favorable views of members of these groups .
Detailed questions about perceptions of Islam show that a plurality of the public ( 45 % ) says Islam is no more likely than other faiths to encourage violence among its believers ; 38 % take the opposite view , saying that Islam does encourage violence more than other faiths do .
Views on this question have fluctuated in recent years , with the current findings showing that the view that Islam is connected with violence has declined since 2007 , when 45 % of the public said that Islam encourages violence more than other religions do .
Almost half of Americans ( 45 % ) say they personally know someone who is Muslim .
Also , slim majorities of the public are able to correctly answer questions about the name Muslims use to refer to God ( 53 % ) and the name of Islam ’s sacred text ( 52 % ) , with four - in - ten ( 41 % ) correctly answering both “ Allah ” and “ the Koran . ”
These results are consistent with recent years and show modest increases in Americans ’ familiarity with Islam compared with the months following the 9/11 attacks .
Those people who know a Muslim are less likely to see Islam as encouraging of violence ; similarly , those who are most familiar with Islam and Muslims are most likely to express favorable views of Muslims and to see similarities between Islam and their own religion .
Religious Similarities and Differences
When asked how much various religions resemble their own , the public cites Protestantism and Catholicism as the faiths most like theirs .
Overall , more than four - in - ten non-Protestants in the survey ( 44 % ) say that the Protestant religion and their own faith are similar ( including 12 % saying they are very similar ) , slightly more than say Protestantism and their own faith are somewhat or very different ( 38 % ) .
Of non-Catholics , 43 % see mostly similarities between Catholicism and their own faith , while roughly half ( 49 % ) see mostly differences .
More than one - third of non-Jews say Judaism is somewhat or very similar to their own faith ( 35 % ) , while 47 % say it is somewhat or very different .
By comparison , the public is even more likely to see differences rather than similarities between their own religion and Mormonism , Islam , Buddhism or Hinduism .
In fact , majorities say that each of these faiths is different from their own religion , with sizeable numbers saying that these religions are very different from their own ( 37 % say this about Mormonism , 40 % about Hinduism , 44 % about Buddhism and 45 % about Islam ) .
Protestants see Catholicism as the religion most like their own , followed by Judaism .
Among Protestants in the survey , white evangelicals ( 49 % ) and white mainline Protestants ( 50 % ) are somewhat more likely than black Protestants ( 39 % ) to see their religion as similar to Catholicism .
But all three groups have roughly the same impression of Judaism ’s similarity with their own faith ( 39 % similar among white evangelicals , 34 % among both white mainline Protestants and black Protestants ) .
Fewer Protestants see Mormonism ( 22 % ) , Islam ( 15 % ) , Hinduism ( 9 % ) or Buddhism ( 7 % ) as similar to their own faith .
Catholics , especially white , non-Hispanic Catholics , name Protestantism as the faith that is most similar to Catholicism .
Interestingly , Catholics see greater similarities between Catholicism and Protestantism than do Protestants .
After Protestantism , Catholics see Judaism as most like their faith .
Indeed , Catholics are slightly more likely than Protestants to say their faith is similar to Judaism .
Less than a quarter of Catholics ( 22 % ) see Mormonism as similar to their religion , 19 % see Islam as similar , 16 % see Buddhism as similar , and 12 % see Hinduism as similar .
Compared with other groups , fewer of the religiously unaffiliated see their own beliefs as similar to Catholicism , Protestantism and Judaism .
However , the religiously unaffiliated are more likely than any other group in the survey to see their own beliefs as similar to Buddhism ( 26 % ) .
Analysis of the survey reveals that perceptions of similarity with religious groups are linked with more favorable views of these groups .
For instance , non-Catholics who see mostly similarities between their own faith and Catholicism are much more likely than those who see mostly differences to view Catholicism favorably ( 76 % vs. 54 % ) .
And two - thirds of those who see mostly similarities between their own faith and Islam have a favorable view of Muslims ( 65 % ) , compared with fewer than half of those who see mostly differences with Islam ( 37 % ) .
Discrimination and Religious Minorities
Americans are more likely to say there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims than against any other religious group asked about in the survey .
Most people say there is not a lot of discrimination against Jews , atheists , Mormons and evangelical Christians in the U.S. , while nearly six - in - ten ( 58 % ) say there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims .
The only group that Americans perceive as subject to more discrimination than Muslims is homosexuals ; nearly two - thirds of adults ( 64 % ) say gays and lesbians face a lot of discrimination .
About half say blacks ( 49 % ) and Hispanics ( 52 % ) suffer from a lot of discrimination , and more than a third ( 37 % ) say there is a lot of discrimination against women in the U.S. today .
Young people ( ages 18 - 29 ) are especially likely to say there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims , with nearly three - quarters ( 73 % ) expressing this view .
Among those older than age 65 , by contrast , only 45 % say that Muslims face a lot of discrimination .
Across the political spectrum , most people agree that there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims .
But this perception is most common among liberal Democrats , with eight - in - ten saying there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims .
This is significantly higher than among all other partisan and ideological groups .
There are only minor differences of opinion between members of the major religious traditions on this question .
Black Protestants are most likely to say there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims ( 65 % ) , but majorities of all religious groups say Muslims face a lot of discrimination .
Few Feel Like Part of a Religious Minority
When asked about their own religious status , one - in - five Americans ( 19 % ) say they think of themselves as belonging to a minority because of their religious beliefs while 78 % do not , numbers that are unchanged since early 2001 .
Though white evangelicals constitute the single largest religious group in the country , roughly a quarter ( 24 % ) identify themselves as part of a religious minority , much more than the 11 % of white mainline Protestants and 13 % of Catholics who do so .
In this regard , evangelicals resemble black Protestants , among whom 22 % regard themselves as part of a religious minority .
Among the religiously unaffiliated , 18 % see themselves as part of a religious minority , a figure significantly higher than among mainline Protestants or white Catholics .
Frequent attendance at religious services is associated with a higher tendency to feel like part of a religious minority .
Overall , one - quarter of those who attend religious services at least once a week say they are a minority because of their beliefs , compared with 16 % of those who attend less often .
And among white evangelicals , nearly three - in - ten regular churchgoers ( 29 % ) see themselves as part of a religious minority .
Likewise , 23 % of those who say religion is very important in their lives think of themselves as minorities , compared with 14 % of those who say religion is less important in their lives .
Politically , those in the middle of the ideological spectrum are less likely to consider themselves part of a religious minority .
Just 13 % of moderates identify as religious minorities , compared with 22 % of conservatives and 21 % of liberals .
Views of Islam and Violence
Americans ’ views of the link between Islam and violence have fluctuated in recent years .
Currently , a plurality ( 45 % ) says Islam is no more likely than other faiths to encourage violence among its believers , compared with 38 % who say that Islam does encourage violence more than other religions .
This is similar to positions on this issue in 2005 .
By contrast , in Pew Research Center surveys conducted in 2004 and 2007 , more people said Islam does encourage violence than said it does not .
Among conservative Republicans , 55 % say Islam is more likely than other faiths to encourage violence , down 13 percentage points in two years .
However , conservative Republicans are still more likely than other political groups to express a negative view of Islam on this question .
Views of Islam and violence have also changed considerably among conservative and moderate Democrats ( with the number saying Islam encourages violence more than other faiths down nine percentage points since 2007 ) , while holding steady among other political groups .
White evangelical Protestants are significantly more likely than other religious groups to say Islam is inclined toward violence , with more than half ( 53 % ) taking this view .
Within other religious groups , fewer than four - in - ten people express this opinion ( 39 % of white mainline Protestants , 38 % of white Catholics , 33 % of the religiously unaffiliated and 30 % of black Protestants ) .
Familiarity with Muslims
Just under half of Americans know a Muslim , a figure unchanged from 2007 and slightly higher than in November 2001 , when 38 % of Americans said they personally knew a Muslim .
Familiarity with Muslims varies greatly by age and education .
Two - thirds of college graduates ( 66 % ) know a person who is Muslim , as do a smaller majority of those with some college ( 55 % ) .
But that drops to just 29 % among those who have not attended college .
Similarly , 52 % of people under age 30 know a Muslim , as do almost half of those ages 30 - 64 .
But among those over age 65 , just three - in - ten personally know a Muslim .
Men are more likely than women to say they know a Muslim ( 51 % vs. 40 % ) , and blacks are more likely to know a Muslim ( 57 % ) than are whites ( 44 % ) or Hispanics ( 39 % ) .
Half of moderates ( 51 % ) and liberals ( 50 % ) say they are acquainted with a Muslim , compared with 41 % of conservatives .
White evangelical Protestants are now 11 percentage points more likely to know a Muslim than they were in 2007 ( 41 % vs. 30 % ) , bringing them more in line with the 40 % of mainline Protestants and 43 % of white Catholics who also say they know a Muslim .
Interaction with Muslims is much more common among black Protestants , among whom 61 % say they know a Muslim .
Knowledge of Islam
A slim majority of Americans know the Muslim name for God is Allah , and a similar number can correctly name the Koran as the Islamic sacred text .
Overall , 41 % of the public is able to answer both questions correctly , 23 % can answer one but not the other , and 36 % of Americans are unfamiliar with either term .
Men are generally more knowledgeable about Islam than women ; 47 % know the Muslim name for God and name the holy book correctly , compared with 35 % of women .
This knowledge is also higher among whites than among Hispanics , and Americans under age 65 are much more likely than seniors to know these facts about Islam .
Still , as with knowing a Muslim personally , education makes the greatest difference : Almost two - thirds of college graduates ( 64 % ) answered both questions about Islam correctly , compared with less than half of those with some college ( 48 % ) and 24 % of those who have not attended college .
A majority of liberal Democrats ( 56 % ) named both Allah and the Koran correctly , as did nearly as many conservative Republicans ( 49 % ) .
Fewer than half of independents ( 44 % ) and just a third of moderate and liberal Republicans and conservative and moderate Democrats answered both correctly .
Knowledge of Islam is fairly equal across religious groups , though it is highest among the unaffiliated ( 44 % answered both questions correctly ) and lowest among Catholics ( 35 % answered both correctly ) .
More Americans can correctly identify both the Koran and Allah today ( 41 % ) than could do so in 2002 or 2003 ( 33 % and 31 % respectively ) , though there has been only a marginal increase in Americans ’ knowledge about Islam since 2005 , when 38 % were familiar with both Allah and the Koran .
Awareness of the Muslim holy book and name for God has increased noticeably among some groups while remaining steady among others .
For instance , 42 % of those under age 30 can correctly name the Koran and Allah , up eight percentage points from 2002 .
Knowledge is also significantly higher among those ages 30 to 64 , but familiarity with Islam is largely unchanged among seniors , the group that was least knowledgeable about the religion to begin with ; 26 % can name both the Koran and Allah today , compared with 23 % in 2002 .
Knowledge has grown markedly among many religious groups .
The increase is most obvious among black Protestants , among whom 42 % can name both the Koran and Allah today , compared with 27 % in 2002 .
White Catholics as well as evangelical Protestants are also much more familiar with Islam today than they were in 2002 .
However , the trend is not apparent among the religiously unaffiliated ; 44 % of this group can name both Allah and the Koran today , compared with 42 % in 2002 .
The unaffiliated stood out for possessing
the most knowledge of Islam in 2002 , whereas today there is less of a gap between them and other religious groups .
Familiarity with Islam Affects Views
Roughly a fourth of Americans ( 26 % ) have a relatively high level of familiarity with Islam , that is , they know the names Muslims use to refer to God and to their sacred text , and they are also personally acquainted with a Muslim .
Another fourth of the population ( 27 % ) is basically unfamiliar with the Muslim religion , neither knowing a Muslim nor having knowledge of Allah or the Koran .
The remaining half of the population ( 47 % ) falls somewhere between these two groups in terms of familiarity with Islam .
The survey shows that higher levels of familiarity with Islam , and especially knowing someone who is Muslim , are associated with more positive views toward the religion .
For example , among the group with the highest level of familiarity with Islam , most reject the idea that Islam encourages violence ( 57 % ) .
By contrast , fewer than half of those with medium familiarity with Islam ( 46 % ) and one - third of those with little familiarity ( 34 % ) reject the idea of a link between Islam and violence .
Not surprisingly , people with lower levels of familiarity with Islam exhibit higher levels of non-response in attitudes about Islam , saying they do not know whether it is more or less likely than other religions to encourage violence .
Similarly , those with the highest levels of familiarity with Islam express the most favorable views of Muslims .
Nearly six - in - ten of those most familiar with Islam express favorable views of Muslims , compared with less than four - in - ten among those with less familiarity .
Regardless of their familiarity with Islam , more Americans say that their beliefs are different from rather than similar to the Muslim religion .
However , even on this question , those who are most familiar with Islam stand out as being more likely to say that their religion is similar to Islam ( 27 % vs. 7 % among those with low familiarity ) .
More than a third ( 35 % ) of those with low familiarity say they do not know whether their religion is similar to or different from Islam .
A similar pattern exists with regard to whether Americans perceive a lot of discrimination against Muslims .
Those who are most familiar with Islam are significantly more likely than those with minimal exposure to say that there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims today .
Seven - in - ten say this , compared with just 44 % of those with a low level of familiarity .
As on the question of Islam and violence , a large portion ( 25 % ) of those with minimal knowledge of Islam say they do not know whether there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims today .

( CNN ) --
The global economic crisis has caused a spike in world hunger that has left more than a billion undernourished , United Nations agencies said in a new report .
The report says the stabilization of financial markets has meant less investment in agriculture , food distribution .
" It is unacceptable in the 21st century that almost one in six of the world 's population is now going hungry , " said Josette Sheeran , executive director of the World Food Programme .
" At a time when there are more hungry people in the world than ever before , there is less food aid than we have seen in living memory . "
The report by the WFP and the Food and Agriculture Organization was released Wednesday , ahead of World Food Day on Friday .
Nearly all the world 's undernourished live in developing countries , according to the report .
An estimated 642 million people are suffering from chronic hunger in Asia and the Pacific .
An additional 265 million live in sub-Saharan Africa while 95 million come from Latin America , the Caribbean , the Near East and North Africa .
The final 15 million live in developed nations .
Should developed economies be doing more to eradicate hunger , poverty ?
The number of hungry spiked as the global economic crisis took hold and governments pumped resources into stabilizing financial markets .
The move meant smaller investments in agriculture and food distribution .
" World leaders have reacted forcefully to the financial and economic crisis , and succeeded in mobilizing billions of dollars in a short time period .
The same strong action is needed now to combat hunger and poverty , " said Jacques Diouf , director - general of the FAO .
" The rising number of hungry people is intolerable . "
The report calls for greater investment in agriculture to tackle long and short - term hunger by making farmers productive and more resilient to crises .
" We know what is needed to meet urgent hunger needs -- we just need the resources and the international commitment to do the job , " Sheeran said .

The “ indoctrination ” of children
This grandfather reserves time to spend with his grandchildren specifically to teach them important biblical truths — see Biblical worldview project for parents and grandparents .
Published : 7 November 2009 ( GMT+10 )
A correspondent from the northern hemisphere ( name and country were provided , but are being withheld from publication at their request ) complained about our article The Indoctrinator and a few other articles , arguing that we also indoctrinate .
The letter is first published in its entirety , then with a point - by - point response by Lita Cosner :
Hi , I was removed from the state primary school system by my parents about mid-way through the school , and since then I have been homeschooled by them until I joined the local Sixth Form last year .
Until then , I was a devote Creationist and supporter of CMI but due to my interaction with my friends and teachers at school and with the more secular institution in general I have started to question some of the teachers of my church minister and family .
It seems to me , that the more I look around me at the evidence on both the creation and evolution sides of the argument , I quickly find flaws in both sides of the argument , but especially with creation which surprised me !
It now seems to me that Genesis may not be a true history and it was the teachings of my closed upbringing that have chosen what I should believe in before I was old enough to understand .
I recently read on CMI in an article called ‘ The Indoctrinator ’ about the brainwashing of people into believing evolution etc .
Further reading of the Family / Marriage section of CMI however seemed to indicate to me that in fact evangelicals and creationists are just as bad or worse with the brainwashing of young people as the evolutionists !
I have found several quotes from this section which help to further indicate this : “ Firstly , you can teach your children about God ’s creation .
Begin when they are very young .
Read to them over and over again the story of God ’s creation until they have it firmly fixed in their memory ” “ Teach your children about the fallacies of evolution before they learn about its supposed truth at school ” “ Personally , for our children over the years , we chose a combination of homeschooling and Christian schooling ” “ We have to teach our children to be very different ” “ So how can we as parents prepare our children to face this world ?
To resist peer group pressure ?
To live morally ?
To keep believing the Bible when so much of what they are taught contradicts it ”
“ We must set aside time each day to teach our children ”
Is this the case , and how can the Word of God simply be forced onto young people before they can understand it or are old enough to be able to look at alternate views to reach a balanced conclusion to what they believe ?
Is this morally right ?
Thanks for the help , [ name withheld ]
CMI ’s Lita Cosner responds :
Dear [ name withheld ] ,
You wrote …
I was removed from the state primary school system by my parents about mid-way through the school , and since then I have been homeschooled by them until I joined the local Sixth Form last year .
Until then , I was a devote Creationist and supporter of CMI but due to my interaction with my friends and teachers at school and with the more secular institution in general I have started to question some of the teachers of my church minister and family .
It seems to me , that the more I look around me at the evidence on both the creation and evolution sides of the argument , I quickly find flaws in both sides of the argument , but especially with creation which surprised me !
… but if you had pointed out some of the things you think are flawed about creation , I could have endeavoured to answer your objections .
Certainly , there are flawed arguments for creation , but CMI advises people not to use those arguments .
It now seems to me that Genesis may not be a true history and it was the teachings of my closed upbringing that have chosen what I should believe in before I was old enough to understand .
When children know that what they are being taught is the truth , they have a positive attitude toward schooling .
Unfortunately , attending state schools has this effect on many young people ; I experienced the same effect when I went through the US public school system .
Thankfully though I discovered the truth of Christianity , which would have been impossible for me without also believing the history in Genesis .
I recently read on CMI in an article called ‘ The Indoctrinator ‘ about the brainwashing of people into believing evolution etc .
Further reading of the Family / Marriage section of CMI however seemed to indicate to me that in fact evangelicals and creationists are just as bad or worse with the brainwashing of young people as the evolutionists !
I have found several quotes from this section which help to further indicate this : “ Firstly , you can teach your children about God ’s creation .
Begin when they are very young .
Read to them over and over again the story of God ’s creation until they have it firmly fixed in their memory ” “ Teach your children about the fallacies of evolution before they learn about its supposed truth at school ” “ Personally , for our children over the years , we chose a combination of homeschooling and Christian schooling ” “ We have to teach our children to be very different ” “ So how can we as parents prepare our children to face this world ?
To resist peer group pressure ?
To live morally ?
To keep believing the Bible when so much of what they are taught contradicts it ” “ We must set aside time each day to teach our children ”
We indoctrinate young children all the time in all sorts of areas , not just religion .
We teach them to recite the alphabet as well as numbers , and all sorts of other things when they are small .
As they grow , we might drill multiplication tables and grammar rules into them , through repeating over and over .
I remember having to recite all the American presidents of history , which were put into rhymes with notable achievements for easy memorization .
Their young minds may not fully understand the implications of the things they are memorizing , but their memorization provides a crucial foundation for later learning .
And as the uncontested academic superiority of Chinese , Japanese , and Korean schools show , this is an effective method of learning .
Parents have the responsibility to ‘ indoctrinate ’ their children in the truth
Indoctrination is necessary because young children are simply not mature enough to investigate religious matters for themselves , any more than they could figure out the multiplication tables on their own , and parents have a responsibility therefore to oversee what their children learn .
To put it a little differently , parents have the responsibility to “ indoctrinate ” their children in the truth .
On the surface , the way we are encouraging people to teach their children may look like how evolutionists indoctrinate children .
But in fact it is very different , primarily because our teaching is based on God ’s truth , revealed in Scripture .
Also , often the evolutionists indoctrinating children are their teachers in school , not their parents .
Some even make it their goal to supplant the parents ’ values and beliefs in the child ’s mind with their own .
This is thoroughly unbiblical .
Ideally , as the child grows and is able to understand the reasoning behind creationism , Christian parents would teach their children about the reasons behind why they believe what they believe , including about Genesis creation , and thus help the child to build a coherent Christian worldview .
Of course when someone reaches the age where he is able to investigate the truth claims of various philosophies and religions , he becomes responsible for what he believes and must work through the issues on his own .
Is this the case , and how can the Word of God simply be forced onto young people before they can understand it or are old enough to be able to look at alternate views to reach a balanced conclusion to what they believe ?
Is this morally right ?
The notion that Christians should not lead their children to believe what they are convinced is the truth owes much to the postmodern secular philosophy that there is no such thing as absolute truth
The short answer is that God commands us to teach our children about His Word , and I would argue that Christian parents would be showing that they hated their children if they did not teach them about Christianity ( which by definition they are convinced is true ) and help them to gain a firm grasp on the issues involved in their faith .
The notion that Christians should not lead their children to believe what they are convinced is the truth owes much to the postmodern secular philosophy that there is no such thing as absolute truth , something that stands in total opposition to Jesus Christ , who is “ the Truth , the Way and the Life ” ( John 14:6 ) .
It is important to understand that it is not a question of whether views will be forced onto young minds — they are completely incapable of forming their own views , and need the help of adults to make sense of the world .
The question is whether the views that the child is taught will be from the Word of God or from secular or pagan philosophies .
The idea of ‘ neutrality ’ is a convenient myth .
Again , the goal of a Christian education in the faith is not to produce a mindless drone that can automatically state the tenets of the faith , but to produce a thinking person who can give a reason for the hope that they have .

Have an argument .
Once you start an argument , not a discussion , you 've already lost .
Think about it : have you ever changed your mind because someone online started yelling at you ?
They might get you to shut up , but it 's unlikely they 've actually changed your opinion .
Forget the pitfalls of Godwin 's law .
Any time you mention Hitler or even Communist China or Bill O'Reilly , you 've lost .
Use faulty analogies .
If someone is trying to make a point about , say , health care , try to make an analogy to something conceptually unrelated , like the space shuttle program , and you 've lost .
Question motives .
The best way to get someone annoyed and then have them ignore you is to bypass any thoughtful discussion of facts and instead question what 's in it for the person on the other end .
Make assumptions about their motivations and lose their respect .
Act anonymously .
What are the chances that heckled comments from the bleachers will have an impact ?
Threaten to take action in another venue .
Insist that this will come back to haunt the other person .
Guarantee you will spread the word or stop purchasing .
Bring up the slippery slope .
Actually , the slope is n't that slippery .
People do n't end up marrying dogs , becoming cannibals or harvesting organs because of changes in organization , technology or law .
Go to the edges .
This is a variant of the slippery slope , in which you bring up extremes at either end of whatever spectrum is being discussed .
So , what works ?
Earn a reputation .
Have a conversation .
Ask questions .
Describe possible outcomes of a point of view .
Make connections .
Give the other person the benefit of the doubt .
Align objectives then describe a better outcome .

The pace of construction in settlements is picking up , campaigners say Israel 's government has stopped issuing settler housing tenders in the West Bank , hoping to reach common ground with the US , a senior minister says .
The US administration has been putting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu under pressure to freeze all settlement work , which has strained normally close ties .
" There is no freeze , there is a waiting period , " said Housing Minister Ariel Atias in an Israeli radio interview .
But anti-settlement groups say work in settlements has in fact increased .
Asked about the statement that no new settler housing tenders were being issued , US President Barack Obama said there had been " movement in the right direction " .
The Obama administration is being tough with us
Israeli Housing Minister Ariel Atias Speaking after a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Washington , Mr Obama said he had been encouraged by reports of checkpoints being removed and increased economic activity in the West Bank .
" But everybody is going to have to take steps , everybody is going to have to take some risks , " he added .
" It 's going to require a lot of hard work . "
Possible split Mr Atias said in the radio interview : " Since the government was established five months ago , no tenders have been issued for Judea and Samaria , " referring to government - issued contracts for construction of new homes in the occupied West Bank .
" It 's no secret that the prime minister is trying to reach some sort of understandings with the Obama administration , which is being tough with us , " he said .
Mr Netanyahu has refused US demands for a freeze on settlement construction Mr Obama 's administration has demanded Israel halt all settlement activity in line with the international peace plan known as the roadmap , which also demands Palestinian moves to quash anti-Israeli militants .
The US is also lobbying Arab states to persuade them to move towards normalising ties with Israel , to mitigate any concessions Israel feels it is making .
Israel insists settlements must be allowed to enjoy " natural growth " , so families are not split up by any freeze .
A construction freeze could split the ruling Israeli coalition , correspondents say , as it is dominated by hardline supporters of the settler movement .
' No slowdown '
The Peace Now anti-settlement group says the last fresh government tender for settlement construction was in November 2008 .
That was when former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was still in power and before the Obama administration took office .
But Mr Netanyahu 's office has denied the hiatus amounted to an official freeze and continued to insist on " natural growth " construction in settlements .
Campaigners from Yesh Din said there was no sign of a slowdown on the ground , with construction continuing in government - funded projects , in the private sector and in unauthorised outposts .
" In practice , on the ground , construction is continuing and the pace is even picking up , " said Yesh Din researcher Dror Etkes .
About 500,000 Jews live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem settlements , which are illegal under international law , among 2.5 million Palestinians .
The land was captured by Israel in the 1967 war and Israel insists its undecided status means the settlements are legal .
But Palestinians view them as constituting the theft of their homeland , while new projects further jeopardise their prospects of establishing an independent state .

Wikinews interviewed the creator of a parody website satirizing American political commentator Glenn Beck , about his thoughts after prevailing in a domain name dispute brought by Beck before the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) in Geneva , Switzerland .
Florida resident Isaac Eiland - Hall created the website in September , and it asserts Beck uses questionable tactics " to spread lies and misinformation " .
Eiland - Hall was represented in the case by free speech lawyer Marc Randazza .
Wikinews interviewed Randazza for the article " US free speech lawyer Marc Randazza discusses Glenn Beck parody " , and previously reported on the Beck v. Eiland - Hall case in articles , " US free speech lawyer defends satire of Glenn Beck " , " Satirical website criticizes Glenn Beck for ' hypocritical ' attempts to silence free speech " , and " Glenn Beck loses domain name case over parody website " .
Background
Eiland - Hall registered the website at the domain " www.GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com " .
Its premise was derived from a joke statement made by Gilbert Gottfried about fellow comedian Bob Saget .
Users of the Internet discussion community Fark first applied the joke to Beck , and it then became popular on several social media sites .
Eiland - Hall saw the discussion on Fark , and created a website about it .
The website asserts it does not believe the rumors to be true , commenting , " [ b ] ut we think Glenn Beck definitely uses tactics like this to spread lies and misinformation . "
The website was created on September 1 , and just two days later attorneys for Beck 's company Mercury Radio Arts took action .
Beck 's lawyers sent letters to the domain name registrar where they referred to the domain name itself as " defamatory " , but failed to get the site removed .
Beck filed a formal complaint with the Switzerland - based agency of the United Nations , WIPO , who operate under regulations laid out by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers .
Beck asserted the website 's usage is libelous , bad faith , and could confuse potential consumers .
Beck 's complaint was filed under the process called the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy .
This policy allows trademark owners to begin an administrative action by complaining that a certain domain registration is in " bad faith " .
Beck argued the site should be shut down because it is an infringement upon his trademark in his own name , " Glenn Beck " .
Eiland - Hall retained Randazza as his attorney after receiving threatening letters from legal representatives of Beck .
On September 28 , Randazza filed a response brief to WIPO , contending the site is " protected political speech " , due to it's " satirical political humor " .
Randazza stated , " even an imbecile would look at this Web site and know that it ’s a parody . "
Randazza 's brief commented on Beck 's style of reporting , and highlighted a controversial statement made by him when interviewing a Muslim US Congressman .
Beck said to Representative Keith Ellison , " I like Muslims , I 've been to mosques .
...
And I have to tell you , I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is , sir , prove to me that you are not working with our enemies . "
According to the Citizen Media Law Project , the website 's joke premise takes advantage of " a perceived similarity between Beck 's rhetorical style and the Gottfried routine " .
Randazza argued in the response filed on behalf of Eiland - Hall that Beck attempted to use the process of the WIPO court to infringe the free speech rights of his client ; " Beck is attempting to use this transnational body to circumvent and subvert the Respondent 's [ web site owner ] constitutional rights [ to freedom of speech ] , " he wrote .
Randazza cited the U.S. Supreme Court case , Hustler Magazine v. Falwell , in arguing that Beck 's attorneys advised him against filing legal action in a U.S. court because the website would likely be seen as a form of parody and due to the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , such legal action would not be successful .
On September 29 , Randazza sent a request to Beck 's representatives , asking that their client agree to stipulate to the United States Constitution , and especially to the First Amendment , during the case before the WIPO .
In the request , Randazza quoted a statement from Beck himself about the usage of international law by United States citizens , Beck said , " [ o ] nce we sign our rights over to international law , the Constitution is officially dead . "
In an October 19 interview with Wikinews , Randazza stated that Beck had not replied to his request to stipulate to the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment in the WIPO case .
On Monday , Ed Brayton of ScienceBlogs noted , " Ironically , Beck never did respond to Marc Randazza 's motion for a stipulation that the panel would have to apply American law in deciding the case ... "
On October 20 , Randazza filed a surreply – a response document to an October 13 supplementary filing made by Beck in the case .
Attorneys for Beck asserted in the supplementary filing that the joke made by the website is difficult to comprehend , and therefore the domain name is confusing .
In Beck 's supplementary filing , his lawyers argued , " While there is absolutely nothing humorous or amusing about the statement made by Respondent in his domain name that ' Glenn Beck Raped and Murdered a Young Girl in 1990 , ' the average Internet user finding the domain name GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlin1990.com
( " Disputed Domain Name " ) in a search would have no reason not to believe that they will be directed to a website providing factual information ( as opposed to protected criticism or similar protected speech ) about Mr. Beck . "
Randazza 's surreply asserted , " An average Internet user might not ' get the joke ' .
In fact , the average Internet user does not understand any internet memes .
That 's the fun of a meme - it is an esoteric inside joke that will leave most people scratching their heads . "
In Randazza 's conclusion to the Eiland - Hall surreply , he called Beck " the butt " of a joke he apparently does not understand .
Randazza wrote that Beck " should be deeply ashamed " for devaluing the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
... the ‘ total effect ’ is that of political commentary by respondent , capable of protection as political speech by the 1st Amendment under the Hustler Magazine standard .
— WIPO ruling
Frederick M. Abbott , the WIPO arbitrator , ruled that Eiland - Hall had legitimate interest in the domain name of the website he created .
" Respondent appears to the Panel to be engaged in a parody of the style or methodology that Respondent appears genuinely to believe is employed by Complainant in the provision of political commentary , and for that reason Respondent can be said to be making a political statement .
This constitutes a legitimate non-commercial use of Complainant ’s mark under the Policy , " said the WIPO ruling .
The WIPO arbitrator commented that the panel was " very reluctant to reject respondent ’s claim of legitimate noncommercial and fair use , " and noted , " Were we to hold otherwise , there can be little doubt that political cartoonists and satirists would be subjected to damages awards without any showing that their work falsely defamed its subject . "
The Hustler Magazine v. Falwell U.S. Supreme Court case was cited by the WIPO arbitrator in the ruling , " This panel considers that if Internet users view the disputed domain name in combination with a visit to respondent ’s website , the ‘ total effect ’ is that of political commentary by respondent , capable of protection as political speech by the 1st Amendment under the Hustler Magazine standard . "
After the WIPO ruling , Eiland - Hall decided to voluntarily relinquish ownership of the domain name and hand it over to Glenn Beck .
On Friday , Eiland - Hall sent a letter to Beck , and pointed out that Beck 's actions only served to further increase publicity to the meme described on the website .
" It bears observing that by bringing the WIPO complaint , you took what was merely one small critique meme , in a sea of internet memes , and turned it into a super - meme .
Then , in pressing forward ( by not withdrawing the complaint and instead filing additional briefs ) , you turned the super - meme into an object lesson in First Amendment principles , " wrote Eiland - Hall in the letter to Beck .
Eiland - Hall criticized Beck 's actions with regard to the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , writing , " It also bears noting , in this matter and for the future , that you are entirely in control of whether or not you are the subject of this particular kind of criticism .
I chose to criticize you using the well - tested method of satire because of its effectiveness .
But , humor aside , your rhetorical style is no laughing matter .
In this context of this WIPO case , you denigrated the letter of First Amendment law .
In the context of your television show and your notoriety , you routinely and shamelessly denigrate the spirit of the First Amendment " .
He stated that he persevered in the case in order to uphold the value of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , " I want to demonstrate to you that I had my lawyer fight this battle only to help preserve the First Amendment .
Now that it is safe , at least from you ( for the time being ) , I have no more use for the actual scrap of digital real estate you sought ... "
A representative of Beck declined to provide a comment about the WIPO ruling , after a request from PC Magazine .
Commentators likened the legal conflict between Beck and the site to the Streisand effect , a phenomenon where an individual 's attempt to censor material on the Internet in turn proves to make the material itself more public .
Online Media Daily commented , " The decision appears to mark a significant win for digital rights advocates because a ruling in Beck 's favor could have encouraged other subjects of online parodies to take their complaints directly to the WIPO rather than U.S. courts , which are bound by the First Amendment . "
Citizen Media Law Project 's assistant director wrote that the ruling was appropriate , " It 's good to see that this WIPO arbitrator had no interest in allowing Beck to circumvent the guarantees of the U.S. Constitution . "
Eiland - Hall 's website was still operational Monday , at a mirror site www.GB1990.com.
At the site , Eiland - Hall announced " WE WON ! " .
He gave Beck well - wishes as the commentator is recovering from appendicitis .
Interview
(( Wikinews ) )
Can you describe a little bit about yourself and your background , and how you came to be interested in the Glenn Beck meme in the first place ?
Isaac Eiland - Hall : I 've been a computer geek since 1987 , when I was 12 .
I 've been on the internet since 1994 .
Among other jobs , I 've done technical support and web design / hosting .
I 've gone back to school and I 'm working on a degree in Computer Science .
If I manage that , I 'm thinking of following up with a Master 's in Meteorology .
If I had more courage , I 'd probably try to become a professional storm chaser .
I grew up as a very fundamentalist Southern Baptist .
I got better .
My political and social outlook has gone from very conservative to very liberal .
One nice thing about this is that I understand both sides .
A lot of liberals scoff at the concept of Chick tracts , for example ; and I do , now .
But growing up , I remember believing in all that stuff .
I do have to remind myself that most Christians are pretty moderate in their outlook , though , sometimes when I get a little frustrated by some of the more vocal small groups who would like the U.S. to become a Christian Theocracy .
I 've also become frustrated with radicals -- liberal and conservative ; though , as a liberal , you 'll be shocked - shocked , I say - to find out that I see more conservatives that fit the bill -- radicals who I feel are tearing this country apart with their manipulations and lies .
These extremists are pushing people toward the extremes , and it 's polarizing and ripping our nation apart .
It seems like nobody wants to compromise any longer ; nobody wants to try and work together ; everybody wants their party to win at all costs , because the other party is the spawn of Satan .
The sad thing is - the American people are losing in this battle .
Republicans are fighting against government interference in business ; Democrats are ( or should be ) fighting against business interference in government .
Ultimately , though , special interests are pumping so much money into the political scene that it seems the voice of the People is lost in the noise of business .
It seems that the media - especially the television media - have long ago figured out that the way to make their businesses work ( which , being commercial entities , they must , of course , do as well as they can ) requires ratings .
Ratings require getting people to watch .
Getting people to watch requires controversy .
And so , people like Glenn Beck - among many others - rise to become stars , because they can get ratings , which ultimately boil down to money .
The problem is that truth and compromise are boring , but exaggeration and controversy are exciting .
When I saw the thread on Fark , where one of the posters , in a thread about Sarah Palin announcing her support for Glenn Beck , said , " Why have n't we had an official response to the rumor that Glenn Beck raped and murdered a girl in 1990 ? " --
I did n't think too much of the post by itself ; but in the thread , it immediately took off .
A bunch of people ran with it and it became a hit in that thread .
It was actually the next day when I saw this thread - and so many people had said so many funny things ... it was like a relief valve had opened up and all this pent up frustration was flowing out .
(( WN ) )
Why did you decide to create the website " www.glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990.com " ?
E-H : There was so much energy in the Fark thread where the meme got its start .
I felt that it was something worth continuing ; that the frustration that was being expressed in that thread through the expression of the meme might actually become a force for change .
And even if it did n't manage to change anything , just the simple act of being a part of the meme might bring about a cathartic release of that frustration at all the stupidity of the pundits out there - of whom I think that Glenn Beck is really the worst of the worst .
The thing about Fark is - it 's a great site , but it 's all based on these threads .
Someone submits a link , and that gives you a thread to talk about it .
After something like 30 days , posting is cut off .
Also , the site is made up of a lot of links for the public threads , but many times that for the private threads .
It can be very hard to keep up with a single thread .
So I realized that if this meme were to take off - it needed a home .
I knew I needed to create a website , and a forum on that website , to facilitate whatever was going to happen .
Ultimately , the website 's purpose was to shine a light on Glenn Beck 's style , and to reflect it right back at him .
(( WN ) )
How did you feel when you first found out that Glenn Beck had begun to take legal actions with regard to your website ?
E-H : Well , it certainly did n't make me very happy , but at the same time , it confirmed what I suspected .
It did n't make me happy because , obviously , nobody likes to be sued .
It also made me unhappy because I saw it as a direct assault on free speech .
Of course , it confirmed my suspicions that Glenn Beck 's claims to be a champion of the constitution are false claims .
(( WN ) )
Why did you register alternate domain names : " DidGlennBeckRapeAndMurderAYoungGirlIn1990.com " , and " gb1990.com " ?
Will you maintain the website at those locations ?
E-H : As I said about the original domain - I wanted to register the meme as the domain , and that 's what I referred to as the " statement " domain .
The " question " domain came about because the entire concept of the meme is not to try and convince people that Beck raped and murdered ; but how the supposed rumour that he did is a direct parody of the techniques he himself uses .
I thought that the question form would serve the meme better , so I went ahead and registered it ; and as soon as I did , I changed the website to the question instead of the statement ( in the title and header for the page ) .
When the domain dispute was filed , I registered gb1990.com , as well as gb1990 .
net .
I did this partly because if he managed to get the question or statement domains taken down , I would have a backup in place .
Also , it 's a lot easier to type " gb1990 " than either of the long versions , so that was a part of it as well .
I made gb1990.com the primary domain for the website , and parked the other two on top .
I put gb1990 .
net as a mirror on my second server , in case something happened to the first .
(( WN ) )
You wrote in your November 6 letter to Beck , " It bears observing that by bringing the WIPO complaint , you took what was merely one small critique meme , in a sea of internet memes , and turned it into a super meme . "
Media commentators have written that Beck 's actions in the case trigged the " Streisand effect " .
Do you think this happened here ?
What do you mean when you say Beck created a " super meme " ?
E-H : I definitely think the Streisand effect came into play .
Even before I got the website up and running , Farkers had already spread the meme - asking questions on Yahoo Answers , for example .
So it definitely got attention out there ; but the traffic to the site dropped off drastically after the first couple of days .
It was n't until people posted news about the legal threats to Reddit , Fark , Digg , and many blogs that I saw spikes in traffic .
The major spikes in traffic to the site have all come from updates about where the legal fight stood .
For example , when a thread went green ( public ) on Fark.com , traffic to my servers nearly overwhelmed them for a couple of hours .
When we posted my brilliant lawyer Marc Randazza 's responses to the original WIPO complaint , traffic was high for a couple of days .
In each case , it dropped down to a relatively low level when news was sparse .
I think that if Beck had never started the legal action , this meme would have died out after a couple of weeks .
It might have popped up in the occasional place , but I do n't think it would have lasted the more than two months it has .
By super meme , I just mean that there are so many memes out there .
Some are specific to a certain site ; some have a very short life and die quickly ; some continue at a very low level .
This meme , however , just took off .
So many people were posting it on some many unrelated threads on Fark that moderators were banning people for it ) .
I 've seen people post this meme in places where few memes go - on news sites , blogs : anywhere people comment , this meme will pop up .
(( WN ) )
You also wrote in your letter to Beck , " In this context of this WIPO case , you denigrated the letter of First Amendment law . "
How would you like Beck to act differently in the future with regard to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution ?
E-H : Beck 's WIPO complaint revolves around trademark issues .
His claim is that the domains violate the trademark he has in his name .
I do n't believe that was his ultimate motivation in trying to get the domain ; I think he was trying to stifle free speech .
I think he looked at Hustler v. Falwell and decided he could n't win against my legally - protected right to mock him , but that he might be able to use other means to get my point of view shut down .
( It 's easy to come to this conclusion if you look at the legal documents I posted on gb1990. net / legal - and I posted everything I got )
What I 'd like Beck to do differently is simply realize that the chilling effects of trying to have speech you disagree with shutdown would ultimately affect his rights as well .
I disagree with many of the things he says , and hope to put pressure on him to change his techniques ; but ultimately , I would never wish to stifle his first amendment rights .
There 's a difference between disagreeing with someone , mocking them , and trying to intimidate them to stop talking .
As regards the application of the Hustler v. Falwell case to this case , I think the overall application was fair : Parody and satire are protected forms of free speech .
— Eiland - Hall
(( WN ) )
In the final decision in the Beck v. Eiland - Hall case , the WIPO arbitrator cited the U.S. Supreme Court case , Hustler Magazine v. Falwell .
Are you familiar with this Supreme Court case ?
What are your thoughts on how it was applied to your case ?
E-H : I am familiar with the case ; and in fact , it helped me sleep at night during the past couple of months .
I think it is a very important case on the topic of first amendment rights as regards parody and satire .
I strongly believe that humour should be used to point out the ridiculous - that 's one of the reasons that the Daily Show is so popular and successful .
They do it very well .
As regards the application of the Hustler v. Falwell case to this case , I think the overall application was fair : Parody and satire are protected forms of free speech .
(( WN ) )
On September 29 , 2009 , your lawyer Marc Randazza requested that Glenn Beck agree to stipulate to the application of the United States Constitution , and also especially to the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
In an October 19 interview with Wikinews , Randazza said that Beck had not responded to this request .
Why do you think Beck chose not to stipulate to the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment in this case ?
E-H : I think Beck knew that doing so would hurt his case .
The rights of free speech we enjoy in the United States are broader than in some other countries .
WIPO , being an international organization , could well have assigned an arbitrator from a country that does n't protect speech as strongly as we do .
And WIPO , not being bound by the U.S. Constitution , might not choose to consider the strong protections we have in rendering their decision .
We also felt it was ironic that Glenn Beck , who is on record as being against an international body making judgments that might overrule the U.S. Constitution , would himself choose to use an international body to try and stifle speech that would be protected under the U.S. Constitution .
So ultimately , you could say we were trying to help him retain the patriotic image he has worked to hard to present .
Ultimately , the arbitrator applied the First Amendment anyhow .
We felt that in sending that letter , we would give Beck a chance to show that his purported support for the constitution was real .
His failure to respond shows everyone that he is full of shit .
We also felt it was ironic that Glenn Beck , who is on record as being against an international body making judgments that might overrule the U.S. Constitution , would himself choose to use an international body to try and stifle speech that would be protected under the U.S. Constitution .

An article in Online Media Daily noted , the decision in your WIPO case , " appears to mark a significant win for digital rights advocates because a ruling in Beck 's favor could have encouraged other subjects of online parodies to take their complaints directly to the WIPO rather than U.S. courts , which are bound by the First Amendment . "
How do you feel about the fact that your case may have set precedent for similar cases in the future ?
E-H : If this has truly set precedent , I am honored to have the chance to serve the cause of Liberty .
I 'm nobody special , mind you .
Anyone could have set up a site - it just happened to be me that got thrown in the center of this fight .
When Beck first filed his WIPO action , I was ready to just give in to make things easier for myself .
Surrender is always the easiest thing , is n't it ?
But , I started to think about what the case meant .
It did occur to me that if Beck succeeded , that his very predictions that he gives on the air -- about international bodies threatening our free speech rights -- would come true .
I then realized that the case was about much bigger principles .
(( WN ) )
Are you happy with your decision to turn over the " www.glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990.com " domain name to Beck ?
E-H : Absolutely yes .
For one , the meme is already out there .
In one sense , the job of the meme is over and done with - it has gotten people to talk about the issue , and that was one of the primary goals .
Another primary goal was to foster that sense of community , and to provide a release valve for the frustration so many have with Glenn Beck , and others like him .
Of course , we want to keep the entire thing going , but we can do that without the statement version of the domain .
That domain gets a LOT of traffic .
I could have taken down the domain , put up a pay per click site , and made a heck of a lot of money by harnessing the advertising revenue from the site .
It was in my financial best interest to do that - but this was always about free speech - not about profit .
I absolutely think giving him the domain sends the message that I want to send - this was n't personal , it was political .
Beck made it about Free Speech principles , and I think I did my part to stand up for those principles .
But , keeping this particular domain would n't have advanced that cause any further than it had already been advanced .
I wanted to give him the domain to demonstrate the fact that my interest in fighting the WIPO case was purely a matter of principle .
(( WN ) )
Do you have any thoughts or advice for other potential creators of satirical parody websites who may undergo a similar legal process in the future ?
E-H : If you decide to make a political satire site , do it .
Be prepared to stick it out .
Get a good lawyer who is committed to First Amendment principles , who knows how to handle this kind of thing , but get one who will teach you and make sure that you are able to make informed decisions .
There were a lot of lawyers to choose from , but Mr. Randazza seemed to be the best guy for this kind of case .
His First Amendment credibility is unshakeable , his knowledge of this area of law is fantastic , but he has a reputation for managing his clients ' interests really well .
He did n't tell me what to do , he taught me what the law was , he gave me options and choices , and let me make informed decisions .
In a process like this , it is easy to feel like things are out of your control .
Make sure your lawyer teaches you about what you can control .
It will make you feel a lot more comfortable .
(( WN ) )
Are there any other points regarding the Beck v. Eiland - Hall case that you would like to elaborate or explain ?
E-H : Although the vast majority of emails and voicemails I 've received are from folks that clearly get the joke , there are so many people that did n't .
If there 's anyone out there who still thinks the point was to try and get people to believe that Glenn Beck raped and murdered a young girl in 1990 : Please understand that I 've tried to make it as clear as I could that it 's just not true .
The entire point is that the supposed rumour is so over - the - top as to be ridiculous .
Further , I have always had a disclaimer on the site explaining that it was a parody .
The welcome blurb has always said that we do n't believe the rumour is true .
The entire point is that we 're trying to point out techniques we 've seen Beck himself use .
One thing that has amused me is that some of the folks who do n't get that have come into the forum , and tried to respond by attacking Obama , because that 's what they feel the response to the supposed rumour should be .
Sometimes I 've been successful in explaining how this really is n't the same thing , but sometimes it just does n't work .
The other thing I would like to clarify is that I have not made a single cent from this ; in fact , I have spent probably more than I could afford to on the whole project .
I also did n't want or expect the 15 minutes of fame I got .
I do n't have any regrets - it 's been fun , in some respects , mind , but if I was out for fame or money , this would not be the method I 'd choose .
(( WN ) ) Mr. Eiland - Hall , thank you for taking the time to participate in this interview with Wikinews .
E-H : Hey ... that 's not a question !
Seriously , thank you very much for taking the time to interview me .
It 's been my pleasure .

The Venera missions produced tantalising images of the Venusian surface
Densely clouded in acid - laden mist , Venus used to be the Soviet Union 's favourite target for planetary exploration .
Now , after a lull of almost three decades , Russia is making plans for a new mission to the " morning star " and has invited Western scientists to participate .
Last week , Moscow - based space research institute IKI hosted an international conference aimed at luring scientists from Europe and possibly other countries such as the US into the ambitious project , officially scheduled for launch in 2016 .
We want somewhere around 24 - hour survivability ... but even in one day we can do a lot
Lev Zeleny , IKI " The goal of this conference was to consolidate our and European scientists ' ideas and determine what approaches toward this project we could use , " says Oleg Korablev , who leads the work on returning to Venus at IKI .
The Soviet Union last went to Venus - jointly with a number of European nations - with the twin Vega probes of 1985 .
This followed 16 Soviet - only Venera missions between 1961 and 1983 .
Known as Venera - D , the new mission is expected to involve a multi- front scientific assault on the mysteries of Venus with an orbiting spacecraft , multiple air balloons , a surface lander and - possibly - an innovative " wind - flyer " .
" We want this mission to be as cutting edge as possible , " says Ludmila Zasova , a leading planetary scientist at IKI who helped to organise the Moscow event .
" At this day and age , this is not easy even for a very rich country , therefore we understand that this mission has to be co-operative . "
The project is in its preliminary stages , and faces enormous technical and financial challenges .
Nonetheless , the initial reaction of the European scientists seemed very positive .
Venera - D would take a suite of modern instruments to the " morning star " " What surprised me was the level of dedication that Russians [ put ] into this mission , " says Hakan Svedhem , a scientist with the European Space Agency ( Esa ) .
" Questions remain of when exactly it is going to fly and what it is going to contain . "
Dr Svedhem works with the Venus Express mission which currently orbits the planet , following its successful launch onboard a Russian rocket in 2005 .
He believes Venera - D has a good prospect of getting funded by the Russian space agency , and now discussion is focusing on what elements the mission could include .
" The Russian space science research budget has been expanding quite dramatically for a number of years , and it seems possible that there will be room for this mission , " he said .
" We are in the very early stage , but I am sure many Europeans will be involved in the end in this mission . "
Venus scientists , unite !
Venera - D would be the second attempt in the last few years to combine efforts to explore Venus by European and Russian scientists .
A previous proposal to merge Venera - D with the European Venus Explorer , EVE , had to be abandoned when the European mission was rejected in the favour of other planetary projects .
EVE scientists still intend to resubmit the project for Esa 's next selection round at the end of next year ; and according to industry sources , the mission has a good chance of getting funding .
However , even with a successful bid in 2010 , EVE 's launch date would inevitably be pushed beyond 2020 .
" This new launch date does not correlate well with the timeframe of the Venera - D mission , " says Dr Korablev .
As a result , he says , a different approach is needed .
Surviving ' hell '
The IKI conference in Moscow was timed to coincide with the end of the " paper " phase of Venera - D and the start of actual spacecraft development , scheduled for early next year .
During the last few years , the project has been through several incarnations , as scientists tackled the enormous engineering challenge that going to Venus entails .
Esa 's Venus Express found enigmatic patterns of ultraviolet absorption
From the outset they understood that in order to unlock the planet 's secrets , their equipment would have to survive on the oven - hot surface beyond the hour - long lifespan of previous Soviet landers .
A longer stay would enable sensors on the surface to listen for tremors , which would give clues about the internal structure of the planet .
However , after sifting through various options for cooling schemes and exotic heat - resistant electronics , an initial 30 - day survival goal had to be cut to one day .
" We now understand that it may not necessarily be justified , and may be too expensive , to last 30 days , " IKI 's director Lev Zeleny told the BBC .
" We did invent some cooling systems ; however , we have very limited mass ( on the lander ) , and would have to sacrifice a very interesting experiment studying dynamics of the atmosphere ( in order to install it ) .
" Now we want somewhere around 24 - hour survivability ... but even in one day we can do a lot . "
Navigating the Venusian skies
To compensate for the lander 's quick frying death , Russian scientists proposed a number of innovative solutions in the exploration of Venus .
A series of balloons designed to float in the misty atmosphere of the planet would be deployed either from the main lander during its descent to the surface , or from protective capsules capable of penetrating the Venusian atmosphere .
Although balloons did once float over Venus as part of the Soviet Vega missions , a new lightweight generation of sensors promises to revolutionise their scientific harvest .
The " juice " of the future research on Venus would be studying isotopes of noble gases such as xenon and krypton in the planet 's atmosphere .
Since they react only reluctantly with other substances , they could help to draw a blueprint of the ancient Venusian atmosphere .
The Venera missions were pioneering in the 1970s and 80s
In turn , such information could help to understand processes involved in the formation of closely located planets such as Earth and Venus .
" These are extremely sensitive measurements which have never been done ( on Venus ) , " Dr Korablev told the BBC .
They would provide a colossal breakthrough in the quality of science compared with the Soviet missions completed in the 1980s .
" Even if we take existing instruments from Huygens ( the European craft that landed on Titan in 2004 ) and send them to Venus , it would be a huge progress , " he said .
Along with their primary instruments , Venus balloons could carry " microprobes " - essentially pieces of ballast filled with additional sensors .
As balloons drift in the Venusian sky , microprobes would be dropped one by one , to provide scientific measurements in various locations .
Flying in the wind
In addition to balloons and a lander , NPO Lavochkin , Russia 's premier developer of deep - space spacecraft , has proposed a " vetrolet " ( a Russian term for " wind - flyer " ) for the Venera - D mission .
A kite - like device could reportedly use the alien winds of Venus to stay aloft almost indefinitely at altitudes of 45 - 50 km , with lightweight instruments and transmitters onboard .
Lavochkin has apparently conducted some experiments to prove that this exotic idea is workable .
Even if the Venera - D mission will be able to afford the additional mass needed to accommodate the device , the " wind - flyer " would probably be included only as an additional demonstrator rather than as the main platform for scientific instruments .
Still , if successful , it could open a new page in the history of planetary exploration .
French connection
As a first sign that Russian efforts to internationalise Venera - D are bearing fruit , the French space agency CNES has expressed preliminary interest in taking full responsibility for developing the balloon part of the project .
However , French representatives told their Russian colleagues that a 2016 launch date for the mission would not be realistic for their contribution , and delay to 2018 would probably be needed .
A CNES delegation is expected in Moscow again in the middle of this month for further discussions .
Given Russia 's own situation , IKI scientists might be willing to be flexible with the launch date for the sake of international participation .
A recently announced delay of Russia 's flagship Phobos - Grunt mission from 2009 to 2011 is expected to cause a domino effect on all further plans .
Still , following Phobos - Grunt and one or two missions to the Moon , Venera - D is lined up to become the next planetary project .
IKI scientists told their European colleagues that they intended to hold conferences on the Venera - D project annually , in the hope of expanding co-operation as the mission moves toward fruition .

The new joint Mars exploration program of NASA and ESA is quickly pushing forward to implement an agreed upon framework to construct an ambitious new generation of red planet orbiters and landers starting with the 2016 and 2018 launch windows .
The European - led ExoMars Trace Gas Mission Orbiter ( TGM ) has been selected as the first spacecraft of the joint initiative and is set to launch in January 2016 aboard a NASA supplied Atlas 5 rocket for a 9 month cruise to Mars .
The purpose is to study trace gases in the martian atmosphere , in particular the sources and concentration of methane which has significant biological implications .
Variable amounts of methane have been detected by a martian orbiter and ground based telescopes on earth .
The orbiter will likely be accompanied by a small static lander provided by ESA and dubbed the Entry , Descent and Landing Demonstrator Module ( EDM ) .
The NASA Mars Program is shifting its science strategy to coincide with the new joint venture with ESA and also to build upon recent discoveries from the current international fleet of martian orbiters and surface explorers Spirit , Opportunity and Phoenix ( see my earlier mars mosaics ) .
Doug McCuiston , NASA ’s director of Mars Exploration at NASA HQ told me in an interview that , “ NASA is progressing quickly from ‘ Follow the Water ’ through assessing habitability and on to a theme of ‘ Seeking the Signs of Life ’ .
Looking directly for life is probably a needle in the haystack , but the signatures of past or present life may be more wide spread through organics , methane sources , etc ” .
NASA and ESA will issue an “ Announcement of Opportunity for the orbiter in January 2010 ” soliciting proposals for a suite of science instruments according to McCuiston .
“ The science instruments will be competitively selected .
They are open to participation by US scientists who can also serve as the Principal Investigators ( PI ’s ) ” .
Proposals are due in 3 months and will be jointly evaluated by NASA and ESA .
Instrument selections are targeted for announcement in July 2010 and the entire cost of the NASA funded instruments is cost capped at $ 100 million .
“ The 2016 mission must still be formally approved by NASA after a Preliminary Design Review , which will occur either in late 2010 or early 2011 .
Funding until then is covered in the Mars Program ’s Next Decade wedge , where all new - start missions reside until approved , or not , by the Agency ” , McCuiston told me .
ESA ’s Council of Ministers just gave the “ green light ” and formally approved an initial budget of 850 million euros ( $ 1.2 Billion ) to start implementing their ExoMars program for the 2016 and 2018 missions on 17 December at ESA Headquarters in Paris , France .
Another 150 million euros will be requested within two years to complete the funding requirement for both missions .
ESA has had to repeatedly delay its own ExoMars spacecraft program since it was announced several years ago due to growing complexity , insufficient budgets and technical challenges resulting in a de-scoping of the science objectives and a reduction in weight of the landed science payload .
The ExoMars rover was originally scheduled to launch in 2009 and is now set for 2018 as part of the new architecture .
The Trace Gas orbiter combines elements of ESA ’s earlier proposed ExoMars orbiter and NASA ’s proposed Mars Science Orbiter .
As currently envisioned the spacecraft will have a mass of about 1100 kg and carry a roughly 115 kg science payload , the minimum deemed necessary to accomplish its goals .
The instruments must be highly sensitive in order to be capable of detecting the identity and extremely low concentration of atmospheric trace gases , characterizing the spatial and temporal variation of methane and other important species , locating the source origin of the trace gases and determining if they are caused by biologic or geologic processes .
Current photochemical models cannot explain the presence of methane in the martain atmosphere nor its rapid appearance and destruction in space , time or quantity .
Among the instruments planned are a trace gas detector and mapper , a thermal infrared imager and both a wide angle camera and a high resolution stereo color camera ( 1 – 2 meter resolution ) .
“ All the data will be jointly shared and will comply with NASA ’s policies on fully open access and posting into the Planetary Data System ” , said McCuiston .
Another key objective of the orbiter will be to establish a data relay capability for all surface missions up to 2022 , starting with 2016 lander and two rovers slotted for 2018 .
This timeframe could potentially coincide with Mars Sample Return missions , a long sought goal of many scientists .
If the budget allows , ESA plans to piggyback a small companion lander ( EDM ) which would test critical technologies for future missions .
McCuiston informed me that , “ The objective of this ESA Technology Demonstrator is validating the ability to land moderate payloads , so the landing site selection will not be science - driven .
So expect something like Meridiani or Gusev— large , flat and safe .
NASA will assist ESA engineering as requested , and within ITAR constraints . ” EDM will use parachutes , radar and clusters of pulsing liquid propulsion thrusters to land .
“ ESA plans a competitive call for instruments on their 3 - 4 kg payload ” , McCuiston explained .
“ The Announcement of Opportunity will be open to US proposers as well so there may be some US PI ’s .
ESA wants a camera to ‘ prove ’ they got to the ground .
Otherwise there is no significant role planned for NASA in the EDM ” .
The lander would likely function as a weather station and be relatively short lived , perhaps 8
Sols or martian days , depending on the capacity of the batteries .
ESA is not including a long term power source , such as from solar arrays , so the surface science will thus be limited in duration .
The orbiter and lander would separate upon arrival at Mars .
The orbiter will use a series of aerobraking maneuvers to eventually settle into a 400 km high circular science orbit inclined at about 74 degrees .
The joint Mars architecture was formally agreed upon last summer at a bilateral meeting between Ed Weiler ( NASA ) and David Southwood ( ESA ) in Plymouth , UK .
Weiler is NASA ’s Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate and Southwood is ESA ’s Director of Science and Robotic Exploration .
They signed an agreement creating the Mars Exploration Joint Initiative ( MEJI ) which essentially weds the Mars programs of NASA and ESA and delineates their respective program responsibilities and goals .
“ The key to moving forward on Mars exploration is international collaboration with Europe ” , Weiler said to me in an interview .
“ We do n’t have enough money to do these missions separately .
The easy things have been done and the new ones are more complex and expensive .
Cost overruns on Mars Science Lab ( MSL ) have created budgetary problems for future mars missions ” .
To pay for the MSL overrun , funds have to be taken from future mars budget allocations from fiscal years 2010 to 2014 .
“ 2016 is a logical starting point to work together .
NASA can have a 2016 mission if we work with Europe but not if we work alone .
We can do so much more by working together since we both have the same objectives scientifically and want to carry out the same types of mission ” .
Weiler and Southwood instructed their respective science teams to meet and lay out a realistic and scientifically justifiable approach .
Weiler explained to me that his goal and hope was to reinstate an exciting Mars architecture with new spacecraft launching at every opportunity which occurs every 26 months and which advance the state of the art for science .
“ It ’s very important to demonstrate a critical new technology on each succeeding mission ” .
More on the 2018 mission plan and beyond in a follow up report .

The new version will include an updated Gecko engine and some features that were n't quite ready for the 3.0 release .
The roadmap states that large and disruptive changes will be avoided during this development cycle .
Yesterday someone mailed me cash for a James Garfield ChrisKwanzaaKahRfield card but instead of real money they sent me a Canadian $ 10 bill .
Which is kind of fucked up because 1 ) I was n’t aware that Canada had different money than normal people and 2 ) I do n’t even know what Canadian money is supposed to look like so for all I know someone made this on their printer and is just fucking with me .
It looked suspect :
I asked Victor what I should do with it and he said he ’d take care of it which means “ You ’ll never see that $ 10 again ” so no thank you , Victor .
Instead I went to the grocery store and decided to use it there .
I figured that I could n’t buy American stuff with it so instead I picked up $ 10 worth of Canadian bacon but when I got to the checkout the cashier just looked at me suspiciously like I was some kinda counterfeiter and she told me I had to use real money .
Then I was all “ This is real money .
I ’m pretty sure it ’s a Canadian ten dollar bill ” and she was like “ You ca n’t use Canadian money here ” and I ’m all “ But I ’m buying Canadian bacon .
So the Canadian parts cancel each other out ” .
Then she ’s all “ This is ham ” and I ’m like “ Yeah , Canadian bacon is ham . ”
Then she looked confused and I ’m all “ I know , right ?
It ’s like Canada is trying to make things difficult ”
Then she called her manager over and she also said she was very sorry but that I ’d have to have the Canadian money exchanged .
And I ’m all “ That ’s what I ’m trying to do .
I ’m trying to exchange this money for bacon ” .
Then she stared at me and looked at the money again like there was an answer written there and I ’m all “ Yes , I realize it ’s Canadian money but this is Canadian bacon so if you cancel out the common denominators this makes sense . ”
She still did n’t get it so I drew her a picture of how it works :
But the manager just looked at me and said again that they do n’t take Canadian money because they hate Canadians and do n’t understand how algebra works .
Except she did n’t say that last part , but it was implied .
Then they told me that I had to pay with real money or they would n’t let me have the bacon and so I just left .
I do n’t even like Canadian bacon , y’all .
Instead I just gave the cash to the Salvation Army guy on the way out .
Then he was all “ Oh. Bless you . ” and I ’m like “ Dude .
Do n’t bless me .
You ca n’t even buy bacon with that . ”
Thanks a lot , Canada .
Your money is useless here .

Versatile Numbers :
Self - Organization , Emergence and Economics
Part I
Introduction
by Bill Lauritzen
There is an important , yet simple , class of numbers , perhaps equal or greater in importance to prime numbers , that has remained relatively hidden over the centuries , but has a great deal of social usefulness .
Mathematicians call these numbers highly composite numbers ,  but here I call them " versatile numbers . "
Some famous modern mathematicians have investigated these numbers , and possibly one Greek philosopher .
These are the numbers that were used by many of the ancients to mentally pattern the universe around them : the circle of the horizon , time , weight , length , classes of items , and even numbers themselves .
These are the numbers that answered these fundamental questions :
How many ?
How much ?
How should one divide up space , time , matter , and energy for measuring ?
How should one pack numbers together into groups ?
( In other words , what " base " should be used , or , how should the society divide up " infinity . " )
Homo sapiens apparently has a desire to split up the universe around him , in order to grasp it better , so he uses the mental tool of numbers .
This mental tool overlays a pattern on the universe , but also act as filter - glasses for seeing the universe .
We see the world through the mental filter - glasses of 10 , which is not a versatile number .
This paper will emphasize the more practical aspects of versatile numbers , rather than the purely mathematical aspects of these numbers .
( See the references for articles on that . )
Even so , a full book could be written about these numbers , and I will here try only to summarize , I fear in an entirely inadequate manner .
My hypothesis is that knowledge of this class of numbers has , in the past , lubricated social and economic action between people .
As the world becomes increasingly populated , creating greater and greater social stress , greater knowledge and use of this class of numbers by the general public might further lubricate economic interaction among people .
Unfortunately , with the rise of metric measurement , it appears that just the opposite is occurring .
My fundamental thesis can be stated on one sentence : Liberal use of versatile numbers ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 360 , 720 , ... ) would lubricate a humans interaction with surrounding humans and the surrounding environment , especially as population on Earth increases .
Definition
2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 360 , 720 , 840 , 1260 , 1680 , 2520 , 5040 , ...
( In mathematical language , n is versatile if f ( n ) > f( x ) where f( n ) and f(x ) are the number of factors of n and x , for all x < n. )
We could say prime numbers have a minimum number of factors while versatile numbers have a relative maximum of factors .
As one mathematician , Hardy , who we will meet later , said ,  they are as unlike a prime as a number can be .
( Kanigal , p. 232 )
If we compare the number 12 with the number 23 , along the lines of addition , we see that the number of ways to split the numbers into two integer parts is generally determined by the size of the number .
In other words , 23 can be written as 1 + 22 , 2 + 21 , 3 + 20 , 4 + 19 , 5 + 18 , 6 + 17 , 7 + 16 , 8 + 15 , 9 + 14 , 10 + 13 , and 11 + 12 .
Whereas 12 can be written only as 1 + 11 , 2 + 10 , 3 + 9 , 4 + 8 , 5 + 7 , and 6 + 6 .
However , if we were to express 12 and 23 as the products of two numbers rather than the sums of two numbers , an entirely different story emerges .
Twenty - three can be written as 1 x 23 only .
Twelve can be written as 1 x 12 , 2 x 6 , and 3 x 4 .
The smaller number can be split in more ways .
We say 23 has two " factors , " while 12 has six .
Twelve is more versatile than 23 .
Here 's a sample factor table :
In the first column we have the number , in the second column we have a list of all the factors of the number , and in the third column we have the number of factors of the number .
FACTOR TABLE
number divisors number of divisors 1 1 1 2 1,2 2 3 1,3 2 4 1,2,4 3 5 1,5 2 6 1,2,3,6 4 7 1,7 2 8 1,2,4,8 4 9 1,3,9 3 10 1,2,5,10 4 11 1,11 2 12 1,2,3,4,6,12 6 13 1,13 2 14 1,2,7,14 4 15 1,3,5,15 4 16 1,2,4,8,16 5 17 1,17 2 18 1,2,3,6,9,18 6 19 1,19 2 20 1,2,4,5,10,20 6 21 1,3,7,21 4 22 1,2,11,22 4 23 1,23 2 24 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24 8
Notice that this third column is rather erratic .
It 's this " erraticness " that allows us to pick out those numbers that have more or an equal number of factors compared to the numbers around them .
EXAMPLE : 12 is versatile because with 6 factors ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 12 ) , it has more factors than all the smaller numbers : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 .
A versatile number is a number that has a greater number of factors than any smaller number .
Whenever the number of factors from the list above jumps , we designate a versatile number .
Here are the first few versatiles with the number of factors is in parentheses : 2 ( 2 ) , 4 ( 3 ) , 6 ( 4 ) , 12 ( 6 ) , 24 ( 8 ) , 36 ( 9 ) , 48 ( 10 ) , 60 ( 12 ) , 120 ( 16 ) , 180 ( 18 ) , 240 ( 20 ) , 360 ( 24 ) , 720 ( 30 ) , 840 ( 32 ) , 1260 ( 36 ) , 1680 ( 40 ) , 2520 ( 48 ) , 5040 ( 60 ) , ...
There is no way to predict the next one except by trial .
In other words , it 's fascinating to try to look for patterns in these , but , there are none .
For a while I thought that there was a prime next to every versatile except for 120 .
[ This holds true up to 25,200 ( 90 ) . ]
So versatile numbers , like primes , can not be predicted by any formula .
Another characteristic that they share with primes is that they become less frequent as they get larger .
Versatile numbers are a sort of potential numerical nexus point .
A point where many numbers can meet .
Steven Ratering of Central College wrote , in 1991 , a paper about highly composite numbers  which he called by the name round numbers .
He felt , and I believe rightly so , that these numbers were rounder than 10 , 20 , 30 ... 100 , etc .
What use are versatile numbers ?
It s hard to say exactly what percent of human interaction is involves numbers .
Trade ( economics and business ) , construction of shelter , and sports certainly take up a large proportion of human time .
EXAMPLE : A school teacher has 23 students in her class , a non-versatile number .
If she wants to divide the students into groups , she could , but the groups would never have the same number in each .
( She ca n't take a fraction of a student . )
If she had 24 students , however , a versatile number , then she could divide them into groups of 2 , groups of 3 , groups of 4 , groups of 6 , groups of 8 , or groups of 12 , all with exactly the same number in each group .
EXAMPLE : Merchant A imports 360 items , a versatile number .
Merchant B imports 375 items , a non-versatile number .
The 360 items can be divided into 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 20 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 40 , 45 , 60 , 72 , 90 , 120 , 180 , or 360 even groups .
The 375 items can only be split into 1 , 3 , 5 , 15 , 25 , 75 , 125 , and 375 even groups , unless fractions of items are used .
EXAMPLE : Some children have some apples to divide equally between them .
If they have 12 apples , a versatile number , the apples could be shared equally with 2 , 3 , 4 , or 6 children .
No bloody noses .
If they have 13 apples , a non-versatile number , the apples can not be shared equally .
Unless they know how to make fractions of items quickly and easily , bloody noses are possible .
( I have done some preliminary experiments along these lines , which suggest that this phenomenon is worth investigating . )
EXAMPLE : A real estate broker can divide up land into lots of 25 acres .
This means one could split it into 5 smaller lots of 5 acres each .
To divide it up into a versatile 24 acres means one would have many more options : 2 by 12 acre lots , 3 by 8 acre lots , 4 by 6 acre lots .
EXAMPLE : The state legislature wants to reduce class size .
What number do they pick ?
The versatile numbers are 36 , 24 and 12 .
This numbers should be given most consideration as they are the easiest to divide up .
There are an infinite number of such examples .
How many items should one export ?
How many items should one manufacture ?
How many items should one pack together ?
How many people , states , districts , counties , etc. , should there be ?
These are the many common decisions that one faces on the job , in which one has to pick how many .
Thus , unless one is working in some strictly mathematical job , one is much more likely to have a need for versatile numbers than prime numbers .
I have had many jobs besides being a school teacher .
Over twenty .
On none of these jobs was knowledge of prime numbers necessary .
However , on most of the jobs I was required to make a decision about how many .
In other words , a good case could be made that it is more important to teach versatile numbers in school than it is to teach prime numbers .
Social Lubrication
To the average person fractions of items are not that easy to deal with .
( There are two types of fractions : fractions of an item , such as 1/3 of the apple , and fractions of a total , such as 1/3 of all the apples . )
They take time and effort , especially when you are dealing with decimal fractions that are repeating such as 0.33333 ....
As we can see from the above examples , sometimes fractions of items are unnecessary if one chooses to work with a versatile number .
Fractions cause unnecessary stress .
And unnecessary stress can have detrimental psychological and physiological effects .
This is the proposition I am making : that the use of particular numbers could cause less stress and could lubricate economic and social interactions .
It could be tested by psychologists .
Perhaps all of us can recall a time in their life when there was an upset because someone got more than we did .
Child A > Child A > Child B > | | | | | | | | | | Child B > | | | | | | | | | | | | Child C > Child C >
Will there be more antisocial behavior among this group of children if they have to divide up 10 pieces of candy or 12 pieces of candy ?
Put some children in a room ( a small group of 2 to 6 children as is commonly seen ) and give them either 12 or 10 pieces of candy and let them figure out how to share the candy ( similar to the above example with apples ) .
With 5 children there may be more antisocial behavior with the 12 candies .
However , with 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 children I predict that with the 10 pieces of candy there will be more antisocial ( aggressive ) behavior .
Another proposition is that the mere awareness of a certain class of numbers by a civilization could increase the intelligence of that civilization .
Again , this could be tested by psychologists .
Make two groups of school children who are matched in mathematical ability ( Group A and Group B ) .
Teach Group
A mostly about prime numbers , in the traditional manner , while Group B is taught about both prime and versatile numbers .
Then administer standard math tests to both groups .
I predict the group taught versatile numbers would test higher .
It may be a small and subtle advantage that the person or culture dealing with versatile numbers has , but in life , even a small advantage , over time , can lead to the extinction of competitors .
Remember that chimps have something like 99.9 % of their active DNA in common with humans .
Look at what difference that small advantage can make .
I believe this same mechanism operates in this situation .
In other words , a business with a small advantage ( such as the liberal use of versatile numbers ) will , other things being equal , have a better chance of survival .
The fact is that it is easier to share or distribute evenly using versatile numbers than any other kind of numbers .
Why is even sharing or distribution important ?
Remember that nature does two crucial tasks .
One is to bring things together .
This could be through gravity or though human packing of goods .
The second is to spread things out .
This could be through energy radiation or through human distribution .
So packing , and its opposite , distribution , are vital to understand .
For example , if there is a shortage of something ( such as food ) on one side of the globe and a surplus of the same thing on the other , it is to humanity 's advantage to be able to pack , transport , and then distribute this food efficiently , easily , and evenly .
As a computer programmer , John Boyer , pointed out to me , primes are used in data encryption , in other words , to keep data secret , or prevent its distribution .
Sort of the opposite of what I am recommending for versatile numbers .
Do n't get the idea that I favor a society in which everyone gets the same reward regardless of the amount of work they do .
Sometimes it is important to be able to share unevenly .
( In that case a larger number can be shared in more ways . )
However , the situations in which even sharing is desirable are more widespread .
So I believe that school children should be able to define and list versatile numbers , just like they do prime numbers .
This will give them insight into the character of numbers .
They should also be taught to use versatile numbers in real situations as mentioned at the beginning of this article .
Merchants , politicians , businessmen , legislators , in fact , all citizens could benefit from knowing these numbers .
In other words , we should work to make these numbers part of the standard curriculum for all schools .
Babylon and Versatile Numbers
Three versatile numbers ( 12 , 60 , and 360 ) were ones that the Babylonians chose near the dawn of civilization to divide up the heavens ( 360 degrees ) , the circle ( 360 degrees ) , time ( 12 hours -- the Babylonian day had 12 hours not 24 ) , more time ( 60 minutes and 60 seconds ) , and their number system ( base 60 ) .
This base 60 number system has always been a mystery and we find Oystein Ore ( Number Theory and its History ) writing , " It is difficult to explain the reasons for such a large unit group . "
Why did the Babylonians picked these groupings ?
One hypothesis is that they got them from astronomy .
However , note that 365.25 ( days per year ) and 12.4 ( lunar months per year ) are the only astronomical numbers close to versatile numbers .
A strict astronomical hypothesis , I think , is wrong .
I suggest that the Babylonians chose 12 , 60 , and 360 partly because of the closeness of 12.4 and 365.25 and partly because these numbers have relatively large numbers of factors .
In other words , it 's possible that the Babylonians were aware of the class of numbers I call versatile numbers .
It may be a very fortuitous astronomical circumstance that we have 12.4 months and 365.25 days per year .
The closeness in size of 12.4 and 365.25 to versatile numbers may have led to early humans being made more aware of this class of numbers .
It is amazing to me how many people believe that our time system was handed down by God and can not be changed .
OUR TIME NUMBERS : NATURES NUMBERS : 365.25 days / year ( mandated by nature ) 365.25 days per year 12 months / year ( suggested by nature & versatile ) 12.4 lunar months per year 7 days / week approximately a half - moon ( 7.36 days ) 24 hours / day ( compatible with 12 and 360 & versatile ) 60 minutes / hour ( compatible with 12 and 360 & versatile ) 60 seconds / minute ( compatible with 12 and 360 & versatile )
When I say to people ,  We dont have to have 24 hours in a day ,  they say ,  Yes we do , because that s how many hours there are in a day . 
In other words , they believe that these numbers are set by nature .
Actually , the only one that is set by nature is the 365.25 days in a year ( approximate ) , as that s how long it takes the Earth to go around the sun .
( Although 12.4 lunar months in the year is close to 12 months per year . )
The other numbers are somewhat arbitrary .
In other words , instead of 24 hours in a day , we could have 15 kunas in a day .
And 50 kinas in a kuna , and 100 kinitas in a kina , or whatever your imagination could construct .
In am not suggesting that we restructure our time system .
The 12 , 24 , 60 , and 60 are all versatile numbers and were perhaps chosen in part for that very reason .
However , given the present metric fashion , one would expect that legislators would next try to make 100 minutes in an hour , etc .
So perhaps its good that people think these time numbers are set by nature .
The Old Paradigm
Traditional mathematics has divided numbers into " abundant numbers , perfect numbers , and deficient numbers . "
They are defined as follows :
1 ) abundant number : the sum of the factors of a number , except for itself , is greater than itself .
The first few are : 12 ( 6 ) , 18 ( 6 ) , 20 ( 6 ) , 24 ( 8 ) , 28 ( 6 ) , 30 ( 8 ) , 36 ( 9 ) , 40 ( 8 ) , 42 ( 8 ) , 48 ( 10 ) , 54 ( 8 ) , 56 ( 8 ) , 60 ( 12 ) , 66 ( 8 ) , 70 ( 8 ) , 72 ( 12 ) , 78 ( 8 ) , 80 ( 10 ) , 84 ( 12 ) , 88 ( 8 ) , 90 ( 12 ) , ...
These abundant numbers are somewhat similar to versatiles but are much less exclusive .
2 ) perfect number : the sum of the factors of a number , except for itself , equals itself .
The first few are : 6 , 28 , 496 , 8128 , 33 550 336 , 8 589 869 056 , 137 438 691 328 , ...
3 ) deficient number : the sum of the factors of a number , except for itself , is less than itself : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 19 , ....
This includes all the numbers not listed in the first two definitions .
( Many mathematicians are aware of a class of numbers called superabundant numbers  which I do not go into here .
Versatile numbers do not correspond to superabundant numbers except at the very beginning of the series . )
Abundant number : 12 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 which is greater than 12 .
Perfect number : 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 which equals 6 . Deficient Number : 10 because 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 which is less than 10 .
When and why did the " abundant , perfect , deficient " paradigm begin ?
Euclid , around 300 BC defined a perfect number as " that which is equal to its own parts . "
Nicomachus , around 100 AD , stated that all odd numbers were deficient .
( He was wrong ; 945 is abundant . )
He discussed " even abundant " and " even deficient " numbers .
He compared " even abundant numbers " to an animal with " too many parts or limbs , with ten tongues , as the poet says , and ten mouths , or with nine lips , or three rows of teeth ... " .
An " even deficient number " was said to be as though " one should be one handed , or have fewer than five fingers on one hand , or lack a tongue ... " .
Perfect numbers , he said , are akin to " wealth , moderation , propriety , beauty , and the like ... " .
All in all , not a very scientific analysis .
In more recent times , L.E. Dickson , in 1952 , ( in the classic History of the Theory of Numbers , 3 vols . ) , gives an extensive history of number theory , with a complete documentation of names and dates -- except for abundant , perfect , and deficient numbers .
The book was written as if these three categories had always existed , or had been handed down from some divine entity .
But they must have started somewhere , and for some reason .

Versatile Numbers

Egypt and the Old Paradigm
Richard Friedberg , in 1968 , ( An Adventurer 's Guide to Number Theory ) implied that Pythagorus , around 600 BC , knew the three classes of abundant , perfect , and deficient numbers , and suggested that they developed because of the way the Egyptians wrote fractions .
They never wrote 11/12 .
Instead they would write 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/12 , never putting anything but a " 1 " in the numerator .
Also , they never used the same denominator more than once .
As a result , all the perfect numbers can be split up " perfectly . "
Six can be split into 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 or 6/6 .
Twelve can be split up into 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/12 or 16/12 .
Twelve is " abundant . "
However , 10 can be split up only into 1/2 + 1/5 + 1/10 or 8/10 .
It 's a " deficient " number .
Abundant Number : 12 because 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/12 = 16/12 Perfect Number : 6 because 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 6/6 Deficient Number : 10 because 1/2 + 1/5 + 1/10 = 8/10
If Friedberg was correct , in our own number system , using our fractions perfect numbers are not necessary .
In other words , the names abundant ,  perfect ,  and deficient , and the paradigm they represent , may be an anachronism .
Versatile Numbers on the Internet
When I posted information on the internet regarding versatile numbers , I received more e-mail than I could keep up with .
It came from the United States , France , Netherlands , Germany , and Russia , from mostly people who are much better mathematicians that I .
It contained conjectures , proofs , computer generated lists of versatile numbers , and just pure speculations about numbers .
One advanced school in Russia , the Math Center of the Palace of Youth Creativity , had a  Versatile Number Day ,  at the instigation of mathematics teacher Roman Breslav ( roma@rbb.stud.pu.ru ) .
They proved some things concerning versatile numbers and made several conjectures .
I think this activity was remarkable , and this school is undoubtedly way ahead of most .
Plato and Versatile Numbers
One day I received e-mail from a Ph.D. mathematician in Switzerland , Meyer Rainer , who pointed out a passage in Platos work that he claims suggests strongly that Plato knew of versatile numbers .
I am not a Greek scholar , so it is difficult for me to judge the validity of Dr. Rainers claim , but it sounds plausible .
The passage is on pages 746- 747 of Laws V , where he says ,
There is no difficulty in perceiving that the twelve parts admit of the greatest number of divisions of that which they include , or in seeing the other numbers which are consequent upon them ... the divisions and variations of numbers have a use in respect of all the variations of which they are susceptible , both in themselves and as measures of height and depth , and in all sounds , and in motions , as well those which proceed in a straight direction , upwards or downwards , as in those which go round and round .
The legislator is to consider all these things and to bid the citizens not to lose sight of numerical order ; for no single instrument of youthful education has such mightily power , both as regards domestic economy and politics , and in the arts , as the study of arithmetic .
... if only the legislator ... can banish meanness and covetousness from the souls of men ... [ my emphasis ]
I was amazed to find Plato apparently discussing some of the same issues concerning numbers as I had been interested in .
This appears to me to be the first attempt since ancient Babylon to utilize the versatility of these numbers in a social setting .
Here are some additional relevant remarks from Laws V , p. 737-738 , that Dr. Rainer drew my attention to :
freedom from avarice and a sense of justice - - upon this rock our city shall be built ; for there ought to be no disputes among citizens about property ... that [ the people ] should create themselves enmities by their mode of distributing lands and houses , would be superhuman folly and wickedness .
How then can we rightly order the distribution of the land ?
In the first place the number of the citizens has to be determined , and also the number and size of the divisions into which they will have to be formed ; and the land and the houses will then have to be apportioned by us as fairly as we can ... The number of our citizens shall be 5040 -- this will be a convenient number ...
Every legislator ought to know so much arithmetic as to be able to tell what number is most likely to be useful to all cities ; and we are going top take that number which contains the greatest and most regular and unbroken series of divisions .
The whole of number has every possible division , and the number 5040 can be divided by exactly fifty - nine divisors [ sixty including itself ] , and ten of these proceed without interval from one to ten ; this will furnish numbers for war and peace , and for all contracts and dealing , including taxes and divisions of the land .
These properties of numbers should be ascertained leisure by those who are bound by law to know them ; for they are true , and should be proclaimed at the foundation of the city , with a view to use .
[ my comment ]
Plato considered the versatile number 5040 , according to Dr. Rainer , as " an ideal number of citizens in an ideal community , where everyone lives in peace , freedom , and friendship , and all measurements , weightings , and partitions are done in the proper way . "
Ramanujan and Versatile Numbers
Coming forward two thousand and three hundred years , we find an article published in 1915 ( Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society , Vol. 14 ) in which the noted Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan analyzes what he calls " Highly Composite Numbers . "
This paper is now considered a classic .
Ramanujan was a fascinating character and much has been said about him in articles , books , and documentaries .
Nova ( WGBH , Boston ) had a documentary about him called  The Man Who Loved Numbers . 
A book was written about him : The Man Who Knew Infinity , by Robert Kanigel .
He had a brief but brilliant life .
Ramanujans only exposure to modern European mathematics ( of his time ) was one book on mathematics .
He single - handedly re-derived some 1915 mathematics , and a good deal more , by himself .
Scientists and mathematicians today are still finding new meaning in his work .
Ramanujan was always looking for new ways to do things .
He may not have known of the traditional mathematical paradigm ( of abundant , perfect , and deficient numbers ) .
As he said in his famous letter to G .W. Hardy ( the brilliant British mathematician who brought Ramanujan to England ) , in 1913 , " I have not trodden through the conventional regular course which is followed in a University course , but am striking out a new path for myself . "
Here 's his definition of a " highly composite number " : " I define a highly composite
number as a number whose number of divisors exceed that of all its predecessors . "
This is the same as a versatile number .
( In mathematical language : the number n is called highly composite if d( m ) < d(n ) for all m < n where d(n ) is the number of divisors of n.
 Divisors  here is synonymous with factors . )
Let me give you some idea of the magnitude of his mathematical genius .
Without the use of a computer , Ramanujan had calculated all the versatiles up to 6 746 328 388 800 ( 10 080 factors ) .
He only missed one .
With regard to predicting versatile numbers he came to a similar conclusion to mine : " I do not know of any method for determining consecutive highly composite numbers except by trial . "
Nomenclature
It 's true that every composite number can be expressed as the product of primes .
In one sense , primes are the raw building material of the other numbers .
But what good is the building material without the building ?
What good are the chemical elements without the compounds ?
What good are the organs of the body without the body ?
Do we call our great cathedrals , temples , skyscrapers , geodesic domes , and other works of architecture merely " composites " ?
In other words , do we primarily ( no pun intended ) study our shelter materials and secondarily our shelters ?
Or , should we be most concerned with our shelters , and as a result , be interested in what they are of made of ?
By the end of this essay I hope to have convinced you more fully that versatiles are as important as primes .
" Prime " usually implies some excellence or value .
The word puts undue emphasis on these numbers .
The term " highly composite " might be descriptive to someone trained in mathematics , however , I believe the term versatile is simpler yet still descriptive , and should be used in order to communicate to the largest number of people the character and usefulness of these numbers .
What would you think if I called prime numbers minimally composite numbers ?
Im sure some mathematicians resent the fact that I am trying to change the standard nomenclature from highly composite to versatile . 
Perhaps they need a lesson from physics :
How many people know what a  Schwarzschild singularity  is ?
Not many .
Yet , how many people know what a black hole is ?
Almost everybody .
That s because physicist John
Wheeler would often meditate for months in order to find just the right name for something .
Nowadays , the name black hole is immediately recognizable .
So I am primarily interested in defining numbers that the public , legislators , and an average 12 year old student can easily remember and use .
Paul Erdös
In the mathematical world , we find a another famous mathematician , Paul Erdös ( pronounced erdish ) , involved with versatile numbers
.
Erdös was an interesting character that used to travel around the world with just a small suitcase , living with other mathematicians , and doing math with them .
He died in 1997 .
A book was written about him : The Man Who Loved Only Numbers .
Erdös wrote about highly composite numbers in 1944 .
Later he wrote about them with L. Alaoglu and with French mathematician Jean - Louis Nicolas .
Anyone who wants to delve into the purely mathematical nature of versatile numbers should consult works by Erdös and these people .
( See references . )
Artificial Intelligence Discovers Versatile Numbers
Doug Lenat , one of the foremost researchers in Artificial Intelligence , wrote a program called AM ( Automated Mathematician ) when he was at the Stanford AI Lab in 1976 .
AM " discovered " many concepts of standard number theory .
It was programmed such that if it discovered something interesting , it should also investigate its inverse .
Thus after it " discovered " prime numbers it also looked at numbers having a maximum of primes .
At first Lenat thought AM had discovered something completely original , but he later read about Ramanujan 's work .
Platonic Solids
There are a limited number of Platonic solids : the tetrahedron ( which I call the four - corner or the four - nook ) , the octahedron ( six - nook ) , the cube ( eight - nook ) , the icosahedron ( twelve - nook ) , and the dodecahedron ( twenty - nook ) .
Notice that many of the number of corners , edges , and faces of these figures are versatile numbers or numbers with relatively large numbers of factors .
Five Platonic Solids corners or vertices edges faces name corners edges faces tetrahedron ( 4 - nook ) 4 6 4 octahedron ( 6 - nook ) 6 12 8 cube ( 8 - nook ) 8 12 6 icosahedron ( 12 - nook ) 12 30 20 docedahedron ( 20 - nook ) 20 30 12
It was partly due to my study of these figures , which was inspired by Buckminster Fuller , that I discovered versatile numbers on my own .
Primordial Numbers
Buckminster Fuller introduces a class of numbers somewhat related to versatile numbers which he called Scheherazade numbers .
Although he never formally defines these , we can glean the fact that they are equal to the product of primes .
( He called these Scheherazade numbers as the prime numbers 7 x 11 x 13 equal 1001 and Scheherazade was a character in One Thousand and One Nights . )
Mathematicians call these numbers " prime - factorial " or " primordial " numbers .
As examples , 1 x 2 x 3 x 5 gives the primordial number 30 , and 1 x 2 x 3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 gives the primordial number 30030 .
However , the lower versatile number 24 has as many factors as 30 .
And the primordial number 30030 has 64 factors , while the closest versatile number , 27720 , a lower number , has 96 factors , or 32 more factors .
Although primordial numbers are more encompassing with regard to primes , versatile numbers are more encompassing with regard to all numbers .
Primordial Numbers : 2 , 6 , 30 , 210 , 2310 , 30 030 , 510 510 , 9 699 690 , ...
( no lower number has as many prime factors ) Versatile Numbers : 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 360 , 720 , 840 , ...
( no lower number has as many factors )
Applications of Versatile Numbers
Although Ramanujan brought these numbers to the attention of the mathematical community , has these numbers found their way into the mainstream of society ?
Have the public and legislators used these numbers to bring about ease of computation , packing and distribution ?
The answer is " no , " ( which is why I am writing this paper ) .
Hardy , ( see Collected Papers of G. W. Hardy , Vol. VII ) , called Ramanujan 's paper " ... the largest and perhaps the most important connected piece of work which he has done since his arrival in England . "
Although Ramanujan died in 1920 , at a young age , Hardy went on to live many more years , until 1947 , and continued to study Ramanujans work .
I wondered why Hardy did not try to apply this work to society .
Hardy himself answered this question : " If asked to explain how , and why , the solution of the problems which occupy the best energies of my life is of importance to the general life of the community , I must decline the unequal contest ...
A pure mathematician must leave to happier colleagues the great task of alleviating the sufferings of humanity . " ( quoted in The Man Who Knew Infinity , p. 347 )
Versatile numbers have been studied rather extensively by mathematicians .
But perhaps they have been buried in with mountains of other mathematical facts , which may or may not have any practical value .
I think it is time that economists , psychologists , sociologists , legislators , and others become aware of these numbers .
Grouping by Dozens
The ancient merchants possibly intuitively knew to use a versatile 12 , or dozen , in their trade .
There are many other examples of the ancients using a versatile dozen or a close relative .
SOME DOZENAL EXAMPLES twelve inches to a foot twelve - pack six - pack twelve parts to the chromatic scale twenty - four to a case two times twelve hours in a day a dozen twelve to a gross twelve hours in a Babylonian day twelve ounces in a troy pound twelve lines to an inch twelve pence to a shilling twelve months to a year two times twelve letters in the Greek alphabet twelve , twenty - four , and thirty - six to a roll of film
A base twelve numbering system was proposed in 1586 by Simon Stevin , and again in 1760 by Georges Louis Leclerc .
Then , in October of 1934 , an author by the name of F. Emerson Andrews , wrote an article for The Atlantic Monthly ,  An Excursion in Numbers ,  which eventually led to the formation , in 1944 , of the Duodecimal Society ( later called the Dozenal Society ) .
The Society rightly points out that a dozenal base is better than a ten base .
It has investigated the mathematics of a dozenal system .
It also publishes papers concerned with dozenal systems .
I was the annual guest speaker for the Dozenal Society in 1997 and gave a lecture on  Numbers of the Future ? ,  a base twelve number system .
Isaac Asimov was a member of the Dozenal Society and has several paragraphs in Realm of Numbers concerning the advantages of a base twelve number system , but seems convinced that our ten fingers are too big an obstacle to overcome .
This point might be refutable by simply counting with the thumb on the three bony segments of each four fingers , which gives a versatile twelve .
Despite a few dissenters , the world has continued to slip toward base ten and the so - called scientific base ten metric system .
For example , in 1971 , the British switched from half - pennies , pennies , threepence , sixpence , shillings , half - crowns , pounds , and guineas ( a 1/2 , 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 30 , 240 , 252 , system which uses numbers with lots of factors or versatile numbers ) , to a decimal ( 1 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 1000 , etc. ) mostly non-versatile , monetary system .
The more versatile numbers were in use when London was the foremost financial center of the world .
The English system of measurement with 12 inches to the foot was in use when the U.S. put a man on the moon .
Now the U.S. is trying ( with much resistance ) to go to a non-versatile metric system .
It 's a noble goal to align all your measuring systems with your number system , and those who have tried to do so should be thanked for their efforts .
However , instead of changing our versatile measuring system to match our numbers , perhaps we should have changed our numbers to match our more versatile measuring system .
Perhaps we really just got off on the wrong foot ( maybe I should say hand ) when we started counting by tens , using our eight fingers and our two thumbs .
Base Ten Glasses
Why have n't versatile numbers , in a sense the " shelters , " the " great cathedrals , " the marvelous organisms  of all our numbers , been more intensively taught to the general public ?
I believe we 've been completely surrounded by versatile numbers for so long ( 360 degrees in a circle , 360 degrees in the heavens , 12 months , 60 seconds , 60 minutes , 24 hours , 12 in a dozen , 12 inches in a foot , 6 - packs , 12 - packs , 12-24-36 pictures in a roll of film , 12 notes , 12 pence , etc. ) that we have forgotten about them .
It s like the story of two fish having an argument about whether water exists .
And even if someone does discover versatile numbers , they are an embarrassment to a society that uses " ten , " not a versatile number , as the core of its number system .

A base 10 system ( or a base 12 system ) overlays a mental pattern on numbers .
In fact , all patterns in numbers ( other than 1 + 1 + 1 ... ) are the result of the versatility or factorability of numbers .
For example , when one looks for patterns in number , prime numbers have no pattern in them , while versatile numbers have the most patterns .
In other words , |
|
|
|
|
| | | | ||| ( 12 ) can be composed like this : | | | ||| | | | | | | or ||| ||| ||| ||| or | ||| | ||| | || | or || || || || || || .
Whereas with |
|
|
|
|
|
| | | | ||| ( 13 ) , you cant make any patterns ( except that basic pattern underlying all number | + | + | + | + | ... ) .
NUMBERS AND THEIR PATTERNS
| no patterns
|| no patterns ( prime )
||| no patterns ( prime )
| ||| = || || ( versatile )
| | ||| no patterns ( prime )
| | | ||| = ||| ||| = || || || ( versatile )
| | | | || | no patterns ( prime )
| | | | | ||| = | ||| | ||| = || || || ||

|
| | | | ||| = | | ||| | | ||| = || || || || ||
| | |
| | | | | || | no patterns ( prime )
| |
|
|
|
|
|
| | ||| = | | | ||| | | | ||| = | ||| | ||| | ||| = ||| ||| ||| ||| = || || || || || || ( versatile )
etc .
( versatile numbers have more possible patterns than any smaller number )
One interesting possibility would be to have a counting system that kept changing to the next versatile number base .
Our time system , which shifts from a 60 second and 60 minute base to a 24 hour base is somewhat like this .
I think it might be possible .
The mental number pattern that Homo sapiens imposes on the world results in everyone looking at the world through a pair of glasses that could be called , base - ten glasses . 
These glasses will tend to filter out certain things , and let in other things .
Someone with these glasses would see |
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
| | | | || | and say ,  I see ten and ten and four , or 24 . 
Someone with more versatile base - twelve - filter - glasses would say ,  I see twelve and twelve , or two dozen . 
THE FUNDAMENTAL PATTERNS OF A NUMBER |
|
|
|
|
|
|
| | | || Twelve as a pure amount or number without base - 10 filter glasses .
( || + || ) + ( || + || ) + ( || + || )
Breaking twelve down into its inherent no- patterns ( primes ) || , || , and |||. | | | | | | | | | | | | Breaking this down further into the most fundamental material of twelve , | + | + | ... , we sort of arrive back where we started .
Thus , when one has to make a common decision about how many , as in the example as I mentioned earlier , in which the state legislature wants to reduce class size , perhaps they will have choices of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 .
The base - ten - tool - filter - glasses will tend to make them see , and thus chose , 20 , 25 , or 30 , when the most versatile and easy to divide number in this range is 24 .
Versatile base - twelve - filter - glasses would have immediately shown the versatile number 24 .
Practical filter - glasses would have shown 18 , 20 , 24 , and 30 .
Thus , in the long term , perhaps our numbering system should have a versatile number at its core rather than a non-versatile number .
In my booklet , Nature 's Numbers , and in my video ,  Numbers of the Future ,  I discuss this , and also propose what I believe is a more efficient , easily learned numbering system ( not using 0 - 9 but entirely different symbols of my own invention ) derived from versatile numbers .
I have personally taught this system to over 6000 students .
The Gravitational Symmetry Limit
In my video of 1995 , I relate the versatile number 12 to easily remembered geometrical models -- models formed due to what I call  the gravitational accumulation of spheres  ( closest packing of spheres ) .
I found in my research that the gravitational accumulation of spheres results in only five regular shapes consisting of : two balls , three balls , four balls , six balls , and twelve balls .
No matter how many balls you add to the total , you can only get these six regular shapes .
Symmetry is just a fancy name for what I call turn - same . 
If you can turn something and it looks the same as before , that s a symmetry of 2 .
Twelve balls gravitationally packed together , so that they can not get any closer to each other , has a turn - same of 60 .
The symmetries of the two balls , three balls , four balls , six balls , and twelve balls are 4 , 6 , 12 , 24 , and 60 - - all versatile numbers .
I also found that the symmetry of the system increases up to 12 balls , but no matter how many balls you add to the gravitational field after that , you can no longer increase the symmetry .
Thus , twelve balls is what I call the gravitational symmetry limit . 
It s not surprising to find all these versatile numbers associated with symmetry when you think about it .
Versatile numbers are useful because they have so many divisors or factors , or potential built - in patterns .
Patterns or repetitions are what make symmetry .

Versatile Numbers

The Largest Versatiles
Building a car that breaks the worlds land speed record can give insight into automotive design , and by the same logic , finding the largest versatile can give insight into numbers .
I am not a computer programmer by trade , but I knew enough to program my old computer to calculate up to the one hundred and fifth versatile , V ( 105 ) .
This was just beyond what Ramanujan had calculated without a computer .
He went to V( 103 ) .
Others have used computers to calculate versatiles far beyond this .
SOME LARGE VERSATILE NUMBERS :
V ( 103 ) = 2^8 * 3^3 * 5^2 * 7^2 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 * 23 .
V ( 1646 ) = 2^11 * 3^8 * 5^4 * 7^3 * ( 11...23 ) ^2 * 29 *...241 .
V ( 1800 ) = 2^11 * 3^8 * 5^4 * 7^3 * ( 11...29 ) ^2 * 31... 263 .
Using the graphing calculator notation , * means times  and ^ means  to the power of .
The ... refers to all the prime numbers that have been left out .
An abbreviated notation is used for writing these large numbers where ... means all the primes left out .
For example , versatile number 1646 , or V ( 1646 ) = 2^11 * 3^8 * 5^4 * 7^3 * ( 11...23 ) ^2 * 29 *...241 . ( Using graphing calculator notation here , * means times  and ^ means  to the power of . )
A French paper was brought to my attention ,  Methods dOptimisation pour un Probleme de Theorie des Nombres ,  by Guy Robin , in which he gives the first versatile number to have more than 10^1000 ( that s a 1 followed by 1000 zeros ) factors .
This number is : 2^20 * 3^12 * 5^8 * 7^7 * ( 11*13*17 ) ^5 * ( 19*23 ) ^4 * ( 29...71 ) ^3 * ( 73...421 ) ^2 * 431...30113 .
It has 2^3203*3^68*5^2*7*13 factors .
They reported that if we were to write it out it would have 13,198 digits .
( However , Guy Robin infomed me recently by e-mail that it actually has 13,199 digits . )
Two mathematicians I met on the Internet , Noam Shazer and Matt Conroy , brought to my attention the method of generating versatiles of huge sizes by using primes .
( See Appendix A. )
For example , to calculate V( 103 ) 6,746,328,388,800 one has to only know the primes up to 23 .
Versatiles of billions of digits become feasible given simply enough computing time and computing speed .
Although this method can sling shot versatiles from primes , it does not find every versatile .
Jud McCranie holds some records for generating a certain class of prime numbers .
Using this method , he started programming his computer to generate versatile numbers , and was able to produce a versatile of 7 trillion digits
There is not a very concise way to write a large versatile , that I know of , as there is with very large primes .
For example a Mersenne prime with 909,562 digits can be written quite concisely as : 2^3,021,377 - 1 .
( This was the largest known prime , the last time I checked , but may not be any more .
A Mersenne prime is just a prime of the form  2 to some power minus 1 . 
So , 2 to the 3rd power , minus 1 , is 7 , a prime . )
A computer programmer from Canada , John Boyer , sent me a proof of the infinitude of versatile numbers .
( Appendix D ) Since Euclid proved that primes are infinite , John uses this to show that versatiles are infinite also .
The Hidden Chaotic Structure in Numbers
Primes are essentially inevitable but unpredictable .
In other words , you always know another one is coming , but you never know exactly where it will appear .
Imagine a Neanderthal who somehow figured out that the first primes were 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , and 13 .
Now he is hunting for the next one .
There is no way he can predict when it will arrive unless he tries .
Is it 14 ?
No , that s divisible by 2 .
Is it 15 ?
No , that s divisible by 3 .
Is it 16 ?
No , that s divisible by 2 .
Is it 17 ?
That s not divisible by 2 , by 3 , by 4 , or by any other number .
It is 17 .
I quote here from Tom M. Apostle , professor emeritus at Cal Tech , no simple formula exists for producing all the primes . 
In my thinking , a simple formula involves a pattern , or repetition .
Any repetition implies multiplication .
Multiplication implies a factor .
And , if there is a factor involved , then , of course , we know that the number is not prime .
There is no recipe .
This same rule , inevitable but unpredictable , holds true also for versatile numbers .
They are inevitable , in that they are infinite , and they are unpredictable , in that we never know when the next one is coming .
Just like with primes you have to try and see .
This rule is built into the fundamental nature of mathematics , in the similar way that the speed of light appears to be an upper boundary to the speed of moving objects .
You can group by any base you want , and it doesnt affect the hidden chaotic structure in numbers as given by primes and versatiles .
If you examine number theory in general , you find that it does not have much of a structure .
John Stillwell , Mathematics and its History ( p. 27 ) : number theory has never been submitted to a systematic treatment like that undergone by elementary geometry in Euclids Elements . 
So there is this sort of hidden chaos in numbers , with the primes on one side and the versatiles on the other side .
Actually , our misplaced faith in the complete regularity of numbers is somewhat a result of the base we use to group these numbers .
We can kind of get a feel for this chaos if we look at the following chart .
In the first three columns , we see the numbers , primes , and versatiles in our Hindu - Arabic base - ten system .
In the second three columns , we see them in their purity , without the filter - glasses - tool of a base - ten - grouping system .

Synergy , Wholism , and Systems Theory
With regard to versatile numbers , there is a loose parallel to the history of psychology .
Sigmund Freud and others intently studied psychotic and neurotic behavior , or aberration .
This , of course , gave a skewed view of human nature .
Abraham Maslow decided to study healthy people or what he called " self - actualized " people .
This resulted in a new branch of psychology called humanistic psychology .
The two together provided us with a more balanced view of humanity .
In other words , I believe that the general public has been taught about numbers with a minimum of factors ( primes ) , while they have not been taught about numbers with a large number of factors ( versatiles ) .
Versatile numbers may have potential use in the field of ( w ) holism .
Wholism can be defined as  the theory that whole entities , as fundamental components of reality , have an existence other than as the mere sum of their parts . ( Random House )
WHOLISM : the theory that whole entities , as fundamental components of reality , have an existence other than as the mere sum of their parts .
( Random House Dict . ) REDUCTIONISM : the theory that every complex phenomenon , especially in biology or psychology , can be explained by analyzing the simplest , most basic physical mechanisms that are in operation during the phenomennon .
( Random House Dict . )
Wholism has been attacked by science philosopher Karl Popper and others .
But Systems Analysis , a practical application of wholism , has been used successfully for many years .
It was found that environmental problems did not respond to compartmentalized attacks , but needed a larger viewpoint .
Harry J. White , in the Encyclopedia Americana , say Systems Analysis is an outgrowth of advanced technology ,  because of the demands of society for more effective solutions of complex environmental , production , and transportation problems . 
Also , as Bucky Fuller used to point out , when one considers the alloy chrome - nickel - steel , it s strength is not merely the sum of its individual parts .
The primary components are iron , chromium , and nickel , with minor components of carbon , manganese , and others .
The tensile strength of iron is about 60,000 pounds per square inch .
Chromium is about 70,000 p.s.i..
Nickel is about 80,000 p.s.i.
Carbon and the other minor components add another 50,000 p.s.i.
Add them all up , and you get about 260,000 p.s.i.
But the tensile strength of chrome - nickel - steel runs to about 350,000 p.s.i.
The number 12 , due to its highly versatile nature , due to the structure of numbers , does appear to have an existence other than as the mere sum of its parts .
( 12 = 11+1 , 10+2 , 9+3 , 8+4 , 7+5 , 6+6 . )
The number has more factors than numbers up to twice its sum .
Pure reductionists may say that we can still analyze why 12 is a unique number , ( because it has more factors than any smaller number ) but we must remember that versatile numbers , like primes , are unpredictable .
If pure reductionism were completely valid , then we would expect that we could predict the next versatile number .
For that matter , if pure reductionism were valid , then why couldnt we predict the next prime number ?
And since we cant even predict the next prime number , in the apparently abstract and well - ordered discipline of mathematics , can we expect a purely reductionistic approach to work in the real world of science ?
I am sort of glad that we have this unpredictability in numbers .
It seems to satisfy some inherent desire that the universe not be completely predictable by science .
Philosophically , I have long since known that a completely predictable universe would be a completely boring universe .
We would have no interest in it .
Douglas Hofstadter , in his notable work , Gödel , Escher , Bach , also discusses chaos in the midst of the most perfect , harmonious , and beautiful of all creations : the system of natural numbers . ( p. 398-408 )
Of course there is order in numbers .
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ...
It is obvious and simple .
Yet this simple order , so apparent in counting and addition , somehow creates a sort of chaos in multiplication and division .

At some points , where the versatiles occur , there seems to be a sort of self - organization .
One can not help but wonder if this mirrors the self - organization that occurs in living systems .
Perhaps we can generalize to : all things can be broken apart into their basics , yet all things are a part of infinitely greater structures .
Is the universe less a machine and more a living system or organism ( Newtonian paradigm to Gaia paradigm ) ?
Should we begin to emphasize less the fundamental ( or prime ) structure of things and more the interconnectedness ( versatility ) of things ?
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is probably the foundation of what structure there is in Number Theory .
This states that every number can be broken down into a different set of prime numbers .
However , opposed to this , but connected to it , we might also say that every number is unique part of an infinite set of versatile numbers .
( Proof in Appendix E ) Perhaps this should be called the Organic Theorem of Arithmetic .
On the one hand , each number can be broken down into its parts , on the other hand each number is part of some greater structure that is nested within still greater structures , ad infinitum .
( This theorem has been proven . )
Every number is nested within versatile numbers .
Versatile numbers , are numbers , in which as many different parts as possible are interwoven into a whole , a unity .
Unity + versatility = Uni-versal numbers .
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic Organic Theorem of Arithmetic Every number can be broken down into a different set of primes .
Example : 8=2x2x2
Every number is a part of an
infinite set of versatiles .
Example : 8 is a part of 24 , 48 , 120 , 240 , ...
If you think about number from this perspective an interesting thing happens .
The figure becomes the ground , and the ground becomes the figure .
Versatile Life Systems
Lets imagine again the human body ( called by some a complex adaptive system ) as an loose analogy .
It can be broken down chemically into its elements ( primes ) : carbon , oxygen , hydrogen , etc .
These elements ( primes ) can be combined in many different ways that are completely unremarkable ( non-versatile numbers ) , but when they are combined into certain patterns , a human body ( versatile number ) results .
No one could have predicted it .
But there it is .
Perhaps it was inevitable .
The heart is a part of larger and larger systems .
It is nested within them .
The circulatory system , the body , the family , the community , the nation , all living things , the whole earth , the solar system , etc .
Sort of like the versatile number 8 is a part of the versatile numbers 24 , 48 , 120 , 240 , 360 , 720 , 360 , 840 , 1680 and every remaining versatile number .
But the heart is not a part of the skeletal system , which is a larger system than the heart .
Sort of like the number 8 is not part of every larger versatile number .
It is not a part of 12 or 36 for example .
Is it a mere coincidence that carbon , the basis of all life as we know it , is element number 6 , with 6 protons , 6 neutrons , and 6 electrons ?
Perhaps .
Is it a coincidence that Carbon 60 , the spherical molecule of great strength , has a versatile 60 number of atoms ?
Perhaps .
Is it a coincidence that the primary fuel of the human body , C6H12O6 , uses versatile numbers ?
Perhaps .
Is it a mere coincidence that DNA , the molecule that carries the blueprint of our bodies uses a versatile 4 different parts ?
Perhaps .
Summary
An important class of numbers , equal in importance to prime numbers , possibly known to the ancient Babylonians , probably known about by Plato , was rediscovered by Ramanujan 1915 .
These numbers have more potential built - in patterns than any smaller number .
Numbers with no inherent patterns we call prime numbers ( except for 1 ) .
Mathematicians , in the past , as well as in recent times , have recommended using one of these versatile numbers , 12 , for our number base .
However , thus far , society has stuck with the more awkward base ten system .
In 1992 , I independently developed a base 12 number system and symbolism .
In 1995 , I independently rediscovered Ramanujan 's highly composite numbers  and dubbed them " versatile numbers . "
Things can be shared evenly easier with these numbers than with other numbers .
Thus , they have unexplored ramifications in economics , business , psychology , and other social sciences .
OLD PARADIGM NEW PARADIGM reductionistic reductionistic - wholistic prime prime - versatile deficient
perfect
abundant non-versatile and versatile
A specific name , versatile numbers , was coined , to allow the vast majority to understand the importance of these numbers , and to raise the status of these numbers to that of at least the status of prime numbers .
POSSIBLE NUMBER NOMENCLATURES
Reductionistic Wholistic Reductionistic - Wholistic prime no-pattern prime composite patterned patterned highly composite organic versatile
Currently almost 6 billion people think , subconsciously , in terms of 10s and 100s , etc. , not a very versatile system .
Force a human mind to think in terms of 10s and 100s , when the most versatile of all numbers are 2 , 6 , 12 , 60 , 360 , and 2520 , and you have perhaps to some degree limited that mind , and possibly even warped that mind .
I sometimes try to imagine what would be the synergetic effect if humankinds collective numerical mind pattern were made aware of versatile numbers , and were eventually brought into synchronization with a versatile number system .
For example , what would happen if we had more versatile , base - twelve filter glasses ? 
Probably people would continue to fight with each other , no matter what .
However , numbers are a tool .
Why not use the best possible tool to lubricate Homo sapiens economic and social interaction ?
Conclusions
1 . Homo sapiens routinely uses a mental - tool - filter - glasses - pattern to deal with continually increasing amounts in the world around him or her .
2 . The mental - tool - filter - glasses - pattern predominantly used on Earth is probably |
|
| | | | | | | | or ten .
3 . Many amounts ( versatile amounts ) have relatively high potential patterns built - in .
4 . Homo sapiens might benefit from becoming more aware of these more versatile amounts .
( 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 360 , 720 , ... )
5 . Homo sapiens might benefit from using a mental - tool - filter - glasses pattern with relatively high potential built - in patterns , as his or her primarily mental - tool - filter - glasses - pattern for dealing with the world around him or her .
Fundamental Thesis : Liberal use of versatile numbers ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 360 , 720 , ... ) could lubricate a humans interaction with surrounding humans and the surrounding universe , especially in an increasingly populated world .
Additional minor theses :
a) The unpredictability of prime numbers and versatile numbers suggests a mathematical foundation for chaos in nature .
b ) The unpredictability of prime numbers and versatile numbers may oppose the idea of a completely reductionistic approach to science .
c ) Versatile Numbers suggests a mathematical foundation for self - organization .
APPENDIX A : Sling Shot Method for determining some Versatile Numbers using Prime Numbers
This method was used by Ramanujan , and was brought to my attention by Noam Shazeer and Matt Conroy .
( Note : Internet notation is used .
* means times , ^ means  to the power of ,  and _ means  subscript . )
For any positive integer n , let f( n ) denote the number of factors of n .
If n = ( p_1^e_1 ) ( p_2^e_2 ) ... ( p_m^e_m ) where p_i denotes the ith prime number , then the factors of n will be numbers of the form ( p_1 ^f_1 ) ( p_2 ^f_2 ) ... ( p_m^f_m ) where 0 < =f_i < =e_i for all i .
Since there are e_i +1 choices for each f_i , the number of factors of n is ( e_ 1+1 ) ( e_ 2+1 ) ... ( e_m +1 )
To generate a versatile number , pick an arbitrary positive real number r. Now let us find the value(s ) of n which maximize ( f( n ) ^r ) / n .
If we find such an n , we can be sure that there is no x<n such that f(x ) > =f ( n ) .
If there were , ( f( x ) ^r ) / x would surely be greater than ( f( n ) ^r ) / n .
So n would be a versatile number .
Now let us find an n which maximizes ( f( n ) ^r ) / n .
Begin by noting that f( n ) ^r ) / n = ( ( e_1+1 ) ^r ) / ( p_1^e_1 ) * ( ( e_ 2+1 ) ^r ) / ( p_2^e_2 ) ... ( ( e_m+1 ) ^r ) / ( p_m^e_m ) .
I will omit the proof that ( f( n ) ^r ) / n achieves a maximum .
This will become obvious in a minute .
To achieve our desired n , we must , for each i , pick an e_i which maximizes ( ( e_i+1 ) ^r /( p_i^e_i ) > ( ( ( e_i - 1 ) + 1 ^r ) / ( p_i^ ( e_i - 1 ) ) if and only if
( ( e_i+1 ) / ( e - i ) ) ^r > p_i if and only if
(( e_i+1 ) / ( e_i ) ) > ( p_i ) ^ ( 1/r ) if and only if
1+1/( e_i ) > ( p_i ) ^( 1/r ) if and only if
( e_i ) > 1/(( p_i ) ^( 1/r ) ) - 1 )
So ( ( e_i+1 ) ^r ) / ( p_i^e_i ) is clearly maximized when e_i is the greatest integer less than 1 /(( p_i ) ^ ( 1/r ) - 1 ) .
This will be positive only when p_i < 2 ^r , i.e. only finitely often .
So let us try our method ,
Let r=4 ,
p_1e2 , so e_1 = | 1 / ( ( 2 ) ^ ( 1/4 ) - 1 ) ) | = 5
p_2=3 , so e_2 = | 1 / ( ( 3 ) ^ ( 1/4 ) - 1 ) ) | = 3
p_3=5 , so e_3 = | 1 / ( ( 5 ) ^ ( 1/4 ) - 1 ) ) | = 2
when p_i = 7 , 11 , and 13 , e_i = 1 .
when p_1 > 16 , e_i = 0
So , n=2^5 * 3^3 * 5^2 * 7 * 11 * 13 = 21621600
f(n ) = 576
Let r=6
p_1=2 , so e_1 = | 1 / ( ( 2 ) ^ ( 1/6 ) - 1 ) ) | = 8
p_2=3 , so e_2 = | 1 / ( ( 3 ) ^ ( 1/6 ) - 1 ) ) | = 4
p_3=5 , so e_3 = | 1 / ( ( 5 ) ^ ( 1/6 ) - 1 ) ) | = 3
p_4=7 , so e_4 = | 1 / ( ( 7 ) ^ ( 1/6 ) - 1 ) ) | = 2
p_5=11 , so e_5 = 1 / ( ( 11 ) ^ ( 1/6 ) - 1 ) ) | = 2
when p_i = 13 , 17 , 19 , 23 , 29 , 31 , 37 , 41 , 43 , 47 , 53 , 59 , 61 , e_i = 1
when p_i > 64 , e_i = 0
So n=2^8 * 3^4 8 5^3 * 7^2 * 11 ^ 2 *
13*17*19*23*29*31*37*41*43*47*53*59*61
which has 30 digits .
f(n ) = 13271040 *
To produce a versatile number of about d digits , let r be approximately ln( d * ln ( 10 ) ) / ln( 2 ) .
You should be able to compute the versatile number in about d*ln ( d ) time .
Note : this method does not produce all versatile numbers , e.g. no value of r produces the versatile number 4 .
APPENDIX B : Teaching Versatile Numbers
First , one would want the students to know how to factor a number .
There are certain helpful rules that are found in many mathematics textbooks , or which , I believe could be derived by the students with proper guidance .
Some examples of these rules are : 1 ) all even numbers can be divided by two , 2 ) all numbers that end in 5 or 0 can be divided by five , 3 ) all numbers whose digits add to a number divisible by 3 can be divided by 3 .
There are other rules , and one could go into as much depth as one wished .
Second , have the students use this knowledge of factoring to make a factor table as shown at the beginning of this chapter .
They may need some assistance with some of the primes , but they should be able to make a table up to say 60 or 120 ( depending on their grade level ) .
Third , have them circle all the primes .
That is , have them circle all the numbers with just two factors .
One could then also go into as much detail concerning primes as one wished .
Last , have them copy the table over ( or use the same table ) , and have them circle , in the last column , every time a number is greater than all the previous numbers .
In other words , ( looking at the first column now ) , every time a number had more factors than all the previous numbers .
Explain that these numbers are versatile numbers and give an example of how they are more versatile than other numbers , especially primes .
The example of 23 students in a class versus 24 students in a class might be a good example to use .
Of course , a more advanced class could use a computer program to generate versatile numbers .
There may be better ways to teach this .
APPENDIX C : Possible Time - Line To Convert to a Versatile Number System
Of course , considering the chaotic nature of the universe , civilization , and technological growth , every social program should be tentative only , as it is quite possible that due to factors completely unknown to me , this entire paper would become irrelevant and obsolete .
Possible time - line to convert from a non-versatile to versatile economy :
2000 Begin to raise awareness of general populace concerning versatile numbers .
2010 Versatile numbers taught in some textbooks alongside prime numbers .
2050 Versatile numbers taught in all elementary , middle school , and high school textbooks .
2100 Some individuals begin to use a versatile number system .
2200 Versatile number system spreads throughout society .
2400 Society has converted to a versatile number system including all weights and measures , and monetary system .
APPENDIX D : Proof of the Infinitude of Versatile Numbers
Consider a versatile number V1 , and compute the next prime number P that is greater than V1 .
Now consider the number V2 = PV1 .
The number V2 is obviously greater than V1 .
More importantly , V2 has at least one more factor than V1 , namely P .
The proof of this is simple : P cannot be a factor of V1 since V1 < P , and all other factors of V1 must be factors of V2 because any factor F such that FG = V1 would appear as F ( GP ) = V2 .
Thus , since V2 has more factors than V1 , the next versatile number after V1 must be either V2 or appear before V2 numerically .
This establishes the existence of a versatile number that is greater than any given versatile number .
Inductively , this implies that the set of versatile numbers is unlimited provided we have an infinitude of primes from which to draw P , which was established by Euclid .

APPENDIX E : Proof that every number , N , is a factor of some versatile number , V .
Thm1 : ( proved by Ramanujan , 1915 ) : Let a [p ] [ k ] denote the exponent of the prime p in the k-th V number ;
For any fixed p , when k goes to infinity , a [p ] [ k ] tends to infinity .
Thm 2 : Let V be a versatile number with prime factorization
V = PROD ( i = 1 to inf , p_i ^ a_i ) .
Clearly , a_i = 0 for sufficient i .
Now , suppose a_i < a _( i+1 ) .
Then by replacing p_i^a_i and p_(i+1 ) ^a_( i+1 )
with p_i^a_ ( i+1 ) and p_( i+1 ) ^a_i , respectively , in the product for V , we
obtain a V ' < V with the same number of factors .
This contradicts the fact that V
was versatile .
We conclude that a_i >= a _( i+1 ) , which is to say , the
exponents in the prime factorization of V occur in descending order .
This
means that the 0 exponents occur after the positive exponents .
Thm 3 : Every positive number N is a factor of some versatile number .
Proof : Every finite number N has a prime factorization ( fundamental theorem
of arithmetic ) .
Consider the highest exponent E from the primes in N's

By Thm 1 , there exists a versatile V[k ] for which P^E is a
factor ( the power of P may be greater than E in V[ k ] ) .
By Thm 2 , every

Handwriting a window to your heart ?
handwriting analysis
The early signs of heart disease may show up in your handwriting , says one researcher , an idea others have likened to palm reading .
Findings of study carried out at the UK's Poole Hospital were presented at a recent International Graphonomics Society conference in Melbourne .
Handwriting researcher Christina Strang reported she had analysed the handwriting of over 100 people in their early 60s , including 61 patients at the hospital 's cardiac clinic .
She also analysed the writing of 41 people who had not been diagnosed with cardiac disease .
Strang says previous studies have focused on the effect on writing of neurological conditions such as Parkinson's , Huntington 's and Alzheimer 's diseases .
But she wanted to see if cardiac disease could also leave its mark .
Strang analysed magnified samples of writing for various features including breaks in the writing , malformed 'o 's and resting dots , where the pen rests momentarily in the middle of a pen stroke .
She found that people in the cardiac clinic group had a statistically significant higher number of resting dots than the control group , especially in the upper middle zone of the letters ' a ' , 'e ' and 'o ' .
Strang says she has submitted the findings for publication and attempts to replicate the findings are now under way .
She says much research in this area has been very unscientific and she is attempting to bring some rigour to it .
Credibility gap
But some researchers think the paper has little hope of being published in a clinical journal .
" I am afraid it does not pass the credibility test , " says neuropsychiatrist Professor Perminder Sachdev of the University of New South Wales , who viewed Strang 's paper .
He says there are problems with the way study participants were selected and studied .
Sachdev also wonders what possible mechanisms there could be to link handwriting with heart disease and criticises Strang for failing to offer any interpretation of her findings .
" Is it that the patients are more tired and therefore pause a lot while writing ? " he says .
Dr Karen Stollznow of the Australian Skeptics says Strang appears to be a proponent of the " pseudoscience " of " graphology " .
" Graphology is the handwriting equivalent of palm reading , " says Stollznow , who is based in the US .
Graphonomy or graphology ?
She says while there are scientific approaches to handwriting analysis , which should be referred to as graphonomy , the two terms are often confused and the terms used interchangeably .
" Handwriting production might be affected by some disorders ( eg Parkinson 's disease ) but this is not to say that handwriting style can be an indicator of disease , and specifically heart disease , " says Stollznow .
" Simply , there is n't any evidence to correlate heart disease with handwriting style , or to suggest that handwriting style can be used to accurately diagnose illness . "
Strang now plans to collaborate with Dr Andrew McLeod , the senior cardiac consultant at Poole Hospital , to test a much larger group of diagnosed heart disease patients .
She says while McLeod was initially sceptical that non-neurological conditions could leave their mark in handwriting , he was impressed by the preliminary findings .
Strang hopes one day handwriting analysis can predict the early stage of heart disease without the need for invasive and expensive techniques .
Writing while drunk
Australian researchers meanwhile have been studying the impact of alcohol intoxication on handwriting .
Dr Jim Phillips of Monash University and colleagues studied the impact of three to five standard drinks of vodka and orange on the handwriting of 20 men in their 20s .
" Their handwriting got larger , " says Phillips .
His team found that having a blood alcohol reading of about 0.05 % changed the speed at which pen strokes began and ended .
" The acceleration phase seemed to be longer and the deceleration phase seemed to be shorter , " says Phillips .
While the finding that a few drinks causes problems with your fine - motor skills may not be surprising , Phillips there is very little research on the impact of alcohol on handwriting .
He says the findings may assist in forensic investigations , trying to determine whether someone was under the influence when , for example , signing a document .
Most programming languages handle failures with either of two paradigms : failing routines return special values , or they throw exceptions .
Either way has its severe problems : in languages like C it can be very simple to forget to catch such a return value , and very tedious to propagate them to the caller ; on the other hand throwing exceptions often clutters the code with way too many try blocks , and it 's generally unfriendly if you try to automatically parallelize expressions .
So Perl 6 offers a middle ground : soft or unthrown exceptions .
If a routine calls fail ( " message " ) , a new Failure object is created and returned from the current routine .
That object behaves as an undefined value , which stores the message , file and line information of the fail ( ) location , a backtrace and so on .
When you ask such an object whether it 's true or false , or defined or undefined , you 'll get a correct answer , and the exception is marked as handled .
However if you try to use it as an ordinary value , it turns into an ( ordinary ) fatal exception .
So both of these work :
my $ handle = open ( ' nonexistingfile ' ) ; if $ handle { .
say for $ handle .
lines ; } else { } my $ handle = open ( ' nonexistingfile ' ) ; . say for $ handle .
lines ;
Now if you do some automatically parallelized operations , a single failure does n't have to abort the whole operation , and neither is information lost

Vanessa George sent picture of her own daughter naked to internet paedophile ring
Vanessa George admitted the charges and will be sentenced on Tuesday
Nursery paedophile Vanessa George took a picture of her naked eldest daughter and sent it on to an online paedophile ring .
Pearl George was snapped by her 18 - stone mother as she darted out of the shower in search of a towel in May last year , just a month before her arrest .
George , who has since pleaded guilty to sexually abusing children and babies in her care , even captioned the picture with what police say were ‘ disgusting comments of a sexual nature ’ .
Pearl , now 15 , told The News of the World of her disgust at what her mother had done : ‘ I want people to know why I really hate and despise her so much .
‘ A mother is supposed to be there for her daughter , is n’t she ?
Not betray her .
‘ What she inflicted on those unfortunate babies and toddlers at the nursery was wicked , but to then discover she had no conscience about exploiting me , her own flesh and blood , was awful . ’
Pearl had no idea about her mother ’s double life until she was arrested and charged with abusing children at Little Ted ’s nursery in Plymouth where she worked .
She only learned about the existence of the sick photo of herself after police told her father , Andrew .
He said : ‘ Our hearts go out to the families of the children Vanessa abused , but I hope people will also realise that we are also victims , especially after the way she humiliated and took advantage of our daughter . ’
George is expected to be sentenced on Tuesday along with Angela Allen and Colin Blanchard who both also admitted a string of offences .
Another woman was also arrested over her alleged involvement in a Facebook paedophile ring .
Police officers outside Little Ted 's Child Day Care Unit in Plymouth shortly after George 's arrest
Tracy Lyons is alleged to have sent a video to Blanchard , an online accomplice of George’s .
The nursery worker has been charged with sexually assaulting a child .
Lyons recently gave birth to her ninth child while in custody .
The shocking news comes as an investigation by the Independent On Sunday revealed a series of websites that promote female - perpetrated child abuse as ' natural , educational and enjoyable ' for children .
User profiles on one website monitored by the newspaper claimed to be those of teachers , doctors and retired grandmothers who list interests in ' young girls ' and ' lesbian incest ' .
The posts - assuming they have not been made by men - are evidence that female abusers are not anomalies or forced into such depravity by abusive men , the report claims .
Dr Anne Carpenter , a clinical and forensic psychologist in Glasgow , said : ' The internet is presenting clinicians with completely new dilemmas and new questions .
' We do n't know if interaction on these websites translates into offences , but while many may be able to stop at the fantasy level , we cannot ignore these sites and assume people wo n't act on these fantasies .
' They may be fewer in number , but women are as accountable for their actions as men . '
WASHINGTON  Senator Ben Nelson , Democrat of Nebraska , says he is not sure he is ready to help a Democratic health care proposal clear even the most preliminary hurdle : gaining the 60 votes his party ’s leaders need to open debate on the measure later this week .
Two of his fellow Democrats , Senators Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas , are proving tough sells as well , raising the prospect that one or perhaps all three of them could scuttle the bill before the fight over it even begins on the Senate floor .
“ I think what is most important for me is to take a look at what is presented on behalf of Arkansans and figure out whether it is something that really makes sense , ” Mrs. Lincoln said Tuesday .
“ I am responsible to the people of Arkansas , and that is where I will take my direction . ”
Typically routine , the procedural approval needed to begin consideration of a bill looms as anything but routine in this instance .
Instead , the vote is fast becoming a test of the leadership abilities of Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader .
It will also decide at least the near - term prospects of President Obama ’s top domestic priority .
And it is providing a case study of the Democrats ’ difficulties in managing high expectations fueled by large Congressional majorities .
Teen Throws Dog Off a Bridge
Featured 11/22/2009
This poor excuse for a Human should get thrown off a bridge
On my list of creative management solutions to dire situations , I offer the rolling whiteboard .
The rolling whiteboard was a curiosity at the start - up .
Not a full size whiteboard , but a door - sized whiteboard on wheels , suitable for rolling into conference rooms and cubicles alike .
I never knew who owned it ; I just grabbed it in a moment of desperation .
It was end game .
The time in the project where you pay for every single shortcut you ’ve taken , for every specification you did n’t write , and for all the warnings from engineers that you ’ve ignored .
All the data is grim .
Bug arrival rates are skyrocketing while bug resolution rates are pathetic because , uh , well , engineers are still finishing features .
Like I said , grim .
The endless stream of bad news was grating on everyone .
We were already three weeks into working weekends with no end in sight .
A normally pleasantly pessimistic engineering staff had gone uncomfortably quiet .
Everyone was staring at “ the date we ca n’t miss ” and thinking , “ I guarantee we ’re missing it ” .
I needed a game .
An Entertaining System
As I said before , geeks are system thinkers .
We see the world as a very complex but knowable flowchart where there are a finite number of inputs , which cause a similarly finite set of outputs .
This impossible flowchart gives us a comfortable illusion of control and an understanding of a chaotic word , but its existence is a handy side effect of a life staring at , deducing , and building systems .
It ’s also why we love games — they ’re just dolled up systems — and the more you understand this fascination with games , the better you ’ll be at managing us .
As with all mental excursions with geeks , there ’s a well - defined process by which we consume a game , and it goes like this :
Discovery
Optimization , Repetition , and Win
Achievement
Discovery — From confusion to control
The initial joy of a game for the geek is discovery .
This is a delicate balance of confusion and progressive disclosure .
A game is initially attractive because it starts chaotic and unknowable , but even in the chaos , there ’s always a hint of the rules … of structure .
What are the specific rules that govern this game ?
And how might I learn them ?
A geek is searching for a single source of joy in this initial state .
It ’s the sense of discovery and progress toward a currently unknown goal .
I want to see the engine that defines this particular universe …
I want to see its edges .
We ’re looking for those edges because as soon as we find this wall , we know this is a containable and knowable place and that is comforting because the game becomes a controllable thing .
There ’s creative flexibility in rule discovery and pacing , and it tends to be a function of the size and the intent of the game .
The beauty of Tetris is that the initial rules are immediately obvious .
But the wonderful curse of a massive online game like World of Warcraft is that while there are rules , they are vast and , as we ’ll see in a moment , they are changeable .
This discovery is the hook where a geek is going to know in just a few minutes whether this particular game suits their particular appetite .
But getting past the initial phases of discovery does n’t mean you ’ve successfully engaged the geek .
The real test is …
Optimization , Repetition , and Win — A paradox and a warning
With the basic rule set discovered and defined , the process of optimization begins .
Ok , I get how it ’s played , how do I win ?
This is the phase where , now equipped with the rules , the geek attempts to use them to their advantage .
There ’s a discoverable structure to the rules .
There ’s a correct order , which , when followed , offers a type of reward .
It ’s the advantage of thinking three blocks ahead in Tetris or holding onto those beguiling hypercubes in Bejeweled .
This is the advanced discovery of the system around the rules that leads to exponential geek joy .
There ’s a paradox and a warning inside of optimization and repetition .
The paradox involves the implications of winning .
Geeks will furiously work to uncover the rules of a game and then use those rules to determine how they might win .
But the actual discovery of how to win is a buzz kill .
The thrill , the adrenalin , comes from the discovery , hunt , and eventual mastery of the unknown , which , confusingly , means if you want to keep a geek engaged in a game you ca n’t let them win , even though that ’s exactly what they think they want .
Think of it like this — does it bug you that there ’s an absolute high score to Pac - Man ?
It bugs me .
To get around this entertainment - killing paradox in subscription - based games like World of Warcraft , game designers freely change rule sets as part of regular updates .
The spin is , “ We ’re improving playability ” which translates into , “ The geeks are close to figuring it out and we ca n’t have that because they ’ll stop paying . ”
This paradox does not apply to all games .
It ’s hard to argue that there is much more to learn about Tetris , but folks continue to play it incessantly , which leads to the warning .
There ’s a socially frightening act inside of optimization that normal humans do n’t get and it ’s the calming inanity of intense repetition .
In a game like World of Warcraft , many of the tasks involve an exceptional amount of repetition .
Repetition like , “ Hey , go kill 1,000 of these guys and come back and I ’ll give you something cool . ”
Yeah , 1,000 .
If each kill take a minute , you ’re talking about sixteen hours of mindless hacking and slashing .
This is not a task that requires skill or thought … and that ’s the point .
If you walked in and looked over my shoulder at troll kill # 653 , you ’d think I ’d dropped into a twitchy - fugue - like mental state and I have .
I am… a machine .
Machines do n’t have a care in the world , and that ’s a fine place to be .
This is the act of mentally removing ourselves from a troubled planet full of messy people , combined with our ability to find pleasure in the act of completing a small , well - defined task .
This is our ability to lose ourselves in repetition and it is task at which we are highly effective .
In the defense of game designers , there are no quests that read “ Go waste sixteen hours of your life doing nothing ” .
They are more elegant with their descriptions ; they splice all sorts of different tasks together to distract you from the dull inanity of large , laborious tasks .
But they know that part of what makes us tick is the micro-pleasure we get from obsessively scratching the task itch in pursuit of the achievement .
As I ’ve never designed and shipped a game , I can confidently and ignorantly say the compelling magic in games comes from the design in optimization and repetition .
This is the portion of the game where we spend the most time and effort and derive the most pleasure .
It is this abstract mental state we long for when we ’re not playing .
But there is one last phase to consider , achievement .
Achievement —
Who cares if you win by yourself ?
Once a geek has learned the game by discovering how to win , they become interested in advanced winning .
They ’re interested in how their win fits into the rest of the world .
They want to compare and measure and answer the social question , “ Is my pile of win bigger than yours ? ”
They believe they ’ve mastered the game , but reputation — achievement — is nothing unless someone else can see and acknowledge it .
Before the Internet , winning was a private thing .
You entered your three - letter name into the local Pac - Man machine and then anonymously stumbled off in search of Donkey Kong .
In an interconnected world , games became social , and once we discovered each other in these virtual worlds , we looked for a means to compare our feats .
We began to understand that achievement was not just becoming great at a game , but being recognized for being great .
Achievement can be as simple as a score , a numeric means of comparison , but the more sophisticated the game , the more complex the achievements .
In World of Warcraft , you ’ll be busily into your seventh hour of mind - numbing troll extinction when you see that night elf run by with … what ’s that ?
A staff … where the hell did she get that staff ?
It ’s sweet .
My world will not be complete until I own that staff .
Now , what was four more hours of troll killing becomes the quest for the staff .
There ’s no well - defined rule that says , “ To win , you need this staff ” .
Sure , it might make those next 200 kills easier , but that is not your entire motivation .
For you , the staff is your own personal badge of mastery , and you do n’t wear a badge for yourself , you wear it for others to see .
Most achievements do have an empirical value , but that ’s not what makes them important .
The point of an achievement is to have someone you know or do n’t know look at your Violet Proto - Drake and say , “ Holy crap , do you know what he had to do to pull that off ? ”
It ’s wondering exactly how far you ’ll go to get the Legendary badge on Stack Overflow .
In a world where we spend a ton of time with people we ’ll never meet , achievements are the currency of respect and identity .
The Rules of the Game
Now that we understand how games float the geek boat , we can tease out rules you can use to build your own business - centric games .
This is will take a creative leap on your part because I do n’t know how your particular situation is grim .
Perhaps your bug count is crap like mine ?
Maybe you ca n’t hire fast enough ?
Maybe you ca n’t measure how screwed you are ?
I do n’t know what game you need , but I know you need to follow the universal rules of games :
The rules need to be clear .
Whatever game you design must stand up to scrutiny .
Test the rules with selected geeks before you roll it out .
Find the holes in your game before you ’re standing in front of the team describing a game that makes no sense .
Ambiguity , contradiction and omission are the death of any good game .
The rules must be inviolable .
Enforce rules with an iron fist .
A rule not followed is twice as bad as a poorly defined one .
A violation of the rules is an affront to a geek .
They react violently to violations of the rules because it ’s an indication that the system is not working .
Rules make a game fair , and when they stop being followed , the geeks stop playing .
The playing of the game must be inclusive , visible , and broadcasted .
Include everyone on the team .
Those not on the team should be aware of the progress and implications .
Only use money as a reward as a last resort .
It ’s a knee - jerk management move to use money as an incentive .
Problem is , money creates drama .
Money makes everyone serious , and while you may be in dire straits as you design your game , you do n’t want the team stressing about who is getting paid ; you want them to stress about the work .
This is not to say that rewards in a motivational game are verboten , but step away from the money and think about achievements .
One of the best trophies I ’ve awarded was a horrifically ugly ceramic blue rhino the size of a pit bull .
The winner proudly displayed the rhino achievement in his office for years .
It ’s not a game .
Just because I ’m using the word game all over this article does n’t mean it ’s trivial , simple , or something not to be taken seriously .
Your geeks will treat the game as a motivational tool as seriously as you choose to treat it in building and rolling it out — because they want to win .
The Whiteboard Game
Everyone was working on a Sunday night as I stared at the blank portable whiteboard in my office .
A weekend of hallway conversations , bug scrubbing , and informal testing confirmed what I already knew : the product was shaky , the bugs we were discovering were alarmingly bad , and there were too many of them .
Ok , a game .
The game will be called Focus and it will concentrate and structure our attention on the worst parts of the product .
I listed the 10 worst bugs I ’d found during the weekend on the board .
Next to each bug , I drew four boxes :
Root cause
Fix identified
Fixed
Tested
I grabbed a handful of dry erase pens and rolled the board into the architect ’s office and said , “ This is all we ’re working on ” .
He stared at the board for 10 minutes and finally nodded , “ Good , but each person needs their own color and you should assign points for each of the boxes .
10 points for root cause and fix identification , 5 for fixes and tests . ”
“ Points for what ? ”
“ Points for points .
We ’re geeks . ”
“ And everyone has their own color ? ”
“ Yeah , so we know who has the most points .
Give me a blue pen , I ’ve already got root cause on bug # 3 . ”
“ Blue ? ”
“ Yeah , I ’m always blue . ”
For the first time in over a decade , New Year ’s Eve revelry , from early - evening snowshoe hikes to midnight fireworks , will take place by the light of a blue moon .
Savor the moment , astronomers say , because the phenomenon in which two full moons occur in the same month wo n’t happen again in December until 2028 .
“ I encourage people to look up , enjoy the sight and think about all the interesting things that have happened ” over the past decade , said Robert Stencel , professor of astronomy at the University of Denver , where public astronomy events are often held at the Chamberlin Observatory .
“ And be happy that we ’re still here to observe it . ”
Thursday night ’s blue moon also coincides with a lunar eclipse — although it wo n’t be visible in the United States — that astrologers say carries powerful meaning .
“ Full moons , and especially eclipses , call us to release what is no longer serving our growth , ” said Cynthia Zehn , a Western Slope astrologer , in her weekly blog .
Scientists , however , do n’t see these conjunctions as particularly momentous .
“ But it ’s kind of nice that it shows up at the end of the week at the end of the month at the end of the year of the decade , ” Stencel said .
Andrea Schweitzer , project manager for the International Year of Astronomy , observes that the New Year ’s Eve full moon falls at the end of the International Year of Astronomy , declared by the United Nations to celebrate the 400 years since Galileo gazed at the sky through the first telescope .
“ It ’s a wonderful way to wrap up what has been a beautiful year for astronomy , ” said the Fort Collins - based scientist .
“ Everyone enjoys looking at a full moon .
They ’re beautiful , and they also rise as the sun sets . ”
There is , of course , endless lore about full moons that most emergency rooms and police departments know by heart .
“ There ’s the myth out there that crazy things happen under full moons , ” said Mark Beckner , police chief of Boulder .
“ I do n’t know if it ’s true , but there are times when things have gotten kind of crazy . ”
As for this “ once in a blue moon ” New Year ’s Eve , Beckner said that the year - turning holiday “ always has the potential to be busy because people are out at parties drinking more than normal . ”
And whether people imbibe too many Blue Moon cocktails — curacao , gin and a twist of lemon — or quaff too much Blue Moon Grand Cru , brewed for the occasion by Denver ’s Blue Moon Brewery , Beckner suggests it ’s not the moon that is to blame for the bad behavior that may follow .
“ I do n’t know that it will be due to the full moon , ” he said .
“ I ’ve also worked some nights when it ’s slow on a full moon . ”

Advanced Micro
Devices saw its stock climb 26 % yesterday on news that the computer chip maker had agreed to settle its legal disputes with rival Intel .
Whether consumers should be as excited about the deal as AMD shareholders is another matter .
The settlement , which calls for Intel to pay AMD $ 1.25 billion , will resolve a four - year - old antitrust case filed by AMD in a Delaware federal court .
AMD accused Intel of using illegal tactics to bully computer manufacturers like IBM and Dell into using Intel microprocessors .

BBC News , Hyderabad
The campaign for a separate state has been long - running and at times violent
From tension and fear to excitement and celebration and then to confusion and uncertainty , the people of Telangana region have seen many shades of emotions during the last few hours .
Ever since the Indian government made its dramatic announcement to accept their 50 - year - old demand to make Telangana a state , the people of Hyderabad and the other nine districts of the region have endured a roller - coaster ride .
Thousands of supporters of Telangana came out on the streets late on Wednesday night to see history being made as the word spread like wildfire that the government had met their long - standing demands .
Men , women and the young and old came out of their homes in the dead of the night and gathered at the Nizam 's Institute of Medical Sciences where the leader of the regional Telangana Rashtra Samiti party , K Chandrasekara Rao was under observation by doctors .
Emotional After 11 days of a " fast unto death " to press the demand for Telangana state , Mr Rao had emerged as a hero for the local masses .
The 55 - year - old MP lost almost half of his original weight and has been suffering from many ailments and complications .
The news that his demands had finally been accepted came just as doctors were pressurising him to break the fast because his life was in grave danger .
But gritty Mr Rao steadfastly refused .
It was to see this man that people had thronged around the hospital where he was being treated .
Emotional youngsters armed with drums , crackers and banners descended on the building shouting slogans in honour of " KCR " - the man now known as the " Tiger of Telangana " .
" No other leader endangered his life for the poor people of Telangana like KCR has done and achieved his goal , " said an emotional youngster , Tayyab , who is unemployed .
" I am sure after Telangana is formed , nobody will be unemployed . "
Lawyer Vivekananda Reddy , who travelled from another city to be present for the historic occasion said that the " formation of a new state will mark the end of 50 years of injustice " .
" Our farmers will get their due share in water and our boys will get decent education and good jobs , " he said .
Celebrations
Such sentiments seemed to be widespread , including in the intensive care unit where Mr Rao was lying in the bed .
A young woman became emotional and started crying on seeing him in such a bad condition .

Many others made a beeline to fall at his feet barely a few minutes after he had broken his fast to sip a few drops of lime juice offered by his guru and ideologue Prof Jaishankar .
Outside , the crowds were swelling , and dancing and singing youths boarded passing vehicles to display the pink banners of the Telangana regional party .
" I am an IT software professional and I am sure he will get me a job soon , " said another youngster as I struggled to find a way through the throng .
Everywhere people deprived of employment , housing and other facilities gathered in celebration and in the expectation that they will witness an economic miracle in their lives .
But will their new hero be able to help them ?
" That will be the biggest challenge , " said Prof Kodanda Ram of Osmania University .
A few hours later I found myself in the same university , where activists of the right wing Hindu students ' organisation , the ABVP , were holding a programme to celebrate what they called a victory .
" Hyderabad Hamara ! " ( This Hyderabad is ours ! ) they sang amid bursting crackers .
A short while later a bigger rally of students belonging to the leftist organisations entered the same campus chanting revolutionary songs and slogans .
But they were not celebrating the victory .
" We are remembering the martyrs who laid down their lives for this day , " one said .
But on one thing both the right and the left are unanimous .
They agree that if anything can change the lives of people of this region , it will be the creation of Telangana state - giving people a distinct cultural , geographic and economic region .
But as I reach home , bad news awaits .
As many as 93 Andhra Pradesh lawmakers have tendered their resignations to prevent the formation of Telangana state - they say that they do n't want it to secede .
The fight may not have ended for Telangana and its people .

Delegation is a quite common practice in Ruby projects , if you consider proxies , mixins and composition as the ingredient of the Delegation Pattern .
The Delegation Design Pattern is a technique where an object exposes certain behavior but it actually delegates responsibility for implementing that behavior to an associated object .
A really common technique is to use method_missing to intercepts the calls to undefined method , then forward the call to the right handler .
However , this is n't always a good idea .
There are better ways to implement the delegation pattern in Ruby .
The Ruby standard library contains a Delegate module that aims to provide support for the Delegation pattern .
Sadly , I found it to be way more complex than the traditional approach and I never really used it .
ActiveSupport Delegate module
If your project includes ActiveSupport , and every Rails project does , you have a more clean and easy way to implement the delegation pattern : the Module # delegate extension .
It provides a delegate module you can use in your class or in your modules to delegate a specific method to an associate object .
For instance , consider a standard Post model which belongs to a User .
class
Post belongs_to :user end class
User has_many : posts end
You might want a call to post.name to return the name of the user associated to the given post .
Normally , you would create a new name method as follows
class
Post belongs_to : user def name # let 's use try to bypass nil - check user .
try ( : name ) end end
The same code expressed using the delegate method .
class
Post belongs_to : user delegate : name , : to => : user , : allow_nil => true end
The delegate method can be used in any context , it 's not limited to ActiveRecord models .
For example , your custom queue wrapper can delegate to the internal queue implementation some specific methods .
class QueueManager attr_accessor : queue # Delegates some methods to the internal queue delegate : size , : clear , : to => : queue def initialize self .
queue = [ ] end end m = QueueManager .
new m . size # => 0 m . clear # => [ ]
Methods can be delegated to instance variables , class variables , or constants by providing them as a symbol .
At least one method and the : to option are required .
Options
The delegate method understand some additional options , useful to customize the behavior .
This is my favorite option .
The : prefix can be set to true to prefix the delegate method with the name of the object being delegated to .
You can also provide a custom prefix .
class
Post belongs_to : user delegate : name , : to => : user , : prefix => true # post.user_name delegate : name , : to => :user , : prefix => " author " # post.author_name end
The : allow_nil option allows the class to delegate the method to an object that might be nil .
In this case , a call to the delegated method will return nil .
The default behavior is to raise a NoMethodError .
class
Post belongs_to : user delegate : name , : to => : user , : prefix => true end Post .
new .
user_name # raise NoMethodError class
Post belongs_to : user delegate : name , : to => : user , : prefix => true , : allow_nil => true end Post .
new .
user_name # => nil
The : to it a non-option , because it 's mandatory .

Not long ago I made one of my periodic forays to Whole Foods , the all - natural - groceries conglomerate .
My assignment was to buy a Christmas ham from a pig that had not suffered unduly , and that was relatively free of chemicals and antibiotics .
I was somewhere between the Amy 's organic soups and the own - label cans of vegetables when I came upon an unexpected sight : bottles of Heinz regular ketchup that , like much of the industrial food that comprises the American diet , is sweetened with high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) .
As you may know , HFCS is among the laboratory - created synthetic foods targeted for elimination by activists , most notably the journalist Michael Pollan in his influential book The Omnivore 's Dilemma .
Though scientific opinion differs on whether HFCS is any worse for you than regular sugar , there 's little doubt that its cheap ubiquity – a consequence of misguided government farming subsidies – has contributed significantly to our epidemics of obesity and type - two diabetes .
Thus I considered it a breach of faith that Whole Foods would carry such a product .
Shopping there means you 're going to pay more and drive farther than if you simply stocked up at the nearest supermarket .
In return , it does n't seem too much to ask that you be spared from having to worry about ingredients such as HFCS .
So it was with a perverse sense of anticipation that I started reading Nick Paumgarten 's 9,100 - word profile of Whole Foods founder and chief executive John Mackey in the current issue of the New Yorker .
As Paumgarten observes , Mackey has stepped in it several times in recent years , engaging in embarrassing ( and legally dubious ) internet sock puppetry with regard to his acquisition of Wild Oats , a rival chain , and writing a commentary for the Wall Street Journal in opposition to government healthcare reform .
The latter enraged his largely liberal customer base , engendering brief calls for a boycott .
What makes the New Yorker article valuable , though , is the way Paumgarten captures Mackey 's " crazy uncle " and " right - wing hippie " personae and places them in the context of his radical libertarianism .
In the course of talking ( and talking , and talking ) , Mackey reveals an important contradiction that illustrates why Whole Foods simply is n't as good as it should be .
On the one hand , Mackey , now a vegan , is absolutely committed to healthy food .
On the other , his naive belief in individual responsibility informs not just his contempt for government but , in a sense , for his own company as well .
Consider , for instance , Mackey 's much - criticized statement that " We sell a bunch of junk . "
In fact , Whole Foods sells meat , which Mackey eschews , as well as nutritionally empty snacks .
This is not necessarily a bad thing .
Meat , candy and potato chips have been with us for a long time , and , in their unadulterated , pre-industrial incarnations , were considerably less toxic than they are today .
But Mackey 's libertarianism means that the consumer must always beware , even at Whole Foods .
As Paumgarten writes of Mackey :
His belief in the power of the individual is such that blame falls on individuals , too .
In his view , it tends to be the fault of the unhealthy or fat person that he or she is unhealthy or fat .
People just need to eat better ....
It matters less to him that our food system , for a dozen reasons , ... has been rigged to deliver unhealthy food at artificially low cost to a misguided public .
People have the power and the means to choose rice and beans over Big Macs , and when they fail to do so they bring ruin on themselves , and on everyone else .
The trouble with this type of thinking is that , at its end point , it 's our own fault if we buy ketchup loaded with high - fructose corn syrup – even if we got it at Whole Foods .
After all , there was a shelf full of Heinz organic ketchup next to the regular variety .
If you choose the cheap stuff , what concern is it of Mackey's ?
Whole Foods is a store that sells " a bunch of junk " , not a shrine .
Except that Mackey misconceives an important part of his business .
At a time when even Walmart is carrying organic foods , the niche Whole Foods ought to fill is that of the trusted guide .
If I have to walk the aisles of Whole Foods with the same label - reading skepticism that I bring to supermarket shopping , well , I might as well go to the local supermarket .
It carries more natural and organic foods than it used to , it 's closer to our house and it's a lot cheaper .
Besides , as Paumgarten writes , Mackey 's libertarianism ignores larger social and cultural forces .
My wife and I would love to do better than Whole Foods – to buy most of our food from local farmers , and to leave the industrial - food system altogether .
We 've tried .
But unless we are willing and able to devote a lot more time and money to the enterprise , the best we can manage is to buy produce from farmers markets during the growing season and milk from a nearby dairy .
For us , a place like Whole Foods should be an important way station between industrial food and something better .
Mackey seems to understand that , but his blind exaltation of the individual misses some pretty important caveats .
Individuals live in a social setting , turning over some tasks so that they can specialise in others .
I do n't want to perform my own surgery or maintain my own roads .
And I do n't want to come home from the grocery store with unhealthy food only to be told it 's my own damn fault .
Especially if I bought it at Whole Foods .
Carsten Koernig told Reuters the late surge would take the forecast past last month ’s increase to 2.5 GW from 2 GW .
“ We ’re all surprised by how strongly demand is picking up now , ” the BSW managing director said , adding the fourth quarter was especially robust due to pent - up demand from the easing of the financial crisis and fear of looming changes in German laws .
Lower prices have also attracted investors , he said .
“ It looks like we ’ll end up with 2.5 to 3 GW for 2009 , ” he added .
“ It ’s still too early to say if it will be closer to 3 or 2.5 .
It ’ll be well over 2.5 .
But it wo n’t be over 3 GW simply because there is n’t enough capacity .
We ’re already at the limit .
Germany , the world ’s leader in photovoltaic which turns sunlight into electricity , had 5.3 GW installed at the end of 2008 , including a previous record 1.6 GW added in 2008 .
That was about a third of the world ’s total of 15 GW .
Three GW installed this year would produce as much power as three large coal - burning plants or three nuclear power plants .
Spain installed a record 2.5 GW last year .
But demand dropped sharply in Spain due to a cap on state support that also caused prices worldwide to fall due to overcapacity .
The slumping prices have hurt some companies .
Two of the two biggest -- Q - Cells and Conergy -- both posted third quarter losses but aim to return to profit in 2010 .
FALLING PRICES LIFTS DEMAND
Koernig said many companies in Germany have reached capacity limits and that demand for equipment such as inverters has far outstripped supply .
He said he expected the strong demand to continue into 2010 .
German group SMA Solar Technology , which makes inverters , last week raised its 2009 guidance for the second time .
Koernig said falling prices for PV systems that had exceeded the decline in state - mandated feed - in tariffs was a key reason for the strong growth in 2009 after the economic crisis slowed the sector ’s growth in the first half .
He said fears that Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s newly elected government might accelerate the scheduled cuts to feed - in tariffs contributed to the end of the year rush , even though it now appears unlikely there will be major changes in the law .
“ Our member companies report lower prices are attracting investors , ” Koernig said .
“ There ’s also some who have long thought about investing in it but are pulling those plans forward now due to fears the laws would be changed . ”
Koernig said Germany ’s feed - in tariffs would decline , as already scheduled , by about 10 percent in 2010 .
“ We ’re now confident the government does not want to endanger the sector and any adjustments to the law will be minor , ” Koernig said .
“ The government sent us an important signal that they ’re still counting on renewable energy . ”
The long ordeal of Fouad al - Rabiah , an innocent man and a 50 - year old father of four , who had been in US custody for almost exactly eight years , finally came to an end on Wednesday , when he was flown back to his homeland of Kuwait from Guantánamo , where he had spent the majority of those lost years , after several brutal months in US custody in Afghanistan .
Until the moment of his release , everything about his treatment at the hands of the US government was shameful .
12 weeks ago , when District Court Judge Colleen Kollar - Kotelly granted his habeas corpus petition , and ordered his release , she revealed the most extraordinary — and extraordinarily depressing — story .
This shone the most unflinching light on Guantánamo as a place where men who were rounded up for bounty payments by the US military ’s allies in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and were never adequately screened on capture , were then sent to Guantánamo .
Once there , in the absence of any information to back up the administration ’s claims that they were “ the worst of the worst , ” they became the victims of false allegations made by other prisoners ( who were either coerced to do so , or were bribed with the promise of improved living conditions ) , and were then tortured and abused to make false confessions .
During the prisoners ’ habeas corpus petitions over the last 14 months , numerous examples of dubious allegations made by unreliable witnesses have been exposed by the judges , as well as other examples of cases that “ defie[d ] common sense ” or exposed the use of torture , but until al - Rabiah ’s case was examined , the existence of a clear chain of torture and threats inflicted to produce false confessions at Guantánamo had never been revealed with such alarming clarity .
Al - Rabiah ’s story began when he traveled to Afghanistan in 2001 to provide humanitarian aid , but was caught up in the chaos following the US - led invasion , and ended up in the hands of the US military .
What followed was truly shameful .
In Guantánamo , unreliable witnesses — whose unreliability was acknowledged by the authorities — claimed that he had met Osama bin Laden and had provided him with a suitcase of money , and also claimed that he had played a supporting role to al - Qaeda in the battle of Tora Bora , the showdown between al - Qaeda and US - supported Afghan forces in December 2001 , when bin Laden escaped into Pakistan .
Under torture , which included , but was not limited to prolonged sleep deprivation — being moved from cell to cell every few hours over a period lasting for several weeks at least , in a program that was euphemistically known as the “ frequent flier program ” — al - Rabiah finally broke down , inventing a story to please his captors , and dutifully repeating it in 2004 during his Combatant Status Review Tribunal , a military review board designed to establish that he had been correctly designated as an “ enemy combatant , ” who could continue to be held without charge or trial .
Although the authorities knew that the witnesses were unreliable , and interrogators and other personnel cast serious doubts on al - Rabiah ’s story , he was , nevertheless , put forward for a trial by Military Commission at Guantánamo in November 2008 , based on the credible - sounding story he had parroted at his tribunal , and it was only when Judge Kollar - Kotelly was able to review his case that the whole sordid story emerged .
As she noted in her ruling , in one of several passages loaded with controlled disdain for the Bush administration ( and for the Obama administration for pursuing the case ) :
Not only did al - Rabiah ’s interrogators repeatedly conclude that [ his ] confessions were not believable — which al - Rabiah ’s counsel attributes to abuse and coercion , some of which is supported by the record — but it is also undisputed that al - Rabiah confessed to information that his interrogators obtained from either alleged eyewitnesses who are not credible and as to whom the Government has now largely withdrawn any reliance , or from sources that never even existed …
If there exists a basis for al - Rabiah ’s indefinite detention , it most certainly has not been presented to this Court .
What makes this story even more shocking is that al - Rabiah ’s innocence was established in the summer of 2002 , when a CIA analyst , and an Arabic expert , interviewed him as part of a fact - finding mission to Guantánamo which revealed that a large number of the men held “ had no connection to terrorism whatsoever . ”
As Jane Mayer described his findings about al - Rabiah in her book , The Dark Side :
One man was a rich Kuwaiti businessman who took a trip to a different part of the world every year to do charity work .
In 2001 , the country he chose was Afghanistan .
“ He was n’t a jihadi , but I told him he should have been arrested for stupidity , ” the CIA officer recalled .
The man was furious with the United States for rounding him up .
He mentioned that every year up until then , he had bought himself a new Cadillac , but when he was released , he said , he would never buy another American car .
He was switching to Mercedes .
What followed was even more disturbing , and demonstrates , succinctly , how the “ enemy combatant ” program developed by the Bush administration was fueled by the most damaging arrogance .
As Mayer explained , when John Bellinger , the Legal Advisor to the National Security Council , and General John Gordon , the NSC ’s senior terrorism expert , learned of the agent ’s report and tried to reveal the information to President Bush , to ask him to urgently review the cases of the men held at Guantánamo , a meeting with Alberto Gonzales , who was then the White House counsel , was hijacked by David Addington , Vice President Dick Cheney ’s legal counsel , who dismissed their concerns by declaring , imperiously , “ No , there will be no review .
The President has determined that they are ALL enemy combatants .
We are not going to revisit it ! ”
As Fouad al - Rabiah prepares to greet his family for the first time in over eight years , having spent the last 12 weeks detained at Guantánamo for no reason whatsoever ( beyond the two weeks ’ notice demanded by Congress before any prisoner is released ) , David Cynamon , one of his attorneys , provided me by email with the following statement on behalf of the legal team that worked so hard to secure his release :
We are pleased that the US Government has at long last complied with the court order to return Mr. al - Rabiah to Kuwait .
The court ’s opinion in his case is proof that his release is long overdue .
Mr. al - Rabiah is an innocent man .
His complete innocence is clearly demonstrated in the trial court ’s decision , which the US Government did not attempt to appeal .
In fact , at the very outset of Mr. al - Rabiah ’s confinement , the United States ’ own expert intelligence analyst concluded Mr. al - Rabiah was an innocent man in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Nonetheless , this innocent citizen of one of the United States ’ best allies was wrongfully imprisoned at Guantánamo Bay for almost eight years , during which he was tortured , abused , and coerced into making false confessions .
We call upon President Obama to provide both a formal apology on behalf of the United States and appropriate compensation for Mr. al - Rabiah ’s ordeal .
Mr. al- Rabiah can never reclaim the eight years he lost at Guantánamo Bay — and the United States must not simply turn and forget .

Bret Michaels Praises Miley Cyrus Miley Cyrus
Poison frontman Bret Michaels has lavished praise on Miley Cyrus following their recent collaboration , insisting the teenager is one of the few young stars who can ‘ actually play and sing . ’
The pair teamed up to record a revamp of the rock band 's 1980s anthem Every Rose Has Its Thorn , and Cyrus recently admitted she 's very proud of the ‘ rad ’ duet .
And Michaels loved working with the 17 - year - old Hannah Montana star - because she is a true talent .
He tells a news site , " It was really , really simple .
I think her first concert was Poison .
She saw us at Nashville at the arena .
It was her introduction into rock and roll .
SANTA ANA – A federal judge today denied awarding $ 391,150 in attorneys ’ fees and court - related costs to the defense team for high school teacher James Corbett , sued by a student two years ago for his anti-Christian classroom rhetoric .
U.S. District Court Judge James Selna said in an eight - page ruling that although the Capistrano Unified School District was not liable for Corbett ’s actions , Capistrano was not eligible to recover any attorneys ’ fees because student Chad Farnan ’s lawsuit against the school district was not simply “ a baseless , vexatious claim , ” as Corbett ’s attorneys had argued .
“ C.F. ( Chad Farnan ) set out to prove a constitutional violation , and he did , ” Selna said in his ruling .
“ The vagaries of the law in this area , from which Corbett benefitted , do not undermine the substantive validity of C.F. ’s establishment clause claim , nor do they render his position frivolous . ”
( Click here to read the judge ’s ruling . )
Today ’s ruling affirms a tentative decision by Selna more than a month ago against awarding attorneys ’ fees to Corbett ’s attorneys , and overturns an October decision by a federal court clerk to award $ 12,631 in court - related fees .
It also marks the end of the case at the trial court level , although both sides already have appealed Selna ’s ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals .
“ We agree with the judge ’s tentative ( ruling ) and are happy with this ruling , as we do not believe we should be paying costs for either the defendant , school district or the union interveners , ” said Farnan ’s attorney , Jennifer Monk .
“ In light of the fact that Dr. Corbett was found to have violated the constitution , the cost of attorneys ’ fees should not be awarded to the defense . ”
Corbett , an Advanced Placement European history teacher at Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo , was found to have violated the First Amendment ’s establishment clause when he referred to Creationism as “ religious , superstitious nonsense ” during a fall 2007 classroom lecture .
While Selna sided with Farnan in the May 2009 ruling , he found Capistrano not liable at the same time and , four months later , found Corbett not financially liable for his actions under a qualified immunity defense .
It was qualified immunity that barred Farnan from seeking attorneys ’ fees or court costs from Corbett , although Corbett ’s attorneys attempted to get costs from Farnan .
“ In the end , we did n’t get involved in this case to get attorneys ’ fees or court costs , ” said Michael Hersh , an attorney for the California Teachers Association union and a member of Corbett ’s defense team .
Corbett ’s defense team comprises attorneys for Capistrano Unified and the teachers union .
Capistrano Unified had asked for $ 154,781.50 in attorneys ’ fees and $ 8,483 in court costs , and the union had asked for $ 223,737.50 in attorneys ’ fees and $ 4,148 in court costs – for a total of $ 391,150 .
To determine whether attorneys ’ fees should be awarded , the judge applied a legal test that essentially evaluated whether Farnan ’s claim was “ unreasonable , frivolous , meritless or vexatious . ”
“ The court finds it somewhat disturbing that the school defendants label C.F. ’s position frivolous given that it was only application of the doctrine of qualified immunity that spared Corbett from liability , ” Selna said in his ruling .
“ The premise of that defense – which the court accepted – was that there was no clearly established constitutional right on the facts of this case . ”
A hearing to discuss the awarding of costs had been scheduled for today , but was canceled at the last minute after both parties agreed to accept the judge ’s tentative ruling , which was released last week .
Today ’s decision combined two issues that previously had been separate .
The judge originally planned to discuss the awarding of attorneys ’ fees at a hearing last month , but canceled it at the last minute and rescheduled it for today .
The awarding of court costs originated with a federal court clerk , Milli Borgarding , the deputy in charge of the Santa Ana division of the U.S. District Court clerk ’s office , who awarded the court fees to Corbett ’s defense team as part of what is typically a routine procedural matter .
But Farnan immediately appealed to the judge .
In the 9th Circuit , Corbett will seek to be exonerated ; Farnan is seeking a stronger , broader judgment against Corbett .
“ We feel strongly about the case and are looking forward to presenting our arguments to the 9th Circuit and getting a broader ruling than we were able to get in district court , ” Monk said .
The house will be monitored over a year to assess its performance
A house built from straw - bales and panels of hemp has passed an industry standard fire safety test which exposed it to temperatures above 1,000C .
BaleHaus@Bath is part of a new research project at the University of Bath into how renewable building materials can be used for homes of the future .
The house is made from prefabricated cells of timber filled with straw or hemp , rendered with a lime - based coat .
TV presenter Kevin McCloud will officially open the straw house later .
During the fire resistance test for non-loadbearing elements , the panel had to withstand heat for more than 30 minutes .
Eco-friendly
After more than two hours it had still not failed .
A panel had previously been put through structural tests for loadbearing elements and had passed .
Researchers Dr Katharine Beadle and Christopher Gross , from the University 's Building Research Establishment Centre in Innovative Construction Materials , will be monitoring the house for a year .
They will be checking its insulating properties , humidity levels , air tightness and sound insulation qualities to assess the performance of straw and hemp as building materials .
The technology was used last year by McCloud to build an eco-friendly house in six days for the Grand Designs Live exhibition .
" I expect the results will show people that we can minimise the use of highly processed materials in building and genuinely make use of such sustainable building materials , " he said .
" It 's vital that we encourage people to recycle , insulate and minimise the use of fossil fuels to keep our buildings warm . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday set a Christmas
Eve vote on final congressional approval of a bill to provide a two - month increase in the federal debt limit .

The measure , passed last week by the House of Representatives , would increase the debt limit , now at $ 12.1 trillion , by $ 290 billion .
Senate Democrats may approve the measure largely by themselves because most , if not all , Republicans are expected to vote against it , Republican aides said .
Democrats control the Senate , 60 - 40 .
Republicans have objected to raising the debt limit , accusing Democrats of reckless spending .
Democrats counter by noting that the debt exploded during the administration of Republican President George W. Bush , which ended in January .
Democratic President Barack Obama is expected to promptly sign the debt - limit measure into law after Senate approval .
The Treasury Department has warned that it would likely reach the current debt limit by December 31 , potentially putting the United States at risk of default .
U.S. lawmakers want to avoid default but have refused to provide a long - term increase amid mounting concern about the debt limit .
Democratic leaders had hoped to raise the limit by at least $ 1.8 trillion , enough to ensure they would not have to revisit the issue before the November 2010 congressional elections .
But they were unable to agree on measures that lawmakers had hoped to attach to the legislation to control the debt .
The two - month hike provides more time to reach a deal .
The government posted a record $ 1.4 trillion deficit in the fiscal year ended September 30 and is on track this year to spend at least $ 1 trillion more than it collects .
The debt has more than doubled since 2001 , due to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , tax cuts and the worst recession since the 1930s , one that has caused tax revenues to plunge and spending on federal safety - net programs to rise .
Senate leaders set the debt - limit vote for Thursday , Christmas Eve , just before lawmakers go home for the holidays .
The vote is to occur after anticipated Senate passage of a bill to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system , a measure that has tied up the chamber for weeks , delaying departure .
So , we finally got some great news today !

Angel Falls is the world ’s highest waterfall at 979 meters ( 3,212 feet ) .
Because the water falls so far it becomes a fine mist which can be felt a mile away before it reaches the ground below .
The falls spill from a cliff near the summit of Mount Auyantepui into the Kerep River ( also called the Rio Gauya ) .
Named after the American aviator Jimmie Angel , Angel Falls is located in the state of Bolívar in Venezuela and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site .
The falls is becoming a popular tourist destination , but it is still difficult to visit .
To get to the base of the falls one must fly to Canaima camp and embark on a river trip from there .
River trips can be taken only from June to December , as the river to too low in the dryer months .
Angel Falls was the inspiration for Paradise Falls in the Disney movie Up .
Alternatively , one can book an aerial flyby of the falls , but a view of the falls is not guaranteed as they are usually surrounded by clouds .

In September , Dan Goldstein received a letter from New York State informing him and his wife that the government was about to seize their Brooklyn apartment " In furtherance of the Atlantic Yards Arena and Redevelopment Project . "
The building would be razed as part of a 22 - acre , $ 4.9 billion sports - complex project .
New ...
There are restrictions on the publication of criminals ' details Police forces that " name and shame " criminals must remove the details from websites after a month , new rules say .
Criminals ' details such as name , age , where they are from and their offence , should be published routinely on police websites , the Ministry of Justice said .
But data protection and human rights laws mean there are restrictions on what is published , for how long and whether suspects ' photos are published .
The new rules will not apply to media websites ' reporting of court cases .
The rules state there should be a " presumption " in favour of making information from crown and magistrates ' courts public .
' Adverse effect '
Under the rules , officers will also need a specific reason to publish photographs .
The guidance says police and town halls should take into account the impact on the offenders ' family of such material and should also consider whether it is " proportionate " to make the verdicts and sentences public .
It also states they should examine whether publishing personal details could have an " unjustifiably adverse effect " on the criminal .
It is vital people know that criminals will not escape the consequences of their crimes
Jack Straw , Justice Secretary Concerns over the long - term " adverse consequences " for criminals may mean that information is published only on websites linked to the area where the crime was committed .
Websites can also consider saying just that " someone " has been convicted of a crime without revealing the specific details of who , if that is enough to reassure the public .
And the guidance says forces can hand out leaflets or make information available at public meetings instead of putting it on the internet .
" Online publicity needs to be justified , and will not usually be appropriate for minor offences / sentences or for first time offenders , " the document states .
Data protection
However , these rules do not apply to media outlets , such as newspaper websites .
A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said : " Information about convictions and sentences handed down to criminals is already a matter of public record and widely reported by the media .
" There should be a presumption in favour of publicising these outcomes .
Doing so will not contravene the Data Protection Act or breach Human Rights in the vast majority of cases . "
Barrister Timothy Pitt - Payne said the rules distinguished between the police and media outlets for a number of reasons .
He said the guidance was meant to deal with concerns there could be breaches of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the right to respect for private life , under article eight of the European Convention on Human Rights , by authorities when they released information .
' News spreads ' Mr Pitt - Payne said : " The Ministry of Justice has a role in providing guidance to the criminal justice services , whereas it would expect media organisations to take their own legal advice " .
" It is n't their job to give legal advice to the media .
In any event different legal considerations would apply in relation to publication by the media and by police or local authorities , " he said .
Earlier , Justice Secretary Jack Straw explained the thinking behind the guidelines .
He said : " Individual crimes often get a lot of media coverage and news can spread across communities quickly that a crime has been committed .
" However , the news that someone has been caught , prosecuted , convicted and sentenced does not travel as far .
" This guidance explains , once and for all , that authorities can publish the details of crimes and the punishments criminals have received , and that the government actively encourages them to do so .
" It is vital people know that criminals will not escape the consequences of their crimes . "

GOMA , Democratic Republic of Congo —
The tropical rain turns Goma ’s lava - blackened streets to slurry as thick grey storm clouds thunder overhead .
For hours the city is on pause as its hawkers and traders , soldiers and civilians shelter from the relentless downpour .
Then the rain stops and the streets burst to life again .
A year ago this chaotic lakeside city lived in fear .
It was on the brink of being overrun by a rebel army made up of ethnic Tutsi fighters supported with arms , money and volunteers from neighboring Rwanda .
Goma is no longer under siege but the surrounding countryside of the eastern Congo remains embattled .
It is a complicated war that includes rebel groups , warlords , ethnic enmities and United Nations forces .
Currently the Congo army and the United Nations are fighting together against the rebels of the FDLR .
FDLR rebels in eastern Congo .
( Jan- Joseph Stok / GlobalPost )
The background to these military offensives is the Rwandan genocide of 1994 .
The territory being fought over contains valuable mines from which all sides are getting the money to fund the war .
Those suffering the most are the people of eastern Congo .
The current war started early this year after the arrest of dissident Congolese general Laurent Nkunda .
At the height of his power Nkunda — tall and slim , bespectacled and clutching a silver - topped cane — was the world ’s most recognizable warlord .
But in January an unexpected detente between the presidents of Rwanda and Congo , Paul Kagame and Joseph Kabila , led to Nkunda ’s arrest in Rwanda and subsequent house arrest in the Rwandan capital Kigali .
In return for taking Nkunda out of play , Kagame was given the opportunity send troops into eastern Congo and hunt down the FDLR , a rebel group made up of ethnic Hutu fighters who he blames for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda that killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 100 days of low - tech slaughter .
The current fighting in eastern Congo can be traced back to Rwanda ’s 1996 invasion of its larger neighbour in a bid to revenge itself on these " genocidaires . "
The International Rescue Committee ( IRC ) , an American aid organization , blames the fighting since then for the
deaths of more than 5 million people in the region , mostly from disease and malnutrition .
A five - week joint Rwandan - Congolese operation began in January and was followed by another U.N. - backed Congolese operation that started in March .
The aim of both " Umoja Wetu " and " Kimia II " was to disarm the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda ( known by its French acronym , FDLR ) .
But after months of jungle skirmishes and village battles that have displaced a fifth of the population , left hundreds of civilians dead and thousands of women raped , the FDLR is no closer to being defeated .
The reasons why are explained in a report compiled by a panel of U.N. investigators and that has been obtained by GlobalPost .
According to the report a series of businessmen in Burundi , Tanzania and Uganda are trading with the FDLR to transport valuable minerals out of their territory and bring deadly weapons in .
The tin ore , gold , diamonds and coltan ( used in mobile phones ) illegally dug from the earth of eastern Congo are exported and end up in western consumer electronic goods .
The report also detailed how some Congolese army officers provide the rebels with arms even as their own troops are fighting to defeat them .
The 17,000 - strong U.N. peacekeeping mission , MONUC , comes in for criticism for backing the Congolese army in the latest offensive against the rebels .
The campaign started in March and is known as Kimia II .
The U.N. report talks of “ the possible contradiction ” between the U.N. ’s mandate to protect civilians and its support of the Congolese army which it says “ continues to commit abuses against the civilian population , and conducts military operations in disregard of protection of civilians and for humanitarian law . ”
New York - based Human Rights
Watch has catalogued a litany of rapes , murders and forced displacements committed this year by Congo ’s national army as well as various rebel groups .
The pressure is mounting against the FDLR .
Last month its top leaders were arrested in Germany and charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in eastern Congo .
Ignace Murwanashyaka and Straton Musoni await trial in a German court but their arrest alone is a blow to the FDLR as one recently defected fighter admitted to during a recent interview at a repatriation camp in Goma .
“ We feel very , very bad because of the arrests .
Ignace was our leader , ” Innocent Rakundo told GlobalPost .
The 35 - year old FDLR corporal said he deserted the rebel group soon after the arrests , fed up with being hunted through the forests and shot at .
He now hopes to return to Rwanda for the first time since fleeing Kagame ’s forces in the aftermath of the genocide .
It is not just the rank - and - file who acknowledge the impact of the recent arrests .
In a telephone conversation , Laforge Fils , the group ’s spokesman in North Kivu , said : “ The arrests are unjust and not justified . ”
“ It shows that the international community does n’t want to respond to the wishes of the people of the Great Lakes region , ” he said with a wounded tone in his voice .
“ The problem of insecurity in this region is to be found inside Rwanda but instead of solving the problem at its source they want to solve it superficially . ”
He repeated calls for dialogue with Kagame , something the Rwandan leader has ruled out .
U.N. officials in charge of trying to persuade FDLR fighters such as Rakundo to lay down their weapons concede that for all their successes — over 100 rebels deserted last month — the group continues to recruit both volunteers and conscripts meaning its estimated strength is thought to have remained stable at perhaps 6,000 to 8,000 .
Although its movement is constrained it still has strongholds dotted about the provinces that border Lake Kivu .
One is just a few miles outside the city of Goma on the slopes of the Nyiragongo volcano whose lava flows cut through the city in 2002 .
Intrepid tourists used to make the arduous trek up to the crater ’s edge to stare transfixed into the lava lake below .
Last year Nkunda ’s armed men prowled this wild landscape , now it is the FDLR once again .
The groups may change but for the Congolese people the insecurity remains the same .

HELSINKI ( Reuters ) -
The world ’s top cell phone maker Nokia Oyj on Thursday charged Apple with infringing Nokia patents in its iPhone .

Nokia dominates the global handset market but it has lost some ground to new smartphone entrants like Apple which entered the market with its iPhone in mid-2007 .
The 10 patents in the lawsuit , filed in the U.S. state of Delaware , relate to technologies fundamental for devices using GSM , UMTS and / or local area network ( LAN ) standards , Nokia said .
“ Nokia ’s enormous patent portfolio does n’t make this a big surprise but it could have severe repercussions for Apple and its component supplier , ” said CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber .
“ Once again intellectual property has become the secondary battleground in a highly competitive mobile phone market . ”
Last year , Nokia ended a more than three - year legal battle with U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm which spanned three continents and involved more than a dozen separate cases .
“ It ’s too early to tell , but it ’s likely to be a drawn out battle .
We have a hard time seeing a material risk to either company , ” said Avian Securities analyst Matthew Thornton .
“ They ’re both big companies , they have lots of cash and they can fight it and in the end I do n’t really see a dramatic impact to Apple ’s financial profile . ”
Legal battles over as many as 10 technology patents can easily take several years .
The patents cover wireless data , speech coding , security and encryption and are infringed by all Apple iPhone models shipped since the iPhone was introduced in 2007 , Nokia said .
Nokia said 40 main handset vendors have licensed its technologies , but it has not reached agreement with Apple .
“ By refusing to agree appropriate terms for Nokia ’s intellectual property , Apple is attempting to get a free ride on the back of Nokia ’s innovation , ” Ilkka Rahnasto , Vice President for Legal & Intellectual Property at Nokia , said in a statement .
Apple Inc shares trading in the U.S. dipped on the news and were 0.34 percent lower at $ 204.21 by 1715 GMT ( 1:15 p.m. EDT ) .
Nokia shares closed in Helsinki 0.3 percent lower at 8.82 euros .
Apple was not immediately available for comment .

A physician accused of deliberately injuring two cyclists by slamming on his car ’s brakes on a narrow Brentwood road was convicted Monday of mayhem , assault with a deadly weapon and other serious criminal charges .
Dr. Christopher Thompson , 60 , slumped forward and held his face in his hands after the verdicts were announced in a courtroom packed mostly with supporters and cyclists .
Deputy Dist .
Atty .
Mary Stone , who prosecuted the case , asked for Thompson to be jailed immediately , calling him a flight risk and a safety threat to cyclists .
“ There ’s not a cyclist in Los Angeles who would feel comfortable with this defendant out on the road after this verdict , ” Stone told the court .
Advertisement
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Scott T. Millington ordered that Thompson be taken into custody .
Thompson , wearing a dark blue suit , grimaced and shook his head as a bailiff cuffed his hands behind his back .
The veteran emergency room doctor , who spent more than two decades working at Beverly Hospital in Montebello , was also convicted of battery with serious injury and reckless driving causing injury .
He faces up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced Dec. 3 .
The three - week trial in the Superior Court ’s airport branch was watched closely by bicycle riders around the country , many of whom viewed the case as a test of the justice system ’s commitment to protecting cyclists .
The July 4 , 2008 , crash also highlighted simmering tensions between cyclists and motorists on Mandeville Canyon Road , the winding five - mile residential street where the crash took place .
Prosecutors alleged that Thompson stopped his car after passing the two cyclists and shouting at them to ride single file .
The cyclists testified that they began maneuvering to ride one after the other when they noticed Thompson ’s car approaching fast behind them but that the driver passed dangerously close before abruptly stopping .

Ron Peterson , a coach for USC’s and UCLA ’s cycling team , was flung face - first into the rear windshield of the doctor ’s red Infiniti , breaking his front teeth and nose and lacerating his face .
Christian Stoehr , the other cyclist , hurtled to the sidewalk and suffered a separated shoulder .
A police officer testified that Thompson told him soon after the accident that the cyclists had cursed at him and flipped him off , so he slammed on his brakes “ to teach them a lesson . ”
Thompson testified that he never meant to hurt the riders .
He said he and other residents were upset at unsafe cycling along the road , which has become an increasingly popular route for bicycle riders in recent years .
But they had struggled to identify problem cyclists .
Thompson told jurors that the riders cursed at him and flipped him off when he yelled at them to ride single file .
He stopped his car so that he could take a photo of the cyclists and believed he had left enough room for them .
Advertisement
But prosecutors alleged Thompson had a history of run-ins with bike riders , including a similar episode four months before the 2008 incident , when two cyclists told police that the doctor tried to run them off the road and braked hard in front of them .
Neither of the riders was injured .
Outside court , the cyclists in the case said they were relieved at the outcome .
“ Our hope is that this brings to light how vulnerable cyclists are out there , ” Peterson , 41 , told reporters .
His face was permanently scarred from the crash and he underwent reconstructive surgery on his nose , which he said remains numb .
Stoehr , 30 , said the crash left him unable to work for months and that he rarely rides his bike anymore .
Nevertheless , Stoehr said he felt some sympathy for Thompson as he watched the physician being led away in handcuffs .

“ It ’s sad for both sides , ” Stoehr said .
“ I lost a lot of my time and my life , and he ’s losing a lot of his . ”

Does anyone run out of ways to spend their hard - earned money ?
I suspect they do not and it is for this reason that I generally shrug at gift guides .
I mean , really ?
That a $ 3,400 razor set has been marked down to $ 1,700 ?
Oh thank heavens !
I was wondering what to do with this money tree in my backyard that never stops growing .
But all most sarcasm aside , I do , you know , spend some time in the kitchen .
And my kitchen is tiny , even tinier than the one I had when I wrote this , which means that paring down my kitchen purchases to the most utilitarian items is more essential than ever .
These are the things I could n’t get by without .
My interest is in items that are practical , well - constructed , clever enough to multitask , pretty enough to move from kitchen to table , and — look , this is just my personal schtick as I fear things that melt close to temperatures I routinely use when cooking — involve as little plastic and silicone as possible .
So why do these fairly basic things make great gifts ?
Because I think the best presents are the things that you either might not think of or might not want to shell out for but end up making your life easier , everyday .
More than one - off , silly or amusing kitchen tchotchkes , odds are people will be using these same ten items in ten years , fondly remembering that kick - ass person who bought it for them in 2009 .
1. A Dutch Oven [ Which Doubles as Both a Doorstop and Exercise Weights , which comes in handy when you need to work off all of the lush things you cooked in it ]
Heavyweight pots that go from stove to oven are essential for any and every type of cooking , especially the stewy soups and braises this weather demands .
Staubs are my personal favorite ; I not only like their cool industrial design but two features that others do not have — little divots , called “ self - basting spikes ” under the lids and handles that are steel , not plastic , meaning that you do not have to worry about them melting should your oven exceed 450 °F .
You only * need * one but I ’ve been unable to resist two over the years .
My 7 - quart oval [ more colors here ] is great for big meals , dinner parties and is large enough to hold a whole roast or bird , i.e. 6 to 12 servings .
My 5 - quart round [ more colors here is the perfect size for everyday cooking , i.e. 4 to 6 servings .
Ca n’t get enough ?
I ’m hopelessly in love with Staub teapots [ sadly , the square are no longer available unless your stalk stores with dwindling supplies ] , but the obsession is form , more than function .
I mean , they work just fine but mostly I just find them real purty .
Slightly more functional , you probably see this 2 - quart roasting dish about three times a month on this site .
I bought it over two years ago and have n’t put it away since .
[ Links : Staub 7 - Quart Oval Dutch Oven , plus more colors ; Staub 5 - Quart Round Dutch Oven , plus more colors here ; Staub Round Teapots , Staub Oval Roasting Dish ]
2. A Great Big Knife [ Because Nothing Says Love Like a Very Sharp Knife ]
I ’m going to be honest with you : I do n’t understand what half the knives in those giant blocks do .
Partly due to laziness , partly due to an inherent desire to do more with less , I get everything I need done with one big chef ’s knife , and I ’ve used it long enough that it feels like a faster , more fierce extension of my hand .
Globals are my first choice , but I warmed to Wushtofs after receiving one as a gift .
I keep both sharp on a Furi , but try to take it for professional sharpenings every month , er , when it happens .
If you want to buy two knives , get a good bread knife .
Until recently , I never used to understand why people spent good money on bread knives .
Seeing as you cannot sharpen a serrated knife , I did n’t understand why the quality of the blade mattered .
So I had a $ 5 one and tried to pretend everything I cut with it did n’t look like I ’d chewed the loaf into slices .
Then someone lent me this one and my life was changed forever .
It glides through bread , it sweeps across the tops of cakes , and it slides effortlessly through marshmallows , bar cookies and chocolate , giving you a clean - cut edge you though previously only existed in the pages of Martha Stewart Living .
So yes , occasionally a second knife has its merits , too .

Dick 8 - inch Bread Knife that not only makes me weepy with joy , but will land an entertaining flux of Google searchers on this site ]
3. Salt and Pepper Grinders [ That Promise to Last Forever ]
You probably do n’t realize how much you care about having a set that can last forever until you ’ve had three in a row that so ineffectively chewed peppercorns that you were constantly met with the unwelcome surprise of a sharp crunch in a delicate pile of salad greens .
And then they broke on you .
Sometimes I want a fine grind , sometimes I want a coarse grind and I decided it was time I had mills that did both equally well , when I told them to .
I adore my Peugeot set I keep in the kitchen and a Vic Firth set [ sadly , can no longer find a link for these online ] we keep on the table but I could n’t say I ’ve extensively vetted other brands of grinders .
Regardless , these are still working great , the Peugot set for over 5 years now and the Vic Firth for close to 3 .
[ Links : Classic Peugeot Set , plus an assortment of colors , including the Dijon one I have , over here ]
4. Favorite Mixing Bowls [ That Double As Serving Bowls ]
Could I go on about my four - bowl set anymore ?
Probably not , but I will anyway : I just love them .
They hold their volume more vertically than horizontally , which means that they take up less real estate on my single , sorry 24″ x36 ″ counter , they nest so they save space in my nonexistent kitchen cabinets , they ’re minimal enough that only the food commands your attention , oh and they ’re dirt cheap which comes in handy when you ’re as clumsy as I am .
What could go wrong ?
They ’ve been unavailable on Amazon for a while .
I have dug and dug , and only found a 3 - piece version of the set on Overstock for , uh , twice what I paid for the four - piece but if you can get past that , we ’re still talking about only a tiny investment into something I ’ve kept in constant rotation since the day I brought them home .
[ Update : As astute readers let me know where they ’ve found these bowls , I try to keep an updated list of sources linked below .
Thanks , astute people ! ]

5. Favorite Ramekins [ That Double As Ingredient Prep Dishes ]
Look , I just really really like my ramekins .
Buy a dozen and you can use them for everything , from individual portions of bubbly baked dishes to big muffin cups , in a pinch .
Heck , buy two dozen !
They barely cost a thing .
[ Link : Stockholm Ramekins ]
6. A Digital Scale [ That Doubles As A Sanity - Saver ]
You know what ’s a pain ?
Measuring out 2 3/4 cups of flour over two one - cup measures , one half - cup measure and one quarter - cup measure .
You know what ’s easy ?
Weighing out 12 ounces on a digital scale .
Unfortunately , most American recipes and yes , regrettably , this site ( as of now ; I have hopes … ) are geared towards measuring cups , not weights but if you have a digital scale , a world of recipes is open to you , not to mention huge time - saving shortcuts where equivalent weights are offered .
My Salter scale works great , is inexpensive ( and you can often find them on sale at the big box stores for less ) , easy to use and — this is key — easily switches between ounces and grams .
[ Link : My Salter Scale ]
7. Various Space Savers [ Because An Uncluttered Kitchen is the Best ]
Strainers that double as sifters .
Round cutters that I use for everything from cookies to hand pies , dumplings , biscuits and you name it .
A solid timer than hangs out on my fridge , not counter which both ticks quietly and rings clearly .
A simple , space - efficient pot rack that gets them out of the way , but leaves them easy to grab .
Finally , my newest , funny little space saver tiny pot that has all but replaced our microwave .
You see , when I moved into an even tinier kitchen , I realized that there was no reason to give up precious real estate to a microwave , when I barely used it .
Yet still , I missed it every time I needed to melt a single stick of butter or simmer half a cup of cream , and I ’m too incompetent to be able to pour from a small saucepan into a bowl without half of the liquid dribbling down the sides .
I brought this tiny , pour - spouted pot home two weeks ago and have used it almost every day since .
It will so be used to reheat baby food down the road .

8. Favorite Gadgets and Gizmos
We all have giant messy drawers of gadgetry , right ?
These are the standouts in mine : Pastry cutter ( for the flakiest pies ) , pastry scraper ( no easier way to clean a counter ) , tongs ( I do n’t remember how I did anything before these ) , whisks aplenty and at least one flat one ( for the corners ) , an inexpensive mandoline , an offset spatula ( that I use for everything from icing cakes to lifting cookies ) and an array of microplanes which I find easier to store and less cumbersome than a box grater ; my favorites are the classic zester , the extra-coarse grater and something new I ’m playing with , the large shaver .
Borderline - ridiculous gadgets I generally do n’t admit to owning , but make me happy all the time : A garlic press that actually works ( no garlic left behind ! ) , apple slicer and corer and a fancy grapefruit knife that piths ( piths ! ) .
Gosh , I feel better getting that off my chest .
9. Cookware and Bakeware
If there is one place it is nearly impossible to rein in kitchen clutter , it ’s cookware and bakeware .
You can try to tweak and redistribute recipes whenever possible , but fact is that a loaf pan is a loaf pan and it looks nothing like a pie dish , and simmering two cups of stock in a 7 - quart Dutch oven feels absurd .
So , after you get your Dutch oven , how do you get started ?
I vote for figuring out which things drive you the most crazy that you do n’t have .
I started there and built my way up to the , well , way - too - much that I own these days .
[ Hey , I baked a wedding cake .
That ’s my excuse and I ’m sticking to it . ]
What I decide I need may be different for you , but in the interest of hey - you - never - know , these are the pieces of cookware and bakeware I get the most mileage from .
My preferences ?
Heavy pans , squared - off sides for clean edges , and I only put up with nonstick on cake pans .
For pots and pans , I link to All - Clads below because that ’s what I have ( my first set were from the MC2 line , but I was unhappy with them because they ’re not dishwasher - safe and had a permanently wrecked finish if you ran them even once by accident ; I ’ve since switched to their Stainless line which are a little pricier but at least last forever ) .
While I like them , I am not overly devoted to any brand of everyday cookware .
For bakeware , I tend to go high or low — either something cheap and not meant to last forever from a baking supply shop , or , when I know I ’ll want to use this pan size for a long time , I ’ve been very happy with the Williams - Sonoma Gold Touch pieces I ’ve invested in ; some look perfect even a decade old .
[ Links : A 12 - inch Cast Iron Frying Pan ( my go - to , as good for stovetop as it is for roasting vegetables and even a whole chicken ) , 3 or 4 - Quart Sauté Pan with Lid ( a bit more of an investment , but mine has lasted forever and is indispensable ) , One Small / Medium -ish Saucepan .
At Least 3 Baking Sheets ( which double as roasting pans ; I use quart - sheet pans because my oven is small but buy the size that works for you ; I ’ve been happy with the weight / heft of Chicago Metallic brand ) , a 9×13 Ceramic ( this is my favorite , by miles ; inexpensive , washes up perfectly , so I own two ) or Metal Pan , Loaf Pan , Pretty Little Pie Dish or Tart / Quiche Pan , and a 9 - or 10 - Inch Springform ]
10 . Something Pretty On Which To Display Your Hard Work : Essential ?
Probably not .
Does your cooking deserve a great big “ ta - da ! ” when you set it out ?
I think it does .
The set that you see in almost every picture on this site is from Martha Stewart .
They ’re not only inexpensive , you can ( slightly precariously ) stack three of them to make a cookie or cupcake stand .
Beyond that , you can get really far with one sturdy porcelain platter and the kind of wide bowl that holds pastas , salads or , heck , even a pretty centerpiece display .

And if you really want your own Smitten Kitchen …
You ’re going to need one of these arm ’s reach from the kitchen .
For one of these to chill in .
While you do things like this .
An apology : To my people !
Hanukah is just minutes away and wow , I did not see that coming this year so I got this out a little late .
Would a great latke recipe make it up for this oversight ?

My SS is still secret , probably because they " A Sound of Thunder " ed up the late Jurassic and are feeling a bit shameful about it .
A present so awesome I had to drag out 15 - year old dinosaur bathtoys to re-enact stupid movie scenes .
These were AMAZING to come home to , and the connection between the two presents is too sweet !
I love how I verbally flipped tables over the Delorean reference in the first present before I even got the second half .
PERFECT .
Note :
In the second half of the photo you may notice a gigantic , festering bruise on my right arm .
This is from a hilarious physical altercation with my best friend over who got to sit in the front seat .
Do n't make that domestic abuse call just yet .
If you ’re a tuning addict who loved the cars at the SEMA Show , but prefer more European models , then the 9ff Porsche 997 Turbo Speed9 debuting at the Essen Motor Show is for you .
The Essen Show in Germany always has the top of the line European makes and models on display , so do n’t miss out if you ’re nearby .
This Porsche 997 Turbo has been inspired by the legendary 356 ( circa 1955 ) with roots coming from the 997 Turbo cabrio .
Featuring the 3.6 - liter twin - turbo , 9ff was able to obtain 650 hp from the stock 473 horsepower .
The 6 - cylinder sports car received an aftermarket exhaust , ECU tuning , and a new catalytic converter .
These are impressive numbers for some simple modifications , and the tuners did n’t stop there .
The body kit on the Porsche 997 Turbo Speed9 is definitely one - of - a- kind .
9ff developed a styling kit that removed the rear seats for a speedster profile , and included new body parts for a unique look .
They installed a new front air dam , side skirts , and rear bumper that all give a striking appearance .
Pricing has not been released yet , but you can expect it to be expensive , given Porsche ’s do n’t come cheap .

Open platforms and open source software remain a central tenet of Mr Wales ’s ethos .
He clearly regrets the failure of his attempt to create an open - source Google rival : Wikia Search .
He had to close the door on that due to the economic pressures of the global downturn .
But he is still optimistic that a Wikipedia - like search engine where everyone could vote results up and down could be a reality in the future , even if he has to accept his role is cheering from the sidelines and not at the centre of the creation .
“ I still believe there is a need to open up search and it will come eventually .
It is very important to challenge the current models , ” he explains .
Do it now , son .
It ’s an expression of disrespect , calling someone your “ son ” if they are not indeed your progeny .
So when former lawmaker Sarah Palin closed a recent Facebook post with “ Thank you , Mr. President , ” surely she did not mean it , considering the contents of a letter she had just posted .
The missive was written by one Harold B. Estes of McAlpin , Florida , who attributes himself as an “ old geezer ” in a retirement home who served in the U.S. Navy during World War II .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I am amazed , angry and determined not to see my country die before I do but you seem hell bent not to grant me that wish , ” he wrote .
“ I ca n’t figure out what country you are the president of . ”
Estes goes on to blast Obama for allegedly declaring that America is “ no longer a Christian nation , ” which he did not .
( Obama said America is a nation of all religions . )
He also took issue with the president ’s characterization that America has not yet lived up to its ideals .
“ I realize you never served in the military and never had to defend your country with your life but you ’re the Commander - in - Chief now , son .
Do your job , ” Estes continued .
“ When your battle - hardened field General asks you for 40,000 more troops to complete the mission , give them to him .
But if you ’re not in this fight to win , then get out . ”
He concludes : “ You ’re not going to restore American greatness by bringing back our bloated economy .
That ’s not our greatest threat .
Losing the heart and soul of who we are as Americans is our big fight now .
And I sure as hell do n’t want to think my president is the enemy in this final battle . ”
The full letter is here , as sent to Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - FL ) .

“ Thank you , Mr. President , ” Palin finishes her Facebook post .
“ Please tell us on Tuesday that America is in it to win . ”
Neither cared to offer a definition of what circumstances constitute victory for an occupation in its ninth year .
I ’m not sure about you , but Google Maps is one of the applications I use on my Android Phone more than most others .
That being said , when an update for it is available I ’m alllll over it .
And guess what ?
Google has just updated Google Maps to version 3.3.0 and it includes a few new features .
The main addition in the application description seems to be Labs which offer :
Compass arrow
Scale bar
Terrain Layer
More …
When I opened up the new Google Maps for the first time it asked “ What ’s new in Maps ? ” and it answered :
Report a problem with the map or a business listing
See businesses at an address or near a point on the map
Try out experimental features with labs
Once in Google Maps if you press Menu >
More >
Labs you get to see the following information :
Labs
Labs is a testing ground for experimental features that are n’t quite ready for primetime .
They may change , break or disappear at any time .
Click on a lab to enable or disable it .
Scale bar
Shows a scale bar on the map with distances in metric and imperial units Terrain layer
Adds the terrain layer to the layers menu .
The terrain layer lets you view physical features , such as mountains and vegetation , with elevation shading .
Popular Categories
Shows a browsable list of category searches when you use the search menu item .
The hard search button still gives direct access to the normal search screen .
Layer button
Adds an on - screen button for easy access to layers Compass arrow
Uses the digital compass to indicate the direction you ’re facing while stationary
All of the labs features are disabled by default , so make sure when you first load the app you turn them on if you ’re looking to find out what is new .
The layers button is pretty convenient and as that feature is built out a little more – hopefully integrated with Places Directory – it will be even more powerful .
Give the new Google Maps a spin and let us know how you like it !
Awesome to see Google activity developing new applications while they simultaneously improve their existing ones at an impressive pace .
Keep it up Team G !

Irish voters will be asked again to decide the fate of the EU 's Lisbon Treaty next week , as the country holds a second referendum on the treaty .
The complex document - which is aimed at streamlining EU institutions - was rejected in a referendum in the Republic of Ireland last year .
Ireland is the only one of the EU 's 27 member states to put the treaty to a referendum , and the document needs the backing of all member states to enter into force .
The Irish government has already admitted it faces a tough battle to persuade its public to ratify it at the second time of asking on 2 October .
If they reject it again , the treaty could be scuppered .
Are you in Ireland ?
Will you be voting ?
How do you intend to vote ?
Have you changed your mind since the first referendum or will you vote the same way this time ?
How important is this referendum ?

The WordNet database contains all sorts of interesting relationships between words : it can categorize words into hierarchies , find the parts of an object , and answer many other interesting questions .
The code below relies on the NLTK and NetworkX libraries for Python .
Categorizing words
What , exactly , is a dog ?
It 's a domestic animal and a carnivore , not to mention a physical entity ( as opposed to an abstract entity , such as an idea ) .
WordNet knows all these facts :
How do we generate this image ?
First , we look up the first entry for " dog " in WordNet .
This returns a " synset " , or a set of words with equivalent meanings .
dog = wn . synset ( ' dog.n.01 ' )
Next , we compute the transitive closure of the hypernym relationship , or ( in English ) we look for all the categories to which " dog " belongs , and all the categories to which those categories belong , recursively :
graph = closure_graph ( dog , lambda s : s . hypernyms ( ) )
After that , we just pass the resulting graph to NetworkX for display :
nx .
draw_graphviz ( graph )
The implementation
The closure_graph function repeatedly calls fn on the supplied symset , and uses the result to build a NetworkX graph .
This code goes at the top of the file , so you can use wn and nx in your own code .
from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn import networkx as nx def closure_graph ( synset , fn ) : seen = set ( ) graph = nx .
DiGraph ( ) def recurse ( s ) : if not s in seen : seen .
add ( s ) graph .
add_node ( s . name ) for s1 in fn ( s ) : graph .
add_node ( s1 . name ) graph .
add_edge ( s . name , s1 . name ) recurse ( s1 ) recurse ( synset ) return graph
By using a high - quality graph library , we make it much easier to merge , analyze and display our graphs .
More graphs

The US Air Force on Tuesday confirmed for the first time that it is flying a stealth unmanned aircraft known as the “ Beast of Kandahar , ” a drone spotted in photos and shrouded in secrecy .
The RQ - 170 Sentinel is being developed by Lockheed Martin and is designed “ to provide reconnaissance and surveillance support to forward deployed combat forces , ” the air force said in a brief statement .
ADVERTISEMENT
The “ RQ ” prefix for the aircraft indicates an unarmed drone , unlike the “ MQ ” designation used for Predator and Reaper aircraft equipped with missiles and precision - guided bombs .
Aviation experts dubbed the drone the “ Beast of Kandahar ” after photographs emerged earlier this year showing the mysterious aircraft in southern Afghanistan in 2007 .
The image suggested a drone with a radar - evading stealth - like design , resembling a smaller version of a B - 2 bomber .
A blog in the French newspaper Liberation published another photo this week , feeding speculation among aviation watchers about the classified drone .
The air force said the aircraft came out of Lockheed Martin ’s “ Skunk Works , ” also known as Advanced Development Programs , in California — the home of sophisticated and often secret defense projects including the U - 2 spy plane , the F - 22 fighter jet and the F - 117 Nighthawk .
ADVERTISEMENT
The photo of the drone in Afghanistan has raised questions about why the United States would be operating a stealth unmanned aircraft in a country where insurgents have no radar systems , prompting speculation Washington was using the drones for possible spying missions in neighboring Iran or Pakistan .
The Sentinel was believed to have a flying wing design with no tail and with sensors built into the top side of each wing , according to published photos .
The RQ - 170 is in line with Defense Secretary Robert Gates ’ request for more intelligence and surveillance resources and with the Air Force chief of staff ’s plans to expand the fleet of unmanned aircraft , the air force said .
ADVERTISEMENT
The new drone is flown by the 30th Reconnaissance Squadron out of Tonopah Test Range in Nevada , which is under Air Combat Command ’s 432nd Wing at Creech Air Base , also in Nevada .
The United States has carried out an extensive bombing campaign against Al - Qaeda figures in Pakistan using the Predator and larger Reaper drones .

Robots or “ unmanned systems ” in the air and on the ground are now deployed by the thousands in Iraq and Afghanistan , spying from the sky for hours on end , searching for booby - traps and firing lethal missiles without putting US soldiers at risk .

Any person who has spent any time trying to get things done knows that the biggest enemy of achievement is the individual .
People space out , procrastinate , indulge in illusions , screw up , fall asleep , drop the ball , etc .
The root of most of these problems is that they get lost in their own minds and forget that reality goes on without them .
If you ’ve gone through this experience , you think humans should probably get a good reaming by reality because they so arrogantly , stupidly , and blindly ignore reality in favor of short - term social and monetary rewards .
That ’s the core of the human evil .
Now , there are these people called humanists who want us to be a law unto ourselves , and to put human concerns before concerns of the whole ( humans + world around them , and not just in the present tense either ) :
The disagreement about values may be described in an over - simplified way as a disagreement between naturalists and humanists .
Naturalists believe that nature knows best .
For them the highest value is to respect the natural order of things .
Any gross human disruption of the natural environment is evil .
Excessive burning of fossil fuels is evil .
Changing natureâ€™s desert , either the Sahara desert or the ocean desert , into a managed ecosystem where giraffes or tunafish may flourish , is likewise evil .
Nature knows best , and anything we do to improve upon Nature will only bring trouble .
The humanist ethic begins with the belief that humans are an essential part of nature .
Through human minds the biosphere has acquired the capacity to steer its own evolution , and now we are in charge .
Humans have the right and the duty to reconstruct nature so that humans and biosphere can both survive and prosper .
For humanists , the highest value is harmonious coexistence between humans and nature .
The greatest evils are poverty , underdevelopment , unemployment , disease and hunger , all the conditions that deprive people of opportunities and limit their freedoms .
The humanist ethic accepts an increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a small price to pay , if world - wide industrial development can alleviate the miseries of the poorer half of humanity .
The humanist ethic accepts our responsibility to guide the evolution of the planet .
NYT
I do n’t side with the humanists because that ’s like siding with solipsists .
They ignore reality around them in favor of what they ’d like to think .
For this reason , I ’m more on the side of the naturalists , but I find human beings claiming to know what nature wants are usually full of shit .
Instead , I advocate design science : we pay attention to how reality works and fit into it .
That means not destroying our environment , or ourselves .
It ’s that simple .

A previously incurable blood disorder – sickle - cell disease – has been successfully treated in 9 of 10 adults who received stem cells transplanted from tissue - matched siblings .
The inherited disease causes the bone marrow to churn out blood cells that are shaped like crescents , or sickles , rather than the round shape of healthy cells .
This causes painful blockages in blood vessels , depletion of blood and severe anaemia .
Transplants have worked well in around 200 children but do n’t succeed in adults because the technique requires that cells in the recipient ’s own bone marrow are destroyed first – children can usually tolerate this , but adults can’t .
Even when adults have got past this obstacle , they have gone on to develop the fatal condition graft - versus - host disease ( GVHD ) , in which the donated cells attack and destroy other tissue .
Advertisement
Mild destruction
Now John Tisdale of the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda , Maryland , and colleagues have overcome both problems in adults .
Instead of using the powerful drugs given to children to destroy all the native cells in their bone marrows , Tisdale ’s team mildly irradiated the whole bodies of 10 adults with sickle - cell disease to “ make room ” in their bone marrow .
Starting about a week before the transplant , the patients also received a drug called alemtuzumab which destroyed circulating native white blood cells so they could n’t attack the transplanted cells .
The donated cells came from siblings , and the researchers extracted and transplanted very specific CD34 blood stem cells , which grow into all blood types .
Mixed blood
After the transplants , the patients ’ blood was a mixture of donated and native cells .
The treatment completely prevented further production of the offending sickle - shaped blood cells in nine of the patients .
Also , haemoglobin levels rose from 9 to 12 grams per decilitre of blood in these patients , overcoming anaemia .
As an additional precaution to prevent GVHD , patients received the anti-rejection drug rapamycin , which stimulates production of T - helper and regulatory T - cells , which dampen immune aggression by both native and transplanted cells .
“ The simplicity , low toxicity and high efficacy of this approach make it feasible for use at most transplantation centres , ” the researchers conclude .
Not where it ’s needed
“ It ’s very real step forward in the treatment of sickle - cell disease , ” says Chris Mason , a senior stem cell researcher at University College London .
“ If you have a good intensive care facility , you would be able to do this . ”
However , because of the need for intensive care immediately following the operation , it may not reach poorer areas of the world where the disease is common , such as sub-Saharan Africa , says Mason .
Another challenge is finding siblings or unrelated donors with matching blood types , which is not always feasible .
One option in future may be to create stem cells from a patient ’s own tissue , then return these after using gene therapy to correct the genetic mutation that causes sickle - cell disease .
This has been done successfully in mice with sickle - cell disease , but will not be possible for some years in people .
Gene therapies are another option : these might restore sickle - shaped cells to normal .

It 's a crime
There are some interesting structural differences between writing a police procedural novel ( that sub - genre of crime that deals with how the police pursue the process of detection ) and writing a science fiction thriller .
I 'm currently elbow - deep in the guts of a pantomine horse of a novel ( SF thriller at one end , police procedural at the other ) so this is a topic of some interest to me right now .
One of the features of genre crime fiction is closure : the natural order of things is out of kilter ( a crime has been committed ) and at the end of the story the natural balance is restored ( the criminal has been apprehended ) .
There are , of course , variations : an ancient miscarriage of justice must be righted , or the detective is a serial killer or a purple singing dinosaur ... but the essential form is about the restoration of justice , whereas SF has a tendency towards divergence : nothing will ever be the same again .
How do you reconcile the divergent goals of the two media ?
One option is to do metafiction : use SF as a lens for examining the process of crime and detection , turning a cold camera eye away from the traditional certainties of method , motive , and opportunity to dwell instead on how criminal behaviour is defined .
Aside from the ancient bedrock offenses ( killing , assault — sexual or otherwise — and theft ) there 's a vast spectrum of grey , within which any number of shades clash for our recognition of their severity or innocence .
( File sharing : threat or promise ?
The very wording of legislation governing it would strike a lawmaker of the 18th century as gibberish , in the absence of a crash course in modern technology . )
Another option is to examine the likely policing of things as they might come to pass : is it murder to pull the plug on a computer hosting an artificial general intelligence or a running uploaded copy of a human mind ?
If a spammer sends a billion emails , each of which cost the recipient on average one second of their life , is it proportionate to deprive them of their liberty for a corresponding time ?
Hint : that 's thirty years .
( And then , there 's my approach : flail around happily in a near - future paddling pool full of brightly coloured machine parts ideas , until enough of them jammed together in the right pattern say something interesting . )
An interviewer once asked the elderly Agatha Christie how she got her her puzzle - box murder mysteries to hang together so elegantly .
To paraphrase her : " first I write nine - tenths of the book .
I put in lots of clues , and many suspects , and hapless detectives .
But I do n't know who did the deed !
When I reach the nine - tenths point , I go back through the manuscript and make notes , until I know who the murderer is .
I then go back again and take out all the contradictory clues — except for obvious red herrings — and write the climax , in which the killer is unmasked . "
If you substitute " what the crime is " for " who the murderer is " , this strikes me as being an approach eminently applicable to police - procedural SF ...

The British Grand Prix will stay at the Silverstone circuit next year after the Northamptonshire track reached a deal with Bernie Ecclestone after weeks of negotiations .
Silverstone looked set to lose the race last year when Ecclestone signed a 17 - year deal with Donington Park to host the grand prix from next season .
However , Donington failed to raise the funds to carry out a redevelopment project and so Ecclestone began talks with Silverstone .
The British Racing Drivers ' Club , owners of the track , confirmed on Monday morning they had secured a 17 - year agreement to host the British Grand Prix from 2010 .
The circuit will also host a MotoGP race next year .
" The title of Silverstone as home of motorsport has come true , " said BRDC president Damon Hill .
" It is a place for all motorsport .
Everyone in the BRDC loves motorsport and we are looking forward to the MotoGP as well as the British Grand Prix .
" It is not easy to enter into a contract of this magnitude and you have to take on a lot of responsibility , but the BRDC wanted this relationship to continue .
" Everyone was well aware that the British GP is not just a sporting event , but it is dynamo of the industry in this country .
Losing it would have been damaging and perhaps there would have been no coming back . "
Hill said the new pit and paddock work will begin after Christmas and it is hoped it will be finished for the 2011 race .
Silverstone 's managing director Richard Phillips said the circuit will work hard to given the fans better value for their money .
" Even this year with the new circuit we are trying to get better access for public , changing granstands for better viewing and running our own campsites to be better than the current ones , " he said .
" We want to increase the entertainment factor . "
He said the new contract has a clause to break the deal in 10 years ' time as a safety net .
" There is a mutual opportunity to break it is not what we want to do , " he said .
" It is a good safety thing to have . "
Phillips said Silverstone is looking at using the new ' Arena ' circuit for F1 next year .
" The FIA have been to see it , it has been submitted for homologation and we hope to be running on the ' arena ' circuit next summer .
If not we can run on the current circuit . "

Many food pantries receive food at a huge discount from Food Banks or wholesalers .
How big a difference does cash make ?
If you are going to make a donation , please consider donating the cash value instead of the food .
Some people are wary of donating money out of concern it may be misused .
There is an easy solution : Food Banks are like regular banks in that member agencies have accounts .
Money can be donated directly into your local Food Pantry 's account , and they can use it only to withdraw food .
However , please be aware that Food Pantries may also have operational expenses ( phone , electricity , sometimes rent , etc. ) and they need help with those too .
There is no such thing as a " bad " donation to a food pantry .
But the truth is that some donations feed more people than others .

President Barack Obama asked his national security adviser , James L. Jones , to begin a 90 - day review for recommendations on creating a center to expedite the release of classified documents .
In a presidential memo issued May 27 , 2009 , Obama wrote he wanted " unprecedented level of openness " in his administration .
A declassification center could speed the release of information to the public , he said .
Obama also wanted recommendations on measures to prevent the unnecessary classification of information , as well as preventing declassified information from becoming classified again .
This review is a tangible step toward the creation of a national declassification center .
We rate this promise In the Works .
Many young people are using ' proxy servers ' to get round their schools ' internet security systems .
The free services offer instant access to banned websites , including online games and social networking .
Figures suggest the use of proxies has risen sharply in recent years .
Security experts are warning that pupils who log on put themselves at risk of cyber crime .
It sounds like an obscure , techy area of computing that only geeks would know about .
But when we asked pupils in one secondary school classroom who had heard of proxy servers , every hand went up .
These ' secret tunnels ' to the internet are a way of life for teenagers across the UK .
As schools employ increasingly sophisticated software to stop them accessing ' non-educational ' websites , the proxies offer a quick , easy way to bypass those restrictions .
“ It 's just a box that says ' type in the website that is blocked ' .
You type it in and it brings it up , ” said a senior pupil , who wanted to remain anonymous .
Web - based proxy servers disguise a user 's activity from school monitoring software .
' Cat - and mouse ' game
A student will appear to be visiting only one site , that of the proxy itself .
Any internet surfing they do after that is effectively invisible .
When the blocked proxy server you were using got banned , you had another one ready School pupil
Ironically , what pupils are usually trying to work - around are other types of proxy servers , commonly used in schools to protect their machines from online threats .
Schools can take action against web - based proxies , by blocking them .
However because of the sheer number that exist , it becomes a game of cat - and - mouse .
“ When the blocked proxy server you were using got banned , you had another one ready and everyone had at least four that they knew and everyone shared them about , ” said one pupil .
Statistics on the use of proxy servers are hard to come -by .
One useful measure is the number of them being flagged - up by proxy - blocking systems .
' Security risk '
M86 Security monitors such sites .
In 2006 it was tracking 7,111 proxies .
By 2009 that had risen to 91,490 .
There are fears that the use of proxy servers amongst school pupils may be putting more than their education at risk .
Some can carry viruses , malicious software , and may even be under the control of cyber criminals , according to security experts .
Con Mallon from Symantec carried out a scan on a random selection of free proxies .
“ There is a site which is hosting what we call a trojan .
It may invite you to install some software onto your machine .
“ Once that is installed , it allows the bad guys to come back to your machine at any time ... what they would probably then do is install something called a keylogger .
“ It will sit there and monitor what you are typing - in .
What they are really looking for is passwords and logins . ”
Proxy ' problem '
Such information , once harvested , can be sold online .
Amongst our school pupils , the news comes as a surprise : “ I did n't have a clue that people could get my information if I was putting it in , ” said one girl .
Technical solutions need to be used as one aspect of a wider approach to protecting users , including educating children , teachers , and parents in how to use the web safely JANET spokesman
“ I kind of had an idea that it stays there .
But I did n't know it was that big – that it could log everything , ” added her classmate .
The problem of proxies is recognised by most of the bodies responsible for providing schools with internet access .
A spokesman for JANET , which carries data traffic between many local school networks , said : “ I would agree that proxy servers to get around security systems is indeed a problem .
“ Technical solutions need to be used as one aspect of a wider approach to protecting users , including educating children , teachers , and parents in how to use the web safely . ”
BECTA , the government agency that looks after school ICT , said : “ ... currently there is no single technology or method that can address this issue fully ” .
However , it seems newer security systems are helping schools catch up with the proxy users .
Most of the young people interviewed for this article agreed that monitoring systems had made it harder for them to find usable proxies , but said their efforts to get round school security would continue .
Torrential rains in El Salvador triggered flooding and mudslides that left at least 124 people dead across the Central American nation , officials said Sunday .
Dozens of others were reported missing , and authorities warned that the toll could rise as rescuers reached zones that remained cut off by floodwaters and landslides .
About 7,000 people were evacuated and scores were plucked from flood zones by helicopter , Interior Minister Humberto Centeno said .
“ The images we have seen today are of a country devastated , ” President Mauricio Funes said during a national television broadcast late Sunday .
Funes said the destruction resulted from a lack of flood - prevention systems in hard - hit spots , which he said received more than a foot of rain .
The impoverished nation of 7 million was pelted by three days of rain attributed to “ a disturbed weather area ” off the Pacific coast of El Salvador , according to the Miami - based National Hurricane Center .
Meteorologist Dennis Feltgen said the heavy rains were unrelated to Hurricane Ida , which earlier sideswiped the region as a tropical storm over the western Caribbean .

Authorities reported flooding in the capital , San Salvador , and rural areas to the east .
Some of the worst damage was reported in the eastern province of San Vicente , a farming region where authorities said many residents remained cut off from communication .
A radio journalist who reached Verapaz , a town of 6,000 in that region , reported seeing dozens of people desperately searching for relatives missing amid homes buried by landslides after a river spilled over its banks .
Carlos Lopez , a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross , said 300 homes in Verapaz were “ semi-destroyed . ”
He said hundreds more rural dwellers were cut off in the southern province of Usulutan .
Many took refuge on their shanty roofs .
Rescue workers were having a hard time reaching the area because of landslides that blocked highways .

In San Salvador , Mayor Norman Quijano said the flooding destroyed more than 250 homes in and around the capital as the rains peaked late Saturday and early Sunday .
Outside the capital , in the community of San Martin , Mayor Mario Gonzalez said at least 25 people died , many when landslides buried their hillside shacks .
Later Sunday , Hurricane Ida carried 100 - mph winds as it swirled off Mexico ’s Yucatan peninsula , where authorities activated shelters and suspended tourist ferry services .
Officials in the coastal state of Quintana Roo , home to Cancun and the nearby island resorts of Cozumel and Isla Mujeres , reported rain as the hurricane chugged offshore , but there were no immediate reports of damage .
The storm is projected to reach the U.S. Gulf Coast east of New Orleans by early Tuesday .
Chevron Corp. began evacuating some Gulf of Mexico personnel in anticipation , Bloomberg News reported .

Which come first , the supermassive black holes that frantically devour matter or the enormous galaxies where they reside ?
A brand new scenario has emerged from a recent set of outstanding observations of a black hole without a home : black holes may be " building " their own host galaxy .
This could be the long - sought missing link to understanding why the masses of black holes are larger in galaxies that contain more stars .
" The ' chicken and egg ' question of whether a galaxy or its black hole comes first is one of the most debated subjects in astrophysics today , " says lead author David Elbaz .
" Our study suggests that supermassive black holes can trigger the formation of stars , thus ' building ' their own host galaxies .
This link could also explain why galaxies hosting larger black holes have more stars . "
To reach such an extraordinary conclusion , the team of astronomers conducted extensive observations of a peculiar object , the nearby quasar HE0450 - 2958 ( see ESO PR 23/05 for a previous study of this object ) , which is the only one for which a host galaxy has not yet been detected [ 1 ] .
HE0450 - 2958 is located some 5 billion light - years away .
Until now , it was speculated that the quasar 's host galaxy was hidden behind large amounts of dust , and so the astronomers used a mid-infrared instrument on ESO 's Very Large Telescope for the observations [ 2 ] .
At such wavelengths , dust clouds shine very brightly , and are readily detected .
" Observing at these wavelengths would allow us to trace dust that might hide the host galaxy , " says Knud Jahnke , who led the observations performed at the VLT .
" However , we did not find any .
Instead we discovered that an apparently unrelated galaxy in the quasar 's immediate neighbourhood is producing stars at a frantic rate . "
These observations have provided a surprising new take on the system .
While no trace of stars is revealed around the black hole , its companion galaxy is extremely rich in bright and very young stars .
It is forming stars at a rate equivalent to about 350 Suns per year , one hundred times more than rates for typical galaxies in the local Universe .
Earlier observations had shown that the companion galaxy is , in fact , under fire : the quasar is spewing a jet of highly energetic particles towards its companion , accompanied by a stream of fast - moving gas .
The injection of matter and energy into the galaxy indicates that the quasar itself might be inducing the formation of stars and thereby creating its own host galaxy ; in such a scenario , galaxies would have evolved from clouds of gas hit by the energetic jets emerging from quasars .

" The two objects are bound to merge in the future : the quasar is moving at a speed of only a few tens of thousands of km/h with respect to the companion galaxy and their separation is only about 22 000 light - years , " says Elbaz .
" Although the quasar is still ' naked ' , it will eventually be ' dressed ' when it merges with its star - rich companion .
It will then finally reside inside a host galaxy like all other quasars . "
Hence , the team have identified black hole jets as a possible driver of galaxy formation , which may also represent the long - sought missing link to understanding why the mass of black holes is larger in galaxies that contain more stars [ 3 ] .
" A natural extension of our work is to search for similar objects in other systems , " says Jahnke .
Future instruments , such as the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array , the European Extremely Large Telescope and the NASA / ESA / CSA James Webb Space Telescope will be able to search for such objects at even larger distances from us , probing the connection between black holes and the formation of galaxies in the more distant Universe .
Notes
[ 1 ] Supermassive black holes are found in the cores of most large galaxies ; unlike the inactive and starving one sitting at the centre of the Milky Way , a fraction of them are said to be active , as they eat up enormous amounts of material .
These frantic actions produce a copious release of energy across the whole electromagnetic spectrum ; particularly spectacular is the case of quasars , where the active core is so overwhelmingly bright that it outshines the luminosity of the host galaxy .

This part of the study is based on observations performed at mid-infrared wavelengths , with the powerful VLT spectrometer and imager for the mid-infrared ( VISIR ) instrument at the VLT , combined with additional data including : spectra acquired using VLT - FORS , optical and infrared images from the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope , and radio observations from the Australia Telescope National Facility .
[ 3 ]
Most galaxies in the local Universe contain a supermassive black hole with a mass about 1/700th the mass of the stellar bulge .
The origin of this black hole mass versus stellar mass relation is one of the most debated subjects in modern astrophysics .

As the news industry looks to reconstruct its suffering business model , the journalists of today must reconstruct their skill sets for the growing world of online media .
Because of cutbacks at many news organizations , the jobs available are highly competitive .
News companies are seeking journalists who are jacks of all trades , yet still masters of one ( or more ) .
2010 will likely be a time of transition as today 's journalists catch up to learn the multimedia , programming , social media , and business skills they 'll need to tell their stories online .
These new skills are especially relevant to startups that are looking to hire multi-skilled and social media - savvy journalists .
Below we 've gathered some skills that are quickly becoming basic requirements for the journalist of tomorrow .
These skills are presented in no particular order .
1. Entrepreneurial and Business Savvy
As the foundation of the longstanding business model crumbles , both new and experienced journalists are becoming entrepreneurial and starting their own publications .
They are creating the " future of journalism today " by starting publications like Cody Brown 's online - only NYULocal , ( which covers New York University and has had months that got more Web traffic than the school newspaper Web site ) or David Cohn who started the community - funded reporting site Spot .
Us .
The journalist of tomorrow will have to understand the value of content and how the business model is changing , said Steve Buttry , C3 innovation coach at Gazette Communications .
They will have to understand how to pursue commercial opportunities relating to the content .
2. Programmer
To better transition to online journalism , news organizations are looking for programmer / journalists .
These are people whose programming skills can enhance their storytelling or reporting , and typically combine the use of HTML , CSS , PHP , JavaScript , ActionScript3 and Python skills .
This means being able to report and present a quality story using multimedia , and having the skills to build and manage the platforms that present the stories .
Creating Flash visualizations and building interactives that clearly display data are all key elements of online journalism .
3. Open -minded Experimenter
The challenge for new journalists will be a shift in mindset from control and content to openness and connectivity with audiences , said Alfred Hermida , Assistant Professor at the University of British Columbia Graduate School of Journalism .
Hermida also says that though storytelling across multiple platforms will be important , the key will be to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different media so that the best one may be utilized for each story .
This also means being a learner that can spot trends and understand what new technology can do , according to Michele McLellan , a media consultant who blogs for the Knight Digital Media Center on news innovation .
The journalist of tomorrow should be willing to experiment with new tools , not be afraid of them .
4. Multimedia Storyteller
Today , many journalists need to have multimedia skills to tell stories through video , text , graphics , audio and photos .
Former photographers and reporters are picking up video cameras and audio recorders to create a multimedia experience for readers .
Online video viewing is growing , and news startups like FLYP Media and DNAinfo are building their newsrooms around multimedia journalists .
There are many resources out there for journalists to learn these skills , and many of the skills can be self - taught .
One of the best ways to learn is through hands - on experience by starting a video blog .
Experiment with free multimedia apps like live streaming from your mobile using Qik , or podcasting with free sites like BlogTalkRadio .
If you have some money to invest , buy a camera that takes quality photos and shoots video .
5 . The Social Journalist and Community Builder
The new journalist will be a social journalist .
This means engaging with your audience , promoting content and building personal brands as a thought leader .
Social media increasingly focuses credibility on individual journalists as opposed to the news organization .
Mathew Ingram , Communities Editor at the Globe and Mail , said that future journalists will have the ability to find and connect with communities of interest both online and offline .
Though right now , this role is often being filled by specialized community managers and social media editors .
Ingram said that in the long term , every reporter should become their own community manager .
Journalists of tomorrow will also have new beats .
Typically , this has involved covering a specific subject , topic or community .
The new journalist will have what Ingram calls “ virtual beats . ”
This means building , communicating and engaging with communities online .
Kevin Sablan , Web leader at the Orange County Register , said that journalists of tomorrow will spend more time “ pounding the pavement ” in online social spaces .
Matt Thompson , interim Online Community Manager for the Knight Foundation , said he thinks technological skills are secondary to the core desire to provide community in formats they can connect with .
6. Blogger and Curator
To be a social journalist and one that engages in online communities , journalists will have to practice blogging regularly and serve as curators of other content on the Web .
Journalists of tomorrow will be participating in the link economy by gathering , synthesizing and making sense of other content across the Web .
We 've mentioned this before as a crucial factor in the survival of newspapers .
Journalists can curate the Web using tools like Publish2 , Twitter , StumbleUpon , and other social bookmarking and sharing tools .
And with 86,000 print publishing workers laid off in the last year , there is some good potential for blogging to increase .
But that 's not to say that only unemployed journalists should blog .
Blogging should be done within organizations as well .
This allows journalists to lend a personal tone to their company and connect with audiences .
It will also help them build personal brands that they can carry beyond their current news organization .
Carrie Brown - Smith , Assistant Professor of Journalism at the University of Memphis , said that there is a growing body of research that suggests writing with “ voice ” — writing that is more analytical and has personality — versus the traditional authoritative style has credibility in online contexts .
“ While not necessarily surprising , TV news anchors long had more credibility than newspaper journalists because viewers could see them and felt like they knew them .
This is something I think news organizations are not yet grasping and exploring as they should , ” Brown - Smith said .
There are many free platforms available to bloggers .
Sites like Posterous and Tumblr offer straightforward posting options , while sites like Wordpress and Google 's Blogger are highly customizable and offer various social media integration tools .
7. Multi-skilled
Because of the difficult job market , Robert Quigley , Social Media Editor at the Austin American - Statesman , said that journalists no longer have the luxury of focusing just on one skill set .
Journalists will need to have a combination of the skills mentioned , along with the fundamentals that have been taught for years .
“ The most valuable journalist will know how to use social media tools , can edit and shoot video , can write a good headline , understands a little about html or programming or databases , ” Quigley said .
“ Ideally , he or she can write a great SEO - friendly headline and understands why that 's important , knows how to write a sharp blog post and understands the value in interaction with the community . ”
It sounds overwhelming , but it is becoming truer than ever .
8. Fundamental Journalism Skills
Though journalists are morphing into renaissance men and women with multi-layered skill sets , the fundamental skills of journalism will never be replaced .
Skills like good writing , ethics , news judgment , investigation and verification will always be important , Buttry from Gazette Communications said .
Brown - Smith said that it will be a marriage between core values and new media skills .
These fundamental skills will be more important than ever as audiences search for credibility on the Web .
What skills do you find to be the most relevant to journalism in the social media age ?

In this video , two British police officers come up to a young woman who is filming a building and harass her , imply that she is a terrorist , intimidate her , demand to see her footage .
The policeman says that he 's harassing her for being " cocky " — punishing her for failing to cringe sufficiently .
England 's police chiefs have ordered policemen to stop harassing photographers , but this officer called for backup and 7 more officers converged on the photographer .
The photographer was brutally detained — she is covered in bruises — and fined but she had the presence of mind to return to the scene and interview the witnesses to the assault .
i'm not a terrorist

IT HAS been known for a while that stressful conditions such as famine result in more girls being born than happens in good times .
The shift in the sex - ratio is tiny — around 1 % — but in a large population that is still noticeable .
A possible evolutionary explanation is that daughters are likely to mate and produce grandchildren regardless of condition , whereas weedy sons may fail in the struggle to have the chance to reproduce at all .
In hard times , then , daughters are a safer evolutionary bet .
Regardless of why the shift happens , though , it has long been argued that the moment when it happens is conception — or , more probably , implantation .
A womb exposed to stress hormones , runs the hypothesis , is less likely to accommodate a male fetus .
A recently published study , however , suggests this ain't necessarily so .
According to Ralph Catalano of the University of California , Berkeley , and his colleagues , writing in the American Journal of Human Biology , stress - induced sex selection can take place long after conception and implantation .
Famines being rare in America these days , Dr Catalano and his colleagues used unemployment as their stressful event .
They studied the birth records of the state of California from April 1995 to December 2007 , and compared these with the number of new claims for unemployment insurance .
Based on hints from earlier work , they looked specifically at unemployment claims that had wider social resonance than the firing of a few individuals — namely those in which an employer sacked 50 workers or more in one go .
These mass lay - offs , it might be hypothesised , are more like natural catastrophes , such as famines , than isolated accidents that cause a few people to fall on hard times .
The researchers discovered that mass lay - offs did , indeed , lead to fewer boys being born .
Over the whole period 52.4 % of births were of boys .
In some months , though , that fell as low as 51.2 % .
Teasing out the statistics suggested that the stress of mass lay - offs probably caused these drops , but that the lay - offs in question could happen months after conception .
Male fetuses were , in other words , being spontaneously aborted — presumably as a consequence of stress .
That does not mean the original hypothesis is wrong .
But it is not the whole truth .
The ruthless winnowing of inappropriate offspring can , it seems , also take place well after a fetus has started developing .
The next step , according to Dr Catalano , is to measure in pregnant women the levels of hormones known to predict spontaneous abortion , and to work out if these levels vary with stressful events .
First you really need a debug build of python , this helps a lot since you get to use sys.gettotalrefcount ( ) and get more predictable memory behaviour .
The most complete way to build this is something like this ( the MAXFREELIST stuff adapted from this ) :
Now run the test suite using valgrind , this is troublesome but a very useful thing to do .
The valgrind memory checker will help you identify problems pretty quickly .
It can be confused about Python however , but you only care about your extension module so you need to filter most of this .
Luckily the python distribution ships with a valgrind suppression file in Misc / valgrind - python.supp that you can use , it 's not perfect but helps .
This is how I invoke valgrind :
$ /opt/pydebug/bin/ python setup.py build $ valgrind -- tool=memcheck \ -- suppression=~/python-trunk/Misc/valgrind-python.supp

So my secret santa gave me a rug from overseas , it looks like a terrorist related rug ( I can see the twin towers and an aircraft carrier , presumably the USS Cole ) !
I have no idea what it says , but it looks really cool , and I 'm extremely glad to have it .
Thanks , secret santa !
There was also issue 8 of Wholphin , a DVD magazine of rare and unseen short films , so that looks cool too .
I 'll probably watch that during one of the many days I 'll be spending in my home now that I 'm completely snowed in .
At age 27 , Malalai Joya was the first woman elected to Afghanistan 's parliament .
She 's an outspoken advocate for democracy -- so much so that she 's been suspended from her job in the National Assembly for allegedly insulting her colleagues on television ( the suspension has been criticized by the United Nations and Human Rights Watch ) .
She 's survived five assassination attempts and stays on the move to keep safe , although her friends will tell you that her car has been breaking down a lot lately .
She 's been the subject of a documentary and now has released a memoir , " A Woman Among Warlords " ; tonight , she 'll speak at All Saints Church in Pasadena .
Thursday afternoon , more than 50 Angelenos packed into a front room of a Beverly Hills home to hear Joya , who is fluent in English , speak about her experiences .
About half were activists affiliated with the antiwar group Code Pink , and they were supportive of Joya 's criticisms of the Obama administration 's policies toward Afghanistan .
" We must end this continuing occupation , " she said to a round of applause , with all the conviction and modulation of a practiced politician .
Speaking with an accent that thickened as she gained momentum , Joya , who stands less than 5 feet tall , held the room in her sway .
Her targets were warlords and corruption at home first , but it was her unflinching criticism of American policies that found traction with this peace - activist audience .
" Democracy cannot be won by war , " she said , to more applause .
When she noted that a new report by the UNDP rated Afghanistan 181st out of 182 countries , one woman raised her hand .
" What is UNDP ? " she asked .
About two - thirds of the crowd responded without hesitation : " The United Nations Development Program . "
Some women in the room had traveled to Afghanistan recently , and Joya appealed to their sense of connectedness .
" The silence of good people is worse than the action of bad people , " she urged , to more applause .
The cars parked on the street near the Beverly Hills home were an equal mix of middle - class sedans and high - end sports cars , with a generous smattering of KPFK stickers throughout .
Southern California may be one of the few places in the country where dedicated peace activists dine within arms ' reach of original art by modern masters .
If Joya noticed any incongruity , she kept it to herself .
She is a politician , after all .

To say the Call of Duty franchise has been a success would be a bit of an understatement .
The launch of Modern Warfare 2 shattered entertainment business records .
Though Activision is content with churning out yearly sequels , it may have bigger plans in store for Call of Duty .
The Los Angeles Times is citing a source “ close to Activision ” as stating that the company is in fact looking into the possibility of creating a massively multiplayer online game set in the world of Call of Duty .
There are currently only a handful of MMOFPS games on the market , and it looks like Activision wants to capitalize on that .
Whether or not anything will come of this is yet to be seen , but should any news surface expect to read it on PlayStation LifeStyle .

' Food and oil , I 'm afraid , go hand in hand '
- Deutsche Bank analyst
There 's been a lot of stale argument recently about oil – is it running out ?
Are we approaching / at / passed Peak Oil ( the point when global oil production goes into irrevocable decline ) ?
Business , unsurprisingly , is n't waiting for the answer ; it 's working out what will happen next .
Take the recent report from Deutsche Bank , entitled ' The Peak Oil Market : Price Dynamics at the End of the Oil Age ' .
This describes a world where the effect of failing global reserves is compounded by incoherent politics .
If the US Government was honest about the cost of oil , for example , it would slap another 50c on a gallon of gasoline to pay the cost of the war in Iraq .
Ludicrously , as global oil supplies dwindle , the increasingly precious part that remains is concentrated in the hands of those who give it away to their citizens for almost nothing – Saudi Arabia , Venezuala , Iran , Iraq .
Governments should be planning how best to manage the limited supply of oil sensibly , for the long - term , the bankers write :
' We believe , based on the history of the past decades , years , and months , that they will do the exact opposite . '
As a result , oil demand – and price – will continue to spiral upwards to a peak in 2016 , when a barrel will cost about $ 175 ( it is just under $ 80 today ) .
At that point – at that price – our addiction will be broken as people turn instead to cheaper alternatives already gaining ground today , natural gas and the electric car .
But , for all its talk of price , the report fails to mention the cost .
As the Deutsche Banker quoted above ( he asked not to be named ) points out , this is measured in hungry mouths , for food and oil go hand in hand .
Take a look at the graphs below ; one shows the global price of oil , the other the global price of food .
Both go up .
Last week 's British inflation figures – a measure of increasing prices , including that of food – were up , sharply , driven by the increasing price of oil .
Remember the food riots of 2007 - 8 ?
Between now and 2016 , expect more of the same .
Watching the builders
Every businessman has a pet indicator they claim gives them the inside edge on what is happening to the recession .
Some watch carpet sales , others booze sold by supermarkets ( people staying in for a cheaper night ) , still others watch Butlins ( people taking cheaper holidays ) .
Inspired by one City contact who counts the skips on his street ( people splashing out on home renovations ) , I 've been watching builders .
We 're buying a house .
The extension , we 're told , is substandard .
Needs knocking down .
The builders are licking their lips in anticipation .
When can they start ?
Any time you like , guv .
Business is patchy .
The same is true across the industry .
Wolseley , the Midlands - based builders ' merchant and world 's biggest supplier of plumbing and heating products , says profit was down 45 per cent in the three months to July .
The company has cut 30,000 staff and expects hard times ahead .
' We do expect that to get worse before it gets better , ' said chief financial officer , Steve Webster .

I Anibal Paz is nearly surrounded .
The sergeant and his squad of 15 or so Marines are crouched behind the crumbling mud walls of a small Afghan compound taking fire from three directions .
Hiding in the tree line to the south , guerrillas pepper the Marines with automatic weapons fire .
From a cornfield to the west come more AK - 47 bursts .
Most worrisome , though , are the bullets whizzing in from a squat building in a second compound a few hundred yards to the southeast .
These are sniper shots from a bolt - action rifle .
Unlike the AK barrage , they get closer with every round .
Paz barks at his soldiers to return fire .
His urgent , gravelly voice does n't quite match his boyish face with its smooth , round cheeks , long eyelashes , and tidy black mustache .
Paz , the son of a Portuguese Special Forces soldier , was raised in Fall River , Massachusetts , and grew up to be a self - proclaimed " Masshole , " true to his Celtics , Patriots , and Red Sox .
He did two tours in Iraq and took part in the Marines ' biggest battle in a quarter century , 2004 's invasion of Fallujah .
To his surprise , he 's finding Afghanistan even more relentlessly violent than Iraq :
His unit , Echo Company , has traded fire with the Taliban three out of every four days it has spent in this small farming community , called Mian Poshteh , roughly 100 miles from the border of Pakistan 's Balochistan province .
A bullet whizzes just left of Paz .
Then another to the right .
He waves over a Marine carrying a backpack - sized radio and grabs the green handset .
" We 're receiving accurate fire from the compound ! " he shouts over the rattle of machine gun bursts .
It was supposed to be a simple mission .
Paz and his squad were told to hunker down at this compound — a collection of broken adobe buildings with a dusty , tree - shaded courtyard called Moba Khan — for a day and a half , monitoring the area to see who came and went .
A small reconnaissance team had the hard part : ambushing a group of Taliban who , the Marines had learned , would be meeting in the next compound up the road .
But the attack did n't go smoothly .
There were more militants , and more guns , than anticipated .
In the ensuing firefight , two Marines were shot and four more were injured by an improvised explosive .
The recon team successfully made it back to the company 's nearby headquarters and nobody died , but it was a matter of luck and quarter - inches .
Since then , Paz and his squad have been battling the insurgents .
Mortars , artillery , and rockets from Cobra helicopters have all failed to stop the Taliban assault .
A pair of F - 15 jets circle overhead .
Cameras on the bellies of the aircraft capture the standoff : the opposing compounds , the tree line to one side , the fields between .
The images are relayed to Echo 's headquarters , a burned - out schoolhouse just over half a mile away surrounded by sandbags and mortar tubes .
Inside the school , Eric Meador , the company commander , leans over a small table and looks at the footage on a laptop .
Meador is on the small side — 5 ' 9 " , 140 pounds — and is a bit quirky for a Marine officer .
A former Mississippi cop from a family of musicians , he has a weakness for chewing tobacco and reality TV — he keeps a picture of Kate Gosselin on one wall of the schoolhouse .
But he radiates authority , and in the command post everyone focuses on him .
Meador asks air controller Josh Faucett to review the standoff .
" This is where the friendlies are , " Faucett says , pointing to the screen .
" This is where we think the sniper is . "
It 's a building in the northern compound , next to the main east - west road .
The next step seems obvious :
Call those F - 15s and have them reduce the Taliban 's positions to rubble .
That 's how the Marines took out insurgents in Fallujah in 2004 .
Hell , it 's how they went after the Taliban in August 2008 .
But it 's August 2009 , and today Meador is not sure .
A month earlier , just as Meador , Paz , and 4,000 other Marines were getting ready to move into Helmand province , the US military modified its counterinsurgency strategy .
Incoming top general Stanley McChrystal issued strict guidelines forbidding air strikes except in the most dire circumstances .
The number one priority in Afghanistan , he declared , was to secure the population so normal life could resume .
The US needed to rob the militants of popular support , he argued .
Dropping bombs only disrupted lives and drove people into the arms of the Taliban .
So civilian casualties from air strikes had to stop — immediately .

The directive has required a radical shift in the approach to Afghanistan .
For most of the first eight years of the war , the US and its allies relied heavily on air power to keep militants in check .
US aircraft , the generals believed — with their precision bombs , sophisticated targeting , and sheer omnipresence — could minimize the number of troops required to wage the war .
The problem is that air strikes — even with maximum precision and care — can alienate the people needed most for a successful counterinsurgency campaign .
America 's mightiest engineering accomplishments — drones and smart missiles — are actually impediments to the social engineering required in Afghanistan .
So with a single stroke , McChrystal took the US 's biggest technological advantage off the table .
The military would have to make do without one of its most potent weapons .
It has n't been easy .
While accidental civilian deaths dropped by 87 percent in the eight weeks following the order , American fatalities have more than doubled from 2008 levels .
And to make the plan work , McChrystal will get 37,000 more US and NATO troops .
At the highest levels of the Obama administration , many top officials pushed to remake the Afghanistan campaign in the mold of the Pakistan air war next door : more drone strikes and fewer troops to get caught in the cross -fire .
Soldiers can only do so much to rebuild this rugged society from the ground up , they argued .
Let the drones take the lead , fighting this conflict from the safety of the skies .
But for now , McChrystal 's approach has won out .
He travels to Capitol Hill in early December to defend his war plan .
While the debate rages in Washington , the Marines on the ground are mostly on their own .
Even with Paz 's squad being attacked from three sides , a bombing run is not automatic .
The Marines not only have to prove that civilians wo n't be hurt , they also must guarantee that the bombs wo n't so much as scratch civilian homes .
Back at Echo's schoolhouse headquarters , Faucett stares at an aerial view of Moba Khan on his tablet computer .
He sees a problem :
The building Paz has identified as the sniper 's perch is next to several farmhouses .
" Man , the target house is right on the edge of that village , " Meador says , rubbing his shaved scalp with the palm of his hand .
If he orders a strike that hits a farmer 's kid instead of a sniper , the Taliban will have some angry new allies , and the brass will be apoplectic .
Meador wants to protect his men .
But he also can't be sure who or what a bomb would hit .
Meador tells Faucett to wave off the F - 15s — and hopes he has n't made a serious mistake .
II A year ago it would have been easy for Dave " Smoke " Grasso and Sean " Sticky " Flor to come to Paz 's rescue .
But today the pilots linger on the tarmac of a clandestine air base , hundreds of miles outside Afghanistan , in their tan flight suits and Top Gun shades ( Grasso completes the look with his brown hair trimmed into a flattop ) .
Next to them sits their plane , a B - 1 bomber , perhaps the most lethal flying machine in the US arsenal .
It is capable of delivering up to 48,000 pounds of bombs in a single sortie — enough to obliterate the enemy outpost at Moba Khan , the cornfield , the tree line , and everything else in the vicinity .
But this destructive hardware is now largely kept leashed .
Before McChrystal issued the new restrictions on bombing , Grasso and Flor had two main jobs :
They would demolish fixed targets —
Taliban hideouts identified by aerial or on - the - ground intelligence — or , alternatively , they played " roving linebacker , " dashing over to wherever American troops were in trouble and eliminating that trouble .
If there was a choice between killing Taliban and saving some locals ' homes , the buildings got it .
If it was a choice between killing Taliban and saving some locals ... well , let 's just say they dropped a lot of bombs .
" This guy here , " Grasso says , pointing at Flor , " was a bomb - dropping machine . "
Twice , during a single mission , Flor has dropped all 12 of his 500 - pound bombs and all eight of what he calls his 1 - ton " crowd- pleasers . "
They hit their stride in the summer of 2008 , with the air war at its peak .
The US unloaded 587,000 pounds of ordnance in June and July of that year — as much as was dropped in all of 2006 .
Not surprisingly , there were accidents .
In July , a bombing in Nangarhar province wiped out 47 civilians on their way to a wedding party , including the bride .
In October , a coalition air strike hit an Afghan army checkpoint in Khost province , killing nine soldiers .
This naturally enraged the Afghans .
By November , president Hamid Karzai was calling for a radical de-escalation to the air war : " The fight against terrorism can not be won by bombardment of our villages . "
The Americans politely blew off these demands .
The US had viewed air power as its most important advantage in this war since 2001 , when a fleet of bombers and fighter jets — and minimal US ground forces — helped rout the Taliban .
In 2008 , with roughly 30,000 troops patrolling a country the size of Texas , the US was still heavily reliant on air strikes .
Not only is Afghanistan 50 percent bigger than Iraq ( where , it should be noted , the US had five times as many forces ) , but much of the country 's terrain is so rugged that the only way to attack targets is by air .
Collateral damage was seen as a necessary evil .
At least , this was the attitude until last May .
That 's when a B - 1 and a pair of F / A - 18 Fs came to the aid of a group of Marines and Afghan soldiers locked in a shoot - out with militants in Farah province .
The Taliban hunkered down in an area teeming with hundreds of civilians .
Over the course of the standoff , the B - 1 pilots dropped three 1 - ton munitions and five 500 - pound bombs .
The pilots believed they were unloading on buildings that had been emptied of women and children .
They were wrong .
" It was like Judgment Day , " one witness told Human Rights Watch .
" Who can bear to see so many killed , from a two - day - old baby to a 70 - year - old woman ? "
Dozens of civilians died .
President Obama promised to " make every effort to avoid civilian casualties " in the future .
Later that month , he named McChrystal the new commander for the Afghanistan war .
This Air Force operations center now coordinates only three to five aerial assaults a month .

On July 2 — after two weeks on the job — McChrystal issued his new " tactical directive . "
" We must avoid the trap of winning tactical victories — but suffering strategic defeats — by causing civilian casualties , " he wrote .
This did n't just mean minimizing the number of bystanders killed — it meant not having any .
Under McChrystal 's rules , units were even supposed to consider retreating from a fight rather than calling in an air strike .
These days , Grasso and Flor spend most of their flying time using souped - up video cameras to monitor action on the ground — without unloading their weapons .
Pilots still have vital roles to play — ferrying supplies , surveilling hostile terrain , zooming over convoys in hopes of intimidating potential attackers — but dropping bombs is increasingly not one of them .
Grasso says he's on board with the new directive .
" Every time I drop a bomb and kill one innocent Afghan , I set the war back — even if I killed 100 Taliban , " he says .
And maybe , Grasso admits , he was a little overeager to drop bombs last year .
" When you 've got a truckload of food , everyone looks hungry .
So when everything looks suspicious , when you 're looking for suspicious stuff , you almost want it to be suspicious . "
That 's not to say complying is easy .
" It 's frustrating , sitting up there , knowing guys are on the ground , getting shot at , " Grasso says .
" You 're a roving linebacker .
But they keep running the ball out of bounds . "
On the tarmac , a maintenance crew loads a rack of 500 - pound bombs into his B - 1 .
A public relations officer offers me a white marker , asking if I want to sign one of the munitions .
No thanks , I say .
Grasso takes the marker .
" Bring the hate , " he writes .
III With the F - 15s gone , Paz and his squad must fend for themselves .
Luckily , the Taliban fighters do n't press , and after a few hours the shooting peters out .
The sun begins to set .
Knowing the militants are still out there somewhere , the Marines squat in the compound courtyard , swatting away mosquitoes and eating MREs .
Paz and the unit 's ranking officer , Patrick Nevins , set up a schedule for the night ; the Marines switch off doing two hours of guard duty , then grabbing two hours of sleep .
As day finally breaks , the Marines are running low on food and water , so Nevins plans a resupply mission .
He will take most of the squad with him , and Paz will stay with a team of four to defend the compound .
It 's about 10 in the morning when Nevins and his men file out the back of the compound , alongside an irrigation ditch .
At 10:15 bullets explode from the southern tree line .
Normally , the Taliban fire in quick bursts and then pause before shooting again — a sign of unschooled , undisciplined fighters .
This time , it 's a sustained stream of fire .
And as soon as it ends , another barrage starts from the cornfields .
This is a coordinated attack , orchestrated by someone well versed in infantry warfare .
And judging by the number of guns firing , that pro might have as many as 15 or 20 men — triple the number of Marines left at Moba Khan .
Paz tells his radioman to get ahold of Nevins .
But all they hear is static .
Paz tries to maintain his composure .
What about Meador ?
If they can reach him , there 's a decent chance of finally getting some air cover .
Again , no response ; the radio is dead .
" Get that up , " Paz screams at his radio operator , " or we 're done ! "
IV One of the ironies of McChrystal 's directive is that the military 's ability to plan and execute precision strikes — with minimal loss of civilian life — has never been better .
In fact , the Air Force has a set of tools and protocols so finely tuned that even Human Rights Watch praised its " very good record of minimizing harm to civilians " during the height of the 2008 bombing campaign .
But under the new rules , air strikes became a tactic of last resort — no matter how methodically targeted .
So planned assaults against fixed targets have become rare .
A few days before the standoff at Moba Khan , I got to see how the target - approval system works .
The demonstration took place inside a top - secret annex to the Combined Air and Space Operations Center — the heart of US air operations — located on the same base where Grasso and Flor are stationed .
( In exchange for access to the facility , I agreed to withhold some details , like certain names and its exact location . )
Military drones over Afghanistan are subject to the same rigorous target - approval protocol as piloted fighters and bombers .

An officer , I 'll call him Paul , walks me through the process .
It starts with " targeteering , " figuring out where a pilot should attack .
Just getting GPS coordinates or an overhead image is n't good enough .
GPS is unreliable when it comes to altitude .
And landscape and weather conditions can throw satellite pictures off by as much as 500 feet .
" Even with Gucci imagery , there 's always errors , " Paul says .
He points to a pair of screens :
On the right side is an aerial image of a building .
On the left , two satellite pictures of the same place — taken from slightly different angles — flicker in a blur .
Paul hands me a pair of gold - rimmed aviator glasses .
I put them on , and those flickers turn into a single 3 - D image .
Paul compares the 2 - D and 3 - D images , then picks exactly where the building should be hit .
Depending on elevation , adding a third dimension can shrink a 500 - foot margin of error down to 15 feet .
Step two is " weaponeering , " deciding how to strike the target .
Paul clicks on a piece of software that simulates what a particular weapon will do to a structure .
To demonstrate , Paul punches up a simple 3 - D representation of an adobe building , similar to the ones in the Moba Khan compound .
Then he picks how he 'll attack it : an F - 15E jet armed with a 500 - pound satellite - directed bomb .
He picks a corner of the roof as his aim point .
The program starts running .
In a few seconds , it predicts how the attack is most likely to unfold :
Only one wall of the building will be left standing .
Other tools calculate how far a weapon 's blast and shrapnel will spread and how many people might be in the area at a given time of day .
Paul 's team also checks a Google Earth map highlighting all the known hospitals , mosques , graveyards , and schools in Afghanistan .
If the target is too close to one of these , ground commanders will scrub the mission .
A worldwide network backs up the targeteers .
Spy drones , flown remotely by pilots in Nevada , keep watch on an area to confirm that militants are really around and women and children are n't .
That footage is beamed around the world to imagery analysts , who scour the video for civilians and off - limits sites .
" We 're always finding a mosque or two , " Paul says .
Finally , military lawyers and intelligence specialists compare the drone 's views to radio intercepts , informants ' tips , and intel from recon teams on the ground .
Taken together , it might be the most precise , most sophisticated system for applying lethal force ever developed — the Platonic ideal of how an air war should be run .
The problem , of course , is that all these steps take time — time to wait and watch silently through a drone 's eyes , time to marry up the images , time to run the simulations .
Such strikes used to take place a few times a week — despite the fluid nature of the Afghan counterinsurgency .
But under McChrystal , the system has become even more rigorous .
To get a strike approved in advance , ground commanders now need to provide the top brass with multiple sources of intelligence showing that there are only militants and not civilians , proof that there 's no other way to go after a target , and even a plan to justify the bombing to the locals .
Not surprisingly , these requirements rarely come together .
The only bombs that get dropped these days are those used to protect " troops in contact " — soldiers currently engaged in a firefight .
But because these events are sporadic and unpredictable , there just is n't time to involve Paul and his team .
This creates something of a paradox :
The most precise , humane air strikes are off limits , while the most risky , least controllable bombing runs continue ( albeit under tighter restrictions ) .
When I visit , Paul and his crew sit idle , passing the time running and rerunning simulations .
Meanwhile , the real war rages hundreds of miles away .
V Paz and his four fellow Marines try to hold back the Taliban assault — without support from the air and without the rest of their squad .
The radio operator frantically screws and unscrews his antenna , trying to bring his gear back to life .
Suddenly , a bit of the wall behind him explodes : sniper shots .
After five minutes , the radio inexplicably crackles back to life .
Paz exhales in relief .
" We 're taking enemy fire , " he says into the handset .
" Be advised , have only a fire team and myself . "
A half mile away , inside the schoolhouse , Meador tells his team to get the mortars and artillery ready .
( It 's fairly easy to call in mortars , artillery , and attack helicopters — even though those are less precise than strikes from a fighter jet .
The difference , of course , is the size of the blast . )
" If you want us to shoot something , let us know , " the captain says .
Paz does .
Lots of things , actually .
Starting with that sniper .
" Stand by for direction and distance , " he says .
He gives the coordinates .
A flurry of 60 - millimeter mortar rounds fly at his enemies , each landing with a thud .
Paz asks Meador to fire again — this time on the Taliban 's exit routes .
Meador calls in artillery , shot from a mobile firebase in the western desert .
The shells hit the ground and send shock waves through the Marines ' chests .
Then more mortars .
Then artillery again .
But every time , the pattern is the same : a brief pause , followed by more sniper shots .
What they need is a 500 - pound bomb .
With the situation worsening , a pair of Harrier jets are summoned .
J. P. Larkin , an air controller at the schoolhouse , tells the pilots to survey the scene at Moba Khan .
The Harriers swoop past the tree line and the compound , transmitting video back to the schoolhouse .
Larkin taps his tablet computer with a stylus and a pair of still images appear onscreen .
He 's using a system called PSS - SOF — short for Precision Strike Suite for Special Operations Forces , and pronounced " piss off . "
It 's a kind of dumbed - down version of the tools used by targeteers .
Larkin has the jets point their cameras at a small , square building on the compound 's northern edge , where they think the sniper is .
The approach looks good , so Larkin radios back to the battalion command post , about 10 miles away , to get approval for the Harriers to bomb the sniper 's perch .
The battalion calls back to the commanding officers at the brigade headquarters , who check with headquarters in Kabul and , finally , the main air operations center .
" Sir , " one of Meador 's lieutenants asks , " you want to drop this bomb , right ? "
Meador picks up a plastic bottle , puts it up to his mouth , and spits tobacco juice inside .
He glances around the room , then takes another look at the Harriers ' videofeed .
" I 'm still trying to develop the situation , " he says .
After more than a day of combat , Meador is pretty sure he 's got the Taliban 's tactics figured out .
First they go to the tree lines and the cornfields to shoot .
Then they regroup inside the compound and let the sniper go to work .
The key is to drop the bomb when the militants are in the building .
Larkin , holding the radio handset to his ear , receives word from the battalion .
" Mission 's approved , " he tells the other Marines .
Meador 's still not convinced the time is right , though .
Under McChrystal 's rules , he 'll likely have just the one chance to take out the sniper .
He rubs his temple .
" I do n't want to waste this , " he says .
" How much longer has this guy got ? "
Larkin checks with the pilots .
Bad news :
The Harriers are running low on fuel and have only 10 minutes before they have to leave .
Meador goes over the bomb 's detonation pattern one more time with Larkin .
It 'll be on a timer , puncturing the building 's roof , then detonating .
That should bring down the whole place , crushing the sniper and anyone else inside .
After all the planning , waiting , and hand - wringing , this is the best they can do .
At 11:50 , Meador finally gives the OK .
Larkin tells the Harriers : " Cleared hot . "
" It 's off , " Larkin announces to the room .
" Twenty - eight seconds . "
Larkin and Meador stare at the Harrier 's videofeed , which stays fixed on the target .
The seconds tick by .
Then a plume of smoke shoots from the hostile compound .
Dust engulfs the screen .
" Fuck your building , bitch ! " Larkin screams .
Direct hit .
Moba Khan goes quiet .
" Receiving no more fire , " Paz radios Meador .
Seventeen minutes pass .
Then the AKs open up again .
Followed by a sniper .
Did they miss ?
Is this a second sniper ?
Nobody knows .
There wo n't be a second run , so Meador calls in more mortars , artillery , and helicopters .
Eventually Meador is able to reinforce Moba Khan , and the Taliban back off .
After a third day , he deems it quiet enough to bring Paz and his squad back to the schoolhouse .
But Meador sends another squad to replace them .
And then another squad to replace that one .
At press time , attacks in the Mian Poshteh area have diminished , and Echo Company has returned home .
As a new crew of Marines branches out to work with the population , they know that the militants could ambush them at any time — with no guarantee of a 500 - pound backup .

The 12 Psychology Studies of Christmas
On the first day of Christmas PsyBlog sent to me …12 psychology studies about Christmas ( and no partridges or pear trees ) .
1 . How to have a happy Christmas
We all want a happy Christmas ( or cultural equivalent ) , but how do we get it ?
This research into happiness and Christmas suggests that a focus on spending and consumption is associated with less happiness while family and religious experiences are associated with more happiness .
Not exactly earth - shattering , but satisfying to quote to little Billy when he complains about his presents .
2 . What ’s the best type of chocolate ?
Should we find ourselves unhappy at Christmas ( shock ! horror ! ) , perhaps a little chocolate will help rectify the situation ?
But what to choose for maximum pleasure : normal chocolate , milk chocolate or dark chocolate ?
For the answer we turn to the Chocolate Happiness Undergoing More Pleasantness study .
That ’s right , the CHUMP study .
It ’s a real thing , and it ’s a randomised controlled trial .
Unfortunately the results were inconclusive so you ’ll be forced to conduct your own research .
3 . When gifts go wrong
Giving and receiving gifts can be a no -win situation .
We assume people close to us know us well enough to get us good gifts .
So when a bad gift comes it tends to reflect poorly on the relationship .
However men and women seem to have different psychological defence mechanisms for dealing with poor gifts : women pretend the gift is just what they ’ve always wanted whereas men are more likely to say what they think .
And then the arguments start .
4 . Do n’t give money !
And talking of poor gifts , this study finds money is probably a bad gift perhaps because it can’t send a meaningful message about intimacy and tends to send the wrong message about status differences .
Perhaps that ’s why it seems to be OK to give money to children , but not adults .
5 . It ’s all about the giving
As you know , Christmas is not about the getting , it ’s all about the giving .
This neat research found that spending money on others promotes our own happiness better than spending money on ourselves .
6 . What do your decorations say about you ?
Research suggests that decorations on a home ’s exterior make other people think you ’re more sociable and perhaps more integrated with the community and with its social activities .
But make sure you do n’t tip over into ‘ Christmas lighting addiction ‘ .
7 . The smell of Christmas
It ’s the season of rampant commercialism and the shops have gone into overdrive .
Christmas music has been playing everywhere for months , but have you encountered any Christmas smells ?
According to this study Christmas music interacts with Christmas scents to boost our attitudes to stores and increase our likelihood of visiting them .
I ca n’t help wondering what a ‘ Christmas smell ’ is though …
8 . Good food is mostly in the mind
We all do a lot of eating at Christmas but does the chef get enough credit ?
Brian Wansink , a food psychologist , describes all sorts of cool tricks for boosting people ’s perceptions of the food they are eating .
It ’s all about harnessing the ‘ halo effect ‘ .
Leave parsley and chervil lying around , talk about the organic turkey farmer you know , use evocative labels for the food you ’re serving , tell them the wine is first rate , even if it ’s all just talk .
9. Hallucinating
This is n’t alcohol related but a neat little study where participants were asked to listen to white noise and press a button when they heard Bing Crosby singing ‘ White Christmas ’ .
Almost one - third of the participants pressed the button at least once despite the noise being white - only with not a hint of Christmas .
To the researchers this suggested a link between auditory hallucinations and being prone to fantasy .
To me it suggests too much time spent in department stores .
10 . Searching for the Christmas spirit
Again , not alcohol related but a asking the question : what exactly is the ‘ Christmas spirit ’ ?
According to this survey of 450 people , the Christmas spirit has five components : bonhomie , gay abandon , ritual , shopping and little bit of dejection .
Yup , sounds about right to me .
11 . Bad jokes
The unholy union of Christmas and bad jokes can be blamed on Londoner Thomas J. Smith who in 1847 invented the Christmas cracker .
Almost none of us find the jokes inside funny as an online survey of 2,000 people has confirmed .
The top rated joke raised a reluctant smile in just 12 % of people .
For posterity here it is : “ What do you call a penguin in the Sahara desert ?
Lost . ” * GROAN *
12 . Santa Claus
This study asks why we persist in promoting the myth of Santa Claus to children .
From the 318 parents surveyed , they found that it ’s the myth and magic in the story that we like .
I do n’t understand all this talk of myth and magic though , Santa Claus is clearly real .
Season ’s Greetings !
Merry Christmas and season ’s greetings to you all and thank you for the kind emails and support throughout the year .
Squealing tires and the crunch of impact – when an accident occurs , the steel sheets that form a motor vehicle ’s bodywork must provide adequate impact protection and shield its passengers to the greatest extent possible .
But the strength of the steels that are used throw up their own challenges , for example when automobile manufacturers have to punch holes in them for cable routing .
Struggling to pierce the hard steel , mechanical cutting tools rapidly wear out .
And because they also leave some unwanted material on the underside of the steel ( burr , as the experts call it ) , additional time has to be spent on a finishing process .
One possible alternative is to use lasers as cutters , but they require a great deal of energy , which makes the entire process time - consuming and costly .
Working together with a number of partners including Volkswagen , researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU in Chemnitz have come up with another way to make holes in press - hardened steel bodywork .
Dr. Verena Kräusel , head of department at the IWU , explains : “ The new method is based on electromagnetic pulse technology ( EMPT ) , which was previously used primarily to expand or neck aluminum tubes .
We ’ve modified it to cut even hard steels .
Whereas a laser takes around 1.4 seconds to cut a hole , EMPT can do the job in approximately 200 milliseconds – our method is up to seven times faster . ”
Another advantage is that it produces no burr , thus doing away with the need for a finishing process .
Stamping presses become superfluous , and no costs arise from the need to replace worn - out parts .
The pulse generators comprise a coil , a capacitor battery , a charging device and high - current switches .
When the switch closes , the capacitors discharge via the coil within a matter of microseconds , producing a high pulsed current .
The coil converts the energy stored in the capacitors into magnetic energy .
To be able to use this process to cut steel , the researchers simply had to modify the coil to ensure the resulting electromagnetic field is strong enough : the pressure with which the field hits the steel must be so high that it forcibly expels the material from the sheet .
“ The impact pressure on the steel is approximately 3,500 bar , which equates to the weight of three small cars on a single fingernail , ” says Kräusel .
PSTproducts GmbH in Alzenau provided the original EMPT system .
With regard to the customer demands the researchers develop now the coils for various cutting geometries .
I just finished listening to an excellent Doctor Who audio book entitled , The Forever Trap .
I ’m typically more of a full - cast audio drama fan , but this particular audio book really impressed me .
The story was written by Dan Abnett ( yes , that Dan Abnett of Marvel Comics Nova , Annihilation , War of Kings , etc ) , read by Catherine Tate ( Donna Noble on Doctor Who ) , and features the Tenth Doctor and Donna .
This two - disc story was released in the same format as the other BBC Books Tenth Doctor Adventures audio book adaptations , but this one was released exclusively to audio .
It is the second of its kind , preceded by Pest Control and followed by The Nemonite Invasion .
I ’ve listened to Pest Control , which was read by David Tennant , but it failed to impress me .
Even with David Tennant reading the story , it still did n’t feel like proper Doctor Who .
Needless to say , after that I did n’t have high hopes for The Forever Trap .
As I had expected , I was disappointed within the first few minutes of The Forever Trap .
Right out of the gate , Catherine Tate provides an unbelievable voice for the role of a holographic salesman .
I was so turned off by that voice , I gave up listening for a while .
A few days later , I started the audio book again .
Wow !
Sure , that salesman voice is n’t great , but the rest of the audio book was fantastic !
I could visualize the Doctor perfectly thanks to an excellent script by Dan Abnett , and Catherine Tate totally nailing David Tennant ’s speech patterns .
Did I already say “ Wow ” ?
Well , I gotta say it again .
WOW !
This is proper Doctor Who .
Abnett clearly gets the Doctor and Donna both .
Also , his talent for writing good science fiction really shines through .
Kudos to Catherine
Tate for doing such an outstanding job !
She effortlessly switches between the abrasive Donna , the energetic Doctor , and a wide array of other characters .
I did n’t realize what an amazing range she has .
I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this audio book , more so than most other Doctor Who audio books .
Apparently The Nemonite Invasion is also read by Catherine Tate , so now I ’m gonna have to track that one down too !

With trade and commerce drawing ever larger numbers of foreigners to China ’s cities , tensions have become more common in a country of little racial diversity .
This summer , African immigrants , mostly traders and merchants , who make up a growing enclave in the city of Guangzhou , protested police harassment .
And in a well - publicized cultural moment , a 20 - year - old Shanghainese contestant named Lou Jing , who appeared on the Chinese “ Idol ” - like talent show , caused a national debate ( and drew racist attacks on the Internet ) about what it means to be Chinese .
Lou , the daughter of a Chinese woman and an African - American man , whom she has not met , considers herself completely Chinese .
As China expands economic ties with the rest of the world — including Africa , where it has considerable investments — how might increased immigration alter Chinese perceptions of race ?
How has the society historically dealt with ethnic differences ?
Millennia of Multiethnic Contradictions
Yan Sun , a professor of political science at the City University of New York , is the author of “ A Sichuan Family and Tibet ’s Future ” and “ My Han Relatives ’ Views from Xinjiang . ”
She is co-writing a book about ethnic relations in contemporary China .
When it comes to ethnic relations and perceptions , China is a paragon of contradictions : its majority ethnic group , the Hans , are non-racist in the sense that most are not aware of their own multiethnic background and care little about it .
The surname of the Chinese leader Hu Jintao is multiethnic in origin , meaning “ foreign , barbarian . ”
But they hold prejudices , not only about China ’s minorities and foreigners but also about members of their own group , in that those deemed more “ developed ” receive deference , while those deemed “ backward ” are looked down upon .
If Western racism is about genetic dispositions , Chinese prejudices and racism are more about achievements and standing in the world as applied to individuals or groups .
Unlike Korea and Japan , China has long been a melting pot .
The Han people , now the largest ethnic group on Earth , originated from the central plains of East Asia and was expanded by nomadic invaders from the steppes of inner , central and Western Asia .
Driven by their hunger for the wealth of the settled villages and aided by mounted archery , the nomads periodically toppled the Chinese states and controlled them , becoming in the process fused and assimilated with the agrarian people .

Tibetan and Uighur diasporas may wonder nowadays if China could ever have an ethnic minority like Barack Obama as its top leader ?
The answer is simple : there have been many .
Of China ’s two dozen imperial dynasties , most founding rulers were non-Han or only partly Han .
The Shatuo Turks , related to the Uighurs , founded three post - Tang dynasties .
The Xiongnu , Xianbei , Khitan , Jurchen , and Qiang groups founded major dynasties in the North and the West .
And twice , under the Mongols and Manchus respectively , the nomads conquered and ruled the whole of China .
The China we know today is a product of their conquests : to prevent nomadic rivals rising on their flank , the Mongols and Manchus ruthlessly brought all of China ’s surrounding prairies and plateaus under their rule , including Tibet .
The Northern people of present - day China are tall and lighter - skinned , thanks to fusion with the steppe peoples .
The southern Chinese are descended from people from the central plains ( pushed south by nomadic invasions ) and southern tribal groups .
In an ironic twist , the coastal areas of the South and East –- once inhabited by the so - called Southern and Eastern “ barbarians , ” and the Northern cities around Beijing –- once the hub of Northern “ barbarians ” –- are now considered the most “ advanced . ”
The central plains of China , the birthplace of the agrarian people , are among the least developed among Han regions .
Most Chinese would be surprised that Hu , the surname of the Chinese leader Hu Jintao , is multiethnic in origin .
Hu , meaning “ foreign , barbarian , ” used to designate the nomads east of the Xiongnus ( Huns ) .
Some assimilated groups came to adopt “ Hu ” as a surname , although this is one of its several origins .
My mother ’s last name , Ma ( meaning “ horse ” ) is another multiethnic surname .
“ Of ten Mas , ” so goes a Chinese saying , “ nine are Muslims ” ( this Ma is derived from Muhammad ) .
But most of my mother ’s relatives think it silly to trace the exact origin of their Ma .
While this ability to blend made China ’s melting pot possible , it can also be a barrier to ethnic sensitivities .
As market and globalizing forces cause the Chinese to interact more with minorities at home and foreigners from abroad , conflict will be inevitable but so is progress .
A Liberian singer won second place in the CCTV’s Star Walk ( a variant of the American Idol ) in 2006 .
A Sierra Leonese won fourth place in 2007 .
Both are beloved by the Chinese audience and recently , both appeared as judges on the show .
Chauvinism and Nationalism
Ho-fung Hung is a historical sociologist and a senior associate of the Research Center for Chinese Business and Politics at Indiana University .
He is the editor of “ China and the Transformation of Global Capitalism , ” and the forthcoming “ Protest with Chinese Characteristics . ”
Today ’s racialist self - perception of Han Chinese can be traced back to the rise of Chinese nationalism amidst the chaotic collapse of the Qing empire in 1911 .
The Qing empire was multi-ethnic and ruled by the Manchus .
Rising chauvinism is a menace to China ’s internal stability and its cooperation with other countries .
Many Han Chinese revolutionaries , influenced by racial Darwinism from the West , advocated the expulsion of the “ barbaric ” Tartars ( a vague racial category referring to the Manchus and other Central Eurasian peoples ) and the restoration of “ superior ” Han rule as a path to China ’s resurgence .
Han nationalists justified the subordination of non-Han peoples in modern China by their “ backwardness ” and need to modernize under Han ’s tutelage .
Persistent prejudice against ethnic minorities caused Mao repeatedly to warn of the danger “ Han chauvinism ” posed to the unity of the newborn People ’s Republic in the 1950s .
The Communists , however , failed to eradicate such prejudices , but hid them under the language of class struggle , conveniently denouncing all minorities ’ quests for cultural autonomy as reactionary demands for resurrecting backward social systems ( like Tibet ’s “ slavery ” ) .

State propaganda glorified Chinese solidarity with dark - skinned foreigners as comrades in the struggle against Western imperialism , repressing whatever racial prejudices that ordinary Chinese might have against these peoples .
These prejudices resurfaced in the post - Mao years , unleashing the protests and racial violence against African students in many universities on the eve of the 1989 student movement .
They also contribute to the xenophobic interpretation of Tibetans ’ and Uighurs ’ resentments as pure fabrications by “ hostile foreign forces . ”
China ’s economic success , the government ’s promotion of nationalism , and large - scale internal and international migrations have increased Han interaction and frictions with other ethnic or racial groups and intensified Han chauvinism in recent years .
This chauvinism , as a menace to China ’s internal stability and its cooperation with other countries , is a twin of the century - old Han-centric Chinese nationalism .
It needs to be transformed into a more cosmopolitan form based on values and cultures rather than ethnic identity .
Inclusion and Rapid Change
Zai Liang is a professor of sociology and director of the Urban China Research Network at the University at Albany , SUNY .
China ’s encounter with foreigners is not new .
This is especially true for Chinese who live in the coastal region .
What distinguishes today ’s Chinese experience is the unprecedented scale and diverse number of countries and regions involved .
The language barrier is a huge obstacle for understanding between Chinese people and new migrants , but that can change .
In today ’s world , this encounter is a two - way street , with many Chinese migrating to other countries and citizens of other countries moving to China for economic or educational opportunities .
Race matters in China , as it does in the U.S. , with foreigners and immigrants of darker skin often treated poorly .
This is true despite the warm relationship between China and African countries during the Mao era .
Another factor for tension is the language barrier , which is complicated by the fact that many local people speak regional dialects rather than Mandarin .
This has created a huge obstacle for understanding between Chinese people and those who do n’t speak Chinese .

As a result some businesses transactions — and even some rental contracts — are done in English .
A good command of Chinese language would go a long way in resolving issues such as disputes with neighbors or dealings with law enforcement agencies .
One of the challenges that China faces now is the rise in undocumented migrants or visa over - stayers .
We have already seen this play out in the case of Africans in Guangzhou and this is likely to become a bigger issue as China ’s growth attracts more people from abroad .
At a fundamental level , I do not expect overwhelming difficulties of integrating foreigners into the Chinese society .
China is a huge country with a long history of interacting with other groups within its borders and beyond , and it includes over 50 minority groups with different languages and religions .
The past 30 - year history of opening up shows that Chinese culture can be inclusive .
Learning From the West
Dongyan Blachford , associate professor of Chinese studies , is associate dean in the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research at the University of Regina , Canada .
Growing up in Beijing , as a member of the Han majority , I did not see China as a country which exhibited racial discrimination ; after all , the mission of the Chinese revolution was to build a class - free and egalitarian society .
As a result of living abroad , many Chinese returnees have developed new perspectives on minority rights .
However , after having lived outside China for over 20 years , and having experienced and witnessed discrimination in various forms , I now realize that many in China are simply unaware of the racism and prejudice that exists .
Among the Han Chinese themselves a judgment is often made in a split second based on people ’s looks , places of residence , types of employment , parents ’ titles , or who their relatives are .
As for foreigners , they may also be subject to hasty judgment ; blacks are often associated with backwardness and poverty , whites with money , advanced technology and even beauty .
The attitude towards China ’s non-Han ethnic groups is more complex : they are often viewed as inferior , but they are still considered insiders .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama ’s administration is creating impunity for senior officials of former President George W. Bush accused of authorizing torture , the American Civil Liberties Union said on Thursday .
As Obama accepted the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo , the ACLU , which has pursued nearly a dozen cases against the U.S. government since 2003 related to prisoner abuse , accused him of failing to provide accountability on torture .
“ We ’re increasingly disappointed and alarmed by the current administration ’s stance on accountability for torture , ” said ACLU National Security Project Director Jameel Jaffer .
“ The administration is actively obstructing accountability . ”
Obama said in April that CIA interrogators who had used waterboarding -- a form of simulated drowning -- on suspected militants will not face prosecution and he released Bush - era memos specifying that the practice did not constitute torture .
Republicans criticized Obama ’s release of the memos , saying it left the door open for the prosecution of former Bush officials who authorized severe CIA interrogations .
But the ACLU said Obama was instead preventing any investigations through his pledge to look forward and not review the past .
Jaffer said Obama deserved credit for disavowing torture and closing secret CIA detention sites abroad .
“ But this administration is also shielding Bush administration officials from civil liability , criminal investigation and even public scrutiny for their role in authorizing torture , ” Jaffer said .
“ The Bush administration constructed a legal framework for torture .
Now the Obama administration is constructing a legal framework for impunity . ”
“ CERTAIN RULES OF CONDUCT ”
During his Nobel acceptance speech , Obama said the United States must uphold moral standards when waging wars that were necessary and justified .
“ Where force is necessary , we have a moral and strategic interest in binding ourselves to certain rules of conduct , ” Obama said .
By pledging to close the Guantanamo Bay prison for suspected militants in Cuba and moving to bring them to trial on U.S. soil , Obama has tried to recover the moral high ground that critics accused Bush of surrendering by waging a no-holds - barred war on terrorism .
The ACLU said a U.S. court needed to rule definitively on the legality of actions by the Bush administration to avoid a repeat of any mistakes in the future and that senior officials must be held accountable to ensure the credibility of the United States .
“ The lesson that this is giving to the rest of the world is that countries do not have to be accountable for their actions even when torture and abuse occurs , ” said Christopher Anders , ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel .
“ That ’s going to make it much more difficult for the United States to push other countries on human rights issues across the board and it ’s going to make it much easier for other countries to shirk their own duties to bring accountability for their own actions in the past . ”

The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals handed down an opinion on Friday overturning one of the main charges in the federal case against Mississippi trial attorney Paul Minor and judges John Whitfield and Wes Teel .
The three men were convicted on bribery and honest services fraud charges in 2007 , in what many Minor supporters have called political prosecutions .
In 2008 , the Bush administration even opposed MInor ’s request to be released from prison long enough to visit his dying wife .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Circuit Court began considering Minor ’s appeal in May of this year .
The three - judge panel expressed skepticism at the governments ’ case during oral arguments .
Raw Story ’s award - nominated series , The Permanent Republican Majority ( see links below ) , exposed some of the issues in the cases of Minor , Whitfield , and Teel , who were prosecuted starting in 2003 by a Bush - appointed US Attorney , along with former Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Oliver Diaz , Jr .
On July 25 , 2003 , three months before the Mississippi gubernatorial election , in a case that would stun the legal community , Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Oliver Diaz Jr. , Paul Minor , former chancery court judge Wes Teel and former circuit court judge John Whitfield were indicted on charges of bribery , relating to loan guarantees that Minor had made to the three judges to help defray campaign costs .
There was no state law prohibiting Minor ’s contributions , and his trial resulted in an acquittal on some charges and a deadlocked jury on others .
However , this trial was immediately followed by the unsealing of fresh charges .
The case was brought the US Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi , Dunnica Lampton , who had been appointed by President George W. Bush despite being under investigation by the FEC .
Minor , Whitfield and Teel were acquitted on some of the charges , Diaz on all of the charges , but all four men were soon indicted again by Lampton .
The prosecution was unable to prove bribery during the first trial .
The second jury , however , was instructed by Republican - appointed judge Henry Wingate that quid pro quo need not be proven in order to establish bribery .
As a result , Minor , Whitfield and Teel were convicted , though Diaz was again acquitted .
ADVERTISEMENT
Today ’s opinion addresses the primary charge of bribery and the three counts related to it .
The secondary charges remain .
All three man have had their sentences fully vacated and must appear in front of Judge Wingate to receive new sentences .
The 36 - page opinion states :
A jury found all three appellants guilty of conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 ; mail , wire , and honest services fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 , 1343 , 1346 , and 2 ; and federal pro gram bribery in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 666 .
Additionally , Minor was convicted of racketeering in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ) , 18 U.S.C. § 1962 .
Appellants appeal their convictions and sentences on numerous grounds .
For the following reasons , we VACATE all the convictions related to federal program bribery under 18 U.S.C. § 666 , including the conviction of Minor and Teel for conspiracy to violate section 666 .
We AFFIRM all other convictions , and we REMAND for resentencing as to all appellants in accordance with this opinion .

Columbia law professor Scott Horton has been following this case closely and provided the following comment :
The charges against Minor and the two Mississippi judges , Wes Teel and John Whitfield , fell into two categories : bribery and honest services fraud .
The Fifth Circuit ’s decision reviews all the facts in the light most favorable to the Justice Department , and it even adopts a tendentious and harsh tone in talking about Minor and his co-defendants .
But it also concludes–as I think it had to –that the facts the Justice Department claimed did not make out a case of bribery .
That left the honest - services fraud count standing , so the Court vacated the sentences and is referring the case back for resentencing .
But I do n’t think there will be any need for that .
Why ?
Because on Monday the Supreme Court heard argument on whether the honest - services fraud statute is constitutional .
And tallying up the comments made by the justices at the argument , it ’s clear that a solid majority of the justices think the honest - services fraud statute is unconstitutional .
Moreover , Justice Breyer went out of his way to ridicule the way the Justice Department was applying it , and his criticism , and Justice Scalia ’s , goes right to what the prosecutors did in the Minor case .
It will take a few months for this to work its way out , but it ’s clear that Minor and his co-defendants are on their way home .
This outcome also raises serious questions about the conduct of the trial judge .
He failed even to rule on motions for release pending appeal .
And it now appears that the convictions had no merit .
The result is that these three defendants were forced to serve jail time on meritless convictions , all thanks to Judge Henry Wingate , who sat on their motions for release pending appeal .
His conduct handling these cases deserves some very close scrutiny , because it suggests a lack of judicious temperament at nearly every stage .

Minor ’s attorney , Hiram Eastland Jr , was not immediately available for comment .
According to his office , he is en route to deliver the good news to Minor in person .

Correction : Judge Wingate ’s first name is Henry , not John , as appeared in an earlier edition of this article .
Just got off another blogger conference call , this time with Howard Dean , former CIGNA exec Wendell Potter , and Mike Lux .
Dean announced the results of a DFA poll that is " really quite stunning , " he said .
( You can read the results here . )
The Senate cloture vote is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. on Christmas Eve , he said .
Democracy for America 's " No Option , No Mandate " campaign to contact Harry Reid clocked 7000 calls in four hours , too , he said .
Dr. Dean opened the call by saying " this bill has always been a giveaway to the insurance industry , but we were willing to compromise " to get the public option .
He recapped all the compromises we made : " We wanted single payer , but that was taken off the table early on .
That was a mistake .
We had to get to the place where we had health insurance for all Americans . "
But now , he said , there 's no public option , and no Medicare option .
" You 're forced to pay money to an insurance company or get fined $ 750 by your government , while 27 % of your money goes to CEOs who are flying around in these private jets , " he said .
He talked about the compromises made for pre-existing conditions , the most disturbing one the ability to charge you 300 % more , merely for being older .
" It 's guaranteed issue , but if you ’re making $ 65,000 a year for a family of four and you ’re paying $ 20,000 for insurance , how is that reform ? "
He said the real bad stuff in the Senate bill was
" hidden in the weeds , so you ca n’t find it . "
Dr. Dean brushed aside the " Get a bill , any bill " mentality in Washington .
" Any legislation passed will have a huge impact on American healthcare .
If they ca n’t fix it , it should n’t pass . "
Wendell Potter , former CIGNA executive and reform activist , said the insurance industry got " every single thing they wanted " in the Senate bill .
" There 's no individual mandate , no public option .
There 's also three words , ' benefit design flexibility ' in Senate bill – that means the freedom to design plans that will pass more and more of us into ranks of the underinsured - and charge up to 22 % of income if someone gets sick , " he said .
In Massachusetts , they have a 2 to 1 premium ratio , " and they 're already having trouble finding affordable , adequate insurance .
The industry wants to shift even more costs to individuals and families , having the government pay them half a trillion dollars .
The Senate bill meets every one of their requirements , " Potter said .
" They will continue to shift the cost burden to consumers and get around not using preexisting conditions by charging for certain factors like high cholesterol . "
Dr. Dean pointed out the House bill " is the compromise , we did n’t think it was right to take the option of an employer - based system away if people liked it . "
In Vermont , he said , you can't be charged more than double the lowest premium .
Dean listed some more of the insurance company wish list the Senate was so eager to fill .
" Getting rid of the anti-trust provision .
This contributes to the predatory effect of the insurance companies – they 're essentially unregulated .
We need to get the provision in , get them regulated .
Wendell Potter talked about something you often hear pushed from the Republican side : " Just let us sell across state lines and let the market decide . "
As he points out , insurers would go to the states with least regulation .
Paul Hogarth from Daily Kos asked them to address criticism that if the bill is killed , " there 's no reform and we ’re worse off , the momentum is gone . "
" I do n’t know that we ’ll be worse off , " Dr. Dean said .
" We ought to strip down this bill and get rid of the mandate .
It should have been done by reconciliation . "
He said there were " some good things in this bill – money for community health centers , " and other project .
But he rejected the idea that killing the bill is the same as stopping reform .
" The idea that the legislation wo n’t pick this up for another 20 years is ridiculous .
It ’s a different time , we 're in a crisis , " he said .
The doctor said " Democrats are n’t tough enough .
Use reconciliation like George Bush did - they used it 23 times . "
McJoan from Daily Kos asked about the Stupak amendment .
Dean predicted it would n't be passed .
" I think the bill ’s dead if Stupak ’s in it .
I ca n’t believe the women of the House will let it go through . "
I asked about the plans to increase state authority to regulate insurers that were discussed in Wednesday 's White House call , and both Dr. Dean and Potter cautioned against it .
" You have to ask this question : What would George Bush do in this situation ?
Nobody ’s thinking about what will happen 15 years from now , " Dr. Dean said .
" Who will be writing the regulations ?
How will this be handled when there ’s a Republican administration ? "
Potter said .
Unintended consequences – having to buy insurance , have to have the ability to market products to keep people underinsured .
Have to buy products they do n’t want to buy , often for inadequate coverage .
John Odom asked : " Looking at the rhetoric of the past few days , how much is driven by egos and pure pique ? "
Dr. Dean said the press attitude is " one of the reasons why I stay completely out of the personality stuff .
The press would like nothing more , and it does n’t get us to a better health care bill .
It 's heading us in the wrong direction . "
" I ’d never speculate on anyone ’s motives , " Potter said .
But , he said , " There is a very little understanding of how the commercial insurance industry operates . "
" It 's a lot less about personality than it is about lobbyists being successful in driving the agenda here , " Mike Lux added .
If we stripped the bill , what ’s salvageable ?
" Recissions , preexisting conditions , accountability , more information about how companies operate , awareness of what we ’re buying – ca n’t shift costs onto consumers , " Potter said .
" Real community rating , restore restrictions on cost control , insure by 2012 , pay more of Medicare share , not the states , expanding Medicaid to everyone under 26 .
Make sure any federal regulations – the tougher regulations of the home state take precedence , " Dr. Dean said .
We ended with a discussion of Medical Loss Ratio , the amount of each premium dollar spent on medical care .
" It 's dropping and dropping , " Potter said .
He said we want a mandated amount , " or we will continue to see companies shifting premium dollars to investors . "
Dr. Dean reminded us the MLR's " not in there , the CBO ruled you ca n’t do that . "
Can you require that any insurer in the exchange meet a minimum MLR ?
I asked .
Dr. Dean said no .
" But what you can do is Kerry ’s amendment :
It gives state exchange managers the authority and the duty to look at highest MLR for consumers . "
" Or at least require them to disclose it under standard definitions , " Potter said .
Blind listening tests
Many experiments have proven that audible differences that listeners can hear between audio sources are sometimes the product of imagination .
These illusions can be strong , durable , shared by many listeners , and consistently associated with the knowledge of the audio source that is listened to .
A Double Blind listening Test ( DBT ) is a listening setup that allows to confirm that a given audible difference is indeed caused by the audio sources , and not just by the listener 's impressions .
In an ABX double blind listening test , the listener has access to three sources labeled A , B , and X . A and B are the references .
They are the audio source with and without the tweak .
For example the wav file and the MP3 file .
X is the mystery source .
It can be A or B .
The listener must guess it comparing it to A and B.
But if the listener says that X is A , and that X is actually A .
What does this prove ?
Nothing of course .
If you flip a coin in my back and a state that it 's heads , and I 'm right , it does n't prove the existence of my para - psychic abilities that allow me to see what 's in my back .
This is just luck , nothing more !
That 's why a statistical analysis is necessary .
Let 's imagine that after the listener has given his answer , the test is run again , choosing again X at random 15 times .
If the listener gives the correct answer 16 times , what does it prove ?
Can it be luck ?
Yes it can , and we can calculate the probability for it to happen .
For each test , there is one chance out of two to get the right answer , and 16 independant tests are run .
The probability to get everything correct by chance is then 1/2 at the power 16 , that is 1/65536 .
In other words , if no difference is audible , the listener will get everything correct one time out of 65536 in average .
We can thus choose the number of trials according to the tweak tested .
The goal being to get a success probability inferior to the likelihood , for the tweak , to actually have an audible effect .
For example if we compare two pairs of speakers .
It is likely that they wo n't have the same sound .
We can be content doing the test 7 times .
There will be 1 chance out of 128 to get a " false success " .
In statistics , a " false success " is called a " type I error " .
The more the test is repeated , the less type I errors are likely to happen .
Now , if we put an amulet besides a CD player .
There is no reason that it changes the sound .
We can then repeat the test 40 times .
The success of probability will then be one out of one trillion ( 2 to the power 40 ) .
If it ever happens , there is necessarily an explanation : the listener hears the operator moving the amulet , or the operator always takes more time to launch the playback once the amulet is away , or maybe the listener perceives a brightness difference through his eyelids if it is a big dark amulet , or he can smell it when it is close to the player ...
Let p be the probability of getting a success by chance .
It is generally admitted that a result whose p value is inferior to 0.05 ( one out of 20 ) should be seriously considered , and that p < 0.01 ( one out of 100 ) is a very positive result .
However , this must be considered according to the context .
We saw that for very suspectful tweaks , like the amulet , it is necessary to get a very small p value , because between the expected probability for the amulet to work ( say one out of a billion , for example ) , and the probability for the test to succeed by chance ( 1 out of 100 is often chosen ) , the choice is obvious : it 's the test that succeeded by chance !
Here 's another example where numbers can fool us .
If we test 20 cables , one by one , in order to know if they have an effect on the sound , and if we consider that p < 0.05 is a success , then in the case where no cable have any actual effect on the sound , since we run 20 tests , we should all the same expect in average one accidental success among the 20 tests !
In this case we can absolutely not tell that the cable affects the sound with a probability of 95 % , even while p is inferior to 5 % , since anyway , this success was expected .
The test failed , that 's all .
But statistic analyses are not limited to simple powers of 2 .
If , for example , we get 14 right answers out of 16 , what happens ?
Well it is perfectly possible to calculate the probability that it happens , but mind that what we need here is not the probability to get exactly 14 / 16 , but the probability to get 16 / 16 , plus the one to get 15 / 16 , plus the one to get 14 / 16 .
An Excel table gives all needed probabilities : http://www.kikeg.arrakis.es/winabx/bino_dist.zip .
It is based on a binomial distribution .
Now , how to setup the listening test so that its result , if positive , is really convincing ?
There are rules to observe if you do n't want , in case of a success , have all your opponent laugh at you .
Rule 1 : It is impossible to prove that something does n't exists .
The burden of the proof is on the side of the one pretending that a difference can be heard .
If you believe that a codec changes the sound , it is up to you to prove it , passing the test .
Someone pretending that a codec is transparent can't prove anything .
2 . The test should be performed under double blind conditions (* ) .
In hardware tests , this is the most difficult requirement to meet .
Single blind means that you can't tell if X is A or B otherwise than listening to it .
Double blind means that nobody in the room or the imediate surrounding can know if X is A or B , in order to avoid any influence , even unconcious , on the listener .
This complicates the operations for hardware testing .
A third person can lead the blindfolded listener out of the room while the hardware is switched .
High quality electronic switches have been made for double blind listening tests ( http://sound.westhost.com/abx-tester.htm ) : a chip chooses X at random , and a remote control allows to compare it to A and B at will .
Fortunately , in order to double blind test audio files on a computer , some ABX programs are freely available .
You can find some in our FAQ
3 . The p values given in the table linked above are valid only if the two following conditions are fulfilled :
- The listener must not know his results before the end of the test , exept if the number of trials is decided before the test .
...otherwise , the listener would just have to look at his score after every answer , and decide to stop the test when , by chance , the p value goes low enough for him .
- The test is run for the first time .
And if it is not the case , all previous results must be summed up in order to get the result .
Otherwise , one would just have to repeat the serial of trials as much times as needed for getting , by chance , a p value small enough .
Corollary : only give answers of which you are absolutely certain !
If you have the slightest doubt , do n't answer anything .
Take your time .
Make pauses .
You can stop the test and go on another day , buttry to guess by " intuition " .
If you make some mistakes , you will never have the occasion to do the test again , because anyone will be able to accuse you of making numbers tell what you want , by " starting again until it works " .
Of course you can train yourself as much times as you whish , provided that you firmly decide beforehand that it will be a training session .
If you get 50/50 during a training and then can't reproduce this result , too bad for you .
the results of the training sessions must be thrown away whatever they are , and the results of the real test must be kept whatever they are .
Once again , if you take all the time needed , be it one week of efforts for only one answer , in order to get a positive result at the first attempt , your success will be mathematically !
Only your hifi setup , or your blind test conditions may be disputed .
If , on the other hand , you run again a test that once failed , because since then , your hifi setup was improved , or there was too much noise the first time , you can be sure that there will be someone , relying on statistic laws , to come and question your result .
You will have done all this work in vain .
4 . The test must be reproducible .

(*)
The double blind setting may be replaced by a carefully set simple blind setting .
I saw two accounts of simple blind listening tests that failed , proving that , when done carefully , a simple blind setting is enough to fool the listener .
Anyone can post fake results .
For example if someone sells thingies that improve the sound , like oil for CD jewel cases of cable sheath , he can very well pretend to have passed a double blind ABX test with p < 0.00001 , so as to make people talk about his products .
If someone passes the test , others must check if this is possible , by passing the test in their turn .
We saw what is an ABX test , with the associated probability calculus , that is perfectly suited for testing the transparency of a codec , or the validity of a hifi tweak .
But this is only the ABC of statistic tests .
For example , in order to compare the quality of audio codecs like MP3 , in bigger scaled tests , ABC / HR test are used ( see http://ff123.net/abchr/abchr.html ) , that are more sophisticated .
Each listener has two sliders and three buttons for every audio codec tested .
A and B are the original and the encoded file .
The listener does n't know which one is which .
C is the original , that stands as a reference .
He must give , using the sliders , a mark between 1 and 5 to A and B , the original getting 5 in theory .
A probability calculation allows then not only to know if the tested codec audibly alters the sound , but also to estimate the relative quality of the codecs for the set of listeners involved , and this , still under double blind conditions , and with a probability calculus giving the relevance of the result .
These calculus , according to the needs of the test , can be performed with the Friedman method , for example , that gives a ranking for each codec , or also with the anova one , that gives an estimation of the subjective quality perceived by the listeners on the 1 to 5 scale .
Note that this kind of statistical analysis is mostly used in medicine , and that to get an authorization , any drug must prove its efficiency in double blind tests ( both the physicians and the patients ignore if the pill is a placebo or a medication ) against placebo ( the drug must not only prove that it works , but that it works better than a placebo , because a placebo alone works too ) , and the decision is based on mathematical analyses such as the one we just saw .
Thus they are not quickly made guidelines for hifi tests .
They are actually general testing methods used in scientific research , and they remain entirely valid for audio tests .

Aston Martin has announced a new compact car concept , the Cygnet .
Aston calls the car a “ luxury commuter concept , ” but that was n’t the biggest surprise in the news release .
The Cygnet , which means young swan , takes traditional Aston styling cues — big - mouth grille , alloy wheels and what appears to be carbon - fiber vents cut into the hood — and transposes them onto the petite proportions of the Toyota iQ city car .
At only 117.5 inches long , the iQ , which Toyota began selling in Japan and Europe late last year , is slightly longer than a Smart Fortwo .
Despite the Aston makeover , the Cygnet will still be powered by Toyota ’s 67 - horsepower 998 - cc 3 - cylinder engine — 353 horsepower shy of the Aston Martin V - 8 Vantage , a slinky $ 120,000 sport coupe that , until now , served as the brand ’s budget model .
The V - 8 Vantage can accelerate from zero to 60 miles an hour in 4.5 seconds .
The iQ takes roughly three times as long .
One obvious question is whether the whole thing is a joke .
After the number for the Aston Martin headquarters in Gaydon , England , was punched in , a polite spokesman said the Cygnet , while still a concept , is very much for real .
“ A lot of our customers have two , three or four cars in their garage , ” he explained .
Company research found that this fleet often includes at least one small car for zipping around town .
“ This concept — akin to an exclusive tender to a luxury yacht — will allow us to apply Aston Martin design language , craftsmanship and brand values to a completely new segment of the market , ” said Dr. Ulrich Bez , Aston Martin ’s chief executive , in a news release .
So seeking to capitalize on this niche within a niche market , Aston Martin came up with the Cygnet .
Based on trusty Toyota underpinnings , the production version could arrive by 2010 .
Prices and production numbers are not set , but , according to the Aston spokesman , the price could be around $ 33,000 .
The Toyota iQ starts at $ 15,800 in Britain .
Already having an Aston Martin sports car could help your chances even more because sales priority will be given to existing clientele .
Sales will initially be limited to Britain and Europe .
But Americans can take heart .
Scion could begin selling a version of the Toyota iQ in the United States as soon as late 2010 , reports Motor Trend .
It is likely to cost much less than the Cygnet .

So there ’s a video of actress Jessica Simpson which is burning up ( hahahahahahaha ! ) the internet right now .
Her friend gave her an ear candle for Christmas , and she ’s using it in the video :
I love this video , for a lot of reasons .
First , as should be obvious to anyone who prefers not to set their head on fire , ear candling is dangerous and ineffective .
Unless you ’re trying to set your head on fire .
Then it ’s very effective .
Second , Ms. Simpson clearly thinks this is a bad idea as well .
She titled the video " Who gives this kind of candle for a christmas gift ? " , and her reactions to it in the video is pretty clear .
I love how one purported benefit of ear candling is relief of vertigo , but Ms. Simpson complains of nausea constantly in the video .
Third , and related to the second , the video shows how painful and awful this procedure is .
It may set antiscience " alternative medicine " back a thousand years .
Which is where alt - med is anyway .
So I guess that ’s a wash .
Fourth , it makes me wonder if anyone has sent Ms. Simpson to this website .
I ’ll refrain from commenting on any potential video of that .
Fifth and finally , it gives me a chance once again to use this drawing , which has been lonely lately :
Giant Organic Livestock Operation Decertified by USDA
Federal Organic Enforcement Hammer Falls Hard to Protect Farmers / Consumers
WASHINGTON , DC :
In an investigation and legal case that dragged on for almost four years , one of the largest organic cattle producers in the United States , Promiseland Livestock , LLC , was suspended from organic commerce , along with its owner and key employees , for four years .
The penalty was part of an order issued by administrative law judge Peter Davenport in Washington , DC on November 25 .
Promiseland , a multimillion dollar operation with facilities in Missouri and Nebraska , including over 13,000 acres of crop land , and managing 22,000 head of beef and dairy cattle , had been accused of multiple improprieties in formal legal complaints , including not feeding organic grain to cattle , selling fraudulent organic feed and " laundering " conventional cattle as organic .
" We are pleased that justice has been served in the Promiseland matter , " said Mark A. Kastel , Senior Farm Policy Analyst for the Wisconsin - based Cornucopia Institute .
Scrutiny from Cornucopia , one of the industry 's most aggressive independent watchdogs , was part of the genesis for the comprehensive USDA investigation and subsequent legal proceedings .
Promiseland became the focus of Cornucopia 's investigation into giant factory farms , milking thousands of cows , that were allegedly operating illegally .
Promiseland sold thousands of dairy cows to giant factory dairy farms owned by Dean Foods ( Horizon Organic ) , Natural Prairie Dairy in Texas and Aurora Dairy based in Colorado .
Aurora and Natural Prairie supply private - label , store - brand milk for Wal - Mart , Costco , Target and major supermarket chains such as HEB , Safeway and Harris Teeter .
" It appears that it was the investigation into improprieties by Aurora that finally led to the hammer coming down on Promiseland , " Kastel observed .
Aurora operates five dairies in Texas and Colorado and was found by USDA investigators to have " willfully " violated 14 tenets of federal organic regulations in 2007 .
However , Bush administration officials let the $ 100 million corporate dairy continue in operation under a one - year probation .
" It 's sad that the civil servants at the USDA , who had recommended Aurora be decertified , were overruled , " Kastel lamented .
" They should have been banned from organic commerce the same way Promiseland , and its owner Tony Zeman , now have been . "
Although Cornucopia has praise for the professionalism of law enforcement agents at the USDA , and the career staff at the National Organic Program ( NOP ) , who carried out the Aurora and Promiseland investigations , the farm policy research group has harshly criticized past management at the USDA which allowed Promiseland , and Aurora , to operate illegally for years .
" From formal legal complaints that we filed , Bush Administration officials at the USDA were alerted , starting in January 2005 , to the alleged improprieties by massive factory farms masquerading as organic , " said Will Fantle , Research Director for The Cornucopia Institute .
Documents secured under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) by The Cornucopia Institute indicate that the initial investigation was squashed for political reasons by Dr. Barbara Robinson , who until recently directed the USDA 's organic program .
" It is inexcusable that these improprieties took place for so long and that justice was delayed , " said Gary Cox , an attorney who represents Cornucopia .
" Ethical organic dairy farmers have been placed at a distinct competitive disadvantage and consumers were obviously taken advantage of . "
An investigation by the Office of Inspector General at the USDA , focusing in part on the relationship between Robinson and prominent agribusiness lobbyist and lawyer Jay Friedman , was profiled in a July 3 Washington Post story .
Friedman , in addition to representing Aurora and Dean Foods , also was the lawyer for Promiseland when they were targeted by the USDA for investigation .
New documents made public have prompted Cornucopia to prepare additional legal complaints asking the USDA to focus attention now on Quality Assurance International ( QAI ) , the certifier for Promiseland when many of the alleged abuses took place .
" This is not the first time QAI has been suspected of incompetence or improperly accommodating corporate agribusiness , " said Fantle .
The Robinson , Friedman and QAI connection is part of an investigation by the USDA 's Inspector General .
QAI also certifies portions of Aurora 's operation and Dean Foods ' corporate - owned industrial dairies .
" However grim it sounds , this investigation and the legal proceeding illustrate that if organic stakeholders are persistent , the system works , " Kastel said .
Cornucopia and other organic policy groups have been delighted by what they have called a " decisive shift " that has taken place since Obama administration officials have taken over at the USDA and its organic program .
At a recent industry meeting in Washington , D.C. , Miles McEvoy , USDA Deputy Administrator and the new director of the National Organic Program , stated emphatically that we were now entering the " age of enforcement " at the NOP .

A couple hundred thousand years ago , the planet became a much colder and drier place .
In Africa , deserts expanded , species were wiped out and the human race was in deep trouble .
See , humans today may look pretty different from one another but , genetically speaking , there 's not much diversity at all within our species .
In fact , chimpanzees , which look pretty much the same from one individual to the next , are much more genetically diverse than we are .
To scientists , that suggests that humans have come through a genetic bottleneck–a point where our numbers shrunk dramatically , and a relatively small population had to rebuild the species .
For about 20 years , genetic anthropologists have been comparing the genes of modern human populations .
Over time , they 've used bigger and bigger samples , and better and better analysis , to hone in on when our bottleneck likely happened , and how many humans managed to slip through it .
Turns out , somewhere between 130,000 to 190,000 years ago , the human species was reduced to less than 1000 breeding individuals –just a few thousand people in total .
Ancient , naturally driven climate change pushed our species to the brink , said Curtis Marean , Ph.D. , a professor with the Institute of Human Origins and the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University .
What saved us ?
According to Marean , the answer may be " shellfish " .
" They 're a great source of protein , " he said .
" And shellfish are immune to colder ocean temperatures .
In fact , when the water gets colder , those populations go up . "
Marean used climate models to pinpoint locations in Africa where human hunter - gatherers could have hunkered down during a long glacial period that dried out the continent and expanded deserts .
Of the four - to - six possible locations , he focused in on an area along the coast of South Africa .
" That area has a super high diversity of below - ground tuberous plants , which have high carb loads .
People are excellent foragers for them .
You need a digging stick and there would n't be a lot of animal competitors , " he said .
" And the tuberous plants are adapted to arid environments . "
His team eventually found a site , dating to 164,000 years ago , that shows evidence of humans eating shellfish , working with natural pigments and creating technologically sophisticated tools .
He thinks this could be the remnants of the humans of the bottleneck –ancestors of everyone alive today .
Other researchers have theorized that eating shellfish was actually the driver that allowed humans to develop the big brains we enjoy today , because shellfish are high in the Omega 3 fatty acids that the brain needs to function .
But Marean thinks the big brain came first .
You can't just walk down to the beach and score yourself some sweet shellfish action ( at least , not enough to sustain a society ) without being pretty bright .
Ancient humans would have had to be able to do some pretty complex thinking about concepts like time , Marean said .
They would have to be able to make connections between unrelated things , like phases of the moon , tides and when shellfish were most plentiful .
And they'd have to be able to communicate all that to other people .
From Marean 's perspective , big brains enabled a small group of humans to make the switch to a shellfish diet–an adaptation that allowed them to survive a climactic upheaval that wiped out most of their peers .
Naturally , this all begs the question , " Could humans adapt to and survive modern , anthropogenic climate change as well ? "
Again , Marean thinks the answer lies in our food supply .
" These people were hunter - gatherers , and beauty of a hunting and gathering economy is that it 's very flexible .
If you use 80 plants and 14 animals , and you lose 10 plants and two animals , you can just shift your resources .
When you commit yourself to agriculture that has very narrow environmental parameters , and your whole population is dependent on that , slight changes in the environment can have catastrophic effects , " he said .
" I 'd say we have the cultural and technological ability to make a change and adapt .
But we need to get busy . "

Blocked hit the App Store in early September 2008 .
I had a modest amount of downloads at first .
And then , right after Christmas , sales jumped .
I ’m not sure what led to Blocked ’s being chosen as a staff favorite , but I know that once I started actively promoting it through advertising , Web forums , YouTube , and Twitter , I saw an increase in activity .
The other day I came across a post about being an iPhone developer .
It 's an interesting look inside the mind of someone who made some good money for a small amount of effort with a non-original idea .
I think the key part comes when he says :
In many ways the hard part comes after you 've created something .
Take my book , The Geek Atlas , for example .
I started writing it in May 2008 and spent 6 months full - time writing and researching .
I stopped working and just worked on the book .
In November 2008 , I handed the book to O'Reilly and in June of this year the book was published .
It was a lot of work by me ( and others ) to get the book out .
Now , do you think anyone cares how much work it was ?
Does any of that mean it 'll sell ?
No .
What matters is promotion .
I wrote it , it does n't mean people will buy it .
And the main reason they wo n't buy it is they 've never heard of it .
The same applies to the sales of iPhone apps .
There are over 25,000 iPhone apps and a small number of slots on the iTunes main page where you can see top apps or recommendations .
This is analogous to Amazon.com .
My book 's one of many , many books and it sure gets a boost when it's on one of Amazon 's top - N lists , but what really matters is promotion .
If you 've made the effort to create something , make the effort to promote it .
For example , my book was given lots of airtime by Leo Laporte and Steve Gibson on the Security Now # 199 podcast .
Last week there was an article in the San Francisco Chronicle about it and the same day there was another article in The Times ( of London ) .
All of these articles came about because I went out and promoted the book .
You can do the same for an iPhone app .
To get my book mentioned in as many high impact places as possible I made a list of every newspaper , magazine , blog and podcast I 'd like to see it in .
Then I went and found the relevant editor , blog owner , podcaster , etc .
I obtained their email addresses .
I wrote individual emails to every single one of them , tailored to their publication .
Those that responded got free review copies of the book .
In one case , the San Francisco Chronicle , they asked me to write an article for them about the book .
It was a lot of work to make those things happen , but the only way to make a creative work successful is for people to hear about it .
And it does n't end there .
The promotion continues to make sure that people actually received review copies .
To see if they have questions and know how to contact me ( I handed out my mobile phone number ) .
And I 've recorded videos promoting the book .
At some point I realized that O'Reilly was n't going to have the time to exploit the geekatlas.com domain name that I 'd persuaded them to buy .
So , I got it from them ( thank you ! ) and set up my own site there .
The site is all part of the promotion process .
Most recently I 've been asking people who 've read the book if they'd be willing to write reviews on Amazon .
That 's an important part of getting the book into people 's hands since I ( and everyone else ) reads the reviews .
I 've been doing this by asking people who mention the book on Twitter if they 'd write a review .
You can search geek atlas and see exactly what I and others have said .
( And , BTW , if you 've read it please consider writing an honest review on Amazon )
It 's not enough to create , you have to market .
PS I 've ignored all the wonderful efforts made by the staff of O'Reilly in promoting my book .
I did n't mean to downplay your work ...
I 'm just making a point about the effort it takes to get people to hear about The Geek Atlas .
Labels : rants and raves , the geek atlas
I am shocked , shocked to discover that US contractors bribed Iraqi government officials to overlook its misconduct ...
Really , does this surprise anyone when it comes to Blackwater ?
Top executives at Blackwater Worldwide authorized secret payments of about $ 1 million to Iraqi officials that were intended to silence their criticism and buy their support after a September 2007 episode in which Blackwater security guards fatally shot 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad , according to former company officials .
Blackwater approved the cash payments in December 2007 , the officials said , as protests over the deadly shootings in Nisour Square stoked long - simmering anger inside Iraq about reckless practices by the security company ’s employees .
American and Iraqi investigators had already concluded that the shootings were unjustified , top Iraqi officials were calling for Blackwater ’s ouster from the country , and company officials feared that Blackwater might be refused an operating license it would need to retain its contracts with the State Department and private clients , worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually .
----------
The four former Blackwater executives , who had held high - ranking posts at the company , would speak only on condition of anonymity .
Two of them said they took part in talks about the payments ; the two others said they had been told by several Blackwater officials about the discussions .
In agreeing to describe those conversations , the four officials said that they were troubled by a pattern of questionable conduct by Blackwater , which had led them to leave the company .
A senior State Department official said that American diplomats were not aware of any payoffs to Iraqi officials .
Of course the US government was blind to this - they did n't want to know , they turned a blind eye to what Blackwater was doing because it would have been too hard to arrange for another contractor to do all the security missions that it had ongoing .
In both Iraq and Afghanistan , there are as many private contractors as there are uniformed military personnel .
Most of them are not security guards as Blackwater 's most visible function was .
The lack of oversight is abhorrent but not surprising ; the State Dept 's failure to can this company is inexcusable .
My only observation on this article is to suggest how the US government got into this predicament , and it 's pretty easy to see .
The Bush administration wanted to hold onto the fiction of a few conservative principles , one of those being the concept of a small federal government .
Since it already blew that " principle " with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security , I 'm betting there was White House guidance that directed " no more personnel growth in DOD or State . "
That did n't mean that there was n't lots of work to be done , however .
The beans and the bullets still had to get out to the Middle East , and it was still dangerous Injun country for all those unarmed State Dept civilians doing Condi 's work out there .
So out come the sole source , cost - plus contracts for KBR , Haliburton , and Blackwater , adding tens of thousands of additional personnel to the mix .
The growth of contractors was n't only apparent overseas , it 's very apparent in the Washington DC area in support of larger defense contracts and operations ( confession : I is one of them ) .
Now SecDef
Gates is trying to flush out the system , and it 's going to prove much harder than he puts on in his speeches .
Everyone admits there 's a problem - but no one wants to create the necessary oversight mechanism to stop this misbehavior in the future .
Regulating industry is bad , do n't you know .
It 's a good thing that people insist that the government investigate important scandals like ACORN , is n't it ?
It 's your tax money , going to only the best and brightest that money can buy .
All of us go through different experiences in life .
Building long - term relationships can be difficult but it ’s not impossible .
Always have a positive approach towards life and you will meet the right person .
Happy relationships lead to increase in lifespan and bring contentment .
Improve your communication skills
Make sure that your partner understands you .
If the listener does not understand what you ’re saying then it gives rise to misunderstandings .
Communication is an aspect that is important at the workplace as well as home .
Stop worrying about your differences
Every person is different in his or her own way .
We need to accept our differences and adjust with each other .
Your perception about your partner matters the most .
Get rid of all the negative thoughts and misunderstandings and focus on building a good rapport with your partner .
Make them feel that you listen to them and understand what they are trying to say .
Spend quality time with your partner
You need to spend time with each other .
Without spending quality time you cannot expect to build a strong relationship .
Gifting your loved ones and going out on vacations helps in building memories .
Strong memories are the root of good relationships .
These memories are present in the form of photographs and gifts .
Balancing your work life with your personal life is very important .
Even if you have a stressful schedule you need to make sure that you take out some time for your family .
Limit the use of smartphones and other gadgets
In today ’s world , we are addicted to technology .
Smartphones and tablets keep us so busy that we forget to spend time with our family .
In order to have a good social life , you need to avoid social networks and smartphones .
Companies mention to the users that you need to visit our site for interacting with us but real - time interactions are always better than online interactions .
Interact with your family , go out for movies and spend more time with them instead of spending time on your smartphone .
A cheap catalyst can both generate hydrogen and release energy from it .
The new material could be a breakthrough that will allow the unpredictable energy flows from wind and solar farms to be stored .
As nations attempt to put their energy consumption in order , the need for better ways to store electrical power is becoming apparent : wind and solar power installations do n’t always provide power when it ’s most needed .
Batteries are one option – although they ’ll have to improve before they are practical for large - scale storage – but another is converting excess electricity into hydrogen and feeding it through a fuel cell later to generate electricity .
Now Vincent Artero at Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble , France , and colleagues at the Commission for Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies and the French National Center of Scientific Research have shown that a cheap catalyst could be used to both generate hydrogen to store energy , and also to consume it to extract stored power .
Until now , almost all hydrogen - generating catalysts have been made with the expensive metal platinum , making scaling up their use impractical .
A platinum - free catalyst for hydrogen formation was developed in 2006 , but it required water - free conditions that were incompatible with conventional methods of making the gas .
Advertisement
Artero and his colleagues have solved that problem , coating the platinum - free catalyst in a membrane that lets hydrogen ions reach the catalyst , but not water molecules .
Gas factory
The team attached the catalytic molecules to a carbon nanotube electrode and sealed it in the waterproof membrane .
Then they ran an electric current through the electrode and dipped it into dilute sulphuric acid .
They found that hydrogen ions from the watery acid solution travelled through the membrane to the catalyst , where they picked up electrons from the circuit to become hydrogen gas .
The team also found that the new design can work in reverse , to split up gaseous hydrogen into ions , and release electrons to provide power .
“ That ’s useful because the customer would buy just one device [ that can both generate and oxidise hydrogen ] , ” says Artero .
So far , though , the device ca n’t compete with the power output of a conventional platinum - catalysed fuel cell , although the team have n’t yet begun to optimise it for that use .
Right direction
Earlier this year Fraser Armstrong ‘s team at the University of Oxford showed how a bacterial enzyme – a hydrogenase – could perform a similar role .
“ The reversibility [ shown by the new system ] is important , as the system now resembles a hydrogenase , ” he says .
Some people think such enzymes will ultimately provide the best way to make hydrogen .
“ But their production can hardly be scaled up , and the enzymes require special conditions in terms of humidity , pH and temperature , ” says Artero , who thinks artificial catalysts will probably be the first to enable wide - scale use of hydrogen to store energy .

" To you from failing hands we throw The torch ; be yours to hold it high . "
There should be more regular visits between Canadian and Chinese leaders , Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Thursday after getting a mild chiding for waiting so long to visit the Asian country .
In Beijing for the first time to meet with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao , Harper was reminded that a Canadian prime minister had not visited in five years .
" Five years is too long a time for China - Canada relations and that 's why there are comments in the media that your visit is one that should have taken place earlier , " Wen said .
Harper also said he would like see Chinese leaders come to Canada more frequently .
" I think on both sides , more regular visits would make sense , " he said .
In an earlier meeting , Chinese President Hu Jintao also pointed out twice that it was Harper 's first visit .
Harper said it has been five years since a Chinese leader visited Canada .
Despite the gentle proddings , Harper 's visit to China seemed to be producing results .
In a joint communiqué , the countries said China will bestow the label of " preferred tourist destination " on Canada , a move that will make it easier for Chinese tourists to visit Canada .
China will also open a consulate in Montreal .
The statement only briefly mentioned the issue of human rights , saying the two sides agreed they had " distinct points of view . "
" We always make sure when we bring up these matters — whether they relate to particular cases that you ’re aware of in the newspaper that have been discussed from time to time , or whether they ’re broader questions such as the situation in Tibet — we always bring these up in a way that is frank , at the same time in a way that is respectful of Chinese sovereignty , " Harper said .
Cool relations
Relations between Canada and China have been cool in recent years as Harper has pressed the Chinese government to improve its record on human rights .
In their joint communiqué , the leaders pledged to keep discussing human rights , trade and investment , and to co-operate on " green " technology .
Commenting on the scolding from the Chinese leadership , Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said it was as though Harper " had received a slap in public " and that it will cost Canada jobs .
" He lost face today , " Ignatieff said .
" And in that culture , losing face is very important and I do think it 's cost Canada economic opportunity today . "
Liberal foreign affairs critic Bob Rae charged that Canada has paid a price for four years " of not just living on the margins , but actually , deliberately disregarding China . "
" This was a deliberate decision on [ Harper 's ] part to ignore the relationship and to assert that it had no particular importance for him , and I think we ’re now paying a very , very heavy price for that decision , " Rae told reporters on Parliament Hill .
In another development , a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman called on Canada to deport Lai Changxing , who is accused by China of running a smuggling empire that netted him more than $ 10 billion .
Changxing has taken refuge in Vancouver for the last nine years after fleeing China .
Chinese newspapers have taken a somewhat mixed tone toward Harper 's visit .
On Wednesday , the government - run China Daily ran a story touting Harper 's arrival as a sign that ties between the two countries may " thaw , " while another article described Harper 's visit as " late " but " still welcome . "
An editorial in the Global Times , a publication of the country 's Communist Party , accused Harper of criticizing the Chinese government to appease his electoral base and of turning " a cold shoulder to China . "
The bomb was n’t the only thing burning in his pants .
Internet postings from accused knicker - bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab reveal him to be a sex - starved , lonely , depressed man who felt shame over his carnal urges .
“ As i get lonely , the natural sexual drive awakens and i struggle to control it , sometimes leading to minor sinful activities like not lowering the gaze [ in the presence of unveiled women ] , ” a poster who goes by the handle “ Farouk1986 , ” wrote on an Islamic Forum Web site , gawaher.com .
“ And this problem makes me want to get married to avoid getting aroused . . .
“ But i am only 18 . . .
It would be difficult for me to get married due to social norms of getting to the late 20’s when one has a degree , a job , a house , etc before getting married . ”
No matter how difficult it was to balance his Muslim and secular worlds — he was tortured about his “ dilemma between liberalism and extremism ” — Abdulmutallab always brought the discussion back to his most pressing dilemma : sexual desire .
“ The hair of a woman can easily arouse a man , ” Farouk wrote , one of hundreds of entries posted between 2005 and 2007 .
“ The Prophet advised young men to fast if they ca n’t get married but it has not been helping me much and I seriously do n’t want to wait for years before I get married . ”
For Abdulmutallab , 23 , even his fantasies were steeped in carnal conflict , highlighted by an inner battle between good and evil .
“ So usually my fa[n ] tasies are about islamic stuff , ” he continued .
“ The bad part of it is sometimes the fantasies are a bit worldly rather than concentrating in the hereafter . ”
He was also agonized about going to his prom .
“ Like sister MM 04 suggested , an islamic party is good , a great way to spend your last moments in school with good people , ” he wrote on May 7 , 2005 .
“ Guys in my school talk and plan what they will do for their proms years in advance , organising their dates , cars , suits and what not , ” he added , referring to the “ peer pressure . ”
“ My answer to this is , be patient . ”
Abdulmutallab stopped just short of reaching the hereafter when a bomb he had hidden in his drawers failed to explode aboard a Detroit - bound flight on Christmas Day .
The suspect was wearing briefs with a specially tailored pouch packed with 80 grams of PETN , a key ingredient of a plastic explosive powerful enough to blow a hole in the side of the plane .
Authorities said the Nigerian man tried to detonate it with acid from a hypodermic needle but only singed his shorts .
Abdulmutallab ’s Internet rants seemed less like those of a terrorist - in - the - making and more like a young man burdened by loneliness and a desperate need to be understood .
“ i am in a situation where i do not have a friend , ” one screed read .
“ i have no one to speak too , no one to consult , no one to support me and i feel depressed and lonely .
i do not know what to do . ”
He also told members of an online forum that he was lonely at a British boarding school in the West African nation of Togo because few of his classmates were Muslims .
“ i get lonely sometimes because i have never found a true muslim friend , ” Abdulmutallab wrote .
I ’m active , I socialise with everybody around me , no conflicts , I laugh and joke but not excessively .
“ I strive to live my daily live [ sic ] according to the quran and sunnah to the best of my ability . ”
Farouk1986 discussed growing up and preparing to leave boarding school for college .
But his educational pursuits were quickly overtaken by his obsessions with a holy war .
“ I imagine how the great jihad will take place , how the muslims will win , insha Allah [ God willing ] , and rule the whole world , and establish the greatest empire once again !!! ” reads one post from Feb. 20 , 2005 .
Springfield Missouri :
Where farmers are branded criminals
A view from the Missouri - born Health Ranger
Yet another victimless " crime "
Take action :
Tell the Missouri Attorney General to keep his hands off raw milk
The industry assault on raw milk
Never pick a fight with the people who grow your food
( Natural News ) Imagine being watched by two undercover cops as you engage in an illicit deal in a deserted parking lot .
The buyer hesitantly hands you some cash .
You flash a look over your shoulder , just to make sure the coast is clear , then you hand over the contraband .
Neither of you says a word .
You just nod , acknowledging the deal is done , then you head back to your car and buckle up for the drive home .
But before you can even put the car into drive , a screeching formation of police cars , surrounds you , sirens wailing .
Armed officers leap from their vehicles , guns drawn and sunglasses glaring .
" Come out with your hands up ! " they shout .
You slowly open the driver 's door of your car and inch out of your seat with both hands raised in surrender , cowering behind the open door .
" What did I do , officer ?
What 's my crime ?
" Their answer comes back loud and intimidating : " SELLING RAW MILK !
" The above description is a dramatization of real events that happened recently in Springfield , Missouri , where the state has decided to spend considerable taxpayer resources running a sting operating against a family that was caught dealing -- gulp !
-- Yes , both the Missouri Dept. of Health and the state Attorney General ( Chris Koster ) have decided that prosecuting a farm family for illegally " trafficking " raw milk should be at the top of their list of priorities .
The family being targeted by state officials is the Bechard family , of Armand and Teddi Bechard , and their children Joseph , Hananiah , Kazia and Katie .
The name of the cow offering the milk is reportedly " Misty .
" As the Springfield , Missouri paper reports , " Two undercover investigators with the Springfield - Greene County Health Department allegedly caught two of the couple 's daughters on two occasions selling a gallon of milk each from a Springfield parking lot .
Charges followed in municipal court .
" In case you 're not yet sure what you 're reading here , note carefully that these daughters were not caught selling crack , meth or crank .
They were n't dealing second - hand pharmaceuticals to yuppie school kids .
They were n't selling e.coli-contaminated hamburger meat , cancer - causing diet sodas ( made with aspartame ) or canned soups laced with MSG .
They were n't even selling broiler chickens contaminated with salmonella -- just as you can find in every grocery store in America .
Nope , they were selling .
You know , the bovine mother 's milk , unpasteurized , unprocessed , non-homogenized and wholly pure , natural and innocent .
The stuff America was raised on .
The stuff your parents fed you when you were a kid , if your family was lucky enough to have a cow .
In Missouri today , selling such a natural product is now apparently a criminal act .
What 's next ?
A ban on farm - fresh eggs because the Dept. of Health does n't control their quality ?
The outlawing of raw broccoli because broccoli contains natural anti-cancer medicine ?
Fortunately , As reported by the News - Leader : I grew up in Raytown , Missouri , just a few miles from Springfield .
I spent more than a few summers on a farm near St. Louis , where we would milk the cows , gather fresh eggs from the chickens , and fish for catfish in the pond .
I 'm not exactly a farm boy , but I 'm familiar enough with living off the land to know the difference between real food and processed food ( a distinction the Missouri Dept. of Health still has n't gleaned ... )
When I grew up in Raytown , there were fresh - food farms within driving distance where we could get fresh milk , eggs and vegetables from small family operations .
It was a way of life for many families living in the suburbs of Kansas City , and none of us could have imagined then that families selling fresh milk would one day be treated like criminal contraband dealers by overzealous law state officials .
The effort to criminalize sellers of raw milk is misguided on so many levels that it just begs to be called out as perhaps one of the worst uses of taxpayer dollars yet dreamed up by clueless bureaucrats .
For starters , -- there 's no mislabeling here .
The people buying the milk know very well they 're buying raw milk .
In fact , they go to great lengths to seek out raw milk in order to benefit from its numerous health advantages over processed , pasteurized milk .
Secondly , any serious crime worth investigating requires a victim .
But there 's no victim in the " crime " of selling raw milk .
The family farms sell their milk at a fair price , and a knowledgeable consumer purchases the raw milk , knowing exactly what they 're buying for their dollar .
( Misty the cow , perhaps ?
Probably not , as cows on family farms are treated far better than cows in most dairy factories . )
This raw milk persecution attempt is yet another example of a " victimless crime " being invented , then pursued by overzealous state officials who clearly have nothing useful to pursue ( or who have a serious problem setting priorities ) .
In a world where children are being poisoned by aspartame , senior citizens are being drugged into zombie - like states in nursing homes , where school boys are being dosed with " speed " amphetamine ADHD drugs , bacon is laced with a cancer - causing chemical known asand two - thirds of the broiler chickens sold in grocery stores are contaminated with salmonella , are you telling me that the friendly selling of raw milk in a parking lot is at the top of the list of " crimes " being investigated by the Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster and his overworked staff ?
Seriously ?
It takes a wild leap across the chasm of wrong vs. right to arrive at the bewildering conclusion that a couple of farm girls selling two gallons of raw milk deserves investigators , a sting operation , a Dept. of Health inquiry and the attention of the state Attorney General .
It almost makes me think these bureaucrats are all smoking crack , which can be purchased in , by the way .
But crack dealers are n't their concern , it seems ...
It 's those darned raw milk families that are ruining Middle America !
Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster may be a good AG , for all I know .
He 's gone after Medicaid fraud , and that earns him some kudos in my book .
This whole raw milk thing , if I had to take a guess , is probably some hare - brained idea handed to him by some nutritionally - ignorant staffer who convinced him this could earn him some points for " getting tough on raw milk . "
( Is he seriously going to issue a press release announcing a prosecutorial " victory " over two teen girls selling a couple gallons of fresh milk ?
It 's sort of like prosecuting little kids for running a neighborhood lemonade stand without a business license ... )
In any case , it 's worth letting Koster know you think prosecuting these girls for selling raw milk is a complete waste of time and ( taxpayer ) money .
AGs have an important function in protecting consumers from fraud , but in order to be effective , they 've got to get their priorities straight .
Would n't Koster 's time be far better spent suing the drug companies for running fraudulent , misleading television advertisements that exaggerate the benefits of their drugs while glossing over their severe side effects ?
Here 's how you can : Go to http://ago.mo.gov/consumercomplaint.htm to get started .
You can then fill out an online form or you can callfor more information about filing a complaint .
Remember , this AG office is paid bytaxpayer dollars ( if you live in Missouri , anyway , and I did for almost 20 years ) .
You have every right to let them know when you think their investigation efforts have gone awry .
Be polite in filing your complaint , but also be firm .
Do n't let this Missouri AG get away with prosecuting a small family farm operation for selling fresh milk to willing customers .
Actually , reading this last sentence , I can't even believe America has devolved to the point where such a statement is necessary ..
After all , grocery stores are full of raw food items such as raw chicken , raw beef and raw fruits and vegetables .
Why are state health authorities selectively up in arms over raw milk ?
I 'll give you the answer in three words : .
The dairy industry sees raw milk as competition to its pasteurized , homogenized , standardized , factory - produced " junk " milk product , which promotes heart disease .
Raw milk is healthier , more natural and more local than processed milk , and the more consumers learn about raw milk , the less they 'll buy processed milk .
in much the same way that industrial hemp is a threat to the cotton industry ( or stevia is a threat to the manufacturer of aspartame ) .
So the dairy industry pressures state and federal bureaucrats to outlaw raw milk and criminalize individuals who dare try to sell it . , pure and simple , and it has been conjured up by the dairy industry to protect their profits at the expense of consumer freedom .
Do n't you find it amazing that in ( and the Home of the Brave ) , that anyone caught buying or sellingis prosecuted as a common criminal ?
What has America come to if we 're going to start locking up the very same local farmers who providefor situations where the long supply chains of just - in - time food delivery break down ?
If the Missouri lawmakers had any sense at all , they 'd belocal production of fresh milk , eggs , grains and other foods to help keep Missouri more self - reliant .
But no , fresh milk sellers get arrested and charged with crimes , evenMissouri 's stance on milk seems a lot like America 's stance on hemp : Criminalize American farmers while importing all the industrial hemp from Canada , where it 's grown legally ( and profitably ) .
It is at times like this that you realizeI grew up around farmers .
I have a tremendous amount of respect for them :
For their sweat equity , their hard - won agricultural victories and their seemingly endless financial enslavement to a system of distorted agricultural policies that allows them no escape .
Farmers invest their lives in the production of food that most consumers carelessly take for granted .
Today , just two percent of the population produces all the food for the other 98 percent -- most of whom have n't a clue where real food comes from .
Real food , it turns out , comes from real farms run by real people .
People like the Bechards .
And it is these people -- these un-celebrated , hard - working , honest American farmers -- who should be recognized as the backbone of American prosperity , for without them , we would all go hungry , and even the most specialized , highly - educated scientist would be reduced to a drooling , blabbering infant if all the food disappeared for a mere 96 hours .
And yet , instead of being celebrated , these small family farmers are now being labeled criminals and prosecuted for the " crime " of providing real food to real people .
That this is taking place in my home country -- indeed , near my home town in Missouri -- just breaks my heart .
It is a sad day indeed for America when tyrant bureaucrats are allowed to run rampant over the family - run farms upon which this great country was originally founded .
How quickly America forgets its history ...
How quickly it abandons those who delivered abundance to us and asked for nothing in return other than a day of sunshine , an occasional rejuvenating rain shower , and a fair price at the market for their hard - won goods .
To the Missouri AG , Chris Koster , for pursuing this prosecution against the Bechard family .
It is people like you who are destroying this nation , even as you claim to be saving it .
When you were a young boy in school , and you studied American history and the Civil War , you probably asked yourself , " How could Americans fight each other and kill each other ?
Who could have started such a conflict ?
"
The answer , sadly , is .
People who trample the God - given rights of American farmers .
People who deny consumers their freedom to buy a nourishing beverage harvested straight off the farm .
It is people like you who create the anger and resentment that far too often results in people picking up arms to protect their natural rights that tyrants like you try to steal away from them ( under the false pretense of " authority , " no less ) .
As a Missourian myself , I can tell you thatfor very long .
When their livelihoods and their freedoms are clearly threatened by outlandish laws enforced by bureaucratic tyrants who have abandoned all common sense , , and you will find yourself in a spitting match with a tireless band of rugged Missourians who wrestle with John Deere tractor hydraulics each morning before you even get out of bed .
To you , it 's just a gallon of milk .
But to these farmers , .
Think about that for a minute before you go slapping handcuffs on the very same people who put food on your mama 's table . -

News - Leader : Missouri AG :
For a century the modern world has been caught in a growing web of copper cables .
They have become arteries that power the globe , but , from the jumble of cords cluttering our desks to the miles of wires hidden in our walls , they are also an expensive nuisance binding our gadgets to the grid .
As a new generation of wireless chargers goes on sale , scientists , who for decades have dreamed of a better way , believe we are about to trip into a tangle - free future in which our devices – and electricity itself – are finally unleashed .
The technology behind the following scenario already exists :
You drive home in your electric car , which has been charged through the road outside work , and park it in your garage , which is also equipped with an underfloor power source .
You sit down and fire up the flat - screen wireless television hanging on the wall while you check your emails on your cable - free laptop .
Both devices are powered via the wireless unit in the ceiling , which also started juicing up the phone in your pocket as soon as you walked in the door .
PowerPad , made by the British gadget firm , Gear4 , goes on sale next month and is among a new wave of devices sweeping us towards this unplugged utopia .
A protective sleeve slips over an iPhone , slotting into its connecter socket .
When the encased phone is placed on a mains - connected pad on , say , a desk or bedside table , electricity makes the jump .
American outfits PowerMat and WildCharge make similar devices .
Meanwhile , the Palm Pre smartphone has its own " Touchstone " charger and Dell 's Latitude Z is the first wireless laptop .
" Wireless electricity is something we used to talk about years ago almost as a bit of a joke when we made predictions about the future , " says Michael Brook , editor of the gadget magazine , T3 .
" To a lot of people it sounds insane that you could even do it – like some kind of witchcraft – but we 're seeing a lot of interest in the first wireless chargers .
It 's going to take off in a big way . "
If not witchcraft , how does it work ?
Here 's the science : Current from the mains is wired into a transmitter coil in the charging mat .
This generates an electromagnetic field .
A receiver coil in the phone 's case takes the power from the magnetic field and converts it back into electricity that charges the device .
By separating those coils , induction charging takes the 150 - year - old principle used in the transformers found in most electric devices and splits it in half .
No more tripping over laptop leads and their power bricks or diving under your desk to plug in your charger – just put your gadget on the mat and induction takes care of the rest .
But wireless induction , which , in a less - sophisticated form has charged electric toothbrush chargers and some medical implants for years , is n't perfect .
Advances mean it's now viable for more demanding devices , but in the case of the PowerPad , it requires a case that adds bulk to what is already a hefty handset .
Another drawback is the lack of compatibility – a phone with a PowerPad case will not charge on a PowerMat .
A growing group of electronics firms want to sdeal with the problem .
The Wireless Power Consortium ( WPC ) includes Gear4 and the mobile phone giants , Nokia , Samsung and RIM , makers of the Blackberry .
" These companies think there wo n't be a mass market for wireless charging unless there is a standard , " says Menno Treffers , chairman of the consortium 's steering group and a director at Philips .
Learning their lesson from the hopeless incompatibility of wired chargers , supporters of WPC's Qi ( " chi " ) standard will put universal coils in devices that will work without cumbersome cases .
They 'll also be compatible with any charging mat , whether it's on your desk or recessed in a table at Starbucks .
Treffers expects the first Qi-compatible devices to hit shelves next year .
But there remains a major flaw in charging mats – their need for proximity .
Separation of even a millimetre renders most mats useless .
Take your laptop to your bedroom to watch a DVD and you 'll need a second mat or a cable .
For a truly wireless scenario , electricity must make a giant leap .
Marin Soljacic is a Croatia - born physics professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) .
In 2002 , he got annoyed when his wife 's mobile phone woke him up with beeping when its battery ran low .
" Not only did I have to wake up to plug it in but had to find the charger in the dark , " he says .
" I thought , power is everywhere – sockets all over the house – yet it is n't close enough . "
Soljacic was sure there must be a way to bridge the gap .
He wanted his wife 's phone to charge while it was still in her handbag .
Two years ago , after months of equation crunching and computer modelling , Soljacic literally had a light bulb moment when he flicked the switch of a 60 - watt lamp .
No big deal except that the electricity powering the light was travelling two metres through thin air .
Soljacic and his team at MIT have since formed a company called WiTricity .
Last July , its chief executive , Eric Giler , came to Oxford to demonstrate a wireless television .
In front of an amazed audience at a technology conference , he powered up a giant plasma screen TV that had no cables .
Electricity sprung from a sleek unit on the floor to a receiver mounted on the back of the screen .
Last month , Giler travelled to Japan to show off a wirelessly - charged electric car .
" Every time I show people they 're blown away , " Giler says .
" When you see it up close it does appear almost magical . "
Soljacic 's magic takes the split - transformer model that powers charging mats and adds a key ingredient to make electricity fly .
It 's called resonance , the phenomenon that means a singer who matches the acoustic frequency of a wine glass can shatter it .
Soljacic knew that two resonant objects of the same resonant frequency tend to exchange energy efficiently – imagine a tuning fork causing a nearby fork with the same frequency to chime sympathetically .
His breakthrough was to work out a way to use resonance in magnetic form to transfer not sound but electricity .
He explains : " By coupling the magnetic field that surrounds a resonant coil to another coil resonating at the same frequency , we can make the electricity hop from one to the other . "
WiTricity 's strongly coupled magnetic resonance means cars , TVs , free - standing lamps , and computers – anything that requires electricity – can be powered or charged from a central source in the ceiling or under the floor .
And it 's all totally safe .
" The fields that we are generating in are about the same as the earth 's magnetic field , " Giler says .
" We live in a magnetic field . "
Giler and his team are in talks with big - name electronics manufacturers , including many of those who are putting their names to the Qi standard for charging mats .
Giler says proximity charging is " first - generation stuff ; by the end of next year you 'll start seeing devices with WiTricity components built in " .
If he is right , homes and offices could soon be fully wireless .
" It 's a fundamental breakthrough in science and a game changer for the industry , " he says .
" Cut the cords and the world 's going to change . "
He 's electric : A wireless pioneer
Wireless electricity appears cutting - edge but one man had dreams of a world without cables more than 100 years ago .
Nikola Tesla , a pioneering American physicist , saw wireless energy as the only way to make electricity thrive .
He could n't imagine a future in which we would be mad enough to bind the globe with miles of copper and steel .
In 1901 , work started on Tesla 's Whardenclyffe communications tower on Long Island , New York .
His plan : to transmit electricity like radio waves across entire continents .
In1908 , he wrote : " It will be possible for a businessman in New York to dictate instructions , and have them instantly appear in type at his office in London ...
An instrument not bigger than a watch will enable its bearer to hear anywhere ... music or song [ or ] the speech of a political leader ... delivered in some other place , however distant . "
But Tesla , whose name lives on in the electric car manufacturer , Tesla Motors , lost his investors before he could prove his vision was more than science fiction .
J.P Morgan was concerned that wireless electricity could not be metered , while John Jacob Astor went down with the Titanic .
His tower left to ruin , Tesla died , poor and frustrated , in 1943 .

A 90 - year - old Medal of Honor winner is involved in a dispute with a neighborhood association that wants him to remove a flag pole from his front yard .
Supporters , among them a United States senator , are supporting the medal winner , Van T. Barfoot , a World War II veteran .
Mr. Barfoot put up a 21 - foot flagpole in September .
He raises the flag daily at sunrise and retires it at sunset .
But the Sussex Square homeowners association in Richmond said the flagpole violated the neighborhood ’s aesthetic guidelines and ordered him to remove it by Dec. 11 or face a lawsuit .
Senator Mark R. Warner , a Democrat , is among those offering to help break the impasse , according to a spokesman for Mr. Warner , Kevin Hall .
Others are backing Mr. Barfoot on the Internet , including with a Facebook page .
WORLDVIEW : The special position of the Catholic Church in international law is a vital part of its armoury , writes PATRICK SMYTH
WHEN US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice visited the Vatican in February 2005 , she was caught off guard by Cardinal Angelo Sodano .
After discussions on Iraq , the Middle East and religious liberty , Sodano asked her if she could do something about an irksome court case in Kentucky .
As reported by John Allen , veteran Vatican correspondent for the US National Catholic Reporter ( NCR ) , Sodano explained that the case , a class action to make the Vatican accountable for child sexual abuse by priests in the US , was a violation of the internationally recognised principle of “ sovereign immunity ” .
The Vatican , as a recognised state , cannot be subject to the jurisdiction of other states , an extension of the old British maxim rex non potest peccare , the king can do no wrong .
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro - Valls confirmed as much .
“ It ’s obvious and reasonable , ” he told Allen , “ that the Holy See would present its positions as a sovereign entity to the American state department , and recall the immunity for its acts that international law anticipates . ”
Normal inter -state diplomacy at work . . . and the legal rationale for the Vatican ’s recent brush - off to the Murphy commission – not a pompous rejoinder to someone who does n’t understand diplomatic etiquette , but the deployment of an essential legal weapon in the Vatican armoury for protecting itself .
Rice replied that it was for the Vatican to assert immunity in the Kentucky court itself , and it has pleaded immunity successfully in , by Allen ’s reckoning , some two dozen US cases .
A 1976 law , the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act , did make it easier , however , to sue sovereign entities in US courts under certain conditions – notably , when that entity engages in commercial activity in the US or its agents cause injury there by “ tortious ” act or omission .
In an Oregon case that is breaking new ground , Holy See vs John Doe , the supreme court last month agreed to hear an argument from a lower court that the Vatican can be sued – the “ tortious ” exception to immunity could apply because an abusive Irish priest , Andrew Ronan , could be argued to have been its agent .
The suit sought damages from the Vatican ( and the archdiocese of Portland , the bishop of Chicago , and the Order of the Friar Servants ) for sexual abuse in 1965 and 1966 by Ronan who had admitted abusing a child in Armagh , was transferred to Chicago and then Portland where he abused four others .
The church knew of his admissions of abuse and failed to act against him or notify the police .
Among those cases where the Vatican successfully pleaded immunity is the long - running Alperin vs Vatican Bank , a case originally filed in San Francisco in 1999 .
The plaintiffs are Serb , Jewish , Roma and Ukrainian concentration camp survivors and their relatives and organisations representing over 300,000 Holocaust victims and their heirs .
Their claim is for the return of some $ 50 million of the treasury of the Ustashe , the genocidal , Nazi - collaborating government of Croatia that , according to the US state department and others , was illicitly transferred to the Vatican , the Franciscan Order , and other banks after the end of the war .
In 2007 the Vatican got itself off the hook , leaving the Franciscans alone to fight the case , a ruling that puts the deeply anomalous position of the Vatican in sharp relief – while it may not be sued , an international Catholic order , and indeed any other international religious body , may .
In order not to jeopardise that valuable position , Vatican sources admitted to the NCR , the Holy See remained reluctant to enter into the details of sex abuse policy in the US .
Indeed , Colm O’Gorman argues most plausibly that the failure of the Vatican to promulgate a mandatory worldwide code of conduct , with a reporting requirement – particularly important in the developing world – stems precisely from a fear of acknowledging its authority over national churches and implicitly conceding that priests and bishops , whom it appoints , are actually its agents in a legal sense .
It has also been careful for the same reason to insist repeatedly on the responsibility of the Irish dioceses for the issue .
The remarkable special position of the Catholic Church in international law is also reflected both in the diplomatic immunity of its nuncios and in its position at the United Nations .
Unlike any other religious organisation or NGO , the Holy See ( not the Vatican state ) participates in the business of the UN as a “ non- member state permanent observer ” , a designation that entitles it to participate but not vote in the General Assembly .
It is allowed in practice also both to attend and vote at UN - sponsored international conferences .
Because such meetings operate by consensus the Holy See has played an important , some argue deeply reactionary , role in debates on a wide range of social policy issues from population , to the rights of women , to Aids .
That has prompted a campaign led by the US organisation Catholics for Choice to have the status and rights of the Holy See at the UN reduced to that of any other observer NGO .
In the wake of the Murphy report , it is arguable that while Ireland should maintain a strong relationship at diplomatic level with an organisation representing one billion faithful , it is worth considering whether that should necessarily be conducted on a state - to - state basis .
With all that that entails .
Photographer questioned by police under anti-terror laws ... for taking ' too many ' pictures of town centre Christmas lights
An amateur photographer taking pictures of Christmas lights was questioned by police under anti-terror laws .
Andrew White , from Brighton , was taking pictures in a busy town centre in nearby Burgess Hill when he was spotted and followed by two Police Community Support Officers .
They stopped him and asked why he had been taking pictures and if he was a professional photographer .
Mr White , 33 , asked why they wanted to know and was told it was to do with counter - terrorism legislation .
Police said he was stopped for ' taking too many photographs in a busy shopping area ' .
Andrew White from Brighton was questioned under terror laws for taking photos of Christmas lights
The PCSOs demanded his personal details , including his name and address .
Mr White said : ' I had nothing to hide so I just provided the details .
Now I 'm concerned about where those details are going to end up .
' I only took one or two photos but even if I had taken more , who are they to say what is too many ?
' I do n't think taking too many photos in the street warrants being considered some kind of terrorist threat , which is what they were suggesting .
' I think the money spent on getting PCSOs to waste my time and harass me in the street could be better spent elsewhere . '
Mr White said the officers were polite but they insisted that they had to take his details because they had stopped him .
A Sussex Police spokesman said they spoke to Mr White because they were concerned he was taking too many photographs in a busy shopping area .
The spokesman said : ' They were acting in good faith , balancing individual liberty against the need to ensure public safety . '
Under the 2002 Police Reform Act , PCSOs have the power to demand the name and address of a person suspected of committing a criminal offence or for antisocial behaviour .
Many Hondurans , including , rumor has it , President Roberto Micheletti , see Mr. Llorens as the principal architect of a U.S. policy that has caused enormous Honduran hardship .
Yet many risks remain , starting with the fact that though the U.S. said it was going to butt out of Honduran affairs , old habits die hard .
Referring to Mr. Zelaya 's bid for reinstatement , Thomas Shannon , the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Western Hemispheric affairs , said last week , " That 's the issue that 's the most provocative and the one we will be watching most closely . "
Mr. Shannon should try watching the World Series instead .
Today , the Commerce Department released November 's personal income and spending results .
Oddly , most articles I 've seen this morning are celebrating that last month 's personal income growth was the biggest gain in six months .
If you look a little deeper , however , the numbers are n't very impressive .
For starters , today 's numbers did n't live up to expectations .
According to the Wall Street Journal , although personal income grew by 0.4 % in November ( the biggest increase in six months ) , economists expected a 0.5 % increase .
The story is the same for spending .
It increased by 0.5 % , while economists predicted a 0.6 % increase .
But these numbers do n't tell the whole story because inflation is n't taken into account .
In real dollars , those increases look far less impressive .
The chart below from the news release includes inflation - adjusted numbers in " Chained ( 2005 ) dollars " :
As you can see , November 's disposable person income growth actually matched September and October at a meager 0.2 % when inflation is taken into account .
And spending growth was actually worse in November than October , only growing 0.2 % , compared to 0.4 % in October .
If you look a little deeper into the report ( .pdf ) , you find that November 's inflation - adjusted personal income was actually 0.8 % lower than May 's statistic .
Similarly , November inflation - adjusted disposable personal income was 1.3 % lower than in May .
That 's not to say that it could n't be worse .
Obviously , if income and spending were trending further down , then that would be quite alarming .
But the claim that income and spending appear to be leading a recovery does n't quite ring true when you look at the real numbers that take inflation into account .
These statistics appear stagnant at this point .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Los Angeles County sheriff ’s deputies expected heavy business Tuesday during its annual “ gifts for guns ” program in Compton .
And sure enough , scores of people lined up to turn in various weapons in exchange for retail and supermarket gift cards .
But they were surprised at the man who pulled up in a sport utility vehicle with 58 guns -- mostly handguns but also some assault weapons .
Dressed in a sweat shirt and jeans , the man offered his cache in a nonchalant fashion .
As is the policy for such events , deputies asked no questions and eagerly took the guns .
They do n’t know the man ’s name , and the donor declined to comment to The Times .
After unloading his guns , the man received several thousand dollars in gift cards and drove away .
“ That should feed someone for a year or two , ” said Lt. Anthony Lucia .
“ There were a lot of the kind of weapons used in robberies .
We do n’t know his identity .
We do n’t know if he is a gun dealer or what . ”
The Compton exchange Tuesday garnered 232 guns , all of which will be destroyed .
The gifts for guns program has been a staple of the Sheriff ’s Department ’s crime - reduction efforts in Compton , which has seen a drop in homicides in recent years .
Lucia said the mystery man will likely remain a mystery .
“ It ’s 58 guns off the street , ” he said .

Although their unusual abilities compel considerable , there are fewer than 100 known prodigious savants living at the present time .
Daniel Tammet is one of them .
Over 30 years , the London - born mathematical and language whiz has transformed from an awkward , reclusive boy into a confident adult .
His quiet , private life of strict routines gave way in 2006 , when his memoir Born on a Blue Day became a best - seller , necessitating travel , self - promotion , and talk show appearances .
His latest book , Embracing the Wide Sky , is a scientific exploration of his extraordinary abilities ( reciting pi to 22,514 places , learning to speak Icelandic in a week ) and a tour of autism .
On August 18th and August 19th , 2009 , Daniel was gracious enough to let me peer into his world .
I was aware of the great number of interviews with Daniel that already exist , but as a psychologist , I still had many lingering questions , which Daniel was very patient in answering for me .
These two days , I left my prior expectations , biases , and ways of thinking at the door and transported myself into Daniel 's mind .
As a result , I was fortunate enough to be able to share his unique way of seeing the world .
Daniel 's insights changed my own way of thinking , not only with regards to Autism and , but also in terms of the full extent to which personal change is possible , the nature and nurture of individual differences , , , genius , fiction , art , poetry , math , love , relationships , the mind , brain , the future of humanity , and the appreciation of many different kinds of minds .
A portion of my interview can be found in the November / December issue of Psychology Today ( Numbers Guy : An autistic savant joins the wider world ) .
Over the coming days I will reveal my complete interview with Daniel , laid out in six parts .
I hope you find Daniel 's reflections , insights , and ongoing journey just as fascinating and thought - provoking as I have .
In this first part ( see parts II , III , IV , V , VI , postscript ) , Daniel talks about Embracing the Wide Sky , plasticity , Autism , and disorder , while dispelling popular myths .
S. I really enjoyed reading your book Embracing the Wide Sky .
These issues are at the very front of my mind and the field 's , and it was really great to get your unique perspective .
What was the most surprising psychological finding you discovered while you were researching the book ?
D. One of the things I found very interesting was the plasticity of the brain .
There is this mythology that says that when people are born , their brains are essentially fixed very early on and they 're not able to change their connections .
I was aware that was a myth and that people could learn new skills .
From a linguistic point of view , it 's possible to learn a second language well into adulthood without it being such a difficult task .
The extent of that plasticity was very interesting to me , and was surprising .
That people were actually able to control their capacity for .
That had such a striking effect on the brain .
That just by thinking about an activity , by visualizing it , people were able to improve their skill in that area , whether it was in terms of their goal swing or in terms of playing the notes of a piano .
That was very interesting .
S. Most savants as you know are n't able to reflect on their condition let alone write books .
What unique combination of traits do you think enables you to have such a high level of refection ?
D. My autism is a very mild form .
It was diagnosed at the age of 25 , partly because it was n't diagnosable as a teenager ( this is Asperger 's syndrome , specifically ) .
But there were certainly traits within that condition , within the autism spectrum in general , especially at the high functioning end , that I think are best looked at as pluses .
Often autism is portrayed in the media as a very negative condition , as something that prevents somebody from communicating or from socializing or from being able to have any kind of normal , happy life .
These are exaggerations - exaggerations to the point of distorting the reality of the condition , which is complex .
In terms of Asperger 's syndrome , and those pluses , I 'd say there is a great curiosity to understand the world .
People going through their who do n't have this condition , who are n't on the spectrum , will make friends in general .
They will fit in , will go through the routines of society , of school , of family life , and so on , and these things will seem to them natural because they come naturally to them so they do n't feel the need to question them or to find them puzzling or unusual enough to want to question them whereas those on the autistic spectrum , myself included , are very puzzled by most things people take for granted - the intricacies of , of telling a joke , of having a conversation with somebody .
This curiosity can then develop in all kinds of ways and can broaden out into much bigger questions about the nature of life and death , the universe and the meaning of it all and so - on .
So I think curiosity is one of the primary traits that has been a plus and has been a big part of my development and a big part of the for writing Embracing the Wide Sky because of my curiosity for how the mind works and what makes my mind different but also not so different from other people who obviously have n't had the same journey as I 've had .
S. In what ways do you think Aspergers has contributed to your extraordinary abilities ?
D. I mention this in the chapter on creativity .
I quote one scientist Fitzgerald , who is a professor of in Dublin .
He studied genius as he termed it and believed that many of those people who we would traditionally describe as possessing genius - Newton , Tesla , Mendel , and many others - were likely to have , were they alive today , been eligible for a diagnosis of Asperger 's syndrome or some kind of autistic disorder .
He singles out a number of traits , such as single - mindedness and perseverance .
When things do n't come so naturally to you , you want to persevere , you want to keep pushing yourself to overcome obstacles that prevent you from having the kind of life that you want to have .
And of course curiosity , as I 've already mentioned , is a very important trait in pushing back against ideas that people receive but do n't necessarily question and having that insight , or that creativity - the ability to mix ideas up and come up with new ways of thinking of something .
I could very well believe what Fitzgerald had written about them and see clearly in my own case that these traits did contribute a great deal .
Of course , these traits are n't unique to the autistic spectrum either .
We see examples of course of people achieving many great things who are not autistic at all , but I certainly think that this is helpful in some respects in that it makes it clear that autism is not purely to be seen in negative terms .
The brain is an incredibly complex thing and in certain people it develops differently .
That obviously incurs certain costs but it might also bring certain benefits as well .
S. I thought that was very important how you dispelled some myths of autism in your book .
D. A key theme running all the way through Embracing the Wide Sky is that autistic people in general but savants in particular are not so different from anyone else .
This Oliver Sacks kind of mythology that says that savants are robots , or machines , or aliens , or some kind of strange creatures , doing things that are almost or mystical is I think dehumanizing and distorts scientific understanding of the condition and also how the brain works and how it is possible to calculate in a different way and to learn languages in a different way .
We do n't require supernatural , Oliver Sacks kind of explanations .
In The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat , probably the most famous study done on autistic savants to date , certainly in the public sphere , Sacks met savant who he claims were able to count 111 falling matchsticks .
The same claim was made years later in the adaptation Rainman , where matchsticks were changed into toothpicks , and the number increased dramatically as well .
There is no mechanism by which this can be achieved .
No savant has been tested or has demonstrated this ability under scientific conditions .
All of the materials Oliver Sacks accumulated in his informal study he claims to have lost so it 's impossible to verify .
That is unfortunate , because I think he was mistaken .
I think he was trapped by his own misconceptions of autism and savantism .
And this one myth , I think even to this day , is responsible for both the public 's and many scientist 's conception of how savant 's minds work and perhaps more generally how every mind works because if we make it hard to believe that there is some mechanism by which it would be conceivable to count 111 falling matchsticks in that space of a blink of the eye , then that would be revolutionary and there is no evidence for it whatsoever .
S. Do you think you 'd still have displayed your savant abilities if you did n't have Asperger's ?
Are there cases of savants that do n't have Asperger's ?
D. I guess it comes down to how you define a savant .
It 's a rather ambiguous term .
It comes from French savoir , which means to know and can be described more loosely as any very knowledgeable person .
What is interesting in the case of autistic savants is that there is simultaneously extraordinary ability in one or more skills but also disability in other skills .
Now in some cases like Kim Peek who I met back in 2004 , the disability is very obvious .
Kim has to rely constantly on the care of his father .
He is not able to dress himself or to take care of himself and so on .
Having said that , he is fairly high functioning in that he's able to have a conversation , he jokes , he sings , attained eye contact and so - on .
In other cases where the autism is more linked with Asberger 's Syndrome , the milder form of autism , the high - functioning form of autism , the disability is much more subtle .
People with Asperger 's syndrome are aware of the fact that they are different .
They do not want to stand out necessarily from the crowd and do everything in their power , which is considerable in my own experience , with my brother Steven who also has Asperger 's syndrome , and the many others I 've spoken to who also have Asperger 's syndrome .
They 're smart .
They 're smart in the sense that they can learn quickly , they can watch other children play .
They can learn from the mistakes that they do make , the things that do n't come as easily to them .
So they work around things they find difficult so that they do n't dwell on their disability , but on their ability .
So their disability becomes less and less important in their life .
And in some cases , mine included , the disability in the end is very small , fortunately .
But that is not always the case unfortunately .
S. What are some of the most difficult challenges you 've personally had to deal with as a person with Asberger 's and what techniques have you used to compensate over the years ?
D. One of the things that people know me most for is my autobiography I wrote four years ago , Born on a Blue Day .
In that book I described growing up with Asperger 's syndrome and savant syndrome and not knowing growing up what it was that made me so different from everyone else .
And this journey of self - discovery and also will power to push myself constantly to want to be capable of having the kind of life that I felt I was capable of having .
That was of course a very difficult process .
I would have to watch the other children , I would have to learn from the mistakes that I made , I would have to push myself very hard to overcome things that most people do n't have to think about .
Brushing my teeth was very difficult because of the noise of the brush , which was very scratchy and very uncomfortable for me .
So it took a great bit of effort and time to learn to do that .
Today I 'm able to use an electric toothbrush .
The sound is repetitive and is n't irritating in the same way as a manual brush .
So little things like this , things that people take for granted in everyday life .
Because my brain has changed and evolved differently over the years , those are the things I had to work around .
And making friends as well was very difficult .
Perhaps part of the reason I feel very close to numbers is the emotional content I have with them .
Growing up , those were the things that I understood very well , whereas the other children I did n't understand in the same way .
Whereas the children were playing with other children , I was playing with numbers in my head , visualizing the shapes and the colors that I saw with them and seeing how they change and how they interacted , and doing sums and enjoying the rhythms and the colors and the kind of dance .
As I 've said , I 'm able to dance with numbers , whereas the computers crunch them .
And this ability to dance with them and to play with them was very positive .
As a consequence , my was such that when the opportunity did eventually arise to make friends , situations that I describe in Born on a Blue Day , where children from other countries would come to our school , and because they were different in their own way - a different culture , a different background , a different skin color and so - on- perhaps that awareness of difference , that sensitivity to what it means to be different from everyone else , made it much easier for them to reach out a hand to me and to make friends , and for me to make friends with them .
Many little challenges like this that over the years I 've had to overcome .
I think today one of the biggest challenges is just to keep pushing back against the misconceptions of the kind that I address in Embracing the Bright Sky about what autism is and about the potential for an autistic person to have a happy life , however you would define that or to have a successful , however you would define that .
I think it 's entirely possible for someone with autism to have both .

There is a fair bit of disagreement whether Julius Genachowski is going to make the Internet more open , but it ’s clear already that he is moving to open up the arcane ways of the Federal Communications Commission , of which he is chairman .

On Thursday morning , the commission voted unanimously to begin a formal discussion of Mr. Genachowski ’s proposed rules for what is called network neutrality , a concept that would require telecommunications companies not to favor certain services or devices over others .
Mr. Genachowski and the two other Democratic commissioners voted for the proposal .
The two Republican commissioners voted to support moving forward with the inquiry , but they did not support the text of the proposal .
Unlike past commission chairmen , Mr. Genachowski has issued a draft of his proposed rules rather than simply asking questions .
He is allowing three months for comments , longer than usual .
And he directed the commission staff to examine the technical issues that underlie the debate .
“ For too long the commission has fallen into the habit of obscuring from public view the text of proposed rules , ” said Robert M. McDowell , one of the Republican commissioners .
Mr. McDowell praised the “ persistent eagerness ” of the chairman to find a way to engage the Republicans in the discussion .
Mr. Genachowski also sought to address the heavy criticism his proposal has received from telecommunications companies that his plan would lead to gridlock on the Internet because they would not be allowed to act as traffic cops .
His plan included an extensive list of “ reasonable network management practices ” that would be permitted .
These included reducing the effect of network congestion , guaranteeing customers a certain quality of service , giving priority to communications by public safety agencies and preventing illegal uses of the network , like the unauthorized transmission of copyrighted works .
Mr. Genachowski , however , offered more questions than answers on what may be the biggest philosophical debate : whether a telecommunications company can give preference to services it offers over those of rivals .
Communications companies want to offer services that take advantage of some of the capacity or features of their networks .
This might be offering Internet video services , improved voice mail or text - messaging , or faster connections to Internet sites that pay for speedy service .
The commission simply asked for comment on how to define what it calls “ managed services ” and what rules should apply to them .
On this issue , Michael J. Copps , one of the Democratic commissioners , argued that Internet service providers should not be able to favor their own products over others .
“ The Internet must never be about powerful gatekeepers and walled gardens , ” he said .
“ It must always be about the smoothest possible flow of communications among people . ”
But Mr. McDowell said that such rules would deny consumers the benefits of better services .
“ Consumers are telling the marketplace that they do n’t want networks that operate merely as ‘ dumb pipes , ’ ” he said .
“ Sometimes they want the added value and efficiency that comes from intelligence inside networks as well . ”
As expected , the proposal would explicitly extend the commission ’s informal network neutrality policy to wireless as well as wired networks .
The commission has not yet released the text of its proposal .
( That ’s another of its arcane procedures . )
A live blog of the meeting is on its site , OpenInternet.gov , where presumably it will post the full proposal soon .
According to a news release from the agency , the proposal says that providers of broadband Internet service :
1 . Would not be allowed to prevent any of its users from sending or receiving the lawful content of the user ’s choice over the Internet ;
2 . Would not be allowed to prevent any of its users from running the lawful applications or using the lawful services of the user ’s choice ;
3 . Would not be allowed to prevent any of its users from connecting to and using on its network the user ’s choice of lawful devices that do not harm the network ;
4 . Would not be allowed to deprive any of its users of the user ’s entitlement to competition among network providers , application providers , service providers and content providers ;
5 . Would be required to treat lawful content , applications and services in a nondiscriminatory manner ; and
6 . Would be required to disclose such information concerning network management and other practices as is reasonably required for users and content , application , and service providers to enjoy the protections specified in this rule - making .
Comments are due Jan. 14 , with replies to comments due MarCH 5 .
The commission has as long as it wants after that to decide what to do .
Since President Obama campaigned on a promise of network neutrality , it is not at all clear that any amount of persistent eagerness on all sides will be able to create rules that will accommodate the concerns of the telecommunications companies and the commission Republicans .
( CNN ) -- Brazilian relatives of a 9 - year - old boy , caught in an international custody battle with the child 's father , will not file any further appeals after the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled against them , their attorney told CNN Wednesday .
The family is just looking for a peaceful handover of Sean Goldman to his father , attorney Sergio Tostes said , and plan on starting dialogue to allow the transfer to happen immediately .
The chief justice of the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in favor of David Goldman , who had been battling the family of the boy 's deceased mother for custody .
The ruling by Chief Justice Gilmar Mendes will reunite Sean with his father .
Last week , a lower court unanimously upheld a decision ordering that Sean Goldman be returned to his father in New Jersey .
David Goldman arrived in Rio de Janeiro to reunite with his son , but one Supreme Court justice issued a stay , ordering Sean to remain with his Brazilian relatives until the high court could consider the case .
Mendes ' decision lifted the stay .
This week the U.S. State Department issued a passport to Sean , given to his father , so that he can travel back to the United States , spokesman Philip J. Crowley said Wednesday .
" Our embassy in Brasilia , our consulate in Rio de Janeiro , many people have been up through the night just to provide support to the Goldman family , to maintain contact with the Brazilian government ... as we , hopefully , come to the end of this process and look forward to the reuniting of Sean Goldman with his father , David , " Crowley said .
The regional court decreed the boy must be handed over by 9 a.m. ( 6 a.m. ET ) on Thursday .
" Sean is very sad because it is not and has never been his desire [ to return to the United States ] , " his grandmother , Silvana Bianchi , told CNN .
" He got especially disappointed about not having the right to speak in his own country [ about ] what he wanted for himself ...
They are sending the boy to the United States without the right to defend himself .
Where is the Brazilian constitution ? "
Bianchi was initially expected to appeal .
But Tostes said Wednesday the family wants to act in the boy 's best interest , and he was meeting with an intermediary to arrange the handover .
He said he would like Bianchi to meet with David Goldman so she can tell him what Sean likes to eat , what he enjoys doing and other details .
Asked whether she would accompany Sean on the flight to the United States , Bianchi would only say Tostes is negotiating what is best for the boy .
Upon hearing the family would file no further appeals , Rep. Chris Smith , R - New Jersey , said , " This is not good news .
This is great news . "
The custody battle began in 2004 , when Goldman 's wife , Bruna Bianchi , took their then - 4 - year - old son from their home in New Jersey to Rio de Janeiro for what was to have been a two - week vacation .
She never returned , instead remarrying there and retaining custody of Sean .
She died last year in childbirth .
Goldman has argued that as the sole surviving parent , he should be granted custody .
The Bianchi family maintained it would traumatize Sean to remove him from what has been his home for five years .
The custody battle garnered much media attention and spilled over into the political arena as well .
U.S. Sen . Frank Lautenberg , D - New Jersey , had placed a hold on a trade bill that would have benefited Brazil to the tune of $ 2.75 billion , but he lifted it after the court 's ruling , spokesman Caley Gray told CNN .
The bill in question , which sailed through the Senate after the senator dropped the hold , provides export tariff relief to 130 countries , of which Brazil would be the fifth largest recipient , Gray said .
Lautenberg 's hold was designed to exert additional pressure on Brazilian authorities to abide by the court order to return Sean to his father , he said .
Silvana Bianchi told CNN Wednesday it was " very sad , a country that exchanges children for economic agreements . "
While the chief justice was still studying the case , Brazilian Attorney General Luis Inacio Adams said the executive branch of Brazilian government sided with Goldman .
" Once we stop cooperating and start breaking our treaties and international obligations , Brazil risks the chance of not having its own requests in the matters regarding international judicial help granted , based on the principle of international reciprocity , " Adams said Monday .
" Not releasing the minor into the custody of his father could bring sanctions against Brazil , " he added .
" It could damage Brazil 's image before the international community . "

Despite the legal uncertainties surrounding medical - marijuana dispensaries , Steve Horo witz is plowing ahead with Colorado ’s first marijuana restaurant .
Ganja Gourmet , a restaurant that serves pot-laced food , has opened at 1810 S. Broadway in a building that Horowitz owns .
In addition to the “ Bud Bar , ” where marijuana leaves are sold to licensed consumers , Ganja Gourmet offers lasagna , pizza , hummus , brownies , fudge and a variety of cheesecakes .
Since the building does not have a kitchen , all menu items are cooked in a rented commercial kitchen and reheated in the restaurant ’s microwave .
“ I decided I want to open a cafe that ’s a fun chill place and specialize in edibles , ” Horowitz said .
“ None of the other dispensaries have a friendly and chill atmosphere . ”
But what happens if stricter regulations are adopted on either the city or state level and customers are n’t allowed to munch on marijuana - filled food at dispensaries ?
“ It would be unfortunate , but it wo n’t be the end of the world , ” Horowitz said .
“ At least 50 percent of sales are products to go .
We ’ll just offer all the food to go . ”

Lights out .
Wherever he is from noon to 1 p.m. Friday , Avalanche star Paul Stastny plans to be in the dark .
Stastny , 23 , and Nuggets standout Chauncey Billups are the celebrity spokesmen for Xcel Energy ’s Lights Out Lunch event that aims to send an energy - conservation message statewide .
More than 70 restaurants through the Colorado Restaurant Association have pledged to turn off their lights during Friday ’s lunch .
Coupons and promotions are available at lightsoutlunch.com .
On Tuesday , Stastny and I spread the Lights Out Lunch love by cooking pancakes at Snooze at Seventh and Colorado Boulevard .
Snooze is offering a free pancake of the day during the event .
Stastny ’s creation was a pleasant blueberry pancake with Avalanche red raspberry coulis .
I reciprocated by serving him a blueberry pancake with corn flakes and walnuts slathered with a peanut - butter glaze and Avalanche coulis .
“ It ’s good , ” he said between bites .
“ Not sure I would have used the peanut butter , but I like the walnuts . ”
To participate in Lights Out Lunch , just turn off your lights for an hour at noon Friday .

Memphis police arrested 23 - year - old Ross Burton early Wednesday morning as he and another man attempted to set fire to the rainbow flag ( see singed rope in photo , above ) at the Memphis Gay and Lesbian Community Center , the Memphis Flyer reports :
" Plainclothes officers observed Burton and another man — who fled the
scene and remains at large — attempting to set fire to the rope that
runs up the flag pole in front of the MGLCC .
When police officers
approached the men , an altercation ensued , and one suspect attempted to
disarm an officer .
Additional police were dispatched and some
reportedly received lacerations and abrasions from the struggle .
The
suspects fled , but Burton was located and arrested .
Burton is being charged with aggravated assault and vandalism under $ 500 . "
Burton 's face is bruised because he fought with the officer , Russell Woolley : " Woolley says after Burton ' swung his fist at him , ' the other guy jumped on his back and tried to take his ' service pistol from the holster . '
After Woolley hit the unidentified man with his radio , he took off .
But Burton never gave up the fight .
It took a good samaritan and some pepper spray to get him to comply . "
In late September a " Coming Out Day " billboard featuring a gay Marine that was sponsored by the Center was destroyed in an act of vandalism .
Police have not determined whether the two crimes are related .
That crime inspired hundreds to rally in response .

With one month left in fiscal 2009 , the value of such deals stood at $ 35.3 billion , not including any that may be wrapped up by the September 30 close of the fiscal year , the Pentagon ’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said Thursday .
“ Anything could tip the scale on this , ” said Charles Taylor , an agency spokesman .
U.S. arms sales have boomed in the past two years , in part because of regional tensions surrounding nuclear and ballistic missile programs in Iran and North Korea .
As recently as fiscal 2007 , the value of government - to - government U.S. foreign military sales totaled $ 23.3 billion .
The Pentagon ’s biggest suppliers , including Lockheed Martin Corp , Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp , are looking more and more to overseas markets to offset Pentagon budget belt - tightening .
Andrew Shapiro , an assistant secretary of state responsible for political - military affairs , said Wednesday the State Department had licensed more than $ 100 billion in direct commercial sales of “ defense articles and services ” last year , in addition to the government - brokered sales .
“ This year we expect to see a comparable volume of commercial sales , he told a defense - industry conference known as COMDEF 2009 .
He said it was not yet clear whether global economic woes would have a statistically significant impact on government - to - government arms sales .
In 2008 , the United States accounted for a lopsided 70.1 percent of all arms transfer agreements with developing nations , or $ 29.6 billion , according to a September 4 report by the nonpartisan U.S. Congressional Research Service .
Way back in second place was Russia with $ 3.3 billion or 7.8 percent of such agreements .
France was third with $ 2.5 billion or 5.9 percent , the report said .
Shapiro , in his first public speech since taking over in June as an Obama administration point person on arms - sales policy , described weapons deals as “ an important avenue by which we can leverage American industry ’s powerful appeal and innovative capacity to further America ’s vital security interests and those of our international partners . ”
Arms sales represent “ yet another important tool for broadening and deepening our partnerships with emerging powers such as India , as well as strengthening long - time security ties with steadfast friends and allies , ” he said .
The Obama administration was reviewing Taiwan ’s and Iraq ’s stated hopes to acquire Lockheed Martin - built F - 16 multirole fighter aircraft , Shapiro said in reply to a question .
“ I do n’t want to get out front of any announcement on those , ” he said , “ but you can be assured that we are considering and reviewing those sensitive , high - profile sales . ”
“ We also expect that the strong defense trade relationship with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries will continue , ” Shapiro said .
Such partnerships are essential to address shared security concerns and to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’s vision of a “ smart power ” foreign policy , he said .
The concept of “ smart power ” -- weaving together defense , development and other tools of “ hard ” and “ soft ” power -- is at the heart of President Barack Obama ’s foreign policy vision , he added .
Shapiro said the administration would not rule out the possible overseas sale of unmanned aerial vehicles despite a presumption against such sales under a voluntary international pact known as the Missile Technology Control Regime .
The MTCR guidelines curb transfers of “ missiles ” -- defined as rocket systems , including ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction , plus their related equipment and technology .
The pact emphasizes curbs on exports of unmanned systems capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kg a distance of at least 300 km , so called “ Category I ” or “ MTCR - class ” systems .
“ There is a presumption against selling MTCR Category 1 , ” Shapiro told a questioner .
“ But there are cases where that presumption can be overcome .
We take a look at each case on a case by case basis . ”

The PlayStation 3 is not the only one to have recently turned three , the PlayStation Network also shares the same birthday , marking it ’s third year of service PlayStation users .
Starting on the PS3 the network expanded onto the PSP , and , in some respects , onto the PC .
With numerous firmware updates , and revamps of the PlayStation Store , the network has greatly improved over the course of it ’s life , with even more updates coming later today .
The free service was previously known to have over 24 million users , now , to mark the service ’s coming of age , SCEA has announced how many users the service currently has .
At the moment , there are more than 31 million registered PlayStation Network accounts worldwide , making it one of the largest online networks in the world .
To date , more than 650 million pieces of content have been downloaded worldwide from PlayStation Store , with last October marking the highest month of revenue on record .
The PlayStation Network ’s number ’s are only set to grow as the PS3’s and PSP ’s sales continue to grow , as well as Sony ’s possible plans to bring the PlayStation Network to other Sony products .

AS COMPETITORS CONTINUE to falter , Goldman Sachs ( ticker : GS ) has reaped profits from recent rallies in equities and fixed - income securities and has positioned itself to benefit from a global recovery .
But a recent $ 55 million selling spate by two insiders may be suggesting the stock has gotten ahead of itself .
J. Michael Evans , a vice chairman at Goldman , sold 70,000 shares on Nov. 23 for $ 12 million , or an average price of $ 171.73 each .
On Nov. 25 , he sold 70,000 additional shares for $ 11.7 million , or an average price of $ 167.39 each .
After the sales , Evans held 644,953 shares directly and 830,967 shares through exercisable options and restricted - stock units .
His stake remains less than 1 % of the bank 's outstanding shares .
Another vice chairman , Michael S. Sherwood , exercised options and sold 182,860 shares for about $ 31.9 million between Nov. 13 and Nov. 24 .
Goldman shares have risen 18 % over the past six months , the same as the gain for JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) , but far more than the 5 % gain for rival Morgan Stanley ( MS ) .
A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment on Evans ' sale .
On Oct. 15 , Goldman reported better - than - expected third - quarter earnings , helped by strong performances in credit products , mortgages and equities .
Goldman is a global financial - securities firm , offering investment banking , securities and investment - management services to corporations , financial institutions and wealthy individuals .
The company was founded in 1869 and had $ 55 billion in revenue in 2008 .
Evans has been with Goldman since 1993 .
He was appointed vice chairman in 2008 and has been chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia since 2004 .
Prior to that , he was co-head of the firm 's securities and equities divisions .
Ben Silverman , director of research at InsiderScore.com , says the sales by Evans and Sherwood are concerning .
When Sarah G. Smith , the firm 's controller and principal accounting officer , sold shares in October , she was only the third insider to do so this year .
Silverman noted then that further insider sales would raise a red flag about whether Goldman is worth more now than it was at its all - time high in October 2007 , as the stock 's valuation suggested .
As it turned out , Silverman says , Smith 's sale this year pinpointed a top in the stock .
While the more recent selling has happened after the stock has backslid a bit , it still raises the question of valuation again .
" At the end of the year , there 's always a lot of tax issues for insiders , so you could attribute this to that , " Silverman says .
" But it 's very well known that Goldman employees are getting huge end - of - year bonuses .
Everybody involved here should be getting a big influx of cash in the next few weeks . "
But James Mitchell , an analyst with Buckingham Research Group , has a rosier view of Goldman 's prospects .
He rates the stock at Accumulate with a $ 244 price target .
Mitchell says the firm is attractively valued at 7.9 times his 2011 estimated earnings per share and 1.4 times 2010 estimated tangible book value ( TBV ) .
This compares to historical averages of 11 - 12 times forward EPS and well more than 2.0 times TBV .
" We also believe Goldman 's strong execution and risk - management skills , and its significant leverage to a global recovery in the capital markets , make it an attractive investment , " he wrote in a research note .
Here 's a harbinger of what 's to come in the next several weeks of Senate debate :
Senate Republicans objected on Monday to a proposal from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid that all health care reform amendments must first be posted online before being considered in order ....
A member of the erstwhile " Gang of Six " -- the three Republicans and three Democrats from the finance committee who spent months failing to come to agreement on a compromise bill -- Sen. Mike Enzi ( R - Wy. ) objected to Reid 's request ....
A message left with Enzi was n't immediately returned .
But on the floor , Enzi said he did n't trust the other party enough to go along .
" In light of some of the trust problems and transparency problems we have , while this appears to lead to greater transparency , we can also see ways that this can limit the ability for the minority to offer amendments .
And , therefore , I object , " he said .
Rick Warren has officially come out against the proposed laws in Uganda that would make homosexuality a crime , punishable by death in some cases .
In an open letter to the pastors of Uganda ( with whom Warren has a great deal of influence from his missionary work ) the American mega - pastor says ,
As an American pastor , it is not my role to interfere with the politics of other nations , but it IS my role to speak out on moral issues … the potential law is unjust , extreme and un-Christian toward homosexuals , requiring the death penalty in some cases .
If I am reading the proposed bill correctly , this law would also imprison anyone convicted of homosexual practice … I urge you , the pastors of Uganda , to speak out against the proposed law .
Obviously , Warren holds ( and reiterates in the letter ) beliefs about sex and about queer men and women with which I thoroughly disagree .
But I want to thank him for doing the right thing here , for putting his influence and power to use to save the lives of innocent people .
Hopefully , Warren 's letter will make a difference .

Understanding , Addressing , and Resolving Bullying Behavior in Your Workplace
By Dunn , Carney , Allen , Higgins & Tongue
Bullying in the workplace is a common , and often misunderstood problem .
In a 2007 survey , half of the employees interviewed said they had heard someone scream at a co-worker during work .
Almost one - third acknowledged that they have , after an upsetting situation at work , told someone that they wanted to do something awful to a boss or co-worker .
Workplace bullying seems to be on the rise , and now occurs 4,300 times more often than workplace homicide , and up to three times more often than unlawful harassment , discrimination , and retaliation , combined .
Most are surprised to learn that more often than not , the bully turns out to be female … and educated .
This means that certain work environments are statistically more vulnerable .
Despite its frequency , workplace bullying is often ignored or not ultimately resolved .
When complaints are raised , the employee ( target ) may be told a variety of unsettling things such as – ‘ you need a thicker skin , ’ ‘ it ’s just a personality clash , ’ ‘ give it some time , ’ or ‘ why do n’t you tell [ insert name here ] how you feel ? ’
Not surprisingly , employees who hear these messages often leave the organization , find a way to avoid the bully , or simply remain quiet and internalize their pain and frustration .
Bullying presents many challenges for employers , not the least of which is trying to define what it is and what it is not .
The absence of a statute prohibiting bullying contributes to the problem , as does the lack of agreement as to how much and what type of bad behavior a company should prohibit .
One expert in the field defines bullying as the “ sustained display of hostile verbal and nonverbal behavior , excluding physical contact . ”
The problem of universal application of this definition is immediately apparent .
Another expert advocates for a two - part test .
First , after the target interacts with the bully , does the target feel oppressed , humiliated , de-energized or belittled ?
In other words , does the target feel worse about him - or herself ?
Second , does the bully air his or her venom at people who are less powerful ?
According to this expert , if these tests are met , then workplace bullying has occurred .
Again , imagine the frustration of the HR professional trying to apply this highly subjective and broad standard in a way that is consistent and fair .
Instead of focusing on conduct ( action ) , this standard focuses on the impact ( consequence ) .
Still other experts look to the Workplace Bullying and Trauma Institute ’s definition of Workplace Bullying :
The repeated , health - harming mistreatment of one or more persons ( the targets ) by one or more perpetrators that takes one or more of the following forms :
• verbal abuse ;
• threatening , humiliating or offensive behavior / actions ; and / or
• work interference – sabotage – which prevents the work from getting done .
The Institute also offers an understanding of the cycle of bullying and why it is an issue worth addressing .
According to the Institute , bullying begins with a perpetrator ’s desire or need to control the target (s ) .
The desire takes shape as bullying conduct when the perpetrator decides on the targets , the timing , the place , and the method .
If unaddressed , the bullying escalates by involving others , either voluntarily or through coercion .
Eventually , the business interest of the company becomes secondary to the bully ’s personal agenda .
Given the frequency of workplace bullying , the fact that it is a behavior that escalates over time , and the potential for significant impact on the bottom line , it is no wonder that some companies have taken steps to address the problem .
In these workplaces , employees understand that bullying is not acceptable , that there is a way to raise a concern about such conduct , and that the company will do its best to find a workable and effective solution .
In reality , few of these situations result in happy endings .
Retaliation against targets who raise concerns is rampant .
Sometimes the same conduct merely escalates , while often bullies become better at finding less obvious or less public ways to act out against the target .
In addition , targets who receive only temporary reprieve are reluctant to raise issues again out of fear of being a ‘ complainer ’ .
Much like the early days of sexual harassment , employee behavior does not change until the organizational culture does .

SHENANDOAH , Pa. — Eileen Burke still lives by the epicenter of an outburst of hate .
On a summer night in 2008 , just outside her door , she heard shouts of things like “ you bleeping Mexican . ”
She saw some young men — two of whom she knew by name — run past .
She knelt over a motionless person she saw laying in the street , heard a liquid gurgle in his throat , and realized the man was dying .
But , in the hours and days afterward , Burke said , the local police did not seem interested in her up - close observations of what turned out to be the beating death of an illegal immigrant .
Last week , she digested the news that more than half of the local police department in her small Schuylkill County borough had been arrested by the federal government for crimes that included an alleged cover - up of a racially charged beating death .
“ It is sickening , ” said Burke , a former Philadelphia police officer who moved back to her hometown years ago .
“ They thought they were going to be untouchable . ”
Four of the borough 's seven police officers were arrested last week .
They included the chief , Matthew Nestor .
In addition , two teenagers allegedly involved in the beating were charged with federal hate crimes .
One federal indictment charged Nestor , Shenandoah Police Lt. William Moyer , and Officer Jason Hayes with impeding the investigation into the beating death , which involved white teenagers who had played for the Shenandoah Valley High School football team .
Another indictment , stemming from unrelated events , charged Nestor and Capt.
Jamie Gennarini with extortion of cash from illegal gambling operations .
Meanwhile , the press picked up a previously unpublicized story that people in Shenandoah had quietly talked about for years .
A civil lawsuit , filed in 2006 , claimed borough police had beaten to death a Hispanic teenager , then hung him in his holding cell to make it look like a suicide .
In town last week , reporters asked people on streets and in shops what it was like to see more than the police department under arrest .
“ It is just horrible when you ca n’t trust your cops , ” said Pat Ritsko , who has worked in a donut shop on Main Street for years .
“ I know some of them and they are really nice .
It is a sad , sad situation . ”
Moyer , she said , had been in the donut shop as a customer .
“ Very nice guy , ” she said .
“ People like him .
The kids like him .
Well liked .
It is just a shocking story . ”
A century ago , Shenandoah was a busy coal town .
Thousands of immigrants , including Italians , Lithuanians , Polish , and Germans , worked in nearby anthracite mines and raised families .
The tight grid of streets was hemmed in by mountains .
The population , which once reached 30,000 , was so close - packed that " Ripley 's Believe It or Not ! " dubbed the borough the most congested square mile in the U.S .
Coal mining and other industries declined .
The population dropped to about 5,000 .
In recent years , there was an influx of Spanish - speaking immigrants , and ethnic tensions were on the rise even before the deadly beating of 25 - year - old Luis Ramirez on July 12 , 2008 .
Mexican native Jose Silva has run a used clothing store that caters to Spanish - speaking people for more than two years .
The sentiment in his community about the arrest of the police officers , he said , was , “ It is about time . ”
Silva has three children who attend local schools .
He has worked as a coal miner , field hand , and equipment operator .
In his shop , he sells used lamps , shirts , coats , and stuffed animals for paltry amounts of money , or just gives them away .
After the 2008 killing , he did an interview with an out - of - town television reporter .
After the interview aired , someone broke the window of his shop .
Still , he said , “ I have a lot of friends .
American people .
Mexican people .
Puerto Rican people . ”
Many residents do not want to talk about the federal indictments of the police .
“ Mum ’s the word , ” said a retired man in the donut shop .
Another patron , Bill Habel , said the arrest of the cops was “ an overreaction . ”
What they allegedly did , he said , was wrong , but the pursuit of the case against them was fanned by pressure from “ minority advocacy groups . ”
Habel is a truck driver .
He lives in a nearby town and stops at the shop every day to eat lunch .
The news media , he said , botched the story from the start because it portrayed the town as filled with nasty racists .
And , he said , it failed to report on rumors of less - than - desirable activities involving Ramirez .
At the time of his death , Ramirez was in the U.S. illegally , working at various jobs .
On the night of July 12 , he became involved in an argument with a group of local high school football players .
Nearly two weeks passed before four teenagers were arrested .
Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak eventually were acquitted in state court of the most serious charges lodged against them .
They were convicted of simple assault and given state prison sentences of up to 23 months .
Collin Walsh pleaded guilty in federal court to violating the civil rights of Ramirez and testified against Piekarsky and Donchak .
A fourth teenager was processed in juvenile court .
Piekarsky and Donchak last week were serving out their state prison sentences when the federal indictments came out .
They were charged with federal hate crimes .
They could face life in prison if convicted .
The most serious count against the police officers , obstruction , carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison .
Burke said that on the night Ramirez was beaten , police cars from four other out - of - town agencies arrived at the scene before any vehicle from the Shenandoah police department .
As Ramirez lay dying in the street , she said , no police tape was put up around the scene .
Local investigators waited about two weeks , she said , before they talked to her in person .
As they interviewed her in her living room , she said , the investigators told her that her memory of the events was wrong .
“ I knew something was up , ” she said , “ It is the good old boys . ”
The U.S. government plans to put alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other Guantanamo Bay detainees in Cuba on trial in a federal civilian court in New York City .
Another five detainees , including Toronto - born Omar Khadr , and Abd al - rahim al - Nashiri , a suspect in the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 that killed 17 U.S. sailors , will face military commissions .
Attorney General Eric Holder confirmed the plan at a Friday morning news conference .
" After eight years of delay , those allegedly responsible for the attacks of September the 11th will finally face justice .
They will be brought to New York to answer to their alleged crimes in a courthouse just blocks away from where the twin towers once stood , " Holder said .
Holder said prosecutors expect to seek the death penalty in the civilian court cases .
" I have every confidence we can safely hold these trials in New York as we have so many previous terrorist trials , " Holder said .
Speaking earlier in Japan , where he is on an official visit , U.S. President Barack Obama said it was a legal and national security issue .
" I am absolutely convinced that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed will be subjected to the most exacting demands of justice , " Obama said .
Trying Mohammed and the other detainees in civilian court , instead of a military tribunal , presents several potential hot issues for the U.S. government .
The New York case may force the courts to deal with some counter - terrorism tactics , including interrogation tactics such as waterboarding .
Mohammed is reported to have been waterboarded — a simulated drowning — 183 times in 2003 , before the practice was banned .
Mohammed and the others have not been formally charged in civilian court , so it is not clear when they may be transferred to New York .
Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York , where the civilian trials will be held , have already handled several terrorism trials in recent decades .
Attorneys from the Eastern District of Virginia will also assist in the prosecution .
Holder said it has not been determined where the military commissions , where Khadr will be tried , will be held .
Khadr , 23 , was captured by U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan in 2002 , and is accused of throwing a grenade that killed U.S. soldier Christopher Speer .
He has been held at Guantanamo Bay for the past seven years .
Some leaked documents have called into question the Pentagon 's murder case against Khadr .
Khadr had been in legal limbo since Obama announced plans to shut down the Guantanamo detention centre and repatriate the detainees .
The U.S. government 's original plan was to close the detention centre by Jan. 22 , but the Obama administration has said it no longer expects to meet that deadline .
Holder said Friday 's announcement marked a step forward on the path to close the Guantanamo prison .
While Holder was holding his press conference , the Canadian government 's appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on the handling of Omar Khadr was underway .
The government is appealing a lower court ruling that orders Canada to try to repatriate Khadr .
The Canadian government would rather he face U.S. justice instead of being brought back .

GOP aides are increasingly confident that the Senate bill will represent the public option ’s " Waterloo , " as one aide puts it , chiefly because it ’s questionable whether pressure from liberals in the House will do much to prevent what emerges from the Senate from getting into the final bill largely intact .
That has some GOP aides already chortling that the public option is headed for defeat .
" If you ’re looking for a Waterloo , the public option ’s is fast approaching , " one emails .
" Whatever comes out of the Senate will undoubtedly be in the final bill and it sounds like Lieberman and Snowe have their hands on the wheel . "
The bill without a public option is little more than a big ol ' wet kiss to the insurance industry , a gift of some $ 600 billion and millions of new subscribers .
Sure , they 'll have a few more hoops to jump through to figure out how to dump people and deny their claims , but they 'll still be able to do it .
There are bits and pieces in the legislation that will help control costs , but without a program that expressly challenges the status quo of employer - based private insurance , it can't be called " reform . "
If the insurance companies come out of this declaring victory , it 's not reform .
You can help remind the 10 Senators negotiating on the public option of that fact .
The Treasury Department announced last week that it is revamping its Home Affordable Modification Program .
Unfortunately , its changes — threats to fine and publicly shame mortgage loan servicers for not acting quickly enough — do not address two glaring shortfalls of the program and wo n't stabilize housing markets .
The first shortfall is that the program does n't provide a clear process to triage the over 7.5 million delinquent loans .
The second is that it does n't take into account that the primary reason borrowers default is ...

In the quest to make hydrogen as a clean alternative fuel source , researchers have been stymied about how to create usable hydrogen that is clean and sustainable without relying on an intensive , high - energy process that outweighs the benefits of not using petroleum to power vehicles .
New findings from a team of researchers from the University of Tennessee , Knoxville , and Oak Ridge National Laboratory , however , show that photosynthesis – the process by which plants regenerate using energy from the sun – may function as that clean , sustainable source of hydrogen .
The team , led by Barry Bruce , a professor of biochemistry and cellular and molecular biology at UT Knoxville , found that the inner machinery of photosynthesis can be isolated from certain algae and , when coupled with a platinum catalyst , is able to produce a steady supply of hydrogen when exposed to light .
The findings are outlined in a recent issue of the journal Nature Nanotechnology .
Bruce , who serves as the associate director for UT Knoxville 's Sustainable Energy and Education Research Center , notes that we already get most of our energy from photosynthesis , albeit indirectly .
The fossil fuels of today were once , millions of years ago , energy - rich plant matter whose growth also was supported by the sun via the process of photosynthesis .
There have been efforts to shorten this process , namely through the creation of biomass fuels that harvest plants and covert their hydrocarbons into ethanol or biodiesel .
" Biofuel as many people think of it now -- harvesting plants and converting their woody material into sugars which get distilled into combustible liquids -- probably cannot replace gasoline as a major source of fuel , " said Bruce .
" We found that our process is more direct and has the potential to create a much larger quantity of fuel using much less energy , which has a wide range of benefits . "
A major benefit of Bruce 's method is that it cuts out two key middlemen in the process of using plants ' solar conversion abilities .
The first middle man is the time required for a plant to capture solar energy , grow and reproduce , then die and eventually become fossil fuel .
The second middle man is energy , in this case the substantial amount of energy required to cultivate , harvest and process plant material into biofuel .
Bypassing these two options and directly using the plant or algae 's built - in solar system to create clean fuel can be a major step forward .
Other scientists have studied the possibility of using photosynthesis as a hydrogen source , but have not yet found a way to make the reaction occur efficiently at the high temperatures that would exist in a large system designed to harness sunlight .
Bruce and his colleagues found that by starting with a thermophilic blue - green algae , which favors warmer temperatures , they could sustain the reaction at temperatures as high as 55 degrees C , or 131 degrees F .
That is roughly the temperature in arid deserts with high solar irradiation , where the process would be most productive .
They also found the process was more than 10 times more efficient as the temperature increased .
" As both a dean and a chemist , I am very impressed with this recent work by Professor Bruce and his colleagues , " said Bruce Bursten , dean of UT Knoxville 's College of Arts and Sciences .
" Hydrogen has the potential to be the cleanest fuel alternative to petroleum , with no greenhouse gas production , and we need new innovations that allow for hydrogen to be readily produced from non-hydrocarbon sources .
Professor Bruce and his team have provided a superb example of how excellence in basic research can contribute significantly to technological and societal advances . "
Co-authors on the paper along with Bruce include Infeyinwa Iwuchukwu , a UT Knoxville graduate student in chemical and biomolecular engineering ; Michael Vaughn , a research technician ; Natalie Myers , a UT Knoxville graduate student in microbiology ; Hugh O'Neill , a UT Knoxville - ORNL research professor and Paul Frymier , a UT Knoxville professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering .

This is a topic I write about often since it is the basic foundation for many aspects of the BDSM lifestyle .
Whenever we are referring to M/s or D/s , the main component is the exchange of power .
The only way either of those relationships exist is because the power is ceded to the one in control .
For those who are unaware , the single difference between M/s and D/s is in the areas the power applies to .
In a M/s relationship , the slave is giving up all power over any area of his or her life .
Nothing is off limits to the Master or Mistress .
Compare that with the D/s relationship where the control applies to only certain aspects of life that are agreed upon .
Commonly , this it is the sexual arena where the power is ceded while the sub maintains control over other aspects of life .
The key point to the power exchange is that it is complete .
That is why it is termed " total power exchange " .
There is not an equal breakdown of power .
Whereas most relationships contain some type of 50/50 breakdown of power , the BDSM relationship goes the opposite direction .
We establish routines whereby the division is 100 % to 0 % .
Again , this pertains to both D/s and M/s. Many seem to intellectually acknowledge this idea .
Nevertheless , they seem to have difficulty putting it into practice .
I read many who post their experiences online and often am left wondering are they slaves or are they Masters ( Mistresses ) ?
They seem to miss this basic point of our lifestyle .
A submissive is to be obedient .
This is the main quality which separates the good ones from the bad ones .
Anyone who is looking to get into this way of life without the desire to be obedient is going to have issues .
It can not be stressed enough that we live in a way which contains an absolute breakdown of power .
Closing one 's eyes to this fact only leads to trouble in the future .
When the power is in the hands of another , all decisions , by default , are with that person .
The one who submitted can offer up recommendations or suggestions ( if the dominant one allows that ) .
However , the end choice is with the one in control .
Many will try to manipulate their way around this concept .
They feel they can use little " games " to try and get their desires met .
This is not what is meant when I mention obedience .
Manipulation is an underhanded way to try an exert control .
This is not the position of a submissive type .
While it might be human nature to act out on our desires , a good sub or slave will be able to overcome this .
Obedience leads to the idea of service .
If one is truly serving the needs of his or her One , then all else is secondary .
There are many ideas presented online about how this lifestyle works .
While much of it is informative , there is a lot that is misleading .
Be careful when you consider what you are reading .
BDSM is a wonderful way of life .
However , there are certain basic tenets that we all live by .
The exchange of power is something that is not to be taken lightly .
Anyone who is considering this way of life should ponder what the power exchange means and if you can live under these conditions .
Entrance into this lifestyle means that your wishes and desires become secondary .
How does that sit with you ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Obama Administration is expected to slash the estimated cost of the Troubled Asset Relief Program by $ 200 billion , effectively paving the way for what is expected be a massive federal jobs program .
The latest projection , which will be officially unveiled by the White House Tuesday , would cut TARP 's price tag to $ 141 billion , according to a Treasury Department official .
The administration is expected to propose using a portion of that money to fund a national jobs creation program , White House officials told CNN .
President Obama will likely recommend using the $ 200 billion to fund a series of projects , including building bridges and roads , and weatherizing homes , as well as providing further aid to the unemployed and to small businesses .
Such a move is certain to draw the ire of Republican lawmakers , who have railed against using any leftover bailout funds or money that has been paid back by banks for any new projects .
Many have not only proposed shutting down the program altogether , but argued that any unallocated TARP funds should go toward cutting the nation 's bloated deficit .
Treasury currently estimates that the annual deficit for fiscal year 2010 will hit a record $ 1.5 trillion .
" I think that we ought to cut spending , first and foremost , " House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said Friday , following a House Republican meeting on job creation , aimed at rivaling a similar summit sponsored by President Obama .
White House projections on the cost of TARP have been coming down in recent months .
In August , the administration had projected that the long - term costs of running TARP would reach $ 341 billion .
That outlook has improved as banks have raced to repay government aid .
To date , banks have returned some $ 71 billion to taxpayers , according to the Treasury Department .
And that number continues to grow .
Last week , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) announced plans to repay the $ 45 billion in taxpayer aid it received over the past year .
Additionally , taxpayers have pocketed another $ 10 billion in interest payments stemming from these investments , according to recent Treasury Department estimates .
A losing proposition
However , the American public is still expected to incur a massive loss in the end -- the question is just how much it will be .
A separate estimate issued earlier this year by the Congressional Budget Office warned that TARP will ultimately cost taxpayers approximately $ 159 billion .
Not only are there considerable costs associated with running TARP , but many of its subsidiary programs are widely viewed as losing propositions .
For instance , the $ 27 billion that has been spent on the administration 's " Making Home Affordable " program , is money that taxpayers are unlikely to see ever again according to the Office of the Special Inspector General for TARP , the watchdog group created to monitor the program .
At the same time , there have been significant doubts whether the government will ever be able to recoup the money spent rescuing companies like General Motors , Chrysler and insurer AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) .
AIG , for example , has said it has not generated enough earnings to repay the remaining $ 62 billion it owes the government , despite recording two straight profitable quarters .
And last month , the government effectively lost the $ 2.3 billion it had invested in small business lender CIT Group , after the company filed for bankruptcy .
Treasury currently has $ 133 billion invested in both large and small lenders , under TARP 's capital purchase program , which was launched last fall to get credit flowing in the U.S. economy again .

A group of University Of Washington students are being called vigilantes after they armed themselves with handguns and tried to set up patrols on University Avenue and other areas around campus where students have been attacked over the past year .
Stanley Luong and Luis Garcia have armed themselves .
Both are assault victims .
Luong says , “ Some guy just broke down the window , reached in and unlocked the door and came in and robbed us . ”
Garcia says , “ Four men jumped out of a car .
They assaulted me and threw my girlfriend to the ground and they attempted to rob me .
Two times I ’ve been jumped .
I said it ’s not going to happen a third time . ”
So both got a concealed license permit and bought handguns .
Now they walk with pistols in their pockets … looking for the bad guys .

Luong says , “ I do n’t know if it ’s illegal to walk around and be bait .
I ’m kind of fishing for robbers . ”
Garcia says , “ I believe the police they come after the fact .
They are n’t there when the incident is occurring I believe this is just the fastest means of protecting oneself and those around you and so I decided to take that measure and execute my second amendment to bear arms . ”
According to the UW Daily Newspaper , there have been ten assaults and robberies in the area in just the past two months .
The students also created a Facebook page with more than two dozen friends .
“ I was just kind of sick of it and I watched a lot of movies like taxi driver and vigilante movies and I decided , why not make a Facebook ” says Luong .

Barack Obama displays his Nobel Peace Prize .
Conservative praise for Nobel speech
President Barack Obama ’s Nobel Peace Prize speech Thursday is drawing praise from some unlikely quarters – conservative Republicans – who likened Obama ’s defense of “ just wars ” to the worldview of his predecessor , Republican George W. Bush .
It ’s already being called the “ Obama Doctrine ” – a notion that foreign policy is a struggle of good and evil , that American exceptionalism has blunted the force of tyranny in the world , and that U.S. military can be a force for good and even harnessed to humanitarian ends .

“ There will be times , ” Obama said , “ when nations – acting individually or in concert – will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified . ”
The remarks drew immediate praise from a host of conservatives , including former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
“ I liked what he said , " Palin told USA Today .
" Of course , war is the last thing I believe any American wants to engage in , but it 's necessary .
We have to stop these terrorists . "
Gingrich told The Takeaway , a national morning drive show from WNYC and Public Radio International , “ He clearly understood that he had been given the prize prematurely , but he used it as an occasion to remind people , first of all , as he said : that there is evil in the world . "
“ I think having a liberal president who goes to Oslo on behalf of a peace prize and reminds the committee that they would not be free , they would n't be able to have a peace prize , without having [ the ability to use ] force , ” Gingrich said .
“ I thought in some ways it 's a very historic speech . ”
The context was striking .
The president is enormously popular in Norway – a crowd of several thousand waited at his hotel chanting “ Obama .
Obama .
Obama . ”
And “ yes we can .
Yes we can .
yes we can . ”
Still , he spoke to the Nobel committee in a room packed with European dignitaries – including the Norwegian royal family — on a continent where skepticism of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan is strong .
And despite the sentiments in the room , Obama defended the American war effort there and told the Europeans that their reflexive pacifism may be self defeating .
“ Whatever mistakes we have made , the plain fact is this : the United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms , ” Obama said .
“ The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea , and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans . ”
And Obama ’s comments came just nine days after the president stood before cadets at West Point and told them that American values are “ the moral source of America 's authority , ” as he ordered an additional 30,000 troops into Afghanistan .
His decision to push for a surge also garnered Obama comparisons to Bush , who had done much the same thing in Iraq three years earlier .
The Oslo speech , too , reminded some of Obama ’s predecessor – with a twist .
“ The irony is that George W. Bush could have delivered the very same speech .
It was a truly an American president 's message to the world , ” said Bradley A. Blakeman , a Republican strategist and CEO of Kent Strategies LLC who worked in the Bush White House .
Added Walter Russell Mead , Henry A. Kissinger senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations : “ If Bush had said these things the world would be filled with violent denunciations , ” said “ When Obama says them , people purr .
That is fine by me . ”
Obama ’s remarks were a historical counterpoint to the speech made by Martin Luther King Jr. , on another tenth of December , 45 years ago .
On that day , King told the Nobel committee in Oslo that their award to him was “ a profound recognition that nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral question of our time - the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to violence and oppression . ”
King rejected violence for all time : “ Civilization and violence are antithetical concepts . ”
But Obama broke with King on the issue of non-violence , drawing an implicit distinction between King as the leader of a movement , and himself as the leader of a nation .
“ As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr. King ’s life ’s work , I am living testimony to the moral force of non-violence , ” the president said .
“ I know there is nothing weak –nothing passive – nothing naïve – in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King .
But as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation , I can not be guided by their examples alone . ”
As a candidate , Obama was somewhat more wary of framing America ’s political battles in terms of good and evil – though he said then as he did today that evil exists .
At a civil forum with John McCain at the Saddleback Church in Lake Forest , Calif. , in the summer of 2008 , Obama said , “ Now , the one thing that I think is very important is for us to have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil because , you know , a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil . ”
As he accepted the Nobel in Oslo , the doubts about confronting evil were n’t evident .
“ For make no mistake : evil does exist in the world , ” Obama said .
“ A non-violent movement could not have halted Hitler ’s armies .
Negotiations cannot convince al Qaeda ’s leaders to lay down their arms .
To say that force is sometimes necessary is not a call to cynicism – it is a recognition of history ; the imperfections of man and the limits of reason . ”
“ Wow . what a shift of emphasis , ” said Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , a former policy advisor to McCain ’s 2008 presidential campaign .
Kagan said .
“ I do n't know what to say about an ‘ Obama doctrine , ’ because based on this speech , I think we are witnessing a substantial shift , back in the direction of a more muscular moralism , ala , Truman , Reagan . ”
Liberals , too , offered quick praise for the speech .
“ This was no tie - dye peace prize , ” said Christine Pelosi , an attorney , author and Democratic activist , writing in POLITICO ’s Arena .
“ The President laid out the ‘ right makes might ’ Obama Doctrine : securing a just peace takes both the nonviolent teachings and military traditions of quiet heroes who fight for human rights as civilians and service members . ”
Democratic strategist Lanny Davis said , “ Simply : all Americans should be proud . ”
But Davis also took a shot at Bush , the man on the minds of so many conservatives Thursday morning .
“ We and our president are once again viewed positively by most peoples of the world , ” he said .
“ A sea change from recent years . ”
In a recent article in The Detroit News , there was an interesting real - life example of how speed limits that are set too low can lead to an increase in dangerous , aggressive driving :
[ Michigan State Police First Lt. Thad ]
Peterson said major contributors to aggressive driving include : speed limits that are too low for the road ; traffic congestion ; and poorly timed traffic lights .
These act as instigators to drivers speeding , changing lanes and tailgating , all characteristics of “ aggressive ” driving .
Changes made to roadways where aggressive driving occurs have reduced reported incidents or road rage , he said .
As an example , Peterson pointed to changes made along a section of Interstate 496 outside of Lansing , which accounted for 40 percent of reported incidents of aggressive driving in that area .
When the speed limit was raised from 55 mph to 70 mph , incidents of aggressive driving dropped to zero .
“ The low speed limit frustrated many drivers , so they drove over the speed limit .
This caused problems for other drivers who were driving at the limit .
The speed differential caused the tailgating , passing , and speeding that were reported as ‘ aggressive ’ driving , ” Peterson said .
His data also showed accident rates in that area also fell when the speed limit was raised .
Surprisingly , the higher speed limit also improved traffic flow , nearly eliminating all symptoms of rush hour congestion along that stretch .
GOP ’s ‘ Repeal Health Care ’ Plan Faces High Hurdles

As soon as the Senate passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on Dec. 24 , Republicans and conservative activists started making a promise to voters .
Give them a victory in the 2010 midterm elections , and they ’ll repeal the bill .
“ Every Republican in 2010 and 2012 will run on an absolute pledge to repeal this bill , ” said Newt Gingrich , the former speaker of the House who remains a key strategic thinker for the party , on the Dec. 27 episode of “ Meet the Press . ”
“ This has an unusual ability to be repealed , and the public is on that side , ” said Max Pappas , the vice president of public policy at FreedomWorks , in a Dec. 28 interview with Avi Zenilman .
“ The Republicans are going to have to prove that they are worthy of their votes . ”
[ GOP1 ]
The “ repeal ” pledge was n’t anything new for the GOP .
In August , Rep. Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) promised that passage of health care reform would put Republicans back in charge on Capitol Hill in 2011 and put him in a position to repeal the bill .
In September , Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) told conservative activists that a Republican Congress would “ pass repealer bill after repealer bill ” undoing the work of President Obama and the Democrats , with health care reform first in their sights .
But as Republicans gravitate towards a repeal message for the 2010 elections , they ’re running up against the reality that health care reform would be prohibitively hard to roll back .
According to conservative health care analysts , legal analysts , and political strategists , if President Obama signs health care reform into law , Republicans will have extremely limited opportunities to repeal any part of it .
“ Anyone who thinks they ’ll be able to repeal ObamaCare is kidding themselves , ” said Michael Cannon , director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute .
“ If they want to stop it , they need to stop it now . ”
In conversations with TWI , conservatives identified a few hurdles for a hypothetical , repeal - minded GOP Congress .
The first is that in their most optimistic scenario , in which Republicans like Barton and Bachmann hold committee chairmanships , Barack Obama will be president , wielding a veto pen , until at least January of 2013 .
The second hurdle — one that Republicans are n’t considering , but Democrats are — is that once it passes , health care reform will win back public support .
And the third hurdle is a provision of the bill that , according to Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) and other conservatives , may not ever be subject to new legislative oversight .
The road ahead for repeal looks so daunting that many conservatives are looking at legal challenges , not GOP wins , as the most promising way to challenge health care reform .
Edmund Haislmaier , senior fellow in health policy studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation , was more optimistic than some about Republicans ’ chances of repealing the bill , and said that candidates would be shrewd to run in 2010 promising as much .
“ Still , there ’s always a danger of entrenchment , ” Haislmaier told TWI .
“ Believe me , I ’d rather have the thing not pass . ”
Still , Democrats , in public and in private conversations with TWI , have been more specific about what parts of the bill they ’ll campaign on than Republicans have been about what parts they ’ll campaign against .
In a Dec. 24 press release attacking Sen. Richard Burr ( R - N.C. ) , one of the few Republican senators viewed as potentially vulnerable in 2010 , the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee charged that Burr “ will have to look North Carolinians in the eye and pledge to repeal health care reform which will have afforded coverage to 1.7 million North Carolinians , brought down costs for families and small businesses , ended appalling insurance practices , and lowered the deficit . ”
Republicans , while talking generally about repeal , have not beaten back Democratic arguments about the most popular aspects of the bill — health insurance exchanges , a ban on denying insurance for pre-existing conditions , and filling the so - called “ doughnut hole ” gap in Medicare Part D funding .
Much of their criticism focuses on the idea of a “ government takeover ” and on health care mandates that would not come into effect until 2013 or 2014 .
In a Dec. 27 interview on “ This Week , ” Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) called the bill a “ big problem ” for Democrats and claimed that “ the surveys indicate the American people are overwhelmingly opposed to this effort to have the government take over all of their health care . ”
According to Democratic strategists , McConnell ’s failure to get more specific , or to out - and - out promise that his party will repeal the bill , revealed that the party is not fully behind a “ repeal ” message .
“ You attack the expansion of government , ” said Ret. Lt. Col .
Allen West , a Republican candidate for Congress in Florida whom the National Republican Congressional Committee views as one of its strongest challengers .
“ Improving and reforming our health care should not require more levels of government — health care exchanges , health care czars .
We make that argument .
That ’s the way we start to peel the onion back . ”
But West ’s take on the “ repeal ” message gets into a matter that came up in the final days of the Senate debate , when DeMint claimed that Section 3403 of the bill would make it impossible for the Senate to ever abolish the newly created Medicare Advisory Board .
“ We will be passing a new law , ” DeMint warned in a floor speech , “ and at the same time creating a Senate rule that makes it out of order to amend or even repeal the law . ”
DeMint ’s warning was quickly picked up by Rush Limbaugh , who told his listeners that “ there are unrepealable aspects of the bill , ” and that because those aspects “ violated ” the Constitution , conservatives would have better luck challenging the bill in court than trying to repeal it .
Some conservative legal experts started laying the groundwork for such a challenge months before the bill passed in the Senate .
In July , the conservative Federalist Society published a paper by Peter Urbanowicz and Dennis G. Smith which analyzed the possible avenues for a constitutional challenge to health care reform , such as arguing that a mandate violated the First Amendment ’s right to freedom of religious expression , the “ free exercise clause , ” or the Fifth Amendment ’s “ takings clause , ” ** ** which bars the government from seizing private property without payment .
In November , Urbanowicz participated in a Federalist Society strategy session that delved deeper into the rationales for possible challenges .
And on Dec. 21 , this research informed an “ memo to the movement ” from the Conservative Action Project , a coalition of movement leaders that includes former Attorney General Ed Meese and FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe .
“ We urge you , ” wrote conservative leaders in their memo , “ to make this point to members of the U.S. Senate — and if a bill passes the Senate to impress upon members of both chambers of Congress — that the key provision in the healthcare legislation violates the U.S. Constitution . ”
“ Once a bill like this is enacted , it ’s difficult to repeal , ” Urbanowicz explained to TWI .
“ If it passed , I can see any number of groups finding a way to challenge it in court .
Any taxpayer could file this challenge .
I think you ’d see multiple challenges in multiple district courts , given the really novel nature of the law and the controversy with which it was passed . ”
The constitutional challenge route , however , is a trickier , slower , and less dramatic response to the health care bill than a Republican pledge to repeal it if the party takes back Congress .
“ If the Obama health plan becomes law , ” said the Cato Institute ’s Cannon , “ we will never get rid of it . ”
The Mars Odyssey orbiter went into safe mode on Saturday , November 28th because of a glitch in the “ memory error external bus ” of the satellite .
Odyssey will remain in safe mode at least until the end of the week , effectively slowing down communication with the two rovers , Spirit and Opportunity .
Odyssey is still operating at normal temperatures and communicating with the control team back on Earth .
It stayed in safe mode over the weekend .
After a full reboot today , the craft is on the mend and expected to be fully operational later this week .
“ This event is a type we have seen before , so we have a known and tested path to resuming normal operations , ” said Odyssey Project Manager Philip Varghese of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in a press release .
Odyssey has been orbiting Mars since January 2002 , mapping the surface and taking global measurements of the planet .
Odyssey has also been the link to the Earth for the two rovers since 2004 , acting as a communications relay that speeds up the transference of signals between the robots and the control team .
Though Spirit and Oppy have their own antennae for communication , Odyssey can communicate with the Earth at 10 times the speed and with a fraction of the energy usage .
This glitch is really nothing new for the satellite – it ’s much like having to reboot your laptop when it freezes up .
The Mars Reconnaisance Orbiter would be the obvious backup for Odyssey , but the MRO has been in safe mode since August 26th .
The MRO rebooted itself four times in 2009 , and after the last reboot the spacecraft has stayed in safe mode to prevent any catastrophic damage to its memory .
NASA had planned to uplink files to the MRO to restore it sometime this week , but the uplink and recalibration of the satellite would take over a week , meaning that if Odyssey is n’t back up by the end of the week Spirit and Opportunity are on their own for a little while longer .
Odyssey is a key player in the efforts to free the Spirit rover , which has been stuck in a sand trap since May 1st of this year but is making progress .
Because of a wheel stall problem that the control team thinks may be internal , an extrication attempt made on November 28th was n’t successful .
The Spirit control team had n’t planned on making any more maneuvers to free the rover this week , as they are still analyzing the recent attempts to plan for future efforts at freeing its wheel .
Hopefully , by the end of next week we ’ll be seeing two fully - functioning orbiters and a freewheelin ’ Spirit .

Moscow , Russia ( CNN ) --
The remains of Adolf Hitler were burned in 1970 by Soviet KGB agents and thrown into a river in Germany on direct orders from the spy agency 's chief , a top Russian security official said this week .
The head archivist of Russia 's Federal Security Service ( FSB ) -- the successor to the former Soviet Union 's KGB -- confirmed for the first time the chain of events that led to the disposal of Hitler 's body , and who ordered the operation , in an exclusive interview with Russia 's Interfax news agency .
Gen . Vasily Khristoforov told Interfax in an interview published Monday that previously secret documents show that KGB chief Yuri Andropov , with prior consent from the Soviet Communist Party leadership , ordered a top secret operation to destroy the remains of Hitler , his wife Eva Braun , Nazi Germany 's propaganda chief , Joseph Goebbels ; and Goebbels ' entire family .
Khristoforov said according to the documents , Andropov 's decision to destroy the remains of the Nazi leaders and their family members was motivated by the fears of the KGB and Soviet Communist Party leadership that Hitler 's burial site could become a place of worship for supporters of fascist ideas .
Neither the FSB nor Khristoforov were immediately available to comment on the secret documents , when asked by CNN .
The operation , code - named " The Archives , " was carried out by a group of special KGB agents in Magdeburg , East Germany , where the bodies had been secretly buried February 21 , 1946 , on the territory of a Soviet military facility , Khristoforov said .
Two protocols were compiled after the operation was carried out on April 4 , 1970 , the general said .
The first documented the opening of a grave that contained the remains of the Nazi leaders and their family members , and the other one detailed their physical destruction .
" The remains were burnt on a bonfire outside the town of Shoenebeck , 11 kilometers away from Magdeburg , then ground into ashes , collected and thrown into the Biederitz River , " the second document reads , according to Khristoforov .
The bodies of Hitler , Braun and the Goebbels family had been discovered by the Soviet Army in May 1945 .
The bodies of Goebbels and his wife were found May 2 in the garden of Nazi Germany 's Reich Chancellery .
The bodies of the couple 's children were recovered the next day , and the corpses of Hitler and Braun were discovered May 5 in a crater from an artillery shell outside his bunker in Berlin .
According to historical accounts , Hitler 's death was a combination of a suicide by gunshot and cyanide poisoning on April 30 , 1945 , when the Soviet Army entered the Nazi Germany capital .
In early June of that year , the Soviets buried the bodies in a forest near the town of Rathenau , Germany .
Eight months later , they secretly re-buried the remains in the Soviet Army 's garrison in Magdeburg .
But in March 1970 , the Soviets decided to abandon the garrison and pass it over to the East German civilian authorities .
As long as the burial place of the Nazi leaders was in the territory of a Soviet garrison , it could be kept secret and barred from strangers .
But following relocation of the Soviet Army unit , the decision was made not to rebury Hitler 's remains but to burn them , Khristoforov explained , calling it " perhaps a reasonable decision " given the circumstances .
Khristoforov said that all that remains of Hitler 's corpse are fragments of his jawbone and skull , items that are kept in Russia .
The general said the Russian FSB has no doubts that the bone fragments are genuine .
No other fragments of the German dictator exist in other countries , he said .
" Hitler 's jaw is kept at the FSB archives , and the fragments of Hitler 's skull are at the State Archive .
There are no other parts of Hitler 's body apart from these samples seized on May 5 , 1945 .
" Everything [ else ] that remained of Hitler was burnt in 1970 , " he added .
" Those fragments are ... the only documented evidence of Hitler 's death , which is why they are kept at the Russian FSB Central Archive as being particularly valuable . "
Commenting on recent media reports that archeologist and bone specialist Nick Bellantoni and genetics professor Linda Strausbaugh of the University of Connecticut expressed doubts about the authenticity of the parts of Hitler 's skull , Khristoforov said , " The U.S. researchers did not file such requests [ for taking DNA samples ] with the Russian FSB Central Archive .
" But even if you take the fragments kept in our custody , it is unclear what these data can be compared with . "
In April 2000 , a fragment of what was presented as Hitler 's skull , complete with a bullet hole in it , was first displayed in Moscow at a World War II exhibition .
At the time , Sergei Mironenko , head of the Russian State Archives , told CNN that he is absolutely confident that the skull was authentic , and that there are many documents the Russian archives also put on display along with the skull to support that .
" Those documents provide convincing proof that all those speculations that Hitler could have survived and escaped , that he could have had plastic surgery , are absolutely groundless .
He was a totally depressed man who was incapable of making political or any other kinds of decisions .
He understood that his bunker , the crater [ where he was found dead ] , would become his last refuge .
And that 's exactly what happened , " Mironenko said .

The new head of environmental group Greenpeace , South African Kumi Naidoo , says he will prioritise the impact of climate change on the world 's poor .
A BBC reporter in Johannesburg says it reflects his background as a anti-poverty and anti-apartheid campaigner .
In a BBC interview , he also criticised the US president for failing to make the fate of the earth a priority .
He said Barack Obama no longer reflected the urgency about the planet he had during his election campaign .
Mr Naidoo is the first African to head Greenpeace since it was founded in 1971 .
The group has perfected the art of using high - profile media events to exert pressure on politicians and big business .
' Disappointed '
The BBC's Jonah Fisher in South Africa say for Greenpeace the appointment of Mr Naidoo marks a continuing shift in focus from whaling and nuclear testing to climate change .
We can't change the science .
The science is clear .
We have to change the politics
Greenpeace head Kumi Naidoo
Campaign group : Greenpeace Mr Naidoo said human existence on the planet was " fundamentally under threat " by climate change .
" We are seeing every year now , 300,000 more people dying from what can be described as climate - related impacts , " he told the BBC .
" We 're talking about climate refugees and so on , connecting all of those existing focus on the environment with human concerns , is both the right thing to do . "
He said Mr Obama had lost his urgency on the issue .
" During his election campaign ... every single speech that he gave , he talked about a planet in peril , referring to climate change , " Mr Naidoo said .
" We all understood that he ' got ' it . "
Green Room : Kumi Naidoo
On Sunday , Mr Obama and other world leaders meeting in Singapore said it would not be possible to reach a climate change deal ahead of next month 's UN conference in Copenhagen .
Mr Naidoo said he was " quite disappointed " that Mr Obama had not yet announced clearly his intention to attend the summit .
At the two - day Asia - Pacific summit , world leaders dropped a target to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , which was outlined in an earlier draft .
" Anything short of a binding treaty in Copenhagen must be read as a failure of leadership on the part of the political class , " AP news agency quoted him as saying on Monday .
" We can't change the science .
The science is clear .
We have to change the politics .
If we can't change the politics , then we have to put our energies into changing the politicians . "

GIVE VOTERS A REASON ….
The latest Research 2000 poll for Daily Kos included the usual question on the generic congressional ballot , with Dems still enjoying a modest edge over Republicans , 37 % to 32 % , with 31 % unsure .
Democratic numbers were strongest in the Northeast ( 53 % Dems , 7 % GOP ) , and Republican numbers were strongest in the South ( 51 % GOP , 21 % Dems ) .
But this poll added a new question to the mix to measure voter enthusiasm :
“ In the 2010 Congressional elections will you definitely vote , probably vote , not likely vote , or definitely will not vote ? ”
The overall results are n’t nearly as interesting as the partisan breakdown .
Among self - identified Republican voters , 81 % are either “ definitely ” voting next year or “ probably ” voting , while 14 % are “ not likely ” to vote or will “ definitely ” not vote .
Among self - identified Independent voters , 65 % are either “ definitely ” voting next year or “ probably ” voting , while 23 % are “ not likely ” to vote or will “ definitely ” not vote .
And among self - identified Democratic voters , 56 % are either “ definitely ” voting next year or “ probably ” voting , while 40 % are “ not likely ” to vote or will “ definitely ” not vote .
Markos , who called the results “ shocking , ” explained :
Two in five Democratic voters either consider themselves unlikely to vote at this point in time , or have already made the firm decision to remove themselves from the 2010 electorate pool .
Indeed , Democrats were three times more likely to say that they will “ definitely not vote ” in 2010 than are Republicans .
This enormous enthusiasm gap … seems to make passing legitimate health care reform an absolute political necessity for Democrats .
This polling data certainly should be something for Congressional leadership to consider , as they move along the legislative path .
The notion of an enthusiasm gap this year is not exactly new , but we have n’t seen numbers quite this stark until now .
The results are n’t a total surprise .
President Obama , working with a Democratic Congress , generated high hopes .
As the year progressed , the GOP base was worked into a frenzy , based on little but rage , ignorance , and confusion , while the Democratic base grew frustrated and impatient .
They did their part on Election Day , and there ’s a sense that Democratic leaders are n’t doing their part now .
Policymakers have gone the better part of nine months without any major legislative accomplishments .
That , coupled with a still - struggling economy , is not a recipe for widespread satisfaction .
To be sure , there are some explanations for the political paralysis .
For the last six months , policymakers tackled the toughest policy challenge of them all — health care reform — which left little room for anything else .
Plus , now that the Senate no longer operates on majority rule , passing anything even mildly noteworthy has become harder than at any point in American history .
But these explanations , while true , do n’t change the larger dynamic — the motivated right is still convinced the president is Hitler , and the listless left is still waiting for progress .
It ’s obviously not too late , and a great deal can happen over the next 10 or so months .
What ’s more , the solution is n’t exactly a mystery — if Dems do what they were elected to do , they ’ll be pleased with the results .
I keep thinking about something Rep. Gerald Connolly ( D - Va. ) said earlier this month : “ We must deliver .
I need to give Democrats something to be excited about . ”
Finish health care .
Pass a jobs bill .
Finish the climate bill .
Re-regulate the financial industry .
Finish the education bill .
Pick up immigration reform .
Repeal “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell . ”
It ’s ambitious , but a Democratic Congress and a Democratic president can prove to the country that they know how to tackle the issues that matter and know how to get things done .
The R2K / Daily Kos poll should n’t cause panic among Democratic leaders ; it should serve as a wake - up call .
Neighbours ' fury as BT chairman is only person in village to get high - speed broadband
Reaping the benefits : BT Chairman Sir Michael Rake
BT has sparked anger after it was revealed the company 's chairman has been provided with highspeed broadband at his rural home - even though the rest of the Oxfordshire village where he lives does not have access .
Sir Michael
Rake bought a home in the Oxfordshire village of Hambleden , near Henley - on - Thames , a year ago .
One of his neighbours has been trying to get broadband installed for five years , even though Hambleden has been classified as a ' not spot ' where the service is not available .
Gary Ashworth , head of Abacus Recruitment , was furious when he discovered Sir Michael had broadband installed at his home as part of a ' small trial ' .
The chairman of BT is given preferential treatment over long - serving customers .
' I run a business and we probably have 1,000 BT lines .
Clearly there is preferential treatment if you happen to be the chairman .
I think it is a disgrace . '
Mr Ashworth , 49 , told how he received email from BT 's executive complaints desk after he wrote to the telecoms giant .
It said that Sir Michael was one of a small number of people involved in a trial to test out the commercial feasibility of new technology .
The email , from Shirley Mackie , said : '' I understand the frustrations regarding broadband for the people in Hambleden .
' At the moment we are trialling broadband enabling technology ( BET ) at 10 locations in the UK .
We can confirm Sir Michael Rake is trialling BET at his home .
The pilot is very small and involves a handful of users at this stage . '
When Mr Ashworth asked if he could participate in the trail , BT said no one else could be added until 2010 .
He said : ' Sir Michael Rake is the only person allowed to participate in the trial in our area .
He moved into the village a year ago and surprise , surprise , he has got broadband . '
He was told it would cost £ 68,000 to run broadband especially to his house .
The Parish Church of St Peter in Hambleden :
The village has been classified as an internet ' not spot ' even though it is just 35 miles from London
A BT spokesman said : ' Trials of new technologies are often conducted among a company 's own staff so there is nothing unusual in this situation , ' the spokesman said .
' BT has learnt a lot through the trial the chairman participated in and hopefully those lessons will benefit the residents of Hambleden in due course . '
There was no way of provding the service to Hambleden that was commercially viable , the spokesman added .
Paul Goodman , Tory MP for Wycombe , said : ' The lack of broadband in the Hambleden Valley is a very serious problem for my constituents .
' Unless all BT staff members are entitled to participate in the trial on exactly the same terms , I think some of my constituents will find this very strange . '
The Government has promised to upgrade everyone to braodband by 2012 .
A ' broadband tax ' of 50 p a month on phone bills would be used to pay for the upgrade .
For the CIA supervisors and operatives responsible for torture , the chickens are coming home to roost ; that is , if President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder mean it when they say no one is above the law – and if they do n’t fall victim to brazen intimidation .
Unable to prevent Holder from starting an investigation of torture and other war crimes that implicate CIA officials past and present , those same CIA officials , together with what those in the intelligence trade call " agents of influence " in the media , are pulling out all the stops to quash the Justice Department ’s preliminary investigation .
In what should be seen as a bizarre twist , seven CIA directors – including three who are themselves implicated in planning and conducting torture and assassination – have asked the president to call off Holder .
Please , tell me how could the whole thing be more transparent ?
The most vulnerable of the Gang of Seven , George Tenet , is not the brightest star in the heavens , but even he was able to figure out years ago that he and his accomplices might end up having to pay a heavy price for violating international and U.S. criminal law .
In his memoir , At the Center of the Storm , Tenet notes that what the CIA needed were " the right authorities " and policy determination to do the bidding of then - president George W. Bush :
" Sure , it was a risky proposition when you looked at it from a policy maker ’s point of view .
We were asking for and we would be given as many authorities as CIA had ever had .
Things could blow up .
People , me among them , could end up spending some of the worst days of our lives justifying before congressional overseers our new freedom to act . " ( p. 178 )
Tenet and his masters assumed , correctly , that given the mood of the times and the lack of spine among lawmakers , congressional " overseers " would relax into their accustomed role as congressional overlookers .
Unfortunately for him , Tenet seems to have confined his concern at the time to the invertebrates in Congress , not anticipating a rejuvenated Justice Department that might take its role in enforcing the law seriously .
Tenet proudly quotes his former counterterrorism chief , Cofer Black ( now a senior official at Blackwater ) : " As Cofer Black later told Congress , ‘ The gloves came off that day . ’ "
That day was Sept. 17 , 2001 , when " the president approved our recommendations and provided us broad authorities to engage al - Qa’ida . " ( p. 208 )
Presumably , it was not lost on Tenet that no lawmaker dared ask exactly what Cofer Black meant when he said " the gloves came off . "
Had they thought to ask Richard Clarke , former director of the counterterrorist operation at the White House , he could have told them what he wrote in his book , Against All Enemies .
Clarke describes a meeting in which he took part with then - president George W. Bush in the White House bunker just minutes after Bush ’s TV address to the nation on the evening of 9/11 .
When the subject of international law was raised , Clarke writes that the president responded vehemently : " I do n’t care what the international lawyers say , we are going to kick some ass . " ( p. 24 )
It only took Bush six days to grant the CIA the " broad authorities " the agency had recommended .
It then took then - White House counsel Alberto Gonzales , then - vice president Dick Cheney ’s lawyer David Addington , and William J. Haynes II , then - defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld ’s lawyer , four more months to advise the president formally that , by fiat , he could ignore the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war .
This gang of lawyers so advised at the turn of 2001 - 2002 , beating down objections by William Howard Taft IV , then - secretary of state Colin Powell ’s lawyer .
Bush chose to follow the dubious advice of imaginative lawyers in his and Dick Cheney ’s employ ; namely , that 9/11 ushered in a " new paradigm " rendering the Geneva protections " quaint " and " obsolete . "
Prosecutorial Warning
Addington and Gonzales did take care to warn the president , by memorandum of Jan. 25 , 2002 , of the risk of criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 2441 , the War Crimes Act of 1996 .
Their memo said :
" That statute , enacted in 1996 , prohibits the commission of a ‘ war crime ’ by or against a U.S. person , including U.S. officials .
‘ War crime ’ … is defined to include any grave breach of the GPW [ Geneva ] or any violation of Article 3 thereof ( such as outrages against personal dignity ) .
… Punishments for violations of Section 2441 include the death penalty ….
" [ I ]t is difficult to predict the motives of prosecutors or independent counsels who may in the future decide to pursue unwarranted charges based on Section 2441 .
Your determination [ that Geneva does not apply ] would create a reasonable basis in law that Section 2441 does not apply , which would provide a solid defense to any future prosecution . "
With that kind of pre-ordered reassurance , Bush issued a two - page executive directive [ . pdf ] in which he stated , " I accept the legal conclusion of the Department of Justice and determine that common Article 3 of Geneva does not apply to either al - Qaeda or Taliban detainees … . "
This is the smoking gun on Bush ’s key role in the subsequent torture of " war on terror " prisoners .
The Senate Armed Services Committee issued a report last December stating that that Feb. 7 memorandum " opened the door " to abusive interrogation practices .
Unhappily for Bush and those who carried out his instructions , on June 29 , 2006 , in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Geneva DOES apply to al - Qaeda and Taliban detainees .
One senior Bush administration official is reported to have gone quite pale at the time , when Justice Anthony M. Kennedy raised the ante , warning that “ violations of Common Article 3 are considered ‘ war crimes , ’ punishable as federal offenses . ”
What about U.S. criminal law ?
Despite the almost laughable attempts by lawyers like Addington and John Yoo to get around the War Crimes
Act by advising that only the kind of pain accompanying major organ failure or death can be considered torture , those involved are now in a cold sweat – the more so , since those dubious opinions have now been publicly released .
Evidence of Torture
In releasing the sordid , torture - approving memoranda written by Justice Department lawyers and a critical " Special Review " by the CIA ’s own horse ’s - mouth inspector general , Obama and Holder had to face down very strong pressure from those with the most to lose – former CIA directors and the functionaries ( some of them in senior CIA positions to this very day ) who were responsible for seeing to it that " the gloves came off . "
Now , out in the public domain is all the evidence needed to show that war crimes were committed – " authorized " as legal by Justice Department Mafia - type lawyers recruited for that express purpose – but war crimes nonetheless .
Torture , kidnapping , illegal detention – not to mention blatant violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) outlawing eavesdropping on Americans without a court warrant .
The stakes are incredibly high .
No wonder the CIA and its " agents of influence " ( see Saturday ’s lead story in the Washington Post ) are going all out .
According to the story , seven former CIA directors wrote a letter to Obama on Sept. 18 asking him to " reverse Attorney General Holder ’s August 24 decision to re-open the criminal investigation of CIA interrogations that took place following the attacks of September 11 . "
This is the saddest commentary on CIA covert action operatives ’ disdain for the law since their predecessors loudly applauded former director Richard Helms for lying to Congress about the CIA role in the overthrow of Salvador Allende on 9/11/73 .
The largest CIA cafeteria was bulging with welcoming supporters of Helms , when the court got finished with him .
They then took up a collection on the spot to pay the fine the court had imposed after he was allowed to plead nolo contendere .
Among the most transparent parts of the letter from the Gang of Seven is their corporate worry that " there is no reason to expect that the re-opened criminal investigation will remain narrowly focused . "
Their worry is all too real .
Evidence already on the public record shows that the first three listed – Michael Hayden , Porter Goss , and George Tenet – could readily be indicted for crimes under U.S. and international law , including :
Illegal eavesdropping by the National Security Agency : Hayden was NSA director when he ordered his employees to violate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which requires warrants from a special court before wiretaps are undertaken .
Assassination - planning without notification to Congress : Goss , whose uncommonly abrupt departure in May 2006 was never looked into by the Fawning Corporate Media ( FCM ) ; and Tenet ( who turned out to be right about at least one thing – that " things could blow up " ) .
The other " distinguished signatories " were :
John Deutch , arrogant to the point of criminality , Deutch disregarded the most elementary rules governing protection of classified information and had to be given a last - minute pardon by then - president Bill Clinton .
R. James Woolsey , the man who outdid himself in trying to tie Saddam Hussein to 9/11 and pushing into the limelight spurious intelligence from the fabricator known as " Curveball . "
( Remember those fictitious biological weapons labs for which Colin Powell displayed " artist renderings " to the UN on Feb. 5 , 2003 ? )
William Webster , known mostly at Langley for his handsome face and his devotion to his late - afternoon matches with socialite tennis partners .
( Folks like Webster should recognize that once they have reached what my lawyer father used to call " the age of statutory senility , " they should be more careful regarding what they let themselves be dragged into . )
James R. " Big Jim " Schlesinger launched his brief stint as CIA director by warning us CIA employees that his instructions were " to ensure that you guys do not screw Richard Nixon . "
To give substance to this assertion , he told us that the White House had said he was to report to political henchman Bob Haldeman – not Henry Kissinger , the national security adviser .
More recently , Schlesinger led one of the see - no - evil Defense Department " investigations " of the abuses of Abu Ghraib .
Quite a group , this Gang of Seven .
Their letter also is condescending toward President Obama : " As president you have the authority to make decisions restricting substantive interrogation . …
But the administration must be mindful that public disclosure about past intelligence operations can only help al - Qaeda elude U.S. intelligence and plan future operations . "
The seven then proceed to repeat the canard alleging that such operations " have saved lives and helped protect America from further attacks . "
It reads as though Dick Cheney did their first draft .
Actually , that would not be all that surprising , given his record of doing quite a lot of CIA ’s drafting for eight long years .
Hold firm , Holder .

A bill that encourages major college football to create a playoff system to replace the Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) passed a House subcommittee on Wednesday .
The bill passed the Commerce , Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee by voice vote on Wednesday morning after a markup session .
It is now up to House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) to bring it before the full committee .
ADVERTISEMENT
The bill ’s sponsor , Rep. Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) , told The Hill on Tuesday that Waxman has told him in private conversations that he is “ generally supportive ” of the bill .
Barton previously has said that President Barack Obama assured him he would sign the bill if it reaches his desk .
The College Football Playoff
Act of 2009 would ban promoting , marketing or advertising a " national championship game " unless the game is part of a single - elimination playoff tournament like the National Football League playoffs .
The bill threatens to hold college football 's governing body in violation of Federal Trade Commission truth - in - advertising provisions .
Under the BCS , two teams are selected based on human and computer rankings to play in the national championship game after the regular season .
The bill would apply to National Collegiate Athletic Association Football Bowl Subdivision teams , the top rung of college football .
Lowers levels of the sport already have playoff tournaments .
The markup is scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday .
Several lawmakers , including Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) and Barton , argue that the BCS is unfair to smaller schools because it often selects teams from large conferences to play in the national championship game .
Hatch 's home - state Utah Utes had an undefeated season in 2008 but were not selected to play in the championship .
The Utes play in the small Mountain West Conference .
Barton represents a district near Fort Worth , where Texas Christian University , which has the nation 's third - ranked team , is located .
TCU , which also plays in the Mountain West Conference , was undefeated this season but was not selected to play for the national championship .
Forty years ago today , black - and - white photographs of slaughtered women , children and old men in a Vietnamese village shocked the world -- or that portion of the world willing to believe American soldiers could gun down unarmed peasants and leave them to die in streets and ditches .
The Plain Dealer , in an international exclusive , was the first news outlet to publish the images of what infamously became known as the My Lai massacre , which had taken place on March 16 , 1968 .
" A clump of bodies , " read the description on the front page of The Plain Dealer 's Nov. 20 , 1969 , edition .
At first some people were in denial about how these South Vietnamese civilians were killed , even after seeing the pictures .
It was too hard , too painful , to comprehend .
ONLINE EXTRAS
Haeberle : Some photos destroyed
But the atrocities committed by soldiers in the U.S. Army 's Charlie Company were captured by combat photographer Sgt. Ron Haeberle , a Fairview High School graduate who'd been drafted after college .
The Army did not begin investigating My Lai until the spring of 1969 , a year after the killings , after a former member of Charlie Company sent a letter to government officials , including President Richard Nixon and numerous members of Congress .
Army investigators came to Cleveland to interview Haeberle in August 1969 .
Upon his honorable discharge from the Army the previous year , he 'd returned here and was occasionally giving slide - show talks to Kiwanis and Lions clubs about his war experience in general .
Those groups would never expect the horrific scenes he 'd documented .
" First , I showed all the good we did there , what the medics did , and photos of Vietnamese people smiling .
And then I 'd go to the My Lai photos , and there 'd be dead silence , " says Haeberle today , in one of his first U.S. interviews in many decades .
" They 'd say , ' No , this can't have happened .
That can't be true . ' "
They did n't want to believe it , as many people did n't when the photos were published , but it was true .
Unbelievable massacre still reverberates
On March 16 , 1968 , American soldiers , " the good guys , " who were not under fire , entered a village where residents were eating breakfast , rousted them from their homes , raped young girls and then killed them , their siblings , parents and grandparents .
When the injured moved among the corpses they lay with , they were shot again until they were still .
The U.S. Army set the number killed at 347 ; the memorial in My Lai lists the names of 504 dead .
The story of the My Lai massacre became a significant part of our nation 's history .
Twenty - six soldiers of the 50 - member unit were initially charged with criminal offenses for their actions , but only Lt. William Calley was convicted of premeditated murder .
He served three years of a life sentence under house arrest after President Nixon reduced his sentence .
Calley was silent about My Lai for 40 years , until making a public apology in August .
But the term " My Lai " still reverberates :
It 's mentioned when there are civilian casualties at the hands of U.S. or allied troops in Iraq or Afghanistan .
The Plain Dealer got the explosive My Lai photographs in November 1969 soon after Haeberle , then 28 , was contacted by Army investigators .
He called the newspaper , because The Plain Dealer was his hometown paper and because he recognized one of the bylines -- Joe Eszterhas .
They had attended Ohio University at the same time , and Eszterhas had edited the college paper .
" I did n't have any connections , so Joe was the logical person for me to call , " Haeberle says .
Earlier that same week , a story about the massacre , written by a free - lance writer named Seymour Hersh , was being distributed by a small news service .
The story was n't picked up by very many newspapers ; it was met with incredulity , since neither Hersh nor his news service were well - known .
Still , it garnered some notice .
Mike Roberts , then a Plain Dealer Washington bureau reporter who'd returned stateside after a year serving as the paper 's Vietnam correspondent , remembers that copies of Hersh 's story were slipped under office doors in the National Press Building .
" No one believed it , " said Roberts , of Orange Village .
" Bill Ware , the [ Plain Dealer 's ] executive editor , called ; he was n't sure if we should go with it .
Almost simultaneously , this kid comes forward with these pictures -- Haeberle 's photographs legitimized the story . "
Richard Conway , a retired Plain Dealer photographer in Solon , was working on the photo desk at the paper that night .
" This guy brought the slides in -- I took a look at them , and it was shocking , " he says .
" They were in color .
They showed the terror on people 's faces right before they were shot . "
Man behind camera never sought fame
The photographs would become historic in a war era that consumed a generation .
But Haeberle quietly returned to obscurity .
Forty years later , he continues to live a quiet life .
After the war , he returned here to work at Premier Industrial Corp. in Cleveland , where he was a supervisor .
For the rest of his career -- besides a brief stint as a photographer at Case Western Reserve University , which he found unexciting -- he worked as a supervisor at various manufacturing plants .
Today , he lives in a nondescript house in a new development in a far western Cleveland suburb .
He 's 68 , divorced and has a grown daughter .
On his mantel , there 's a Rube Goldberg sculpture trophy from 1969 , a journalism award for his photos that ran in Life magazine .
On his coffee table , there 's hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger 's book , " Highest Duty . "
Haeberle is fit and athletic -- he works out every day , whether at a spinning class , on the Pilates reformer he 's got at home , or on ultralong bike rides .
He also skis and kayaks .
In the spring , he often heads West and cycles through Utah -- " In Moab , I feel like an ant among the mountains " -- and California .
The only things he documents with his camera these days are his travels and the beauties of nature he finds during his travels .
In contrast to today 's celebrity - seekers , Haeberle is a throwback .
A low - key man by nature , he has almost never -- until now -- talked to reporters about 1969 and how those photos affected his life .
He did give a straightforward interview to the BBC in 1989 and will be part of a documentary about My Lai slated to run on PBS next year .
He does n't talk much about his moment in history .
But if the subject comes up , he 'll talk about those terrible four hours and why he kept shooting photos .
" That was my job -- I was walking around with two cameras strapped around me , mine and the Army's , and my job was to document wherever we went , what the unit did , " he says .
When Charlie Company landed in My Lai and began shooting people , Haeberle shot photos .
" It was reactive , " he says .
" I was trying to figure out , ' How am I going to capture the event and go back to headquarters and show them what we were doing ? ' "
But , he says , " I did n't make it to certain parts of the village where other things were going on , the rapes and the cutting of tongues and scalping and all that stuff .
I did n't see any of that .
" Later on , when I was interviewed by the CID [ the Army 's Criminal Investigation Division ] and they explained everything that happened there , I said , ' You 've got to be kidding me . '
I did n't know it was quite that bad . "
What was the My Lai massacre ?
The My Lai massacre occurred on March 16 , 1968 , less than three months after the start of the Tet Offensive , a series of surprise attacks by Viet Cong and North Vietnamese on U.S. troops .
By the time the U.S. Army 's Charlie Company headed for My Lai , it had lost several men to mines and booby traps .
The soldiers were warned that " VC " could be anyone and were hiding everywhere .
That set the scene for the unit 's attack and shootings that left hundreds dead in the village of My Lai .
Photographs changed lives , perceptions
On that night in 1969 , when Plain Dealer editors were considering publication , the evidence looked very , very bad .
" It was such a horrific idea that American troops could do this , to women and children , " says Conway of The Plain Dealer .
" I thought it was amazing we had these -- such a big story out of Vietnam . "
Of course , it was n't a fait accompli that the photos would run .
First , the paper had to verify that Haeberle was who he said he was .
That was confirmed when an Army prosecutor named Aubrey Daniel strongly suggested The Plain Dealer not publish Haeberle 's photos .
Conway was just one of many people who thought the images " might be a little too much for the paper . "
Publisher Thomas Vail had to approve publication , and he did .
Eszterhas later said that Plain Dealer editors were hopeful they'd win journalism prizes for the incendiary scoop .
Eszterhas , speaking from his home in Bainbridge Township earlier this month , well remembers the intensity of the hours leading up to publication .
" Daniel told us , ' You have no right to run those photos because [ Haeberle ] was using an Army camera , " Eszterhas recalls .
" And we told him he'd had his own camera , too . "
Eszterhas wrote the news story that accompanied the photos , and told of Haeberle 's experiences at My Lai .
He and Haeberle then sold the photos to Life magazine , sharing less than $ 20,000 .
" It was a huge scoop , " says Haeberle .
" It changed my life a little -- I got to travel a bit .
It changed Joe Eszterhas ' life a lot . "
Within a few years , Eszterhas had fallen out of favor and was fired from The Plain Dealer .
But he went on to write for Rolling Stone magazine and then became a successful Hollywood screenwriter who made millions .
Haeberle has never wanted to dwell on the events at My Lai .
But he has read books and watched several documentaries on My Lai , wanting to learn more about what happened in that village .
" My understanding was the company [ which he joined the morning of My Lai ] had been taking losses right and left , seeing their buddies killed by mines , and they 'd become hardened .

" But what happened that day did not have to happen .
No . No way . "
Does Haeberle feel his decision to share the photos with the newspaper changed history , or people 's lives ?
Quietly , nonchalantly , he says : " Oh , I 'm sure it did .
I 've talked to people over the years , Army people even , who did mention it helped bring a turning point to the war , bring about the end of the war , maybe .
" At least that part , that makes me feel good , that part coming out . "
Eszterhas , too , points out that the publication of the My Lai photos , coupled with the Kent State shootings six months later , which he also covered , began a critical shift in Americans ' perceptions of the Vietnam War .
In Vietnam , a shocking memorial
In 2000 , Haeberle went back to Vietnam for the first time .
He bought a number of original works by Vietnamese artists , which hang in his living room today .
Most are abstracts ; one is a black - and - white , delicately needleworked portrait of a woman , gracefully reaching one arm toward the sky .
He and a group of cyclist friends biked 775 miles from Hanoi to Saigon , now Ho Chi Minh City , with stops along the way .
One was at My Lai , where women still push and pull water buffalo alongside green rice fields and where there is now a museum and peace garden memorializing the dead .
Haeberle 's traveling friends knew of his role in My Lai 's past .
" But we just kept it quiet .
They were protective . "
He walked into the small museum -- " It 's beautiful , " he says -- and was shocked to see the 16 - by - 20 - inch photos on the wall .
The massacre photos were all his , some color , some black - and - white ; there was even a black - and - white shot of him .
" I never gave them the photos , " he explains .
" So the Army must have . "
He wo n't say he got choked up , exactly , but he was affected by being in that space , his own powerful images of horror looking back at him from the walls .
" I found myself making an apology for what happened , " he says .
" I walked around by myself .
No one else was around , and I was making silent amends .
" For something that did n't have to happen , but did . "

Dec. 1 marks the 21st celebration of World AIDS Day , an international day to raise awareness about HIV / AIDS .
Worldwide 33.4 million people live with HIV / AIDS , according to international AIDS charity , AVERT .
Of those 33.4 million people , 1 million live in the United States .
Every year the United States adds 56,000 people to that number .
To bring the number closer to home , 15,412 Ohioians live with HIV / AIDS , according to the Ohio Department of Health .
In Hamilton County , 1,949 people live with HIV / AIDS .
Other urban areas across the state also have staggering statistics : Cuyahoga County , home to Cleveland , has 3,298 people living with HIV / AIDS , while Franklin County , home to Columbus , has 3,023 people .
The AIDS epidemic took the world by surprise .
There still is no cure for HIV / AIDS .
The treatment is very expensive , and most people worldwide have limited or no access to the life - prolonging drug cocktails .
It is no surprise more than 25 million people have died of AIDS since 1981 , when the first HIV / AIDS cases were brought to light .
After many years of study , researchers have discovered HIV is spread through contact with an infected person ’s blood , semen , vaginal secretions or breast milk , usually during unprotected genital contact , sharing syringes or needles and , less frequently , blood transfusions .
Currently , prevention and early detection are becoming the route to battle HIV / AIDS .
Local organizations like Stop AIDS provide free , confidential testing at their offices and in mobile testing centers .
The University of Cincinnati Wellness Center even partners with Stop AIDS quarterly to bring the free testing directly to students .
Knowing your status is integral to stopping the spread of HIV , well , knowledge and practicing safer sex .
The UC Wellness Center also provides three free condoms a day to students , as well as other goodies such as lube , dental dams , adhesive bandages and pain relievers .
A student simply has to pop into the office in 675 Steger Student Life Center to pick up the swag and help stop the spread of HIV .
Other organizations such as Planned Parenthood also distribute condoms or safer sex kits .
Stop AIDS also provides other services in addition to free testing , including educating HIV + people about accessing treatment and other resources .
Services like financial counseling , transportation , housing assistance and chemical and alcohol dependency are among the array offered by Stop AIDS .
For more information call 513-421-2437 .
Other programs like syringe exchanges swap used syringes for sterile ones with intravenous drug users .
The reasoning behind these programs is people are using intravenous drugs and spreading HIV / AIDS in the process .
By offering a needle exchange , these groups are not promoting drug use , but decreasing the risk of contracting blood borne pathogens like HIV .
Currently , Cincinnati has no such program , and 7 percent of Ohio ’s HIV / AIDS cases can be credited to intravenous drug use .
In honor of World AIDS Day , people across the globe attend vigils or remembrance services .
Red ribbons are everywhere , even University of Cincinnati ’s McMicken Commons has them .
Facebook statuses , Tweets and blogs are devoted to the topic or go red for the day .
While all of this awareness raising is good , we still need to take action .
Wearing a red ribbon will not eradicate HIV / AIDS , but education , getting tested , having safer sex and using sterile syringes will curb the spread of HIV .
There is no cure .
The only option is to prevent it .

A Caesarean delivery may be required when labour fails to progress naturally Expectant mums who are low in a hormone made by the thyroid gland in the neck are more likely to struggle in labour , findings suggest .
Too little of the hormone thyroxine is already known to complicate pregnancy , increasing the risk of miscarriage , premature birth and pre-eclampsia .
Now a Dutch team has found even " low to normal " levels of thyroxine may cause problems , Clinical Endocrinology says .
Babies were more often positioned wrongly , making labour more difficult .
Although still head down , the babies tended to face the wrong way - towards their mother 's back rather than stomach .
Not only are these labours generally longer and harder , they are also more likely to end in an assisted delivery with forceps , ventouse or a Caesarean .
It does highlight the importance of checking thyroid hormone levels in pregnancy
Hormone expert Professor John Lazarus
The researchers from the University of Tilburg believe the hormone problem is so common - affecting about one in 10 pregnancies - a blood test for it should become a routine part of the antenatal check .
In their study of nearly 1,000 apparently healthy mums - to - be , lower levels of thyroxine at 36 weeks of pregnancy was strongly linked to abnormal positioning of the baby 's head and risk of assisted delivery .
Possible cause Professor Victor Pop and his team believe the relative lack of hormone might stop the unborn child moving as well as it should .
This means that instead of getting into the optimal position for labour , the baby is stuck in a more awkward one .
THYROID PROBLEMS
The thyroid gland in the neck makes hormones that regulate metabolism
Too much of these hormones speeds up metabolism causing symptoms like weight loss and anxiety
Too few of the hormones slows metabolism causing problems like fatigue and weight gain Medication can correct the imbalance Professor Pop said : " Recent findings have shown that motor development in children at the age of two is related to low levels of thyroid hormone in pregnancy .
" It follows that impaired maternal thyroid function could also influence foetal movement . "
The baby is unable to make its own thyroid hormones until 20 weeks into the pregnancy .
Before this , it is entirely reliant on its mother 's stores , he said .
Professor
Pop said more work was needed to explain the link found and to see if giving pregnant women extra thyroxine , even if they do not have full - blown thyroid disease , would be beneficial .
Professor John Lazarus , an expert in endocrinology at Cardiff University School of Medicine , said the link found was not necessarily causal .
" However it does highlight the importance of checking thyroid hormone levels in pregnancy . "

If you 've ever played D&D ( or any other role - playing game ) , you 've likely run into the dungeoncrawl .
For those of you who 've never experienced the delight , the typical dungeoncrawl goes something like this :
The adventurers head to a mountain or abandoned castle .
They enter a door and go down a set of stairs ( suitably worn by time and the elements )
They enter a corridor of dressed stone with doors every so often .
Sometimes there are torches , sometimes not .
Behind each door is a room .
Each room is a rectangle with dimensions in multiples of 5 or 10 feet .
In each room is a group of monsters that the adventurers fight .
When killed , the monsters have a pile of treasure just sitting there in the corner .
The monsters in the various rooms have absolutely no relationship to one another .
In other words , it 's completely and utterly unbelievable and no amount of suspension of disbelief can transport the reader ( or player ) into the world .
While role - playing games are notorious for this kind of " world - building " ( and I use the term generously ) , books are supposed to be different .
They 're supposed to be better than that .
Settings are supposed to be researched and built with loving care .
If it 's a sci - fi setting , the technologies should be believable with minor leaps of disbelief .
If it 's a fantasy setting , the societies are supposed to work within the confines of the technology restrictions .
And most author do n't bother .
This wiki is an attempt to provide worlds that actually make sense .
Sci - fi settings that has believable technologies , believable polities ( where a polity is n't a species just because ) , and believable interactions between them .
Fantasy settings where actual economics and weather are taken into account .
Above all , the settings should be writable - good stories should be able to flourish within it .
We hope that authors will take these settings and write wonderful stories within them .
To all friends , family , readers and random passers - by : Thank you for coming to my site and I hope you have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year !
This tree was decorated with the help of a few scrapped boards from the late 80s and early 90s .
The red components are relays and there are a few electrolytic capacitors scattered throughout .
The LEDs were scavenged from a display board and set to pulse with a Source Meter that was sweeping current from 0 to 10 mA .
High precision resistors could also be found on the tree , although it may be tough to tell they were actually high precision .
The star at the top of the tree was made from 5 DIP package op amps and one can op amp .

This subject seems to have hit a nerve , and there ’s been outstanding feedback in the comments .
Some of it makes a good case for changes in the series articles , and others just need more attention than I think they ’ll get down in the comment section .
[ This is part of the Concur . next series .
To avoid this getting too meta , maybe confine your comments & contributions to one of the mainstream articles in this series , as opposed to comments on comments on comments here ? ]
Python / Twisted · Terry Jones argues that this combo is a winner for asyc event - driven systems .
I ’m not sure it ’s sufficiently accessible to mainstream programmers , but it ’d surprise me not at all if the Java of Concurrency ended up being a library or framework building on an existing mainstream language .
GCD / Libdispatch · Several people pointed at Apple ’s new Grand Central Dispatch , the libdispatch layer of which has been open - sourced .
( Reading about GCD makes me think of java.util.concurrent . )
While I ’m open to the idea of library - based solutions to these problems , I really doubt that the application programmers of the future are going to return to any flavor of C. Second , unless I ’m misreading things , GCD handles the case of a bunch of things needing sequential access to a single resource , as well as things that can run entirely in parallel .
My instinct is that there are a lot of application situations where the concurrency problems do n’t fall into either of those neat baskets .
But I ’d love to be proved wrong .
Biases · Wes Felter suggests I have a Web bias , since I do n’t mention any of OpenCL , OpenMP , Cilk ++ , Ct , TBB , GCD , and so on .
Guilty as charged , in particular if you change “ Web ” to “ Net ” .
If you want to do vectorized computation , particularly in one of the C languages , there are some pretty good tools .
I think there ’s a big interesting problem space where this kind of thing does n’t help .
I also freely admit to not even recognizing some of those acronyms ; if the Java of concurrency is lurking inside one of those , somebody needs to write an educated post explaining why , and I ’ll link to it .
Bob Foster accuses me of Java - centric bias , asking “ what about F# , Axum , LINQ ( and DryadLINQ ) ” .
Rich Hickey , AKA the Clojure Guy , suggests at length that I ’m biased toward Erlang , and makes some good points too ; follow that link .
I think I ’d better write another short piece in this series laying my own biases and viewpoints .
This is a blog , right , and there ’s no point pretending I ’m neutral , but I should at least be transparent .
Save the Earth · Greg Pfister , who writes a lot about this area , says that you get a net saving in energy per unit of computation done by running the computation on multiple low - gigahertz / watt processors .
That could be a really big deal .
Erlang Ecch · Cedric
Beust offers a rant as to why Erlang is not the way forward , which I ’ll just link to without further comment .
[ Update : Steve Vinoski fires back below in the comments . ]
Why Java ? · I find the comments on the Java piece instructive and amusing too ; they offer a bucket - load of other reasons why it was that Java went over the top , notably including JDBC and applets .
But the one that really made nod was from Erik Engbrecht :
I 'd like to add that Java lacks any sort of language - level metaprogramming system and has highly regular , inflexible syntax .
To get Java , you basically take Smalltalk and remove all of the powerful concepts from it while leaving in the benign ones that everyday developers use .
I think there 's something to be learned from that .
Laundry List Diffs · Steve Vinoski points out that I left out distribution , required at least for reliability and for lots of other stuff these days .
I think he ’s right .
There was some discussion of the whole Tail Call thing and I increasingly think it ’s orthogonal to this debate , so unless someone has a good reason for disagreeing , I ’ll toss it out .
Oops , I was wrong , Haskell compiles to native code as opposed to using a VM .
Keep ’em Coming · I think we ’re jointly building something here of lasting value that might be really beneficial to whichever bright creative software person eventually runs out of patience and ends up building whatever it is we need to make things run better in a concurrent world .
The One Who Got Away
IAEA Promotes International Cooperation in Nuclear Fusion Research
- By Chrisrtopher Smith -
The International Fusion Research Council ( IFRC ) advises the IAEA Director General on matters relating to nuclear fusion .
It last met in Vienna , Austria , on 14 October 2009 .
Fusion , a form of nuclear energy created by the merging of light atoms , could provide the world with a safe , environmentally responsible and abundant source of energy .
However , one of the greatest challenges faced by the scientific community today is demonstrating the scientific and technological feasibility of harnessing the power nuclear fusion generates .
To better tackle this challenge , the international fusion community is joining forces and stepping up collaboration , particularly around the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( ITER ) , the world´s first demonstration reactor for fusion power currently under construction in the South of France .
ITER and the IAEA are implementing a cooperative agreement , signed last October , where both organizations exchange information regarding the study and potential application of fusion energy , participate in each other´s meetings and organize joint scientific conferences .
The agreement also includes cooperation on training , publications , plasma physics and modelling , and fusion safety and security .
In addition , the IAEA has a fusion programme which focuses on increasing international cooperation and support for science and technology for fusion power .
" The Member States of the IAEA are showing interest in the new results emerging through the framework of International Tokamak Physics Activity ( ITPA ) meetings , " noted Yury Sokolov , IAEA Deputy Director General for Nuclear Energy at the last International Fusion Research Council Meeting in Vienna .
One of the most visible physics - related activities of ITER , the ITPA provides essential support to ITER activities in addressing key R&D needs .
" Through its involvement in IAEA activities ITER has a good opportunity to address the interest of other member countries , " added ITER Director General Kaname Ikeda .
" There is nothing to be gained by being exclusive ; scientific knowledge should be shared with the scientific community worldwide . "
Fusion and Fission
Another important avenue for increased collaboration is cooperation between fusion and fission experts , particularly those working on nuclear power and fuel cycle development .
Collaboration in cross-cutting issues , like research on radiation damage under high dose irradiation , benefits both communities .
To help support such collaboration , the IAEA promotes close cooperation among its programmes and has begun to organize meetings on common areas of interest , like the development of new structural materials for advanced fission and fusion reactor systems .
The International Fusion Research Council ( IFRC ) was created in 1972 to advise the Director General of the IAEA on matters relating to the Agency´s controlled nuclear fusion programme and to promote international cooperation in this field .
It meets annually and consists of 10 to 15 members , who serve in their individual capacities .
The IFRC last met in Vienna , Austria , on 14 October 2009 .
ITER is the world´s first demonstration reactor for fusion power .
It is being built in Cadarache in the South of France as a joint venture between China , the European Union , India , Japan , the Republic of Korea , the Russian Federation and the USA .
COPENHAGEN 
In the first major police action since United Nations climate talks began here on Monday , Danish law enforcement officers fanned out across the city Friday morning in anticipation of protests at various corporate targets , including McDonald ’s , a Danish industry association headquarters and the shipping giant Maersk .
Several arrests have already been made , according to the police , as protesters continued to move out from a meeting point in the city center .
Roughly 250 protesters descended on Nytorv Square near the Copenhagen city courthouse at 10 a.m.  many apparently responding to a directive issued online earlier this month at notyourbusiness.hacklab.dk .
Photocopies of a map detailing 15 potential targets , along with instructions , could be seen circulating among the gathered crowd .
A 7 - Eleven convenience store facing the square had boarded up its windows in anticipation of trouble .

Killjoy council chiefs have been forced into a U - turn after banning garden gnomes on health and safety grounds .
Linda Langford , 57 , was told her two six - inch gnomes must be moved from outside her council flat because they were a “ fire hazard ” and people could trip over them .
Linda said : “ It ’s barmy .
The idea my gnomes are dangerous in any way is ridiculous . ”
But last night the councillor who drew up the rules backed down .
At first Councillor Mahboob Hussain had said : “ This is about fire regulations .
Whatever people say , safety comes first . ”
But later Mr Hussain apologised and said a housing association had misinterpreted his rules too strictly .
He said : “ As long as there is not an excessive number of gnomes , or similar items they can stay . ”
The ornaments – one hitting an anvil , the other reading a book – have stood in the corridor outside Linda ’s home in Tipton , West Midlands , for the last nine years .
But they were deemed a to be hazard by Sandwell borough council along with a doormat and a welcome plaque .
Efforts will be stepped up tomorrow to suppress evidence of British involvement in the unlawful treatment of a UK resident , Binyam Mohamed , who says he was tortured in Pakistan , Morocco , and Afghanistan before being secretly rendered to Guantánamo Bay .
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , is appealing against six high court judgments ruling that CIA information on Mohamed 's treatment , and what MI5 and MI6 knew about it , must be disclosed .
In a case which lawyers on all sides agree is unprecedented , counsel for the Guardian and other media organisations , Mohamed and two civil rights groups , Liberty and Justice , will argue tomorrow that the public interest in disclosing the role played by British and US agencies in unlawful activities far outweighs any claim about potential threats to national security .
Miliband 's lawyers will tell Britain 's three most senior appeal court judges , led by the lord chief justice , Igor Judge , that if the CIA material is disclosed the US might cut off the supply of intelligence to the UK , thus harming national security .
Since losing in the high court , David Millband has instructed one of the country 's most expensive advocates , Jonathan Sumption QC , to represent his position .
Sumption , who recently withdrew his application to become a justice of the supreme court after reports of " hostility " from other judges , is reported to earn up to £ 3 m a year and is described by experts as one of the bar 's " most formidable " opponents " .
Sources say the decision to instruct Sumption comes amid growing concern within the government at the high court rulings , which officials had confidently expected to be in their favour .
In their six judgments , Lord Justice Thomas and Justice Lloyd Jones repeatedly challenged Miliband 's claims .
It is the first case in which the high court has questioned head - on claims by a government that evidence must be withheld on grounds of national security .
At the heart of the dispute is a seven - paragraph CIA document that the British government insists must remain secret .
The two high court judges , who have seen the document , insist it does not contain any sensitive intelligence material .
" What is contained in those seven redacted paragraphs gives rise to an arguable case of torture or cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
The judges stated after hearing arguments put by Miliband 's lawyers : " It was in our view difficult to conceive that a democratically elected and accountable government could possibly have any rational objection to placing into the public domain such a summary of what its own officials reported as to how a detainee was treated by them and which made no disclosure of sensitive intelligence matters . "
They added : " Indeed we did not consider that a democracy governed by the rule of law would expect a court in another democracy to suppress a summary of the evidence contained in reports by its own officials , or officials of another state , where the evidence was relevant to allegations of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , politically embarrassing though it might be " .
The two high court judges continued : " The suppression of reports of wrongdoing by officials in circumstances which cannot in any way affect national security is inimical to the rule of law , " they ruled .
" A vital public interest requires ... that a summary of the most important evidence relating to the involvement of the British security services in wrongdoing be placed in the public domain ...
Championing the rule of law , not subordinating it , is the cornerstone of democracy , " they added .
The CIA information includes an account given to British intelligence " whilst [ Mohamed ] was held in Pakistan ... prior to his interview by an officer of the security service " , the judges revealed earlier this year .
The officer , known only as Witness B , is being investigated by the Metropolitan police for " possible criminal wrongdoing " .
Miliband 's claim that Britain 's intelligence relationship would be jeopardised " lacks credibility on its face " , the judges added .
The Guardian and other newspaper and broadcasting media groups argue that there is no wider public interest to be taken into account in the case than " open justice , the rule of law and democratic accountability " .
Miliband was accused in the high court of wanting to suppress information about CIA activities even though details had already been disclosed by the Obama administration .
Evidence that Miliband still wanted kept secret related to the question why " it was impossible to believe that President Obama would take action against the United Kingdom " , the judges said .
Lawyers acting for the foreign secretary point to a letter sent by the CIA to MI6 in April , saying that if British judges ordered the information at issue to be disclosed the US might reassess its intelligence - sharing relationship with the UK .
" The evidence that disclosure would cause serious harm to national security is overwhelming , " Miliband 's lawyers claim .
They point to a law lords ruling last year that the Serious Fraud Office could not pursue corruption allegations over arms sales by BAE Systems , Britain 's biggest weapons maker , to Saudi Arabia because the Saudi government had threatened to stop intelligence - sharing with Britain .
The case , in which Sumption also represented the government , has been described by critics as weakening the UK 's reputation for observing the rule of law .
Few arguments are as less well - researched and less grounded in logic than this one , but you 're bound to see it on the comments section of just about any article that mentions that a probe recently launched cost somewhere around $ 300 million or so .
All of a sudden the cry goes up to " please fix problems at home first before spending all that money on space ! " when 1 ) money spent on space is not only worthwhile for the exploratory value alone , not to mention protecting Earth from asteroids , giving nations warnings ahead of time of malaria outbreaks , natural disasters and what have you ; 2 ) the amount NASA receives of the federal budget is laughably low .
0.6 % of the total federal budget .
But there might be an even better way to demonstrate this .
Let 's take an article from yesterday on Citibank 's repayment of TARP funds and replace the numbers with " NASA until ( date ) " units to show how long NASA ( i.e. the entire American space program - the Shuttle , the American part of the ISS , the Ares rocket program under development , astronaut training , every single probe launched and maintained that NASA is responsible for plus everything else NASA manages to do with the money ) could be run using these funds that are being thrown around .
This is n't a " the banks are all evil and you 're owned by Wall Street " rant , just a demonstration of how laughably low NASA 's budget is to other numbers that one sees in the news every day .
Remember , this piece of news is about one single company .
The actual billions being talked about in the article are $ 10 , $ 13 , $ 20 , $ 7 , $ 306 , $ 17 , $ 3.5 , $ 20 , $ 19.3 , and $ 45 .
The best sentence there is probably the last one , where Bank of America is able to raise enough money in a week to run NASA for 13 months , money NASA has to spend months and months persuading Congress to get .
Of course , you could also just say that a single War in Iraq would pay for the American space program at current levels for the next 40 years .
December 25 , 2009 Archpastoral Message of His Beatitude , Metropolitan Jonah for the Nativity of Christ 2009
To the Very Reverend and Reverend Clergy ,
Monastics , and Faithful of
The Orthodox Church in America
Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ ,
Christ is Born ! Glorify Him !
We rejoice in the coming of the Savior , the Advent of the Son of God into this broken world .
His Nativity anticipates and prefigures His Second and Glorious Coming again in the flesh , not clothed in the swaddling bands of humility , for but a few years ; but in the radiant vesture of the Kingdom to reign forever .
For us Orthodox Christians , the Nativity of Christ is the Winter Pascha , and our celebration is rooted in the liturgical life of the Church ; the world ’s “ Xmas ” hymns go on and on , oblivious , rather intentionally , to the point of the celebration .
While we enjoy the worldly celebration , the family time , the gifts and giving , these are empty if we miss the central celebration itself : the services of the Nativity , culminating in receiving the Holy Mysteries .
We can have Christmas without the Nativity , as does the world ; but for Christians the Feast of the Nativity is Christmas !
We pray and fast to prepare ourselves for forty days before Christmas not only to be obedient to the Church , but to prepare ourselves to receive the Mystery of Communion .
Will this Christmas be unto salvation , discerning and receiving His Body — that same Body born of Mary and laid in the Manger , the Son of God who has taken flesh and likened himself to us , so that He might liken us to Himself ?
Or do we judge ourselves , unaware or oblivious to the Mystery of Christ ’s assumption of our nature .
We pray and fast to open our spiritual eyes , so that we can see Christ , discern Christ , know Christ — not just as a historical figure who taught nice things , but as God who has come and will come again .
The traditional Christmas carols talk about Baby Jesus lying in the manger .
Let us contemplate this mystery during this season , a mystery that at that time only His Mother really understood : that this little infant , no different than any other , would become the Savior of the world , and redeem mankind , indeed all of creation , from death .
What infinite potential , the potential of a man fulfilling the Divine Likeness , and manifesting God in His flesh , was invested in that little child .
Who would have thought that a child born in the most destitute poverty and anonymity would become the criterion of judgment for the whole world ?
We can also contemplate this same mystery in the life of every child .
Who knows what the destiny of that child will be ?
Who can tell if he or she will become a point of hope for the whole world ?
That same infinite potential , the potential for deification , the potential for a life transfigured by God , the potential for a life that will bring joy and peace , or beget such a child ?
The Feast of the Nativity is not only the contemplation of God taking human flesh .
It is also the great celebration of humanity , that God so loved as to become one of us , that through that One , joy and peace and salvation may be given to the whole world .
Let us treasure the life of every child , who is the image of Christ born of the Virgin , and remember the great calling which he or she , and each of us , has in God .
Let us also remember that the ultimate fulfillment of that calling is found in the transformation of our very flesh , in which God became incarnate , that having become man for our sake , He enables us to partake of His Divinity on that glorious day of His coming again in the flesh .
With love in the Newborn Lord ,

To many Afghan and international human rights advocates , the central problem is that the Americans are detaining Afghan citizens but depriving them of the right to have their cases processed under Afghan law .
“ The U.S. needs to establish a very clear legal basis for why they are holding Afghan citizens on Afghan soil , and right now there is no clear agreement between the two countries that gives the U.S. that right , ” said Sahr Muhammed Ally , a lawyer with Human Rights First , a New York - based group , who has studied detention arrangements in Afghanistan and at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
General Martins acknowledged that as soon as possible most detainees should go into the Afghan criminal justice system , where they would be charged and tried or released for lack of evidence , but he said that in a continuing armed conflict it is not always possible to try people .
“ There is a category of cases , ” he said , “ where you do n’t have evidence to convict someone in court , but you do have intelligence that if you brought into open court it could hurt you in the armed conflict .
Those are the hard cases . ”
In the meantime , the goal is for the detainee review boards , which are made up of three American officers advised by a military lawyer , to improve the administrative review process for detainees .
In the past , boards sometimes saw the detainees only once and renewed their detention repeatedly based on a paper record .
In Iraq , by comparison , when detainee review boards were put in place in 2007 , release rates rose drastically , according to Maj.
Gen. Douglas Stone , who ran the detention system at the time .

The system at the new Afghan detention center has some elements that were not present in Iraq , including assigning each detainee a personal representative who will advocate on his behalf .
The representatives are not lawyers  a point of contention for human rights groups  but they will explain the administrative review process to detainees and are supposed to help gather any “ reasonably available ” evidence that detainees wish to use to challenge their detention .

1946 : The United States Army holds a contest pitting a Japanese abacus user against a soldier using an electric calculator .
In four out of five rounds , the abacus wins .
The soroban or Japanese abacus is a handy calculating tool that has n't changed since the 19th century .
Despite the ubiquity of digital calculators , the soroban is still used in Japanese schools and banks today , and many users are faster on it than on calculators .
One of the secrets behind the soroban 's popularity :
It proved itself in an epic battle against a calculator .
How could that happen ?
A soroban has a rectangular frame with an odd number of vertical rods .
Each column has five beads .
The frame is traversed with one horizontal bar , which splits the beads into a set of four and a single bead below the horizontal fold .
The single bead is called a heavenly bead and is valued at 5 , and the other four called earth beads are valued at 1 .
A standard - size soroban has 13 rods , though never less than nine .
Having more rods allows for calculation of more digits or representations of several different numbers at a time .
Most Japanese sorobans are made of wood and have metal or bamboo rods for the beads to slide on .
What also sets the soroban apart from its Chinese progenitor , the suanpan , is a dot marking every third rod .
The soroban 's biggest moment was in its face - off against an electric calculator .
At the Ernie Pyle Theater in Tokyo in 1946 , Pvt. Thomas Nathan Wood of the U.S. Army sat with an electric calculator against Kiyoshi Matsuzaki from Japan 's postal ministry .
Scoring in the contest was based on speed and accuracy of results in four basic arithmetic operations — addition , subtraction , multiplication and division — and problems that combined all four .
The abacus scored 4 points against 1 point for the electric calculator .
The soroban has an advantage when it comes to addition and subtraction , says Takashi Kojima in his book The Japanese Abacus , Its Use and Theory .
Ultimately , the soroban is not as much about mental dexterity as it is about mechanical skill , says soroban user Yannic Piché .
Once you master the basics , the soroban becomes a " skill - acquisition process , not a learning adventure anymore , " says Piche .
But in that also lies the soroban 's success .
With so little thought required for skilled users , is there any difference left between pushing the soroban 's beads to find the right answer and tapping on a digital calculator ?

Today in allegedly - empowering - but - actually - annoying research , a survey revealed that more British women wanted to look like Kate Winslet than like Victoria Beckham .
And over a quarter of women in another survey said fitting into old jeans would feel better than sex .
Advertisement
In a poll of 2,000 British women commissioned by weight - loss company Slimming World , Kate Winslet came out on top as the star whose figure was " most desired . "
She got 16 % of the vote , closely followed by TV presenter Kelly Brook with 15 % and Halle Berry with 12 % .
Bringing up the rear were Kate Moss , Posh , and Jordan , with 1 % each .
Says Slimming World head of nutrition Jacquie Lavin ,
It shows a positive shift that women are more likely to see Kate Winslet and Kelly Brook as the ideal body shape rather than Kate Moss or Victoria Beckham .
It perhaps suggests that it is not being " skinny " that is most important to them anymore , it is being healthy .

Because nothing 's healthier than comparing your body to a celebrity 's , especially when the entire exercise is funded by the weight - loss industry .
Or than exchanging one restrictive standard of beauty for another .
A commenter on the Daily Mail website helpfully adds ,
I do n't know why this is news all of a sudden .
Men have been trying to tell women this for years .
I think it 's only women who think that skinny is a good look .
I can only assume that women who try to keep thin are doing it to compete with other women .

Women , why are n't you listening to what men — and Slimming World — are trying to tell you ?
Seriously , it 's probably true that Kate Winslet 's body type is more attainable for many women than Kate Moss's .
But this still presumes that the goal should be to " attain " someone else 's body .
It 's now in fashion for outfits like Slimming World to claim they 're all about health , rather than skinniness , and Slimming World 's website touts " Food Optimising - the no-diet secret of weight loss without hunger ! "
It 's not a diet , it 's " Food Optimising , " and they do n't want you to be too thin , like Posh — just thin enough , like Winslet .
No actual plus - size celebrities were included in the list of desired celebrity bodies — but it's not clear whether no women wanted to look like them , or whether Slimming World simply did n't give them that option .
Even more annoying than all this celebrity body business is a survey showing that over a quarter of women think fitting into old jeans would make them feel better than sex .
28.9 % said it would feel better than a promotion , and , in a one - two punch of depressing gender stereotypes , one in ten said it would feel better than a marriage proposal .
This survey was commissioned by none other than Special K , whose Special K Challenge claims you can " lose up to 6 lbs. in 2 weeks . "
Company spokesperson Laura Bryant says , " This shows the endorphin rush women get when they achieve their goal of fitting back into that one special pair of jeans . "
That 's right , ladies — the only thing that feels better than a ring on your finger is that old pair of jeans sliding over your ass .

A University of Florida researcher has co-authored a study tracing the evolution of the modern opossum back to the extinction of the dinosaurs and finding evidence to support North America as the center of origin for all living marsupials .
The study , to be published in PLoS One on Dec. 16 , shows that peradectids , a family of marsupials known from fossils mostly found in North America and Eurasia , are a sister group of all living opossums .
The findings are based in part on high - resolution CT scans of a 55 - million - year - old skull found in freshwater limestone from the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming .
" The extinction of the dinosaurs was a pivotal moment in the evolution of mammals , " said Jonathan Bloch , study co-author and associate curator of vertebrate paleontology at UF 's Florida Museum of Natural History .
" We 're tracing the beginnings of a major group of mammals that began in North America . "
Opossum - like peradectids first appeared on the continent about 65 million years ago , at the time of the Cretaceous - Paleogene extinction event , which killed the dinosaurs .
" North America is a critical area for understanding marsupial and opossum origins because of its extensive and varied fossil record , " said lead author Inés Horovitz , an assistant adjunct professor at the University of California , Los Angeles .
" Unfortunately , most of its species are known only from teeth . "
The study also analyzes two 30 - million - year - old skeletons of Herpetotheriidae , the sister group of all living marsupials .
advertisement
Based on fossil evidence from the skull and two skeletons , the study 's authors concluded the evolutionary split between the ancestor of opossums and the ancestor of all other living marsupials occurred at least 65 million years ago , Horovitz said .
Marsupials migrated between North and South America until the two continents separated after the end of the Cretaceous period .
Marsupials in South America diversified and also migrated into Antarctica and Australia , which were still connected at that time , Bloch said .
North American marsupials went extinct during the early Miocene , about 20 million years ago .
But after the Isthmus of Panama emerged to reconnect North and South America 3 million years ago , two marsupials made it back to North America : the Virginia opossum ( Didelphis virginiana ) , a common resident in the Southeast today , and the southern opossum ( Didelphis marsupialis ) , which lives as far north as Mexico .
The study describes a new peradectid species , Mimoperadectes houdei , based on a relatively complete fossil skull .
The high - resolution CT scan of the skull gave researchers a large amount of information about the animal 's internal anatomy .
The ear , in particular , provides researchers with information on skull anatomy and clues about the animal 's locomotion , Bloch said .
The scan showed the new species shared enough common traits with living opossums to indicate an evolutionary relationship .
Some predictions about that relationship could have been made from fossil teeth , Bloch said , " but this provides a much stronger foundation for that conclusion . "
Most North American marsupials living in the Paleocene and early Eocene ( 56 million to 48 million years ago ) were small - bodied animals .
But M. houdei approached the body size of some opossums living today .
advertisement
" You would probably recognize it as an opossum , but it would n't look quite right , " Bloch said .
The skull came from the same limestone deposits in Wyoming as the primitive primate skull Bloch and other researchers used to map an early primate brain with CT scans in a study published earlier this year .
" In parts of North America today , opossums are one of the most commonly observed mammals around , " Bloch said .
" This fossil skull shows its roots going back to the extinction of the dinosaurs .
This is literally the fossil that shows us the ancestry of that animal . "
The study 's examination of the two skeletons gives a first glimpse into the form and structure of primitive marsupials and shows that they were more terrestrial than modern opossums .
The skeletons came from the late Oligocene and were found in the White River Badlands of Wyoming .
The international research team also included Thomas Martin ( University of Bonn , Germany ) , Sandrine Ladevèze and Marcelo Sánchez - Villagra ( University of Zurich , Switzerland ) , and Cornelia Kurz ( Natural History Museum , Kassel , Germany ) .

When the CRU emails first made it into news stories , there was immediate reaction from the head of CRU , Dr. Phil Jones over this passage in an email :
From a yahoo.com news story :
In one leaked e-mail , the research center ’s director , Phil Jones , writes to colleagues about graphs showing climate statistics over the last millennium .
He alludes to a technique used by a fellow scientist to “ hide the decline ” in recent global temperatures .
Some evidence appears to show a halt in a rise of global temperatures from about 1960 , but is contradicted by other evidence which appears to show a rise in temperatures is continuing .
Jones wrote that , in compiling new data , he had “ just completed Mike ’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ( i.e. , from 1981 onwards ) and from 1961 for Keith ’s to hide the decline , ” according to a leaked e-mail , which the author confirmed was genuine .
Dr. Jones responded .
However , Jones denied manipulating evidence and insisted his comment had been taken out of context .
“ The word ‘ trick ’ was used here colloquially , as in a clever thing to do .
It is ludicrous to suggest that it refers to anything untoward , ” he said in a statement Saturday .
Ok fine , but how Dr. Jones , do you explain this ?
There ’s a file of code also in the collection of emails and documents from CRU .
A commenter named Neal on climate audit writes :
People are talking about the emails being smoking guns but I find the remarks in the code and the code more of a smoking gun .
The code is so hacked around to give predetermined results that it shows the bias of the coder .
In other words make the code ignore inconvenient data to show what I want it to show .
The code after a quick scan is quite a mess .
Anyone with any pride would be to ashamed of to let it out public viewing .
As examples [ of ] bias take a look at the following remarks from the MANN code files :
Here ’s the code with the comments left by the programmer :
function mkp2correlation , indts , depts , remts , t , filter=filter , refperiod=refperiod , $ datathresh=datathresh ; ; THIS WORKS WITH REMTS BEING A 2D ARRAY ( nseries , ntime ) OF MULTIPLE TIMESERIES ; WHOSE INFLUENCE IS TO BE REMOVED .
UNFORTUNATELY THE IDL5.4 p_correlate ; FAILS WITH >1 SERIES TO HOLD CONSTANT , SO I HAVE TO REMOVE THEIR INFLUENCE ; FROM BOTH INDTS AND DEPTS USING MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION AND THEN USE THE ; USUAL correlate FUNCTION ON THE RESIDUALS .
; pro maps12 , yrstart , doinfill=doinfill ; ; Plots 24 yearly maps of calibrated ( PCR - infilled or not ) MXD reconstructions ; of growing season temperatures .
Uses “ corrected ” MXD – but should n’t usually ; plot past 1960 because these will be artificially adjusted to look closer to ; the real temperatures . ;
and later the same programming comment again in another routine :
; ; Plots ( 1 at a time ) yearly maps of calibrated ( PCR - infilled or not ) MXD ; reconstructions ; of growing season temperatures .
Uses “ corrected ” MXD – but should n’t usually ; plot past 1960 because these will be artificially adjusted to look closer to ; the real temperatures .
You can claim an email you wrote years ago is n’t accurate saying it was “ taken out of context ” , but a programmer making notes in the code does so that he / she can document what the code is actually doing at that stage , so that anyone who looks at it later can figure out why this function does n’t plot past 1960 .
In this case , it is not allowing all of the temperature data to be plotted .
Growing season data ( summer months when the new tree rings are formed ) past 1960 is thrown out because “ these will be artificially adjusted to look closer to the real temperatures ” , which implies some post processing routine .
Spin that , spin it to the moon if you want .
I ’ll believe programmer notes over the word of somebody who stands to gain from suggesting there ’s nothing “ untowards ” about it .
Either the data tells the story of nature or it does not .
Data that has been “ artificially adjusted to look closer to the real temperatures ” is false data , yielding a false result .
For more details , see Mike ’s Nature Trick
UPDATE : By way of verification ….
The source files with the comments that are the topic of this thread are in this folder of the FOI2009.zip file
/documents/osborn-tree6/mann/oldprog
in the files
maps12.pro
maps15.pro
maps24.pro
These first two files are dated 1/18/2000 , and the map24 file on 11/10/1999 so it fits timeline - wise with Dr. Jones email where he mentions “ Mike ’s Nature trick ” which is dated 11/16/1999 , six days later .
UPDATE2 : Commenter Eric at the Climate Audit Mirror site writes :
================
From documents\harris-tree\recon_esper.pro :
; Computes regressions on full , high and low pass Esper et al. ( 2002 ) series ,
; anomalies against full NH temperatures and other series .
; CALIBRATES IT AGAINST THE LAND - ONLY TEMPERATURES NORTH OF 20 N
;
; Specify period over which to compute the regressions ( stop in 1960 to avoid
; the decline
;
Note the wording here “ avoid the decline ” versus “ hide the decline ” in the famous email .
===============
I ’ll give Dr. Jones and CRU the benefit of the doubt , maybe these are not “ untowards ” issues , but these things scream for rational explanations .
Having transparency and being able to replicate all this years ago would have gone a long way towards either correcting problems and / or assuaging concerns .

Bill O'Reilly decided to bring in Fox 's newest big - name hire , John Stossel , to help buck up his annual pledge drive in the War on Christmas .
And Stossel -- who is no innocent in the ways of ideological reporting himself -- actually seemed embarrassed by it all -- mainly because O'Reilly was stooping to the lowest reporting methods possible to make his point .
Namely , he was citing as somehow authoritative ( " I trust the folks " ) an online poll from an outfit called " StandForChristmas.com " .
Stossel briefly mentions that it actually was run by another group , and O'Reilly talks over him and emphasizes that it 's " StandForChristmas . "
Of course , " StandForChristmas " is actually run by the religious - right cranks at James Dobson 's Focus on the Family .
So there 's an obvious bias built into the poll and its potential viewers in the first place .
And then to treat the results of any open online poll as meaningful in any real sense is just palpable nonsense .
Stossel obviously understands this , and mostly tries to work his way around O'Reilly 's insistence that the poll means something by just repeating its results .
But the whole thing goes completely off the rails and into another universe when O'Reilly tries to claim that corporate chiefs telling their employees what to say is " just fascist " :
O'Reilly :
But my point is , that I thought it was fascist -- fascism , which offends a libertarian like you -- for a CEO or a store manager to tell their employees , ' You better not say Merry Christmas ' -- even though the reason we 're selling stuff is because of Christmas .
Is n't that fascism ?
Stossel : No , it 's ownership .
He built the business , if he says , ' Stand on your head and sing when people come in , ' you do n't have to work there , you can quit , it 's his business .
You realize from exchanges like this just how long it 's been since Bill O'Reilly has had anything even remotely like a real job .
Because in most people 's real jobs -- especially in the retail biz -- employees are instructed all the time in exactly the kinds of things they 're supposed to say .
That 's not fascist , it 's just business .
Indeed , Bill O'Reilly has himself on numerous occasions demanded that people in various positions be fired for saying things he believes reflect badly on their employers -- remember his attacks on Rosie O'Donnell ?
Guess that makes him a fascist , by his own definition .
What would Christmas be without a warm cup of Bill O'Reilly hypocrisy ?
WASHINGTON 
In the next several months , the Supreme Court will decide at least a half - dozen cases about the rights of people accused of crimes involving drugs , sex and corruption .
Civil liberties groups and associations of defense lawyers have lined up on the side of the accused .
But so have conservative , libertarian and business groups .
Their briefs and public statements are signs of an emerging consensus on the right that the criminal justice system is an aspect of big government that must be contained .
The development represents a sharp break with tough - on - crime policies associated with the Republican Party since the Nixon administration .
“ It ’s a remarkable phenomenon , ” said Norman L. Reimer , executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers .
“ The left and the right have bent to the point where they are now in agreement on many issues .
In the area of criminal justice , the whole idea of less government , less intrusion , less regulation has taken hold . ”

That conflicts with the Obama administration ’s idea of dedicating some of the money toward reducing the deficit .

The calls from Capitol Hill to change course on the controversial one - year - old bank bailout , officially known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) , come as voters hear Wall Street banks announcing record bonuses while the unemployment rate for October hit 10.2 percent — its highest level in decades .
More than $ 317 billion in money from the TARP had yet to be directed as of Sept. 30 , according to the special inspector general for the program .
Billions will be left over when the program ends , even if the Treasury Department extends the program beyond its Dec. 31 expiration date to October of next year , as it is expected to do .
More than half of the Democrats in the Senate want to use the remaining money to provide small businesses with easier access to credit .

The administration is also considering using bailout funds for deficit reduction and freezing or cutting spending in the 2011 budget from the previous year ’s levels , The Wall Street Journal reported .
DeFazio dismissed suggestions that the deficit needs to be addressed before lawmakers tackle unemployment , which hit a 26 - year high last month and is expected to rise .
“ Main Street ’s most immediate concern is not deficits ; it ’s the economy and jobs , ” DeFazio said .
A pressing issue for Democrats on Capitol Hill is the midterm elections .
Unemployment is considered the country ’s top problem by one - fifth of Americans , according to a Gallup poll taken earlier this month .
The federal budget deficit was deemed the top problem by 6 percent .
Other Democrats said they ’re hopeful that the leftover TARP dollars can be used for both relief to struggling Americans and deficit reduction .
Frank noted that his plan for foreclosure aid would take just $ 2 billion in TARP funds to provide low - interest loans to help unemployed homeowners make mortgage payments .
Frank added that he believes the Obama administration will go along with some plans to use TARP money for relief .
When asked if the White House is too focused on deficits at a time of high unemployment , Frank said , “ I hope not . ”

Warner asked to start the fund in a letter to President Obama signed by 32 other Senate Democrats .
Warner , who backs a push by Senate centrists for a special bipartisan commission to find a way to reduce deficits , told The Hill he thought there would be enough TARP money left over for both small - business aid and deficit reduction .

“ $ 700 billion is a lot of money , and I think the American people want to see that the TARP fund does n’t become this political slush fund , which many people already think it is , ” Thune said .

Treasury Department spokesman Andrew Williams said that the administration shares
Thune ’s goal of “ restoring financial stability at the lowest possible cost to taxpayers and dedicating uninvested TARP money to reducing the debt . ”
But the administration argued that ending TARP too soon would undermine the economy ’s recovery .
“ [ T ]he U.S. economy has just begun to grow again , and far too many Americans are unemployed , so we should be careful about limiting government ’s ability to respond to the crisis while recovery remains fragile , ” Williams said in a statement .

By By Michael Krebs Nov 25 , 2009 in Health With H1N1 mutations seen in Norway and noted in several countries , a Chinese expert issues a warning on the potential for a superbug combination of bird flu and swine flu .
A swap in genetic code between these two dangerous viruses could create a superbug pandemic with the potential to wipe out the majority of human populations worldwide .
" China , as you know , is different from other countries .
Inside China , H5N1 has been existing for some time , so if there is really a reassortment between H1N1 and H5N1 , it will be a disaster , " Zhong Nanshan , director of the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases in China 's southern Guangdong province told Reuters .
Recently , China faces unique challenges with morphing influenza appearing somewhat regularly throughout their population .
Late in 2002 , China and the world were introduced to the The H1N1 swine flu virus that emerged from Mexico earlier this year took many by surprise .
And it quickly became the real thing - as pandemics go .
On Tuesday , the World Health Organization announced that the H5N1 virus had shown its face again in poultry in Egypt , Indonesia , Thailand and Vietnam .
" First , it places those in direct contact with birds -- usually rural folk and farm workers -- at risk of catching the often - fatal disease .
Second , the virus could undergo a process of " reassortment " with another influenza virus and produce a completely new strain , " WHO said , according to Reuters .
As mutating viruses go , influenza species are notorious for making sloppy copies of themselves - and this behavior presents a challenge to public health officials who are charged with containing more dangerous and widespread disease .
On Wednesday , a Chinese disease expert spoke out on the possibility of a dangerous combination between a more dangerous H1N1 swine flu virus mutation and China 's endemic H5N1 bird flu species .
A swap in genetic code between these two dangerous viruses could create a superbug pandemic with the potential to wipe out the majority of human populations worldwide .

Recently , Norwegian scientists discovered a more virulent mutation of the H1N1 swine flu virus .
Their discovery was immediately followed by disclosures from the World Health Organization that this same mutation has been observed in several countries , including China .
While experts believe that current vaccines are effective against the mutation , the WHO disclosures remained disconcerting .
China faces unique challenges with morphing influenza appearing somewhat regularly throughout their population .
Late in 2002 , China and the world were introduced to the SARS coronavirus - an event that nearly touched off a deadly pandemic .
Since then , the H5N1 virus - known also as bird flu - has trumped SARS as the most likely China - based candidate to emerge as a global pandemic .

My colleague Clifford Levy reports in Tuesday ’s New York Times that the Russian government is trying , once again , to find some way of addressing the alarming fact that “ Russians consume roughly 4.75 gallons of pure alcohol a person annually , more than double the level that the World Health Organization considers a health threat . ”
Among the measures under consideration for curbing what Mr. Levy calls “ Russia ’s ruinous penchant for the bottle ” are tougher penalties for selling alcohol to minors and restrictions on the sale of beer , which has grown more popular .
Vodka , though , remains the national drink , and finding a way to keep Russians from drinking it will require some creative thinking .
In 2002 , the Russian writer Victor Erofeyev explained in The New Yorker that vodka was supposedly invented by monks at the Chudov Monastery more than 500 years ago , around the time the Russians finally freed themselves of Tatar rule .
He added that even though vodka “ is unlike other forms of alcohol in that there is no justifiable excuse for drinking it , ” it has become such a central feature of Russian life that “ some historians compare the Russian national dependence on vodka to the Tatar yoke . ”
According to Mr. Erofeyev :
The very mention of the word vodka triggers unpredictable behavior in Russians .
It seems to punch a hole directly into the subconscious , setting off a range of odd gestures and facial expressions .
Some people wring their hands ; some grin idiotically or snap their fingers ; others sink into sullen silence .
But no one , high or low , is left indifferent .
More than by any political system , we are all held hostage by vodka .
It menaces and it chastises ; it demands sacrifices .
It is both a catalyst of procreation and its scourge .
It dictates who is born and who dies .
In short , vodka is the Russian god .
Faced with the task of curbing an appetite for a substance of such legendary power , Russia ’s president , Dmitri Medvedev , would no doubt like to find a practical solution that will also enable him to avoid shouldering too much of the blame .
He must certainly be aware that the career of the last Russian leader to declare war on vodka , Mikhail Gorbachev , ended badly ( for him ) .
So what kind of scheme could simultaneously help Mr. Medvedev make it harder for Russians to secure the bottles of vodka that they crave and stay in the public ’s good graces ?
How about planting a series of intelligence operatives in vodka warehouses across the nation with the driving skills of the man featured in this report from the Kremlin - sponsored , English - language satellite channel Russia Today ?
While no one has suggested that the forklift driver whose work featured in this report — and the longer version of the video embedded at the top of this post , which has gone viral — was in fact an undercover , anti-vodka agent saboteur , if video of dozens of similar accidents starts to appear online in the coming months , remember , you heard it here first .
Occasionally , one finds absolute gems floating around in the aether .
Coyote Blog is one such , which yesterday uncovered this gem :
Those of us who accused Chrysler and GM of hyping their electric car programs merely as a honey trap to capture money from the Obama Administration were accused of being ridiculous cynics .
But ....
Chrysler has disbanded a team of engineers dedicated to rushing a range of electric vehicles to showrooms and dropped ambitious sales targets for battery - powered cars set as it was sliding toward bankruptcy and seeking government aid .
It will surprise no one , we expect , to learn that we considered the notion that Chrysler or GM would somehow remake themselves into " green automakers " overnight ( in the auto business this translates to " several decades " ) the insane ramblings of redistribution - rationalists .
It should surprise no one to learn that Chrysler and GM also considered the notion that Chrysler or GM would somehow remake themselves into " green automakers " overnight the insane ramblings of redistribution - rationalists .
As Coyote Blog points out , after all that noise has anyone actually seen a triple digit city MPG Chevy Volt in the wild ?
Of course not .
The reality is that there are only two things that will get alternative technologies that may happen to be " greener " out and about .
Getting them cheaper ( even net switching costs ) than the entrenched alternatives .
Making the alternatives more expensive than expensive new technologies at the expense of ... well ... everyone .
Manipulating bankruptcy priorities and strong - arming management from the behind the marble facade of a federal building will get you nothing in the long - term if the economics do n't support your endgame .
Further , the moment you look away for 15 seconds to pass a sprawling healthcare bill the entire thing slips away from you thusly :
The move by Fiat SpA marks a major reversal for Chrysler , which had used its electric car program as part of the case for a $ 12.5 billion federal aid package .
As late as August , Chrysler took $ 70 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Energy to develop a test fleet of 220 hybrid pickup trucks and minivans , vehicles now scrapped in the sweeping turnaround plan for Chrysler announced this week by Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne .
Defying economic realities requires constant vigilance ( as you badger rational or semi-rational actors away from where incentives are pulling them ) not to mention constant and massive cash injections to continually make up the shortfalls created by your stable disequilibrium .
Does any of this sound familiar ?
Pouring several trillion dollars of someone else 's money into , for instance , keeping mortgage rates below their natural risk - adjusted equilibrium , works great .
Until you run out of everyone else 's money .
In the meantime , kudos to Chrysler .
Kudos to Fiat .
They managed to extract billions of dollars in exchange for a vague promise to do something politically yummy in the present " money is no object " climate .
This should , however , make it sort of obvious that not only is the present administration easily characterized as a bunch of looting central planners , but also , given how easily Chrysler played them , that they absolutely suck at central planning .

Dear Friend of Liberty ,
I want you to run for office .
You may have already responded to my call to run for office and asked me how to go about it .
Do n’t take it personally if I ’ve failed to respond to any of your questions .
I ’m getting more and more emails , so the percentage of people I can respond to personally is going down .
I need to give priority to questions from Libertarian National Committee members and Libertarian state chairs .
Besides me , we just have three full - time staff members and three part - time staff , and they are doing their best to help .
Although we have a small staff , we ’re busy organizing and re-engineering our processes to maximize our effectiveness with the resources you contribute .
Here ’s a summary of how to run for office as a Libertarian :
1 . Fill out this form .
The form generates an email to your state party and puts you in our national candidate prospect database .
2. Contact your state party and local organizations by email or phone .
State and local parties are your first means of support .
Some states are more organized than others .
Our national office will monitor state progress , and we will try to help out later as much as we can where gaps exist .
3 . Try to find out the process from your state party for filing an official candidate application and getting onto the ballot .
The process is different in every state .
Also , what may take you ten hours to figure out on your own may take only ten minutes for a former candidate , so find former candidates and talk to them .
If there ’s a race you can win , run for that office .
Most Libertarian wins are in small jurisdictions where it takes less than 1,000 votes to win .
I ’m encouraging people who live in major cities , where winning is less feasible , to run for U.S. Congress .
We do n’t have the resources to run major national advertising campaigns , but if we put our candidates on the ballot , they will get some publicity ( often free publicity ) on their own .
And they are in place in case a major backlash erupts against the Republicans and Democrats .
Right now , I want to see if you can contact your state party politely and efficiently to find out the process for getting onto the ballot .
Please be respectful of their time .
Keep in mind , our state party leaders are unpaid volunteers , and some are already pushed to the limit .
Taking up too much of their time could prevent them from getting an additional candidate onto the ballot .
I want you to contact them , but please do n’t take an hour of their time expressing your views on world peace or Medicare .
The earliest deadline to file for U.S. Congress is in Texas ( January 4 , 2010 ) .
The deadline varies by state .
It is several months later in some states .
Your mission is to get your name or help get someone else ’s name listed here .
( The list will be prettied up at some point . )
We post names as we receive approval from state chairs , so get started on the three steps above if you ’re willing to run for office .
America needs you now .
Sincerely ,
Wes Benedict
Executive Director
Libertarian National Committee

President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIt 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting '
MORE still supports the re-importation of pharmaceuticals from other countries even though a deal he struck with the drug industry specifically excluded provisions on the controversial measure .
Asked by The Hill on Tuesday if Obama backs the re-importation effort , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said , “ Yes .
The president said during the campaign that he did .
[ He ] said so in his first budget , assuming that safety concerns … could be addressed .
And I think that ’s the key . ”
Gibbs ’s comments could bolster the chances that a bipartisan amendment on drug re-importation will attract the necessary 60 votes .
The measure , sponsored by Sens. Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) , Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) and John McCain John Sidney McCainAmerica 's presence in Cam Ranh Bay should be more than occasional Meghan McCain , husband welcome first baby girl , Liberty Sage McCain Domenech The Hill 's Morning Report - Sponsored by JobsOhio - Showdown : Trump - Biden debate likely to be nasty MORE ( R - Ariz . ) , is scheduled to be debated on the floor on Wednesday or Thursday .

The White House and Senate Democrats this summer struck a deal with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ( PhRMA ) on healthcare reform .
The industry pledged to support the movement to reform the nation ’s healthcare system and offered to find $ 80 billion in savings on drugs sold in the U.S .
There were conflicting accounts of what the White House agreed to , though it is clear that PhRMA would not back the Senate health measure if re-importation were attached to it .
The White House has not endorsed the Dorgan - Snowe - McCain measure .
The White House has made it a policy not to take positions on Senate amendments .
At press time , however , the Food and Drug Administration came out against the Dorgan measure , stating in a letter to Sen. Sam Brownback ( R - Kan. ) that “ as currently written , the resulting structure would be logistically challenging to implement and resource intensive .
In addition , there are significant safety concerns . ”
If the re-importation language passes , it could help sway Snowe to vote for the underlying bill .
However , overcoming the opposition of PhRMA — and possibly having to scramble to find $ 80 billion in savings that PhRMA committed to — would be extremely challenging for Democratic leaders in Congress .
Obama was a co-sponsor of drug re-importation legislation when he was in the Senate .
Then - Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill. ) in 2003 successfully moved a re-importation measure through the House even though GOP leaders , including then - Speaker Dennis Hastert ( R - Ill . ) , opposed it .
Emanuel is now White House chief of staff .
ADVERTISEMENT
Rep. Jo Ann Emerson ( R - Mo. ) , who was among those who worked with Emanuel on that bill , said in October she does not understand why her former colleague agreed to the PhRMA deal .
“ PhRMA got off easy , ” she said .
PhRMA did not comment for this article .
House Democrats , who were not involved in the agreement with PhRMA , did not include re-importation language in their healthcare reform bill that passed the lower chamber , 220 - 215 .
But they did add legislative language on other issues that has attracted criticism from the pharmaceutical industry .
House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) has said he is also “ open- minded ” about including drug re-importation legislation in the healthcare package if it passes the Senate .
Critics of the proposal argue it would not save much money and that importing drugs from other countries would pose a danger to U.S. consumers .
Dorgan recently said that a senior White House official denied the assertion that the president would oppose drug re-importation provisions in healthcare reform .
He added , “ I think we ’ve got a decent shot at winning .
I do n’t think we can pass healthcare reform without trying to put the brakes on the steep increases in prescription drug prices .
“ The only thing I know about the White House is the president was a co-sponsor of the bill last year and Rahm Emanuel was one of the lead sponsors in the House , so my hope would be they ’d be supportive , ” Dorgan said .

The eyes are the windows to the soul , and the surest way to let your interviewer see the true nature of your character .
And now that you 've stopped feigning blindness , you need to make up for lost time .
Hold your interviewer 's gaze at all times , drinking in their features like a man dying of thirst .
Thirst for facial features .
" You 've got a real pretty mouth . "
_________ Conventional Advice :
Ask questions about the position and company culture
By asking questions about the position and culture within the office , you stress how interested you are in the role and how you see yourself fitting in to it .
This lets the interviewer know you 're more interested in the job than the money , which is one of those universal lies everyone tacitly agrees to ignore .
Unconventional Advice : Just dive right in to the company culture
See if you can find some company branded clothes on eBay , like golf shirts or windbreakers .
Or just make your own .
A crudely knitted sweater vest with the company logo stitched into it to shows you possess resourcefulness and crafty fingers .
During the interview , show them company photographs which you 've Photoshopped yourself in to .
Show up wearing a wig made of employee 's hair .
( You 'll need some prep time for this ; also look for Cracked 's 85 Tips for Gathering Stranger 's Hair on bookshelves this December . )
_________ Conventional Advice : Refer to quantifiable achievements
When discussing past achievements , quantify what you did .
Whether it 's time saved , money made or products created , by referencing verifiable achievements it makes you look like someone who can actually get things done , rather than someone who is solely responsible for making ass marks in chairs .
Unconventional Advice : Show , do n't tell
Any writer can tell you that showing something happened is a far more powerful way to convey it then telling the reader it happened .
The same applies to job interviews .
Grab something off his desk and show him how to do it better .
Interviewers love this .
_________ Conventional Advice : Never criticize your past employer
By criticizing your previous employers , you can come across as bitter , angry or small .
Your interviewer will wonder how you 'll speak of his company when you eventually part ways .
Unconventional Advice : Criticize the fuck out of them But , if you 're seeking a job in the same industry as your past employment , then your previous employer is likely a competitor of this company .
By demonstrating a shared dislike for this competitor , you 're sure to ingratiate yourself .
Be careful you do n't come across as bitter though .
Instead , you want to give the impression that you 're a concerned citizen who could no longer stand idly by with all that bestiality and sloppy accounting practices going on unreported .
Do n't be afraid to exaggerate .
Phrases like " laundered Nazi gold , " or " elbow deep in sheep , " help make stories memorable .
_________ Conventional Advice :
When asked what your " greatest weakness " is , have a prepared answer Everyone hates this question .
Interviewers know that , and by observing the responses they get , they can form a pretty good idea of how the interviewee handles stress .
The conventional wisdom is that when asked this question you should discuss a past weakness and how you overcame it .
Make sure the weakness you claim is n't critical to this job .
" Ca n't stand the sound of children 's laughter " is a good one , provided you 're not applying for a position at a daycare .
Sorry ; a reputable daycare .
Unconventional Advice :
When asked what your " greatest weakness " is , break a piece of furniture with your bare hands
Because fuck weakness , that 's why .
You 're strong , stronger than this chair , stronger than anyone .
You 're nobody 's fool .
_________ Conventional Advice : Provide references
Many times interviewers wo n't even check references , or if they do , make only cursory phone calls .
This is mostly just meant to verify that you have n't made up your resume entirely , or that you 've at least made the effort to brief accomplices on the accents they 'll need to imitate when verifying your back story .
Unconventional Advice :
You do n't need any referencesâ¦ â ¦because right now the interviewer is thinking : " Holy Shit , this guy just kicked a chair in half .
He is definitely getting this job . "

See this post for the latest in military spending .
Defense Spending In The Billions
The chart above shows the fifteen nations with the greatest annual military spending .
The United States , with a budget of $ 535.9 billion annually , spends more on defense than the next fourteen nations combined .
One wonders if all that spending by the United States is really necessary , considering that the U.S. military budget is more than four times that of the next largest spender , China , at $ 121.9 billion .
If America ’s NATO allies are included just from the chart above ( which is not all of NATO ) , that adds another $ 207.2 billion in defense spending .
Those countries are the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Italy , Canada , and Spain .
Defense Spending By GDP
When spending is considered by percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the United States at 4.1 % falls to eighth place .
Saudi Arabia ( 10.0 % ) , Russia ( 9.9 % ) , and Israel ( 7.3 % ) take over first , second , and third place respectively .

CLIMATE SUMMIT IS THE NAME , POPULATION CONTROL IS THE GAME
By Dr. Laurie Roth
December 11 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
Let ’s look to China for inspiration and direction with this climate journey from hell .
They have got it all figured out .
Zhao Gaige , vice - minister of National Population and Family Planning Commission of China ( NPFPC ) stated :
“ Dealing with climate change is not simply an issue of CO2 emission reduction but a comprehensive challenge involving political , economic , social , cultural and ecological issues , and the population concern fits right into the picture . ”
Zhao went on to enlighten the climate gurus with specific contributions of China .
Is n’t it grand ?
“ Calculations of the contribution of population growth to emissions growth globally produce a consistent finding that most of past population growth has been responsible for between 40 per cent and 60 percent of emissions growth ………. because of China ’s family planning policy they have seen 400 million fewer births , which has resulted in 18 million fewer tons of CO2 emissions a year . ”
It has become very clear with the global warming / environmental crowd and the Obama administration that population control is a critical and sought after plan .
Just look at Mr. Science czar John Holdren .
His belief and hope is that we can even have forced abortions .
He told Front Page Magazine the following :
“ It has been concluded that compulsory population - control laws , even including laws requiring compulsory abortion , could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society . ”
This freak has written and spoken about a thermonuclear war or eco-catastrophe by the year 2000 .
He has spoken of endless doom falling on the world due to there being too many people and babies .
Kill them all I tell you !
I can hardly wait to see what his next prediction is .
We all know that Pelosi and other liberal radicals in congress are doing whatever they can do to manipulate a forced Government option into health care that pays for abortion .
Though this push has not flown with all democrats it has certainly morphed its way forward hiding behind various maneuvers and word changes … … like perhaps calling it instead “ preventative care . ”
We shall see what the Senate tries to manipulate into place .
The push is heavy to include abortion .
Realize that would mean forcing Doctors and Hospitals to give abortions whether they thought it was a breach to their Hippocratic oath or not .
Who cares about rights ?

The bottom line behind the climate change leftists trying to save the world ……. people are in the way .
People cause carbon emissions so people must die .
Let us start with hundreds of millions of abortions worldwide .
Shall we follow the example shared by Zhao of China ?
It seems these environmental thugs , now at the latest Climate Summit , want to in big part control climate by slaughtering babies first ….. then I predict , seniors , the disabled and “ expensive to stay alive folks . ”
You think I ’m nuts ?
Just listen to a few quotes from prominent founders of the environmental movement .
“ Man is always and everywhere a blight on the landscape . ” - John Muir , founder of the Sierra Club
“ Given the total , absolute disappearance of Homo sapiens , then not only would the Earth ’s community of Life continue to exist , but in all probability , its well - being enhanced .
Our presence , in short , is not needed . ” - Paul Taylor , author of Respect for Nature , A Theory of Environmental Ethics
“ I got the impression that instead of going out to shoot birds , I should go out and shoot the kids who shoot birds . ” - Paul Watson , Founder of Greenpeace and Sea Shepard
“ We have no problem in principle with the humans reducing their numbers by killing one another .
It ’s an excellent way of making the humans extinct . ”
- Geophilus , spokesman for Gaia Liberation Front
“ Human beings , as a species , have no more value than slugs . ” - John Davis , editor of the journal Earth First !
Even feminists feel that by women having more autonomy over their own bodies , they will help the environmental issue and population problem .
Jess McCabe pined away about the importance of women ’s rights to their body ( abortion / murder rights ) to help population control .
At the end of the day , with all the international discussions on contrived climate issues there is obviously a general push and philosophy that believes in and wants to kill people because they are in the way !
When you have a current Czar of Obama who believes that forced abortions are cool , why stop there ?
Let us go after the inconvenient toddlers no one wants ….. especially those pesky down syndrome kids .
For that matter , let ’s hide behind a forced federal health plan also so we can eventually demoralize , shame , then kill the seniors that are in the way .
We can get them coming in and going out .
Eventually only the global elites , trees , animals and controllable surfs will stand .
Margaret Sanger would be proud .
She was one of the main inspirations and founders of Planned Parenthood and a huge fan of Eugenics and racism .
She quite liked the idea of abortion to reign in and destroy blacks for starters .
Though we do n’t have an international climate emergency to solve , many in power believe we do and people are in the way .

Is there a Christmas special and sale on killing ?
I think they are trying to drum up a big sale on life in Copenhagen .
June 15 , 2005  -- " Denerding " is n't yet a word recognized by New York Times editors , even for use in its crossword puzzle , but it might become one after " Wordplay " hits theaters .
While you might not find any of the crossword champs with pocket protectors , many of the top puzzlers featured in " Wordplay " live up to the popular image of the bookish know - it - all who wants to show off , work in pen rather than pencil , and solve the Times ' Monday puzzle in less than three minutes .
But if there 's still a stigma attached to puzzlers , the documentary , opening Friday , blows it apart , with a close look at the Times puzzle editor , Will Shortz .
As many as 50 million American puzzlers are Shortz fans .
They 're as Republican as Bob Dole , as Democratic as Bill Clinton , and as hip as Amy Ray and Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls , who 've been known to ask in concert " Did anyone get 6 - Down today ? "
Of course , many of the top puzzlers seem lost in their own wordy world .
" I 've always been fascinated by the letter ' Q ' , " says Trip Payne , one of the grandmasters at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament .
Crossword as Sport : ' Bring It On ! '
Another crossword gladiator likens his prowess to the athletic excellence of Barry Bonds , and when he does , filmmaker Patrick Creadon cuts to the mighty slugger swinging through a third - strike pitch .
Call it revenge of the nerds , because the mighty Bonds has been struck out by another prominent and accomplished crossword puzzler , New York Yankee ace hurler Mike Mussina .
" If you can handle the puzzle in the Times , you can handle any puzzle they throw at you , " Mussina says .
On a Saturday afternoon a few seasons ago , while Mussina was tossing one of his gems , Yankee announcer Michael Kay described how the pitcher was at his locker room completing a puzzle before his pregame warm -up .
As if sensing the typical baseball fan would n't notice the significance of this feat , Kay felt compelled to elaborate .
" The Times makes the toughest crosswords , and if you can do it on Monday , you should be proud of yourself .
But by Tuesday and Wednesday , they keep getting harder , " he said , noting that the man on the mound graduated from Stanford University .
" If you can do the puzzle by Saturday , you 're something special .
And that 's why you wo n't see what Mussina was doing in a major league locker room too often . "
The Errol Flynn of Crosswords
It 's apparently not that unusual to call puzzling a sport .
" Bring it on , Shortz ! " shouts Comedy Central 's Jon Stewart as he works a puzzle from his desk in gym clothes .
" I am a Times puzzle fan , " Stewart says .
" I will solve the USA Today puzzle [ when traveling ] , but I do n't feel good about myself . "
Shortz is indeed a legend .
Known to millions as the " Puzzle Master " on National Public Radio's " Weekend Edition , " he took over the mantle of Times crossword editor in 1993 , becoming only the fourth person since 1942 to assume what many consider the ultimate dream job .
" When you imagine a ' crossword guy , ' you imagine he 's 13 or 14 inches tall … someone who does n't care to go more than 5 feet without his inhaler , " says Stewart .
" And yet he 's a giant man .
He 's the Errol Flynn of crossword puzzling . "
Shortz , a 53 - year - old Indiana University graduate , is said to be the only person in the world to hold a degree in enigmatology ( the study of words ) , a curriculum he designed under the university 's general studies program .
In 1978 , Shortz helped organize the first American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in Stamford , Conn. , which the local Marriott 's marketing department conceived to beef up wintertime revenues .
The event has taken on a life of its own , with more than 500 fierce competitors .
At times , " Wordplay " seems like the wildly successful 2002 documentary " Spellbound , " which offered a glimpse into the cutthroat world of spelling competitions .
But crossword competitors are adults .
And while geek tormentors may say otherwise , they indeed have lives .
Top players include Ellen Ripstein of Manhattan , also known as the Susan Lucci of Crossword for finishing near the top for 18 years but not winning .
" Wordplay " also examines the lives of those evil geniuses known as professional crossword constructors .
Shortz works with a stable of these experts who 've found the perfect outlet for their bizarre gift with the language .
But writing a tantalizing crossword clue takes more than verbal skills .
It takes an astute knowledge of popular culture .
While explaining his profession , Merl Reagle passes a Dunkin ' Donuts .
He stops midsentence , eyes lighting up , and says , " You know , if you take the first letter of " Dunkin " and move it to the end , it becomes ' Unkind Donuts . "
In '96 , Times Puzzle Declares Clinton and Dole Winners
Bill Clinton 's famous ability to connect with everyday Americans might come , in part , from his puzzling prowess .
" Half the time I do these things just to see what people are thinking about , " he says .
While many see crosswords as a boredom beater , the former president says they 're not bad as preparation for the Oval Office .
" Sometimes you have to go at a problem the way I go at a complicated crossword puzzle , " Clinton says .
" You start with what you know the answer to , and then you build on it .
A lot of complex problems are like that .
You have to find some aspect of it you understand and build on it until you can unravel the mystery that you 're trying to solve . "
Crossword puzzles might get a bad rap as nothing more than boredom beaters for folks with way too much time on their hands .
But even if you 're not a fan , this documentary explores the art of the puzzle .
Shortz edited the famed " Election Day Puzzle " ( created by Jeremiah Farrell ) , which included a clue that asked puzzlers to come up with a 14 - letter headline for tomorrow 's paper .
" Clinton Elected " or " Bob Dole Elected " both fit .
And miraculously , both responses worked .
Even Dole says he was impressed .
Unfortunately for him , the Electoral College proved to be one puzzle he could n't solve .
