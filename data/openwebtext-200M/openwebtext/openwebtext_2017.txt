A partially mummified hadrosaur discovered by a teenager in North Dakota , may be the most complete dinosaur ever found , with intact skin that shows evidence of stripes and perhaps soft tissue , researchers said on Monday .
The discovery , excavation and analysis of the mummified dinosaur is featured in " Dino Autopsy , " premiering December .

Enough of the animal remains to show it ran quickly and was far more muscular than scientists believed such dinosaurs were .
“ It ’s sort of King Tut meets T. Rex , ” paleontologist Phil Manning of the University of Manchester in Britain said in a telephone interview .
The creature is fossilized , with the skin and bone turned to stone .
But unlike most dinosaur fossils , tissues are preserved as well .
This includes large expanses of the animal ’s skin , with clear remains of scales .
“ This is not a skin impression .
This is fossilized skin , ” Manning said .
“ When you run your hands over this dinosaur ’s skin , this is the closest you are going to get to touching a real dinosaur , ever . ”
The remains of the hadrosaur , dubbed Dakota , were found in 2000 by Tyler Lyson , then 17 , on his uncle ’s ranch in North Dakota .
The hadrosaur , a plant - eating dinosaur that walked on two legs , lived 67 million years ago , during the late Cretaceous Period .
Lyson contacted Manning .
The National Geographic Society , which helped pay for the expedition , will air a television program about the team ’s work on Sunday .

Manning had the team remove the monstrous specimen almost intact , with just the tail in a separate block .
It weighed close to 10,000 pounds ( 4,500 kilograms ) .
They persuaded the Boeing Company and NASA to use a huge computed tomography , or CT , scanner in Canoga Park , California , that is usually used to scan space shuttle parts .
LOOKING FOR THE HEAD
The dense fossil has taken months to scan , Manning said .
“ We will know in the next few days if the head is in there , ” he said .
The tail piece turned up some surprises .
The animal ’s back end is 25 percent larger than previously thought .
Locomotor biologist Bill Sellers of the University of Manchester used a computer program to reconstruct how the hadrosaur would have moved and came up with a picture of an animal that walked not upright , but with its head low to the ground and forearms almost touching .
The strong muscles connecting its upper legs to its tail would have allowed it to run at speeds of up to 28 miles ( 45 km ) an hour , well ahead of its predator , Tyrannosaurus rex .
Patterns in the scales resemble those associated with skin color changes in lizards .
This provides the strongest evidence yet that the animal had stripes , Manning said .
The researchers are looking for preserved proteins .
They have some results that have been offered to a scientific journal , Manning said .
“ It ’s contentious .
We say we are finding soft tissues where people previously have not looked , ” he said .
They also found a second fossil , one that Manning calls the “ the hand of doom . ”
The clawed foot belongs to a species of crocodile that may have been dining on Dakota soon after it died in a riverbed .
“ It could have crawled up the back passage of the animal , went to get the guts and ended up stuck , ” Manning said .
( CNN ) -- White House hopeful Mitt Romney on Thursday articulated his position on the role of religion in America , but avoided details about his personal faith .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said " freedom opens the windows of the soul . "
Romney , who hopes to become the first Mormon president , said " religious tolerance would be a shallow principle , indeed , if it were reserved only for faiths with which we agree . "
" There are some who would have a presidential candidate describe and explain his church 's distinctive doctrines .
To do so would enable the very religious test the founders prohibited in the Constitution , " the former Massachusetts governor said .
" No candidate should become the spokesman for his faith .
For if he becomes president he will need the prayers of the people of all faiths . "
CNN contributor Bill Bennett said he was n't sure Romney addressed the concerns voters might have with Mormonism , but , he added , " I do n't think he had to . "
" I can see this speech he just gave being given by any of the Republican candidates and most of the Democratic candidates , frankly .
I 'm not sure he was responding to the concern ' what about this Mormon thing ? ' " Bennett said .
" I think he will probably get more questions on it , not fewer . "
Another CNN contributor , Roland Martin , said the setting for the speech was a good one -- " in the heart of the Bible Belt . "
Watch Bennett and Martin debate the effectiveness of Romney 's speech »
Romney spoke at former President George H. W. Bush 's presidential library at Texas A&M University before a crowd of about 300 people : a combination of friends , family and religious and conservative leaders .
" What he is trying to say is ' I am a person of faith .
Forget the fact what my faith is , that I am a Mormon .
You might be Christian .
You might be Jewish .
I 'm a person of faith .
I believe in God , ' " Martin said .
Romney said religion is essential to freedom , without pointing to any specific faith .
" Freedom requires religion , just as religion requires freedom .
Freedom opens the windows of the soul so that man can discover his most profound beliefs and commune with God.
Freedom and religion endure together , or perish alone , " the GOP contender said .
Romney , who had brushed off comparisons to John F. Kennedy 's famous address , did n't hesitate to mention the 1960 speech .
" Almost 50 years ago another candidate from Massachusetts explained that he was an American running for president , not a Catholic running for president , " Romney said .
" Like him , I am an American running for president .
I do not define my candidacy by my religion .
A person should not be elected because of his faith nor should he be rejected because of his faith . "
Watch Romney explain what role religion would play in his presidency »
Kennedy took the stage in Houston , Texas , and addressed concerns that the Vatican would influence his policies .
Watch Kennedy describe the ' real issues ' of his time »
Like Kennedy , Romney told the audience that his church would not influence his presidential decisions .
Romney said he did not " confuse " religion and politics as governor and he would not do it as president .
" If I am fortunate to become your president , I will serve no one religion , no one group , no one cause , and no one interest .
A president must serve only the common cause of the people of the United States , " he said .
Romney , however , said he would not distance himself from his religion .
Watch what 's behind Romney 's decision to talk about faith »
" I believe in my Mormon faith and I endeavor to live by it .
My faith is the faith of my fathers -- I will be true to them and to my beliefs , " he said , adding that if his faith hurts his candidacy , " so be it . "
Romney avoided explaining differences in his church 's beliefs and other faiths .
Instead , he pointed to similarities between churches in America , saying they share a " common creed of moral convictions . "
Romney said he thought some have taken the idea of separation of church and state beyond its original meaning by trying to remove any acknowledgment of God from the public arena .
" It is as if they are intent on establishing a new religion in America -- the religion of secularism .
They are wrong , " he said .
Nearly 77 percent of those questioned in an October CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll said the fact that a candidate is a Mormon would not be a factor in the way they vote for president .
But a significant portion -- 19 percent -- said they are less likely to vote for a Mormon .
" Those who have the biggest problem supporting a Mormon are churchgoing and evangelical Christians -- particularly those who believe that Mormonism is not a Christian religion , " CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said , citing the October poll .
What do Mormons believe ? »
And that also represents a large portion of the Republican base .
Religion reporter Dick Ostling said Romney 's speech marks an important moment for Mormons .
" Historically , the church has been very vigorously persecuted , " Ostling told CNN .
" And today they are becoming more normalized in the normal run of American life . "
Ostling said Romney is trying to make the case that although there are are a lot of differences between the Mormon church and Protestant and Catholic Christians , " we can unite behind these cultural , American moral values . "
Romney is trying to win over conservative Christians as rival Republican Mike Huckabee , a former Baptist minister , makes gains in the polls .
The former Arkansas governor is touted in one of his television ads as the " Christian leader . "
" Understand , Mike Huckabee is rising because he is speaking to those social conservatives , these evangelicals .
So Mitt Romney needs to identify with them saying , ' You 're a person of faith , I 'm a person of faith , let 's break bread together , and let 's agree to agree or agree to disagree , ' " Martin said .

What costs more : Global Natural Disasters or America 's War on Drugs ?
Well ... go on ... take a guess .
You know the answer but it seems so absurd .
It 's hard to say it .
That 's because it is a study in absurdity .
The world community spent $ 30 billion for global disasters in 2007 .
While losses soared in 2007 , the figure was far short of the $ 99 billion Munich Re recorded in 2005 - when Hurricane Katrina slammed into New Orleans .
The world 's second - largest reinsurer put total economic losses this year - which includes losses not covered by insurance - from natural disasters at $ 75 billion - a 50 percent increase from last year 's $ 50 billion , but far below the 2005 figure of $ 220 billion .
*****
The company said that , in all , 950 natural disasters were recorded this year - up from 850 last year , and the highest figure since the company started keeping systematic records in 1974 .
That $ 30 billion represents what was actually covered and paid for .
It appears there was another $ 45 billion in assessed damage that was n't paid for .
That article cites global warming as a very real factor in all this and indicates this will all only get worse .
Now consider this : America spends $ 50 billion a year on it's " war on drugs " alone , $ 500 billion since the 1970's .
All for nothing .
Paul Armentano , of NORML , writes in Ending America 's Domestic Quagmire , that America spends $ 50 billion a year now on you - know - what .
America now spends nearly $ 50 billion dollars per year targeting , prosecuting , and incarcerating illicit - drug users .
As a result , the population of illicit - drug offenders now behind bars is greater than the entire U.S. prison population in 1980 .
Since the mid 1990s , drug offenders have accounted for nearly 50 percent of the total federal prison population growth and some 40 percent of all state prison population growth .
For marijuana alone , law enforcement currently spends between $ 7 billion and $ 10 billion dollars annually targeting users -- primarily low - level offenders -- and taxpayers spend more than $ 1 billion annually to incarcerate them .
And a recent journalistic tour de force in Rolling Stone magazine cites " After Thirty - Five Years and $ 500 Billion , Drugs Are as Cheap and Plentiful as Ever : An Anatomy of a Failure . "
Even by conservative estimates , the War on Drugs now costs the United States $ 50 billion each year and has overcrowded prisons to the breaking point - all with little discernible impact on the drug trade .
A report by the Government Accountability Office released at the end of September estimated that ninety percent of the cocaine moving into the United States now arrives through Mexico , up from sixty - six percent in 2000 .
Even Walters acknowledges that for all of the efforts the Bush administration has devoted to overseas drug enforcement , the price of cocaine has dropped while its purity has risen .
More than forty percent of Americans support legalizing marijuana , yet the government continues to target pot smokers .
America wasted more money arresting people and putting them in prison than the world community spent trying to clean up and deal with 950 identified natural disasters .
Money spent vigorously making people 's lives more difficult , rather than spent on making people 's lives LESS difficult .
More from the Rolling Stone article , which talks at length about the failure of the War on Drugs military - style cocaine interdiction :
Overseas military efforts were the least effective way to decrease drug use , and imprisoning addicts was prohibitively expensive .
The only cost - effective way to put a dent in the market , it turned out , was drug treatment .
" It 's not a magic bullet , " says Reuter , the RAND scholar who helped supervise the study , " but it works . "
The study ultimately ushered RAND , this vaguely creepy Cold War relic , into a position as the permanent , pragmatic left wing of American drug policy , the most consistent force for innovating and reinventing our national conception of the War on Drugs .
When Everingham 's team looked more closely at drug treatment , they found that thirteen percent of hardcore cocaine users who receive help substantially reduced their use or kicked the habit completely .
They also found that a larger and larger portion of illegal drugs in the U.S. were being used by a comparatively small group of hardcore addicts .
There was , the study concluded , a fundamental imbalance :
The crack epidemic was basically a domestic problem , but we had been fighting it more aggressively overseas .
" What we began to realize , " says Jonathan Caulkins , a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studied drug policy for RAND , " was that even if you only get a percentage of this small group of heavy drug users to abstain forever , it 's still a really great deal . "
People who smoke marijuana are a considerably larger percentage of the population than " drug addicts " or hard drugs users not otherwise specified .
Law enforcement arrested over 800,000 Americans for pot last year .
Is that not astounding ?
How can that be " unimportant " ?
If you realize that pot smoking is n't the horrible thing the ONDCP and others wish for you to believe , that all they will ever tell you is hype and propaganda ; if you understand it is far less impactful than tobacco or alcohol ( being non-fatal is one handy measure ) , and if you add to this realization that the main consequence of pot smoking is entirely contrived and artificial - arrest and involvement in America 's " justice system " - then you should be able imagine that pot should not be " illegal " .
If marijuana is relegalized , what will law enforcement have to do ?
The " pool " of hardcore drug users is dwindling , which is good for us but not so good for law enforcement budgets .
Legal marijuana removes one huge focus of law enforcement attention ( otherwise known as a " distraction " ) .
Now , if you focus all that manpower and money wasted on marijuana n dealing with the hardcore folks , I suppose they could all be arrested and put in jail .
Or community policing .
Something that helps the community .
The legislative and law enforcement approach to " drugs " has been a failure , if for no other reason than it is fundamentally the incorrect solution to the problem .
Addiction and drug abuse are medical problems first and foremost .
With the population of hard drugs users , one main issue is that in jail they still require care and a lot of these people will be high - maintenance and expensive to keep in prison .
Treatment options and availability should be increased .
In the end they need treatment because this is a medical issue first and foremost .
So one way or another the government is going to pay for treatment for these people .
Which means , legal or illegal , you the tax payer WILL pay for their treatment , like it or not .
I say it 's better to fund treatment - make it part of the coming healthcare overhaul that is long overdue in this country .
For those who gasp or get all addled when this topic surfaces , relegalization means 2 basic things :
1 : It means that cannabis was once legal .
And by following the rules of the Constitution , reformers wish to make it legal again .
2 : Relegalization means regulation .
Tobacco and alcohol are the models for rendering dangerous elements legally available .
Regarding specifically tobacco regulation : citing statistics claiming that slightly more tenth - grade students have smoked pot than tobacco as evidence that regulation of tobacco works .
Simply put , we have leverage over tobacco sellers that we do n't have with marijuana dealers .
Because tobacco retailers and producers are licensed and regulated , we have some control over them .
If they want to keep their lucrative businesses , cigarette merchants have a strong incentive to follow the laws -- even laws they do n't like .
Consider this :
As part of their reaction to the Synar Amendment , tobacco retailers adopted a " voluntary " program called " We Card . "
Today , virtually any store that sells cigarettes posts a large , brightly colored sign saying , " Under 18 , No Tobacco .
We Card . " **** Regulation works .
Prohibition deprives authorities of the best tools available to successfully regulate sales and marketing .
Prohibition has handed the entire , annual $ 113 billion marijuana industry over to unregulated criminals , with entirely predictable consequences .
What about the prison industry , though ?
Lots of folks are in prison in America .
It 's been a growth industy
As of year - end 2006 , the Bureau of Justice Statistics ( BJS ) reported that American jails and prisons held a record - breaking 2,258,983 men and women , and that one in 31 adults are now under some form of correctional supervision .
Analysis of the report , released last week by The Sentencing Project revealed that , since 1980 , there has been a 1,200 percent increase in the number of people incarcerated for the possession or sale of illicit substances , from 41,100 to at least 532,400 today .
At nearly double the rate of men , the number of women in prison has increased by 812 percent in that same time period .
In October , the Marijuana Policy Project also reported that marijuana arrests exceeded nearly 830,000 in the same year , resulting in one pot-related arrest every 38 seconds .
And we are no safer .
It 's irresponsible .
Democratic Policy
It should be the goal of the Democratic party , since it 's going to cast off the corporate influences and become a party of " the People " , to end the " war on drugs " as it is now known .
The cannabis plant would be relegalized and regulated post haste .
This is one of the few major issues that can be corrected relatively easily , quickly and cheaply .
There is a massive logjam of laws that has to be addressed , but law enforcement can be ordered to stand down on all cannabis - related matters and their attention immediately diverted to more pressing issues .
( unless we find we simply have too many ... )
A committee would be needed to work on releasing marijuana prisoners from incarceration .
Effective drug policies would be drafted , including harm - reduction perspectives and drug - diversion courts for addicts .
All of this can start with Democratic Candidates talking about " the need for reform " , when the issue arises .
Because the issue is so highly emotional , thanks to decades of highly - emotionalized propaganda , real leadership on this issue will come in the form of Democratic leaders who talk simply and plainly about the overt failure of drug policy , and lament that change is needed .
Nearly half of America openly supports changing cannabis laws and doing something about the out - of - control nature of the current war on drugs .
Democratic leaders should want to tap into that .
We spend more on chasing pot smokers and drug addicts in the US alone than was spent globally cleaning up from a year of natural disasters .
Think what good could have been done with all that wasted money and human effort .
It 's just wrong to work that hard and spend such astronomical sums of money to make people more miserable than to help make them less miserable .
But then , I am a liberal .

Alexander Janssen , a Tor node operator located in Germany , has shut down his node after a second confrontation with police several months ago .
Law enforcement agents entered Janssen 's home , handcuffed him , and searched the premises .
Janssen was informed that he was a suspect in a bomb threat investigation involving an Internet forum .
He was then taken to the police barracks where he was interrogated .
After Janssen was released , a German state security official informed him that the detainment was a misunderstanding .
Tor is an anonymizing proxy service that obscures the origin of users by relaying traffic through various nodes on the network .
The destination server sees the IP address of the Tor exit node rather than the IP address of the user .
Unfortunately , this has made
Tor exit node operators the accidental targets of police investigations that involve the Internet activity of users who rely on Tor to hide their identity .
Janssen 's situation is not unique .
Tor exit nodes were seized by the German government last year during a child pornography investigation .
Early this year , Janssen also became a suspect in a child pornography investigation as a result of traffic relayed by his Tor exit node .
At the time , Janssen was able to resolve the problem with a lawyer , but it left him shaken .
His latest confrontation with German law enforcement agents was enough to convince him to give up .
" I 've shut down my Tor- server , " wrote Janssen in a blog entry yesterday .
" I can't do this anymore ; my wife and I were scared to death .
I 'm at the end of my civil courage .
I 'll keep engaged in the Tor- project , but I wo n't run a server anymore . "
Like the German government 's recent law against hacking software that inadvertently criminalized many computer security tools , the country 's attempts to harass
Tor node operators reflect an unwillingness to distinguish between a legitimate technical service and criminal behavior .
Yesterday , Rolling Stone online put together a list of what they called “ The Fifty Best Songs Over Seven Minutes Long . ”
Not so much .
Sure , there were some all - time great songs on that list , but other songs were n’t even the best long song by the particular artist , much less on a 50 best ever list .
So , I figured that I ’d do my own .
Thanks to the magic of an iTunes playlist sort , it did n’t take very long to put together .
Here are my rules : because some artists ( Neil Young , Velvet Underground ) work better with long songs , I figured that it was OK to have multiple songs by individual artists .
I did , however , discount anything that had never been commercially released , which wiped out a lot of Bruce Springsteen songs .
Like Rolling Stone ’s list , this is alphabetical by artist .

Scandal Brewing for Miss France Valerie Begue ( Photos )
was crowned 2008 Miss France earlier this month .
She was embroiled in an attempt to strip her of her the crown and title because of some suggestive photos that have surfaced .
After a huge media storm , a compromise has been reached and she will be allowed to reign .
The pictures of the 22 year old beauty queen show her floating in a pool on a wooden cross in a Christ like pose .
Another photo shows her licking condensed milk in a provocative pose .
The newly crowned Miss France refuses to relinquish her new title .
She indicates that she did not give her permission to the individuals who published the photos and is therefore not responsible for the firestorm they have caused .
The 800,000 residents of the French island of La Reunion are backing their hometown girl but , unfortunately for Begue , they do n't have any say in the matter .
The pageant organization has decide that Begue will be allowed to keep her title , but having the crown and title stripped is not without precedent .
The 2004 Miss France was suspended from performing her duties for six months after photos of her surfaced in Playboy magazine .
Begue held fast to the title , refusing to stand down .
In a compromise , she keeps the title and crown but will not be able to participate in upcoming international competitions .
We 've got additional photos .
Jeff Jones , a director of security strategy at Microsoft published a report today about counting bugs .
I blogged a few months ago about why I think counting bugs is less than useful :
Since all software has bugs , it ’s more important to consider how long it takes to get a fix out when a security issue is discovered than it is to count bugs .
Number of vulnerabilities identified is a function of how many bugs are present , but is probably more influenced by things like who is looking , and how good they are at finding security issues .
That makes it a misleading metric .
When you compare how long it takes Microsoft to fix Internet Explorer vulnerabilities versus how long it takes Mozilla to fix vulnerabilities in Firefox it becomes clear why he chose to count vulnerabilities in this report instead .
Earlier this year Brian Krebs of the Washington Post came up with this when comparing IE to Firefox :
For a total 284 days in 2006 ( or more than nine months out of the year ) , exploit code for known , unpatched critical flaws in pre-IE7 versions of the browser was publicly available on the Internet …
In contrast , Internet Explorer ’s closest competitor in terms of market share — Mozilla ’s Firefox browser — experienced a single period lasting just nine days last year in which exploit code for a serious security hole was posted online before Mozilla shipped a patch to remedy the problem .
Mike Schroepfer goes into this in more detail in his post today .
One of the goals of the bug counting report is to demonstrate that Microsoft fixed fewer bugs for IE than Mozilla did for Firefox .
Unfortunately for Microsoft ( and for anyone trying to use this report as analysis of useful metrics ) he does not count all the security issues .
If he were able to count them all , Microsoft could get credit for all the bugs they fixed .
He counts only the public issues , because that is all Microsoft will tell us about .
Microsoft is worried that if it ever says it has fixed X security issues , the world will focus on that it had X vulnerabilities in the first place , not that they are now fixed and no longer a risk for users .
So the set of issues that are available for public comparison is limited to the set of vulnerabilities that are reported externally AND fixed in security updates .
This is a small subset of all the vulnerabilities , because the vulnerabilities that are found through the QA process and the vulnerabilities that are found by the security folks they engage as contractors to perform penetration testing are fixed in service packs and major updates .
For Microsoft this makes sense because these fixes get the benefit of a full test pass which is much more robust for a service pack or major release than it is for a security update .
Unfortunately for Microsoft ’s users this means they have to wait sometimes a year or more to get the benefit of this work .
That ’s a lot of time for an attacker to identify the same issue and exploit it to hurt users .
Sometimes it just takes time to put in a complicated fix .
Anyone that has shipped a major piece of software can relate to that .
But this is not the case for every internally found security issue .
Extending this process to include fixes that are ready and just sitting on the tree waiting for the preferred vehicle to ship increases risk for users .
But it sure keeps those bug count numbers down .
If we as an industry would just acknowledge that counting bugs is useless then vendors could feel safe talking about what they are doing to protect users .
At Mozilla we fix our bugs openly .
When you count Mozilla security bugs you are seeing not just those that are reported externally , but also the ones that would be considered internal if we acted like most other software vendors .
Since all software has security vulnerabilities , we consider a vulnerability identified and fixed a win .
It speaks to the strength of our community based security efforts to actively identify and quickly fix security issues .
We do n’t let fixes languish on the tree waiting for a major release while users are vulnerable .
We ship fixes regularly because securing our users is more important than protecting our PR team from having to respond to articles about counting bugs instead of looking at the metrics that actually indicate whether a vendor is doing reasonable things to keep users secure .
We ’re not building fixes for our PR team , we ’re building them for our users .
Go ahead and count .
Pantech add bone conduction to silent cellphone
Bone conduction .
No , not some heinous experiment involving a hot - plate and the contents of your Dad ’s underpants , it ’s a way of squirrelling sound into your ears by directly vibrating your skull .
The key benefits are that you can still hear despite ambient noise – that means you do n’t have to turn the volume up – and it ’s far more private as eavesdroppers would have to press their faces against yours to hear it .
And you ’d probably notice them doing that .
We ’ve seen it before on Bluetooth headsets and mp3 players , but Pantech are perhaps the first to put it directly into a cellphone with their A1407 PT .
Currently available for the Korean KDDI network , the specs are generally unremarkable – 2.4 - inch QVGA display , 1.3 - megapixel camera , 20 MB built in with a microSD slot for expansion – aside from the bone conduction .
As the vaguely confused lady in the photo above is demonstrating , you can even pretend the A1407PT is an electric shaver , while still listening to whoever it is that called you .
Super discrete !
No word on whether the hump - backed handset will be available outside of Korea .

One of the beautiful things about the Internet is that it is supposed to level the playing field between the major corporations and the little guy trying to eke out a living on his own from his basement .
Many a netrepreneur has managed to go start a company on a shoe string and turn it into a business that generates a nice profit .
The whole point of Search Engine Guide and our sister site , Small Business Brief , is to try and help people learn how to do just that .
So , I 've decided to set up a little challenge for myself and to both blog and write articles on it over the next month .
The idea is to try to setup some type of business in my free time and see if I can start to turn a profit in a 30 day period .
That should n't be too hard , since I 'm also going to limit myself to spending zero cash out of pocket .
That means that any sales at all will be profit .
I plan to outline all of the steps that I take over this 30 day period so that readers can find out what worked , what did n't , and maybe get some ideas to try with their own sites .
The point I need to make again is the lack of money involved here .
There 's a big difference between what someone can do with cash to pay for hosting , for marketing , for web analysis and so on .
I 'll be working without many of those advantages , using only what I can get for free .
Day One
Trying to come up with an idea to make money online that does n't require any cash up front is tough .
Off the top of my head , I could come up with a couple of different options .
Selling on eBay seemed to be the most obvious , with generating profits via AdSense being my second choice .
But I decided to bypass both of those and take advantage of CafePress .
CafePress is a site that allows you to create your own shirts , mugs , bumper stickers and more and put them online .
They handle the printing , the shipping , etc .
All site owners have to do is come up with the ideas and promote the products .
In fact , according to CafePress , some shopkeepers earn six figures a year from their stores .
I had played around a few months ago with their free store and thrown some products online .
While checking in earlier this week I noticed that I 'd sold four products , despite the fact that I was running a free store and had never done any promotion of it .
Those four products generated about $ 8 , which was enough to upgrade me to a premium store for a month .
I also realized that I still had a $ 100 Google AdWords coupon sitting around , so I decided to use that to start promoting the site and thus , the idea was born .
( You can say that I 'm cheating by starting off with $ 108 , but the reality is that none of that came from my pocket , so I 'm not . )
I knew that any old store was unlikely to have a chance at making a profit without some real marketing dollars behind it , so I decided to focus on a highly niche market that did n't have a lot of competition , but that could attract some viral marketing and attention .
As a breast feeding advocate that has exclusively pumped for a full year , I had spent enough time in online message boards and sites to know that there was a solid base of women out there that would have an interest in unique shirts that helped them share their views with the world .
Thus , " The Lactivist " was born .
Day one saw me sitting around trying to come up with unique slogans and ideas for products .
I 'm not a skilled graphic designer , but I do have a sense of humor .
Since I could n't spend any money on my project , that meant that I was mostly limited to pure text with a few font variations .
I came up with about a dozen different slogans , uploaded them to my store and selected the products to go with them .
While I wanted to take the time to really customize my store and get some solid product descriptions written , I was doing this in my spare time and only had an hour or so left to work that evening .
The need for traffic was strong and I knew that I could setup a PPC campaign more quickly than I could optimize page content and get it indexed .
Thus , the rest of my time was spent setting up a pay - per - click campaign aimed at two different sets of keywords .
I selected about fifty different keywords and set them to exact match to get started with plans to expand the campaign a little further down the road when I saw how traffic started to pan out .
I also wrote seven ads for each campaign to get started so that I can test some different messages and start tweaking my copy later this week .
Finally , I setup conversion tracking through Google 's AdWords interface because I wo n't have the cash to setup tracking via an analytics program like ClickTracks .
Tomorrow I 'll be focusing on shifting around product categories on my site in order to get the most sellable products in front of customers .
I 'll also add image ads to my AdWords campaign and research sites that I can set those ads to run on .

Friction
By David Flanagan .
This article has been a long time in the writing and I welcome any comments or corrections .
Thanks to Richard Jones and Glen Harding for their input .

Friction is the magic ingredient in bouldering .
It 's what makes the best moves and sequences subtle and surprising .
Friction is a variable , some days it 's better than others and on the right day anything is possible .
It 's the reason we go out in our down jackets and woolly hats on those freezing cold winter days .
The association boulderers make is that
cold = friction
But is it as simple as that ?
What other factors influence friction ?
Should climbing shoes be soft or hard ?
Does chalk really help ?
Should we get as much rubber on the rock as possible ?
Does our foot slip because there was too much weight on the hold or too little ?
The classical approximation of the force of friction states :
F= �R F = Friction
� = coefficient of friction ( COF )
R = resultant force
The frictional force is always exerted in the opposite direction to the object 's movement or potential movement .
The COF has to be measured experimentally , it can not be found through calculations .
It is a property of the two surfaces interacting , for example the COF of rubber on ice is different to that of rubber on rock .
The rougher the surfaces the higher the value .
Static versus Dynamic friction
There are two types of friction , dynamic and static .
As regards our hands we are only interested in static friction as once the relationship becomes dynamic you have slipped and are mat bound .
However it may not be so simple for rubber .
According to Professor Richard Jones from the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Sheffield
" The one item I might seriously quibble with you about is when you say that you 're interested only in static friction , not dynamic friction .
What you say would certainly be true if you were talking about anything other than rubber , because static friction is usually higher than dynamic friction , so once you start to slip you keep on going .
But yet again , rubber is different .
Because the friction coefficient tends to increase with velocity ( up to a point ) , and is very low for zero velocities ( in fact , some researchers doubt whether there is actually a true static friction for rubber at all ) , I think what happens is that when you make a friction move your feet very slowly start to creep down until the friction gets to a point at which it balances the downward force .
This creeping velocity is probably very small , possibly imperceptible .
Yet I wonder whether those really talented climbers who have a dynamic , flowing style are n't subconsciously aware of this and exploit it . "
Friction and Contact Area
You will notice there is no mention of contact area in the classical approximation of the force of friction , this is because friction is independent of the contact area ( in theory ) .
To the naked eye a material may seem smooth but if you look at it closely it will appear rough .
When two materials are in contact it is the peaks of this roughness , known as asperities , that actually touch .
So the true contact area is less than the apparent contact area ( see below ) .
For example the true contact area of a car 's tyre is usually about 1 % of the apparent contact area ( source )
The true contact area ( at asperity tips ) is much smaller than the apparent contact area .
Consider a brick on a table .
When the large side of the brick is in contact with the table ( large apparent contact area ) there are a large number of asperities that support the load .
When the small side is in contact ( smaller apparent contact area ) there are fewer asperities but the area of each asperitie is larger due to the higher pressure ( same force , smaller area ) so there will be no difference in the amount of friction .
Hence friction is independent of surface area .
Forget about all that for climbing as the classical approximation of the force of friction applies to most materials but not rubber and skin .
Friction , as scientists talk about it , applies to two smooth parallel materials sliding against one another .
Not one hard , irregular surface ( rock ) pressing into a soft , supple surface ( rubber or skin ) .
This means that for rock / rubber / skin interaction the apparent and true contact areas are the same and hence friction is proportional to the contact area .
This is why when smearing you should get as much rubber in contact with the rock as possible .
Softness allows rubber or skin to mesh with rock and roughness ensures the contact area will be large .
For optimal grip we want rough rock ( up to a point , we will come back to this later ) and soft but not too soft shoes .
There are two aspects to friction , the hands on rock and the feet on rock and it's worth look at them separately .
Feet
Rubber generates friction in 3 ways
Deformation
Also know as mechanical keying , the pressing of rubber on rock results in the deformation of the rubber by the asperities of the rock .
The more load on the rubber the more penetration .

Wear Imagine the resistance generated by shaving a thin layer of rubber from your shoes this is a macro version of friction due to wear .
This is n't a good thing and costs us a fortune .
Smearing on Three Rock
Rubber needs to be soft to allow it mould to the rock but if it's too soft the rubber will deform and slip .
For a given compound of rubber the softness will vary with temperature hence the friction of rubber varies with temperature .
When a F1 car is racing around the track it 's tyres heat up .
The rubber compound used in the tyres is designed to work best at this high temperature .
This is why the teams pre-heat their tyres so they work optimally from the start .
Similarly climbing shoe manufacturers design their shoe rubber to work best in a specific temperature range ( 0 - 5° centigrade ) , below this the rubber is harder and wo n't mould well to the shape of the rock and above this the rubber will be too soft and will deform too easily .
This why climbing shoes work best in the cold .
Why was 0 - 5° range chosen as the optimal performance temperature for climbing shoe rubber ?
Because it is too cold for the hands to sweat but not too cold to warm up .
Why do n't they design the rubber to work well at a more normal temperature of say 12° ?
Yes shoes would work best but the hand grip would be sub-optimal and therefore you would never have optimal hand and foot grip at the same time .
Edging
New shoe versus old shoe
When edging the contact area is limited to the size of the edge .
Standing on a small edge is a mechanical act , friction is n't the deciding issue , this is why old school nailed boots work relatively well on edges .
When edging we want a hard compound rubber that is stiff and wo n't deform and roll off the edge .
New shoes are better at edging for two reasons , firstly the rubber is harder before it is worn in and secondly the edge of the shoe is better defined so the contact area is larger .
Ideally we would have rubber compounds designed for edging and others for smearing .
Also since any given rubber compound is designed to work optimally at a specific temperature , one that works best bouldering in Font in January will underperform sport climbing in Spain in June .
All rubber compounds are a compromise between these and many other factors .
So it seems that shoe and rubber design has a long way to go in terms of customisation .
Bulk effects
Due to it 's chemical structure when rubber moves across a rough surface it compresses and expands , this deformation at the surface causes energy loss some distance away .
This bulk effect is a significant factor in the high friction properties of rubber .
This energy loss ( hysteresis ) depends on temperature and frequency ( think of frequency as a measure of roughness i.e. the closer the bumps are together the rougher the surface ) and is a major reason why the friction of rubber is so sensitive to changes in temperature .
Why do n't climbing shoes have thread ?
Car tyres have tread to improve contact between the tyre and the road in wet conditions .
The thread allows the water on the surface of the road to escape as the tyre presses onto it .
Without treads the water is unable to escape and a thin layer of water remains between the road and the tyre 's surface which causes a severe loss of grip .
However if the road is dry the tread reduces the contact area between the tyre and the road and hence the grip .
This is why treadless tyres are used in motor racing when the track is smooth and dry .
We do n't climb in the wet so climbing shoes are threadless to maximise grip .
Hands
P = F/ A P = Pressure
F = Force
A = Area
Our skin has a certain amount of strength ie .
it can resist a certain amount of pressure ( force over a given area ) be it a low force on a small area ( a tiny crimp on a slab ) or a high force on a large area ( a big sloper on an overhang ) .
Once the pressure is above this threshold our skin will tear .
This is another reason why increasing the contact area is so important , spreading the load will prevent our skin from tearing .
Flapper .
Moisturise !
Skin
We have contours in our skin 's surface called friction ridges that help the hand to grasp by increasing friction .
Friction ridges occur in patterns ( fingerprint ) .
What properties do we want in our skin to have ?
It should be smooth so there are no points of weakness where tearing can start ( this is why some boulderers use sandpaper to smooth burrs in their skin between tries on a problem ) .
It should be thick but not too thick or else it will rip off in lumps ( see photo above ) .
This thickness makes pulling on rough rock more comfortable and can be built up by loads of climbing or manual work .
It should n't be too dry as dry skin tears easily , this is why some climbers use moisturiser ( gay ) .
Stump cream
There is a product available on the web called Anti-Hydral cream ( a.k.a. Stump Cream ) that was designed to keep the skin on amputee 's stumps dry and supple .
When applied to the fingertips it thickens the skin and reduces sweating , but be careful it does n't dry out your skin by using it sparingly and moisturising .
It can be bought www.mycare.de.
What happens to our hands in the cold ?
The cold has a two pronged effect on our hands .
Firstly our hands sweat less and secondly our skin becomes harder ( the cold reduces the fluidity of the liquids that constitute our cellular membranes ) .
Dry hard hands have better friction than soft , damp ones .
The wind affects hand friction but not foot friction .
The wind does n't influence the temperature of the rock but it does influence the temperature of our hands and thus reduces sweating and increases friction .
Chalk
So what 's the story with chalk ?
A recent study by the University of Birmingham wrote :
" Magnesium carbonate , or ' chalk ' , is used by rock climbers to dry their hands to increase the coefficient of friction , thereby improving the grip of the holds .
To date , no scientific research supports this practice ; indeed , some evidence suggests that magnesium carbonate could decrease the coefficient of friction .
Fifteen participants were asked to apply a force with the tip of their fingers to hold a flattened rock ( normal force ) , while a tangential force pulled the rock away .
The coefficient of friction -- that is , the ratio between the tangential force ( pulling the rock ) and the normal force ( applied by the participants ) - - was calculated .
Coating ( chalk vs no chalk ) , dampness ( water vs no water ) and rock ( sandstone , granite and slate ) were manipulated .
The results showed that chalk decreased the coefficient of friction .
Sandstone was found to be less slippery than granite and slate .
Finally , water had no significant effect on the coefficient of friction .
The counter - intuitive effect of chalk appears to be caused by two independent factors .
First , magnesium carbonate dries the skin , decreasing its compliance and hence reducing the coefficient of friction .
Secondly , magnesium carbonate creates a slippery granular layer .
We conclude that , to improve the coefficient of friction in rock climbing , an effort should be made to remove all particles of chalk ; alternative methods for drying the fingers are preferable . "

The only really surprising conclusion is that water has no effect on friction .
We know that chalk decreases friction but it decreases friction less than sweaty hands do so it 's a necessary evil for most climbers .
However I think they are wrong to say that " magnesium carbonate dries the skin , decreasing its compliance and hence reducing the coefficient of friction " , yes chalk dries the skin , yes dry skin has a decrease compliance ( ie. is harder ) but hardening skin does n't reduce the COF it increases it .
I do n't think the researchers had much input from climbers .
In the introduction that equate chalk and talcum powder which is just wrong .
The subjects in their test applied the force to the rock by pushing down on a slab of rock with their fingertips it would be a lot more realistic if the test subjects hung from a large sloping hold instead .
I would also suspect that the participants in the study did n't remove the excess chalk as thoroughly as a climber would .
Some of the fancier brands of chalks contain an extra drying agent , this will dry our skin and make it harder .
This is a good thing as it replicates the effect of colder temperatures however be sure to wash your hands after you are finished climbing to prevent your skin getting too dry .
Rock
We know from experience that granite has better grip than slate , this is because granite has large crystals that deform the surface that is in contact with it whereas slate is a very smooth fine grained rock , this means there is a greater contact area for granite .
But what about sandstone which is not as rough as granite but has as good ( if not better ) grip ?
Rougher is better but only up to a point .
Friction depends on the true contact area of the two objects .
As the rock gets to a certain roughness the irregularities are so large that the rubber can't adapt to them .
This is the point at which increasing roughness causes decreasing friction .
Even for the same rock type grain size can vary hugely compare Three Rock granite ( left ) and Glendalough granite ( right ) .
Factors that influence friction
Grain size : Refers to the physical dimensions of individual particles of rock .

Grain shape : Sharp grains will have higher friction than round ones .
How the rock was weathered ie .
by wind , rain , glaciers etc. will influence the grain shape .

Sorting : Well sorted ( grains of approximately all one size ) materials have higher porosity than similarly sized poorly sorted materials ( where smaller particles fill the gaps between larger particles ) .
Gritstone is poorly sorted with grains ranging from sand to pebble size .
Sandstone is well sorted .
The image below shows how some smaller grains can fill the pores drastically reducing porosity while only being a small fraction of the total volume of the material .

Well cemented :
Is it well held together , certain types of granite and sandstone are n't , when climbed on grains break off and act like ball bearings .
A given compound of rubber will work optimally at a certain temperature on a certain rock type , for a smoother rock type the temperature will need to be higher for the same shoes to work optimally .
So the rougher the rock the softer the shoes .
What happens on a hot day ?
Our hands sweat but does the rock sweat ?
No if there is moisture in the air some will , naturally , be present on the rock but on a sunny day the rock wo n't start to emit moisture .
Summary
Nothing in life is simple especially the simple things .
The interaction of rubber and skin with rock is complicated but hopefully this article has clarified some things .
It seems that most factors that influence friction obey the law of diminishing returns , cold but not too cold , soft but not too soft , rough but not too rough etc .

The mathematics of smearing
Forces involved in standing on a sloping hold
The normal force pushing your foot on the smear is
N = mg SinA
where
m is your mass
g is the acceleration due to gravity and
A is the angle of the smear to the horizontal .
The shear force that is trying to make your foot slip is
F = mg CosA
For your foot to stay on the smear the friction force must be greater or equal to the shear force .
So
umg SinA > mg CosA
where
u is the coefficient of friction ( the stickyness of your boots ) .
The mass and the acceleration due to gravity cancel and if we simplify we get
u > 1 / TanA
Therefore your foot sticking depends only on the angle of the hold and the stickyness of your shoes .
Your mass does n't matter ( fatties take note ) .
Those who know me well are aware that I ’ve been going on about this for years , but for some reason I ’ve only just now remembered that I have my own website and can carry on the effort here .
Folks , there are a few drinking holidays here in the United States , but I ’m here to tell you that none of them are as important as the new celebration I ’m proposing for this great country of ours .
Allow me to start from the beginning :
Saint Patrick ’s Day
Saint Patrick ’s Day ( March 17th ) , a national holiday in Ireland , is a feast day that commemorates Saint Patrick , the patron saint of Ireland .
It was brought to the United States by Irish immigrants and is now celebrated by Irish and non-Irish alike .
Cities with large Irish populations host huge celebrations with parades , where scores of drunken fraternities swallow huge amounts of Guinness Stout , Jameson Irish Whiskey , Bailey ’s Irish Cream , and Mickey ’s Malt Liquor .
Sometimes corned beef is eaten .
Cinco de Mayo
Cinco de Mayo ( May 5th ) is a Mexican holiday that celebrates the the victory of Mexican troops over the French occupational army in the Battle of Puebla on May 5th , 1862 .
It has been adopted as a commercialized drinking holiday by the United States , where people flock to chain Mexican restaurants to gulp down huge quantities blended margaritas , shots of Jose Cuervo tequila and bottles of Corona beer .
Chips and salsa are served .
Halloween
Halloween ( October 31st ) began as a Celtic Pagan festival , named as the evening ( e ’en ) before All Hallow ’s Day on November 1st .
Halloween was n’t widely celebrated in the United States until the middle of the 20th century , and is now the sixth most profitable holiday for retailers .
It is celebrated by this country ’s drinking - age population in the form of dressing up in very slutty costumes and consuming large amounts of alcohol .
Any kind .
Dry ice is often involved .
Repeal Day
Repeal Day ( December 5th ) is not celebrated by anyone in this country , yet it is the only day which truly has any connection with alcohol .
December 5th is the anniversary of the day the United States repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and gave us all the constitutional right to consume alcohol .
I ’ve been celebrating Repeal Day for years by forcing this information down the throats of my customers , and now I ’m forcing it on you .
Here are a few reasons why I think Repeal Day should be a major drinking holiday in the United States :
We have the constitutional right to do so .
How many forms of pleasure are guaranteed by the Constitution ?
None , unless you ’re one of those who get an inflated sense of ego from holding a firearm or speaking in public .
Me , I ’m going to stick with alcohol .
It ’s at the right time .
Conveniently located about halfway between Thanksgiving and Christmas , at a time when we ’re probably not with our families , the Fifth of December represents a great time to get together with friends and celebrate our constitutional rights .
Repeal Day does n’t exclude .
Are you an American , or are you located in the United States ?
Congratulations , you ’re invited to join our party !
Sorry , gay leprechauns , but Saint Patrick ’s Day is off limits .
Being French on Cinco de Mayo is about as cool as being British on the Fourth of July .
But December
Fifth is a day that ’s open to anyone !
It ’s easy !
There are no outfits to buy , costumes to rent , rivers to dye green .
Simply celebrate the day by stopping by your local bar , tavern , saloon , winery , distillery , or brewhouse and having a drink .
Pick up a six - pack on your way home from work .
Split a bottle of wine with a loved one .
Buy a shot for a stranger .
Just do it because you can .
Thanks for reading about what I hope will become a more widely - celebrated day in this country .
Please help spread the word about Repeal Day , and tell a friend .
Cheers !

By
I ’ve been a Second Life resident for well over a year now .
In November I finally took the plunge and signed up for World of Warcraft and have been grinding through the early levels .
I ’ve reached Level 15 as both a Dwarf Warrior and Human Mage and have reached a little below that as a Night Elf .
I feel I ’ve spent enough time to grasp the basics of the game and to at least partially understand its appeal .
I thought it might be worth doing a short critique of both platforms as they sit in a wider virtual world context .
A disclaimer – this is probably only going to interest someone who has n’t used both platforms .
Veteran users of both will find most of the points below fairly obvious .
For brevity I ’ll use WoW for World or Warcraft and SL for Second Life .
Onto the critique :
1. Second Life is by far the most ‘ free ’ .
WoW by its very nature requires rigidity as far as areas you can explore at particular stages of the game .
If you ’re a Level 1 human mage in WoW then you wo n’t be exploring the Westfall area as it ’s inhabitated by critters of well over Level 10 .
You can go there but you ’ll spend your time being killed time after time or constantly running to avoid each critter .
This is n’t a criticism of WoW , just a gameplay reality .
Second Life in comparison only has limitations set by users – if someone owns land in Second Life and does n’t want you to be able to access it , then you wo n’t .
Because there are no overarching game objectives in Second Life , you ’re free to explore at will .
You ’ll get used to being dead in the early stages of WoW – unless you have more experienced friends willing to help while you level up
2. Both are extremely social experiences .
It ’s a very obvious statement but when I signed up for WoW I was actually expecting that the gameplay would interfere with the great social interaction achieved in SL .
What I did n’t realise was the social fun to be had in the main cities like Stormwind and Iron Forge .
Plus , groups of avatars tend to congregate pretty much anywhere for a chat , some dueling or even some dancing .
Aussies socialising in SL
3 . Graphically , it ’s no contest .
WoW has stupendous graphics that make SL look pretty poor in comparison , even with Windlight on its way .
Of course , it ’s very easy for WoW to provide great graphics when the main grunt work is being done by your own computer .
SL ’s centralised server model makes that much more difficult – it remains one of SL ’s biggest challenges but it ’s also one of it ’s strengths – see point 1 .
Even the barren areas are damn pretty
4. ‘ Safety ’ is an issue for both .
The media attention on Second Life in regard to ageplay , gambling and addiction .
WoW has similar challanges but they ’re less overt than SL .
Addiction is an issue that spans across all virtual worlds and it ’s one that is n’t well understood , though that is changing .
SL does have its Teen Grid but it ’s under- utilised and arguably under - supported by Linden Lab .
5 . Fun is provided differently .
I ’m going to make some broad statements here .
Both WoW and SL are immense fun but in very different ways .
For pure gaming / questing fun , WoW wins hands down .
For more whimsical , sophisticated and free - ranging amusement , SL has the upper hand .
No , that does n’t mean WoW users are unsophisticated , nor that SL users are not interested in games / quests – the fact is they are very disparate beasts .
There ’s also no doubt there ’s a significant cohort of people who participate in both worlds and my hunch is they do so because of the different experiences they offer .
It ’s all about education in Second Life
So which is ‘ best ’ ?
The answer of course is neither .
I need to spend more time in WoW to fully grasp its possibiities but my gut feel at this stage is I prefer the less constrained environment of SL – it ’s educational opportunities alone keep me coming back day after day .
But if I want some fast paced gaming , then WoW is the place to be .
I ’d be really interested to hear your thoughts .
Have I got it totally wrong or does your experiences match those I ’ve outlined above ?

I 've been absolutely fascinated watching the unfolding debate in the jihadist forums and various Arab media about what happened with al - Jazeera and bin Laden 's Iraq address .
Some things that I 've been reading about the episode are just wrong .
This is not the first time that al - Jazeera has angered al - Qaeda .
The jihadist forums routinely lambast al - Jazeera , along with the other Arab media outlets , for not acting as the propaganda outlets that they 'd like .
They 've been frustrated for years with al - Jazeera 's presentation of the tapes , cutting them up and airing only the newsworthy bits , with commentary and analysis from often unsympathetic guests .
That 's one of the many reasons that they came to rely on the internet distribution method , so that they would n't be at al - Jazeera 's mercy .
Still , it 's clear that this one is something special - they are genuinely outraged , beyond the norm .
It 's pretty clear that , at least in the eyes of his followers and online interpreters , bin Laden did not mean what most people thought he meant in the address .
He was not addressing al - Qaeda in Iraq or the Islamic State of Iraq , or focusing on their errors .
He was not calling for reconciliation or admitting defeat ( although skeptics would respond that of course this is what his partisans would say ) .
He was offering advice to the " mujahideen " in Iraq , but that is not being seen as anything new , as he has offered advice to the mujahideen around the world many times .
The main charge being leveled against al - Jazeera , in fact , is that its presentation of the tape was fundamentally misleading because it made it seem like he was talking about al - Qaeda 's mistakes and misfortunes when the full tape makes quite clear that he was n't - he was offering advice and praise to all mujahideen , which to these interpreters was the whole point .
There 's also a lot of anger out there that the people who made their instant analyses based on the al - Jazeera version have n't come forward and changed their public views .
Ah , media criticism and bashing pundits - the common glue which binds together internet activists across cultures and political divides .
[ UPDATE - I thought of a good American analogy for this last night .
It 's as if Bush gave a speech bashing Congress , and then CNN had only run clips suggesting that he had attacked Republicans , driving an entire news cycle dominated by " Bush attacks Republicans " - and then nobody changed their story after the whole tape aired elsewhere . ]
So what was bin Laden up to ?
That 's where things get murkier .
There are a number of competing interpretations floating around the forums , some confused and some furious and some compelling .
The most interesting interpretation I 've yet seen comes from Dr Akram Hijazi , who is one of the more prolific and from what I can tell most influential of the jihadi analysts on these influental forums ( his essay is easily found on any of the forums ; ask me for a link over email if you want one ) .
Hijazi's reading of bin Laden 's speech wo n't offer much support for either side of the current American political debate .
He argues that bin Laden was speaking not as a political strategist but as a " salafi jihadist " ( the divide between Muslim Brotherhood style political Islam and salafi jihadism is a particular theme of Hijazi 's developed over countless essays ) .
Hijazi argues that the salafi - jihadist organizations are religious first , not political organizations with a religious focus , and that such organizations do not change their doctrines for political ends .
He notes bitingly that non-salafi- jihadists , even those sympathetic to al - Qaeda , always misinterpret bin Laden 's speeches because they read him through their own political , strategic lenses ( a sin of which I suppose I 'm equally guilty ) .
To Hijazi , this is a major mistake .
Bin Laden and the salafi - jihadists are first and foremost concerned with religion ; if they admit mistakes , the mistakes are deviations from religious precepts rather than strategic or tactical .
His major charges against the Iraqi mujahideen are that they are accepting judgements by bad ulema , or by hypocrites ( munaqafin ) who pretend to be good Muslims but who are really looking to spread fitna ( internal conflict ) .
His call for unity is a call for unity of honest organizations ( jama 'at sadiqa ) - which for Hijazi is one of the major theoretical innovations and points of the speech .
What bin Laden demands of the Iraqi fighters is religious sincerity and honesty , not any particular political strategy , and unity must begin from this religious foundation .
Hijazi notes that nowhere in bin Laden 's speech do words appear such as independence or liberation or negotiation or elections or political participation or nation ( watan ) .
That , to Hijazi , is the real clue to what bin Laden is talking about .
The mistakes in Iraq are deviations from sharia - which could mean an overeager imposition of hadud penalties without the oversight of a sincere and qualified judge , could mean fanaticism ( ta'assub ) in placing one 's group over the umma , or could mean bestowing illegitimate recognition on polytheistic political institutions ( like democracy ) .
Of course , the doctrinal and strategic likely run together - groups like the Islamic Army , which are forming the Political Council , would fall on the same side of the divide as would Tareq al - Hashemi since they talk about participating in the political process once the Americans leave .
This is just one interpretation of bin Laden 's speech , but it comes from an influential insider voice .
Frankly , I 'm not sure what to do with it , and since it does n't really fit any political agenda over here it will probably be ignored .
But it seems like something interesting that people might like to hear about .
As Cocoa developers , whenever we get a major new release of Mac OS X , we have to spend time familiarising ourselves with the new APIs and facilities on offer .
One of the main goals of this investigative process is to identify controls and funtionality which we previously had to implement ourselves , but which are now provided natively for us .
I ’ve been using Leopard for the last few months , and I thought I ’d post a partial list of new and improved APIs which may be of interest to Cocoa application developers .
I ’m going to classify these in terms of what you can do with them , rather than by class - name or other such relatively obscure aspect , and I ’ll include some screenshots where appropriate .
Please feel free to add your own observations via the comments .
I ’ll stick roughly to the order used in the AppKit and Foundation release notes , which you should also read if you ’re serious about getting the skinny on what ’s new in Leopard .
Naturally , backwards - compatibility does complicate matters somewhat , but that does n’t detract from the usefulness of getting a quick high - level overview of the new toys we now have to play with .
Update : Added some new screenshots and clarifications , and mention of a couple of the new frameworks available .
Oh , and welcome to all Daring Fireball readers - I knew it was taking longer than usual to pull down my server logs . ;)
Core Animation
This one needs little introduction .
Spend some time with the documentation , paying particular attention to the concept of layer - backed views and the animator proxy .
You can do some incredible things simply by setting up properties in Interface Builder , and can usually get a very convincing animation simply by sending a message to [ yourView animator ] instead of just to yourView .
Take a look at NSAnimatable Property Container to add your own animatable properties to views too .
( Note : both of these examples , “ Covert ” Flow and Cocoa Slides , are part of the Core Animation Coding Headstart sample code .
I believe it ’s still just available to those with access to the Leopard seeds , but hopefully / presumably it ’ll become publicly available soon . )
View drawing
You ’re now notified ( via methods you can override in a subclass ) when a view is hidden , unhidden , or is about to draw .
This will help you do more efficient pre-calculations and caching for your drawing code .
You can also now directly manipulate all of a view ’s subviews at once .
Working with Quick Look
You can create Quick Look Plugins which allow Quick Look to preview the content of your app ’s custom documents , in the same way as Tiger allowed you to add Spotlight Plugins to allow indexing those documents .
You can also request a Quick Look - generated preview of a document using QLThumbnailImageCreate ( ) from the QuickLook framework ( thanks to Mek for pointing that out ) .
The preview can be of an arbitrary size you specify , of any document you like , and you can even tell the framework to draw it as an “ icon ” ( i.e. with a drop - shadow , document page - curl and so on ) .
Managing multiple views ( for custom tab controls , or such )
There ’s a new NSViewController class that lets you manage a set of views , and supports bindings .
It might eliminate a lot of glue code to swap views in response to user interaction .
i Photo - like animating grid of images or views
You get this for free with IKImageBrowserView .
Try setting one up in Interface Builder and run the simulation ; it ’ll work right then and there .
The example shown below ( and the default behaviour of the control in Interface Builder ) is a zero- code , nib - only view of your desktop pictures , supporting multiple selection , automatic re-tiling and animated drag - reordering .
Note that IKImageBrowserView is a pre-made control using the new NSCollectionView class ; see its documentation for more details ( it used to be called NSGridView in earlier seeds , but that name has been changed to NSCollectionView ) .
There ’s also a sample app for the new PubSub framework which uses IKImageBrowserView ; you can find it in / Developer / Examples / PubSub / NewMusic / ( thanks to Jens Alfke for the note ) .
Setting up your own Smart Groups / Playlists / Folders
You can use the NSRuleEditor and NSPredicateEditor classes to get the familiar rule - editing interface for your app .
Putting custom views in menus
NSMenuItem now has a - setView ( and a - view ) method , to put arbitrary views in your menus without resorting to Carbon .
Animation via timers will work too , but pay attention to the runloop you use ( it has to be the event - tracking runloop mode , since it ’s in a menu ) .
Menu improvements
You ’ll now be notified ( via delegate methods ) when a menu-item is opened , closed , highlighted and unhighlighted - this is very handy for custom view menu-items , but applies to all items .
You can now have the same keyboard shortcut in multiple menus as long as the action of all items with that shortcut is the same ( good for contextual menus duplicating commands in the menubar ) , and ( significantly ) if a shortcut would trigger a disabled item , your app now gets the chance to handle that shortcut anyway .
This could remove the need for some trivial NSApplication subclasses .
Printing UI
The Print panel is much improved , particularly in terms of accessory view support ; your app can really get in there and customize what ’s shown .
If printing is a significant part of your app ’s functionality , you need to take a fresh look at NSPrintPanel and NSPageLayout - there ’s a huge amount of new material and functionality there .
Uniform Type Identifiers
Leopard now richly supports using UTIs throughout the document architecture , including NSDocument , open / save panels , bundle info , NSWorkspace and so on .
Ditto for drag - types , pasteboard data , services definitions , image types , and a host of others .
If you ’re looking to simplify and unify how your app classifies data types without using lots of arbitrary constants , take a look .
Get splitviews like those in Mail etc
NSSplitView has been significantly enhanced ; read through the API and you ’ll see that it ’s much better about programmatic collapsing , changing divider thickness and active area , and even specifying an external area which acts as a proxy draggable zone to move the splitter ( just like the little thumb in Mail and many other apps ) .
There are also bug fixes in there for things like the long - standing progressive rounding errors when resizing .
( And if it ’s still not up to scratch , you can of course continue to use RBSplitView . )
Putting document icons in the titlebar
You do n’t need to be using the NSDocument architecture for this ; there are new methods to control the icon , what it represents , whether the popup menu appears , and so on .
HUD windows , like in iPhoto 's palettes
There ’s now a HUD Window type , which is an NSPanel .
It can even be borderless , and still get the transparent black background and so on .
This might let you get rid of custom window subclasses ( like some of mine , for example ) .
Controlling the texture / metal on your windows , and where it draws
There are now methods to determine the “ border thickness ” of the texture on your windows ; you can say that , for example , there should be texture on the bottom 100 pixels or such .
This can remove the need for custom window subclasses , or superfluous views which only draw a background .
Integrating with Spaces
Your windows can choose what happens when they are made visible on a certain Space , and when the user switches Spaces .
Basically , you can choose whether it uses the default behaviour ( appears on one space , stay there unless moved explicitly ) , or always appears on the active space , or appears on all spaces .
See NSWindowCollectionBehaviour for more .
" Do n't Show Again "
If you wanted this behaviour ( usually a checkbox at the bottom of an alert dialog , to suppress showing the alert next time ) , you had to roll your own .
In Leopard , NSAlert supports it natively , and also lets you add arbitrary accessory views .
This should eliminate a lot of custom windows in nibs and glue code .
See NSAlert ’s - setShowsSuppressionButton : and - setAccessoryView : methods .
Dock icons for windows and apps , including badges and counts
There ’s a new NSDockTile class allowing you to control the dock tile for a minimized window and / or for your app itself .
It supports adding or removing the app- icon badge , and also setting a custom badge label , say to show progress or some other status display .
This could eliminate a lot of code to create a custom image for the dock , and compositing other stuff into that image .
Tracking the mouse properly
As I previously alluded to , Leopard has a much better alternative to the rather weak and unreliable cursor - rects : NSTrackingArea .
Use it to get precise and solid tracking of the mouse ( both entered / exited and / or moved ) , even when your app is n’t active .
Even more text formats
The text systems deals with OASIS Open Document files and ECMA Office Open XML files , and a newer version of Word files too , so you can add a few more Import and Export options to your app for free .
Layout manager improvements
If you ’re explicitly using NSLayout Manager for anything , you should know that it now supports non-contiguous layout .
This could be a massive performance improvement for your app , if you ’re willing to take the time to learn how the implementation has changed .
Some very welcome additional minor improvements include getting the baseline offset for a given font , and the ability to display invisibles natively .
Safari 3 - style Find results popup
Safari 3 has a nice visual indicator for the results of a Find operation ; it ’s like a yellowish lozenge shape which pops up over the body of text you ’re searching .
You have access to this too , via show FindIndicatorForRange : in NSText View .
Use it for good , rather than evil .
Smart links , quotes , and inline image editing
NSTextView supports all these things now , including tooltips for links .
You can even query an NSAttributed String to see if it has found an URL at a given position .
This could get rid of a lot of custom NSText * object subclasses .
Do good grammar
You might have noticed the new grammar checker ( wiggly green underlines ) in the Cocoa text system ; you have access to it in all the same ways as you ’ve had access to the spelling checker for some time now , including providing your own suggested grammatical improvements .
Get rid of a lot of unnecessary bitmaps of buttons
If you have custom buttons in your app , you probably have a lot of bitmaps for the normal state , pressed state , and so on , and a bunch of code to tie it all together .
Leopard can help you get rid of it , via NSImage ’s - isTemplate and NSCell ’s - background Style additions .
Read the docs to find out what it ’s all about , but essentially :
You can specify one bitmap and tell Cocoa that it's a kind of " mask " , and Cocoa will take care of making it glow in appropriate situations ( like the show / hide mini - calendar / tasks buttons in iCal ) .
You can tell NSCell how to draw your text , in terms of what kind of background it 's on : dark , light , raised , or lowered .
This gets you stuff like the Bookmarks button in Safari ( with all its different highlighted / unhilighted / etched / embossed appearances ) with only one bitmap .
This is potentially a significant win in terms of app size , memory usage , and your graphics budget .
See the documentation for more .
Note that NSStatusItem also supports this stuff , so you can potentially get rid of your one - black - and - one - white images there too .
Free images and icons
We ’ve all stolen Apple ’s icons for things ; now we ’re officially allowed to .
There are lots of new standard images available via NSImage - imageNamed : , including the Safari bookmarks image , all kinds of arrows , the gear icon , the Computer icon , Bluetooth and Bonjour logos , user account icons , the Info icon , and many more .
The size of your app could drop significantly , as could your icon-design expenditure .
( And do n’t worry : NSButtonCell now supports an imageScaling parameter , in case those icons change size in the future ) .
If you want to play with these in Interface Builder , drag an NSImageView into a window and use the Inspector to set the image using the combo-box ; it now lists all the newly - available standard ones .
Drawing complex images and areas by tiling smaller images
Leopard now has two functions called NSDrawThreePartImage ( ) and NSDrawNinePartImage ( ) , which let you easily draw images which have two fixed - width end - caps and one tiled variable - width middle section , or images which have four corner images , four tiled side images , and a tiled central image .
These functions are smart about resolution - independence , and could probably replace about twenty or more lines of your code every time they ’re used .
Groovy boxes
NSBox now supports custom background and border colors , and your choice of border width and corner radius .
One more custom control subclass you can throw away .
Gradients that are n't by Chad Weider
Everyone in the Cocoa development world uses CTGradient , and it ’s rather awesome .
In Leopard , Apple finally catches up with Chad and offers us NSGradient .
Check out its methods designed to help you build gradient - editing UI too .
TableViews and OutlineViews enhanced
I ’ve often had to create NSTableView subclasses to let me edit the contents of cells ( like checkboxes or such ) , without visually selecting the whole row .
Leopard fixes this by letting you choose whether to “ track ” a cell independent of its editable status .
We now have delegate methods to let us support type - to - select natively , both these controls properly support a disabled state , and have a host of improvements in handling drags , contextual menus and inline editing .
If you want that iTunes / Finder - sidebar look , with the etched group titles amongst the rows , you ’ve got that too - you can now have “ full - width ” cells .
You can probably get rid of a bunch of custom subclasses of NSTableView , NSTableColumn , and several NSCells .
Source lists
We ’ve been talking about these for years now , and Leopard finally gives you that highlight style in both NSTableView and NSOutlineView .
Feel free to make the next iSomething without resorting to custom code .
iTunes Music
Store - like path display
The new NSPathControl ( and its Cell and ComponentCell cousins ) let you have a display like the “ breadcrumbs ” in the iTunes Music Store , which can also be configured to display as a popup menu or like the Path Bar at the bottom of Finder windows in Leopard .
Give it a try in Interface Builder .
Image editing for free
IKImageView ( available in Interface Builder ) gives you an image view that supports an Image Editing HUD palette , and Preview - style cropping , selection , moving , annotation and more , all with zero code .
There ’s no reason not to have basic image - editing built into your app wherever you ’re dealing with images now .
PDF viewing and browsing for free
Similarly , PDFView ( which was already available in Tiger ; thanks to Peter Hosey for the correction ) gives you Preview - style browsing , selection , zooming and so on for PDFs , and the new PDFThumbnail View even gives you the list of pages down the side .
Again , zero code .
Finally unload those bundles
NSBundle now supports unloading .
Yes , seriously .
Save some memory .
Get info on memory and processors
NSProcessInfo can now tell you the amount of - physicalMemory and also the - processorCount and - activeProcessorCount , without going into Carbon .
Easier priority queues
Take a look at NSOperation and NSOperationQueue ( includes dependency management ) .
It could perhaps replace your home - grown implementation .
Displaying dates
NSDateFormatter has a host of new symbols ( like era names , e.g. “ Anno Domini ” , quarter names , and new short variants for weekdays , months , etc ) .
This could remove a bunch of hard - coded arrays in your display code if you do a lot of work with dates and calendars .
NSCalendar now also has your back for calculating the start and range of a given unit of time around the current moment ( like the start of the current week , or month ) .
String encodings
NSString has a series of new supported encodings .
If you do a lot of conversion between string formats , see if Leopard ca n’t take over some of the heavy lifting for you .
More efficient expressions in Core Data
NSExpression now supports subquery , aggregate , union , intersect and minus expression types .
This means you can save both memory and potentially a lot of code where you previously had to fetch more objects than you needed and filter them yourself .
Should be faster , more scaleable , and require less code - definitely check it out if you ’re using Core Data with an SQL store .
Scripting support
There are too many improvements to scripting handling to even mention here ; please read the Foundation release notes ( towards the end ) if you use scripting in your app .
You ’ll be able to remove a lot of nasty workaround code , guaranteed , and you ’ll get much more sensible , readable error messages in many cases too .
Working with iCal calendars and other data
The Calendar Store framework lets you access , edit and update iCal data like calendars , tasks , and events , and it ’s very easy to use .
Supports filtering and searching too , of course .
RSS feeds
Check out the PubSub framework if you need to pull down and parse RSS feeds easily ; there are examples in / Developer / Examples / for you to get started with .
Interface Builder
Lastly , and hopefully this goes without saying : check out the new and improved objects in Interface Builder .
You have some amazing stuff there for nothing , including Automator - related views , AppleScript editor fields , the ability to create your toolbars visually , movie - capturing , and lots of Quartz Composer - related stuff .
There ’s even a bindings - compatible NSDictionary Controller to let you edit the contents of an NSDictionary in an NSTableView , which could eliminate a lot of your controller code .
Oh , and there ’s an improved API for creating your own IB objects / palettes , so take a look at that too if you ’re interested in contributing back to the developer community , or just making your own dev process a little easier with commonly used custom controls .
Whew
That should just about do it for now ; I ’m sure you want to go and play anyway .
Take some time to have a look through Xcode and Interface Builder and get up to speed with the new tools at your disposal - it could make the development time on your next project a lot shorter .

Bless his heart .
Mike Gravel , who is currently running for President as a Democrat , has already declared that he will run as a third party , and he has n’t even lost the Democratic nomination yet !
Call me old fashioned if you must .
I am all for scrappy insurgencies trying to fight their way into America ’s two party system , but should n’t Gravel at least wait until after he loses before quitting ?
“ Hold out your hand , take your thumb and connect it to your little finger .
What do you get , ” Gravel asked his on looking audience .
“ A third party ! ” he answered .
“ I ’m running as a Democrat right now , and my string is going to run out in February .
It ’s already run out ; I just do n’t know it , ” Gravel said to a small group of supporters .
“ If I want to stay in this election all of the way until next November , I will have to make a decision : ‘ Will I go as a third party ? ’
Obviously you can figure that out . ”
The implication is that he will .
Gravel is entertaining a notion that he can approach established existing third parties , such as the Libertarians , Greens , and perhaps also the Reform or Constitution Party , and who knows what else , and unite them under one cause with himself leading the charge .
“ We ’re going to coalesce … we ’re going to take all of the other parties together , ” Gravel explains .
“ We ’ll go … you ’ll go to the Green Party , to the Libertarian Party .
Let ’s coalesce , let ’s come together , we ’ll coalesce to win . ”
The notion is well and fine , but the Libertarian and Green Party are currently busy nominating their own candidates .
And for that matter so are the Socialist Party , Socialist Workers Party , Communist Party , Patriot Party , American Party , Reform Party , Populist Party , Personal Choice Party and even more .
Getting Republicans and Democrats to come together in harmony will seem like child ’s play compared to bring together socialists with libertarians , and greens with communists .
To put it quite frankly , it ’s not a notion that is based in reality .
The Ron Paul Factor
Moreover , Gravel is ignoring the strong possibility that Ron Paul may make a run for the White House as an independent .
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
Though Paul has repeatedly denied such plans to run as an independent , he has increasingly left his statements open ended .
The former Libertarian Party presidential candidate says that he plans to win as a Republican , but will not discuss any actions that he might take were he to lose the GOP nomination , other than to say that he will likely not support any other nominee .
Ron Paul is currently polling poorly both nationally and in important early nominating states , but he is sitting on a mountain of gold .
Without a doubt , he could raise enough money to finance his own third party candidacy and make a strong showing in national polls – maybe even strong enough to be included in debates .
The virtual inevitability that Paul will lose his party ’s nomination coupled with his uncanny fund raising ability and massive support base makes his third party run all the more likely .
With a crowd that size and that passionate , they ’re not going to just go away because their candidate lost a silly thing like a primary .
Gravel ’s lonely road …
It saddens me to see Mike Gravel forced out of the debates just as much as it saddens me to see him give speeches about fanciful ideas , such as uniting third parties behind him .
I fear that his message will become lost in the curious spectacle that his campaign would become .
The positive aspect of this development is that it frees Gravel ’s supporters to get behind someone else for the Democratic nomination .
It does n’t matter if they vote for Gravel in the primary , because they can vote for him in the general election anyways .
Gravel supporters , to you I say this ; now is your opportunity to take a look at the rest of the democratic field .
Answer this question :
Who is the candidate that would be your second choice ?
Vote for that person .
Help to defeat the candidate who is the greater evil ; make the world a better place .

A while ago , I had a need to monitor filesystem modifications , and I looked around for Python bindings for the Linux kernel ’s inotify subsystem .
At the time , the only existing library was pyinotify , so being a lazy sort , I naturally tried to use it .
On first glance , the documentation seems impressive , and the API looks reasonable .
Effective use of inotify is a subtle affair , however , and pyinotify is not , shall we say , the best tool for the job .
It ’s difficult to tell what those problems might be from external inspection , though , so here are a few notes from my experience .
Correctness
A program using pyinotify can easily lose track of parts of its directory hierarchy .
The library does n’t raise an OSError exception if the inotify_add_watch system call fails : instead , it propagates the - 1 error result up to the caller as a value in a dict , but without the value of errno to tell the caller why the error occurred .
It ’s thus trivial to miss errors entirely , because the usual mechanism of raising exceptions is n’t used .
Almost as bad , it ’s impossible to distinguish between recoverable ( tried to add a watch on a directory that no longer exists ) and fatal ( hit the system max_user_watches limit ) errors .
Performance
To a regular Python hacker , the interface that pyinotify provides will probably look reasonable .
If you want to handle some kind of event , just write a method that will get invoked with an Event object when that event occurs .
How reassuringly normal .
Under the hood , though , the implementation is terrible .
On every event , the library scans every event that the inotify interface could possibly report , and checks to see if your class implements one of several possible appropriately named methods .
This means it ’s traversing a 20 - element dict , and performing up to 60 attribute lookups ( of which up to 40 are based on % - formatted names ) , for every reported event .
This has disastrous performance implications .
If you write a simple monitoring tool that uses pyinotify , use it to monitor activity in a Linux kernel source tree , and then start a build in that tree , try running top while your build runs .
When I did this , I found that pyinotify was consuming an entire CPU trying to keep up with the flood of notification events .
Locking
All that needless attribute lookup churn is n’t the only problem : pyinotify uses a threading .
RLock to protect every access to every attribute of its
Watch class , by providing its own __getattribute__ and __setattr__ methods .
I can’t guess what the author thinks he ’s protecting himself from , but he ’s got a solid defence mounted against both correctness and performance there .
( Blindly locking individual attributes is n’t going to protect the consistency of an entire data structure , and delegating responsibility for locking out to callers , who are probably all single - threaded anyway , might help to recover a bit of the execrable performance .
Watch is n’t often on the fast path , thank goodness . )
Is it possible to do better ?
A potential rejoinder to my performance criticisms is that Python is n’t a fast language .
However , this does n’t bear up in general : I ’ve written plenty of nippy Python code .
In this particular case , in response to my mounting horror at reading and fixing the pyinotify source , I wrote bindings of my own .
In contrast to pyinotify consuming an entire CPU during moderately heavy filesystem activity , an app using my bindings consumes about 5 % of a CPU , even in the face intensive activities like untarring a big file archive .
In part , this is because my bindings are less abstracted than those of pyinotify .
I do n’t dispatch out to user methods at all ; the caller is responsible for checking a bitmask instead .
The readability of application code is n’t really affected by this , but stripping out all the cruft massively improves performance .
In addition , the application itself is also responsible for using the library in an informed way .
To get decent performance with inotify , you must delay calls to read so that the kernel has a chance to aggregate multiple notifications into a single buffer write .
In other words , if a call to poll says “ you ’ve got events ” , you have to wait a good fraction of a second before seeing what they are .
I provide a Threshold class to help with this .
While it is certainly possible to call into pyinotify in a similarly informed way , I suspect that all its flab and abstraction will gull the unwary coder into thinking that maybe they ’re not writing performance - critical code after all , when in fact they are .
There are other Python inotify interfaces available .
One is , like mine , named python- inotify , but a quick glance at its source code revealed some of the same silliness with unnecessary locking that plagues pyinotify , so I quickly averted my eyes .
There ’s also a Python API to gamin .
I have no opinion about it , beyond not wanting to run another daemon if I can avoid it .
My general advice would be to avoid writing code that involves monitoring filesystem activity .
It ’s all too easy to write code that looks sensible , but is actually racy , usually under circumstances that are difficult to reproduce .
Tuning performance without introducing more races or bugs is tough .
You ’re getting the idea now : hard !
scary !
find something fun instead !
The corollary to this is , of course , that as a user , you ought to be suspicious of any programs you use that monitor filesystem activity .
I bet the Beagle and Google Desktop teams have armloads of horror stories .

Why would anyone lie , kill , torture , maim , do treason , and cheat about anything ?
Why is a canard .
It is common sense that people do these things , and common sense that the degree of perceived " reward " is the degree to which they will go .
Their true reward is a corrupt soul , which is also the answer to the question :
they have a corrupt soul .
And those who do not contemplate the activities of those with corrupt souls likewise have corrupt souls .
Corrupted away from what our forefathers warned us about and put in place for us to preserve and improve upon .

My thoughts on the Koehler article : http://allaboutvoting.co...ity-and-voting-machines/
I ’m glad to see more attention to the problems with electronic voting machines
The praise for the " ritual " of placing a ballot into a ballot box is bogus .
That is just an argument for status quo and could be used to justify all sorts of poor practices - such as having voting occur on a workday ( Tuesday ) .
I ’m not a fan of electronic voting machines but it is unfair to say that there are no benefits to using them .
I list a few benefits and problems below .
To me the problems far outweigh the benefits .
Some benefits of electronic voting machines are : faster initial reporting of results [ article discusses this and argues that it is unimportant ] , ability to handle many ballot variations with minimal waste ( eg : variations for each precinct and for language preference ) [ this is one of the few arguments that I find at all compelling ] , improved disability access [ but there are many other ways of improved disability access and many current eVoting machines do a poor job at access for those with disabilities ] .
Some problems with electronic voting are : very serious election integrity issues , cost ( in my understanding ) , limited number of machines available in a location so unacceptably long waits when sufficient number of machines are not in a precinct , potential use in vote suppression via technology and access barriers .

Britain said the incident was an ' innocent misunderstanding '
Archbishop 's reaction
Gillian Gibbons , 54 , from Liverpool , has been sentenced to 15 days in prison and will then be deported .
She escaped conviction for inciting hatred and showing contempt for religious beliefs , and will now appeal .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband has expressed " in the strongest terms " the UK 's concern at her detention .
The Sudanese ambassador , Omer Siddiq , was called back to the Foreign Office to explain the decision .
Officials said that during his 45 - minute meeting Mr Miliband also spoke to the Sudanese acting foreign minister for 15 minutes on the telephone .
" There will be further contacts overnight and tomorrow in the search for a swift resolution of this issue , " the Foreign Office added .
I have called in the Sudanese ambassador this evening to explain the decision and to discuss next steps
Foreign Secretary David Miliband
Reaction to verdict
Before the meeting , Mr Miliband said he was " extremely disappointed " the charges had not been dismissed and repeated his view that it had been an " innocent misunderstanding by a dedicated teacher " .
" Our priority now is to ensure Mrs Gibbons ' welfare , and we will continue to provide consular assistance to her , " he said .
" I have called in the Sudanese ambassador this evening to explain the decision and to discuss next steps . "
Meanwhile , Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said he could not " see any justification " for the sentence , calling it an " absurdly disproportionate response " to a " minor cultural faux pas " .
Officials at the Foreign Office say the mood has changed as a result of the verdict .
Staff complaint
The prime minister , Sudanese embassy officials in London and UK Muslim organisations all expressed the hope that Mrs Gibbons would be released .
But Sudan 's top clerics had called for the full measure of the law to be used against Mrs Gibbons and labelled her actions part of a Western plot against Islam .
She could have faced up to 40 lashes if found guilty on all three charges against her .
In September , Mrs Gibbons allowed her class of primary school pupils to name the teddy bear Muhammad as part of a study of animals and their habitats .
The court heard that she was arrested on Sunday after another member of staff at Unity High School complained to the Ministry of Education .
The BBC's Adam Mynott , in Khartoum , said Mrs Gibbons apologised to the court for any offence she may have caused .
The school 's director , Robert Boulos , told the AP news agency : " It 's a very fair verdict , she could have had six months and lashes and a fine , and she only got 15 days and deportation . "
He said Mrs Gibbons would only serve another 10 days in prison , having already spent five in custody since her arrest .
Prosecutor general Salah Eddin Abu Zaid had said Mrs Gibbons could expect a " swift and fair trial " .
But Catherine Wolthuizen , chief executive of Fair Trials International , said Mrs Gibbons ' treatment was excessive .
She said : " It was a very speedy justice process .
Although she has been found guilty of all the counts of causing offence , she has thankfully not been subjected to 40 lashes .
" Having said this , 15 days in a Sudanese prison for an innocent misunderstanding is a serious and harsh punishment indeed . "
The governor of New York , Elliot Spitzer , has decided to raise $ 13 million for his proposed $ 124.3 billion budget by requiring your local purveyors of illegal drugs to affix state tax stamps to your nickel bag of horse or the fixings for your evening speedball .
His administration says the program will enhance enforcement and tracking of illegal drug sales .
Riiight .
That surly - looking fellow slouching on the street corner each night will be sure to run right down to the state Department of Taxation and Finance to buy those tax stamps .
Surely that will make law enforcement happy , eh ?
Good for the fuzz to know who ’s selling the fuel for your bong , right ?
But , says The Buffalo News :
Secrecy provisions in the bill generally prohibit using information obtained from drug dealers in any criminal prosecution , unless it is obtained independently .
The information could be used , however , in a criminal or civil proceeding involving taxes .
Say what ?
The governor expects crack dealers to buy stamps to put on packets of illegal drugs â€ ” but cops ca n’t use that information to ID and arrest them ?
What ’s the Guv been smoking ?
All this to raise one tenth of 1 percent of his proposed budget ?
This bad idea is n’t new .
Arizona hatched such a scheme in 1983 .
Nearly 30 states followed with drug taxes of their own .
Gov. Spitzer ’s administration , says The News , “ contends it also can obtain revenues when illegal drugs are confiscated and dealers are forced to pay taxes if they do not have stamps on the drugs . ”
Arizona repealed its law .
It seems , says a tax - stamp reseller :
The authorities in Arizona arrested a fellow who was selling marijuana , and he had a license and had put the tax stamps on his “ product ” .
A judge decided that if the state sold him a license , they should n’t arrest him for selling the product so licensed .
So he dismissed the charges against the fellow .
If you ’re drug dealer in New York , be prepared to face increased costs of doing business trafficking in illegal drugs .
Gov. Spitzer wants you to cough up $ 3.50 per gram on marijuana and $ 200 per gram on drugs like heroin to buy tax stamps .
If you ’re an overtaxed resident of New York , as I am , you can continue to marvel at the lunacy of government in our fair state .
His extensive memory allows him to recall almost any news event and anything he has experienced , including specific dates and even the weather .
" I was sort of a human Google for my family .
I 've always been able to recall things , " the 51 - year - old said on " Good Morning America " in his first television interview .
Williams ' type of detailed , exhaustive memory is called hyperthymesia and few known cases exist .
Brad 's brain scans are now being studied by neuroscientists at the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory at the Univeristy of California , Irvine .
Eric Williams ' is intrigued about the inner workings of his brother 's mind .
Eric Williams is in the process of making a documentary about Brad , appropriately titled " Unforgettable . "
In the film , which has n't been completed yet , Williams takes on a person who is Googling answers to 20 questions .
He answered 18 of them correctly and was 11 minutes faster than the searcher .
A nation 's economic system is a reflection pool .
The face that looks back from the water ; is the face of the culture and the prevailing ethos .
It 's no different with America .
The stewards of the US economic system — Paulson and Bernanke — are inextricably linked to a political / military establishment which has been thoroughly marinated in a culture of violence and corruption .
Paulson's “ Marshall Plan ” for subprime homeowners is just the gloved hand of the despot .
The other hand is still busy gouging out eyes at Guantanamo , or clubbing foreign nationals at CIA black sites , or dropping incendiary bombs on schoolchildren in Falluja .
It 's all the same .
The culture of war and demagoguery has its roots in the economic system .
Its financial leaders are just as culpable as any low - ranking GI at Abu Ghraib .
The Paulson plan has nothing to do with saving working class people from the ravages of foreclosure .
Oh , no .
The Bush administration is ideologically opposed to helping people in need .
We know that already .
Just look at Katrina .
The real purpose of the proposed “ bailout ” is to allow enough people to keep making minimal payments on their mortgages so the banking system does n't collapse in a heap .
That 's it .
It 's just another sign that desperation has set in at the Federal Reserve .
The last time the government orchestrated a bailout of this magnitude was during the '30s .
And , guess what ?
George Bush is no F.D.R .
The truth is , the system is about to hit the canvas and the Fed is in a state of panic .
They are doing everything in their power to keep the train on the tracks , but nothing is succeeding .
They 've slashed rates , accepted dodgy collateral ( like Commercial paper and shaky mortgage - backed securities ) as repos , and extended the length of the repos indefinitely , which is the same as “ monetizing ” the debt .
Paulson has tried to set up a Super SIV to help the major investment banks off - load their mortgage - backed junk on the wary public , but that is n't working either .
Nothing is working .
Meanwhile , the economic headwinds keep getting stronger , the waves keep crashing over the bow , and ship - o - state keeps listing perilously on its side .
It 's a real mess .
The banks are the conduit for the paper - money scam run by the Federal Reserve .
It 's a shabby business run by the same people who send our kids to war while rewarding themselves with tax cuts .
It stinks .
Now the system is in dire straights .
Are we supposed to feel bad ?
Foreign central banks and investors are dumping their dollars and dollar - backed assets , the Gulf States are threatening to de-link petroleum from the dollar , and investors everywhere now know they 've been ripped off by a shoddy mortgage - laundering swindle that got the “ green light ” from US regulators .
It 's a bad scene all around .
And now the chickens are coming home to roost .
Cluck , cluck .
The meltdown in the real estate market continues to send tremors through Wall Street .
Trillions of dollars in complex bonds ( CDOs and MBSs ) are being downgraded as foreclosures increase and housing inventory soars .
Banks , insurance companies , pension funds , bond insurers , hedge funds ; are all among the living - dead .
Many are already insolvent and many more will follow .
It 's just a matter of time .
The foundation of the financial markets is crumbling .
The scheme to transform the liabilities of loan - applicants with bad credit into a reliable source of fat profits has failed .
Alchemy does n't work .
The subprime crisis and ( subsequent ) credit crunch originated at the Federal Reserve .
The Fed triggered a speculative frenzy by lowering interest rates below the rate of inflation for over 31 months between 2002 and 2004 .
Trillions of dollars were fed into the banking system creating the biggest equity bubble in history .
Now that the housing bubble is crashing to earth -- and trillions of dollars in shaky bonds are headed for the landfill -- the Fed is trying to distance itself from any responsibility .
But their fingerprints are everywhere .
The plan was authored and executed by the Fed and that 's where the blame lies .
Everyone else is just a “ bit player ” .
What matters now , is that the system is collapsing .
It 's slowly getting crushed by the accumulated weight of its own corruption .
When the system crashes , the flag will be lowered over Guantanamo Bay , the present oligarchy of racketeers will be removed from office , and the troops will come home from Iraq .
Sometimes tragedy produces a positive outcome .
There could be anarchy or tyranny or martial law or detention camps .
Who really knows ?
It 's perfectly normal that the public is worried about “ what could happen ” in the near future .
But , consider this : can we continue moving in the same direction that we are now ?
Can we keep pouring the blood of innocent people all over the planet while claiming to own the world and all of its resources ?
Can we keep ignoring the species - threatening challenges of global warming , peak oil and nuclear proliferation ?
And , is there any chance that the media , the congress , the courts , or the president will come to their senses ; chart a different course , restore civil liberties , stop the human rights abuse , and withdrawal the troops ?
No .
So tell me , dear reader , what hope is there for change apart from a full - system economic collapse ?
Political systems do not have to be perfect to be acceptable .
I 'm not naive .
But --- for many of us --- there are basic moral criteria that have to be observed to win our support .
The Bush administration has elevated killing , torture and kidnapping to a level of state policy .
This is unacceptable by any standard , and yet , all the levers of power are controlled by people who support the present doctrine .
Is n't that so ?
The United States is not a beacon of hope or a light unto the world .
It is a menace and a growing threat to survival on earth .
America 's political and military belligerence is just an extension of a domineering economic system which serves the sole interests of the rich and powerful .
The Central Bank plays a critical role in this paradigm .
Nation 's do n't go to war without the blessing of their main financial institutions .
The “ big money ” guys are the silent partners in the plunder and bloodletting .
The men who own and oversee the US financial system ; created the cancer which is presently devouring it from the inside .
Now the tumor has metastasized and spread through the entire organism .
The situation is irreversible .
The economy is on its last legs and headed for a fall .
US political leaders will have to accept a world in which America is just one of many states of equal power and significance .
Military funding will slow to a dribble .
The killing will stop .
Finally .

The Most Distant Sun
Credit & Copyright : Enrique Luque Cervig�n ( The Superspace )
Explanation : When is the Sun most distant from Earth ?
It happened again just this past weekend .
A common misconception is that the Sun is most distant during the winter , when it 's the coldest .
In truth , however , the seasonal temperatures are more greatly influenced by the number of daylight hours and how high the Sun rises .
For example , during northern winter , the tilt of the Earth causes the Sun to be above the horizon for a shorter time and remain lower in the sky than in northern summer .
The picture compares the relative size of the Sun during Earth 's closest approach in January ( northern winter ) on the left , and in July ( northern summer ) on the right .
The angular size of the Sun is noticeably smaller during July , when it is farther away .
If the Earth 's orbit was perfectly circular , the Sun would always appear to be the same size .
These two solar images were taken from Spain during 2006 , but the same effect can be seen in any year from any Earth - bound location .
Before he ostentatiously stopped taking money from political action committees to run for president , Sen. Barack Obama quietly took money from political action committees .
As a presidential candidate , Obama claims to be an outsider eager to shake up the Washington establishment by refusing to accept donations from political action committees and Washington lobbyists .
This year , they 're the bad guys .
But this was n’t always the case .
Back in 2005 and 2006 , Obama raised $ 123,283 from other political action committees and put them into a political action committee of his own .
He called it Hopefund .
Hopefund is what is known as a “ leadership PAC , ” a frequent target of campaign watchdogs because it can raise money in much larger bundles than individual candidates .
The Candidate of Hope from Illinois followed the example set by Senate and House members who establish such accounts to raise money and then spread it around to other politicians in the hopes of gaining new best friends .
Legally , such PACs are supposed to operate independently and cannot coordinate with any campaigns of their owner .
Now that Obama is running for president , he 's handing out the bulk of Hopefund money to politicians and groups who happen to be in early presidential voting states , as the Washington Post 's John Solomon noted the other day .
The pace of giving has increased in recent months and this has led to some remarkable coincidences .
New Hampshire state Sen. Jacalyn Cilley , for instance , received $ 1,000 from Obama 's PAC last summer .
Six days later she happened to endorse the same Obama for president .
" I endorsed him because I believe in him and his policies , " she said .
Likewise , Obama 's PAC recently felt moved to donate $ 9,000 to Rep.
Paul Hodes , who happens to have been the first member of Congress from New Hampshire to endorse Obama early this year .
With a straight face Obama spokesmen deny there 's any connection between his ...
The Clear - Vu Zenith Pac locking DVD case is a ubiquitous fixture in
libraries and video rental stores across the country .
It uses a magic
yellow tab to keep you from opening the case .
A gizmo mounted to the
checkout counter can open the case easily by sliding the DVD across its
slot .
A similar case called One - Time has a built - in red slider .
Ever wonder how it works ?
The secret is two very powerful magnets .
From reading the sales literature
for the locks , these magnets are supposedly only available to sooper - seekrit
authorized personnel .
What they do n't tell their customers is that these
magnets are also available inside every hard disk drive made in the
last 15 years .
They are part of the head seeking motor .
To take apart a disk drive , just get a small Torx screwdriver and have at it .
Be sure to look for the screws hidden under the " warranty void if removed "
stickers .
I wo n't explain more than that ... it should be obvious .
On to the fun part .
Here 's what a yellow locking pin looks like after it's
been removed from the DVD case .
Notice that the lock has two metal lumps , each suspended by a sort of plastic
spring so that they stick out past the narrow sliding part of the locking
pin .
The object of this exercise is to make those two metal lumps pull in
towards the center of the pin , so that they will no longer block the sliding
action of the pin .
In order to remove a locking pin from a DVD case , the magnets have to be
positioned so that they pull both metal lumps inward at the same time .
It
may be easier to do if you have a look at where the magnets go :
To make sure that the magnets are in the right place , you will be able to
feel two spots along the DVD case where the magnet has an attractive force .
One spot is more attractive than the other , because the metal lump is closer
there .
That 's NOT the spot you want .
The spot you want is where there 's a
weaker attraction .
First rub a magnet slowly up the right edge of the front side of the case ,
feeling the two sticky spots .
Make a note of where the strong one is ...
that 's where the magnet goes on the * back * of the case .
The weak sticky spot
is where the magnet goes on the front of the case .
Put both magnets in place ( you may have to hold them and jiggle them a
little ) , and the locking pin will slide out .
Ta-da !
There is a different type of case with a red locking tab that 's permanently
installed in the case .
This one works the same way , but you can look inside
an opened case to see where the metal lumps are , so it 's even less
challenging than the yellow one .

I LOVE talking to cab drivers in Las Vegas because they are always open and there is really nothing you ca n’t ask them that is off limits .
The last time I was in Vegas I was chatting with this cab driver and I was asking him how much they get for taking people to the strip clubs .
He was telling us that he gets about $ 60 PER PERSON on average .
He also said it was seasonal and the price fluctuated .
He also went on to say that when a new club opens up they will pay as much as $ 100 a person and that will force the other clubs to pay higher to keep people coming in .
I was fascinated and kept on digging .
I remember watching this show on HBO about the bunny ranch and I asked him if they got a kickback for taking people out there .
He told us that “ ranch runs ” were the most profitable .
“ We get 30 % of whatever the person spends while at the ranch and we get comped free drinks while we wait ” the cabby told us .
I asked him about other kickbacks and he said just about every hooker had a kickback system setup with cab drivers .
Basically the cabby would get a kickback for recommending a certain hooker .
I just kept thinking to myself how remarkably similar this was to online affiliate marketing .
Percentage payouts , 1 time payouts … seasonal flux , market imbalances , tipping points ….
Just fascinating .
So if prostitution is the worlds oldest profession then that would make this the worlds oldest affiliate program ?

CLOTHING designed to protect people from stun guns may in fact put them in more danger .
Stun weapons such as the Taser shoot barbed darts into a victim , delivering a series of 50,000 - volt electrical pulses .
Last week inventor Gregory Schultz of Arizona was granted a patent ( US 7284280 ) on jackets , T - shirts and other garments that incorporate a layer of conductive foil , which dissipates this paralysing charge .
Schultz argues that with Tasers now available to the public in the US , police will increasingly come across Taser - equipped criminals and need protective garb .

Officers from Britain's Scotland Yard arrived in Pakistan Friday to help the country 's authorities investigate the assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto .
A member of Scotland Yard arrives at Islamabad International Airport on Friday .

The small team from the Metropolitan Police 's Counter - Terrorism Command will meet officials from Pakistan 's Interior Ministry later in the day , the CBC's Stephen Puddicombe reported from the capital , Islamabad .
The move comes a day after President Pervez Musharraf acknowledged his investigators need help and said he was " not fully satisfied " with Pakistan 's own probe into Bhutto 's death .
During a press conference Thursday , Musharraf said his request for Scotland Yard to help local police with the investigation was intended to dispel any suspicions about the involvement of government officials .
Pakistan 's government has been criticized over its security arrangements for Bhutto , who was killed Dec. 27 in a gun and suicide bombing attack following an appearance at a campaign rally in Rawalpindi .
Bhutto , who twice served as prime minister , had said elements in the ruling party and the country 's security forces were trying to kill her .
Key evidence already secured : British official
It remains unclear whether Bhutto — who rose from the sunroof of her vehicle to wave to supporters moments before shots were fired and a bomb went off — was killed by the gunfire or died from striking her head as she fell back into the vehicle , as the government claims .
Musharraf said there was no security lapse , and implied Bhutto was partly responsible for her own death .
" Who is to be blamed for her coming out of her vehicle ? " he asked .
Pakistan provided Bhutto with protection and warned her she faced threats if she returned to her home country after eight years of self - imposed exile , said Musharraf .
Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples Party is calling for the United Nations to investigate her death , saying " vague " help from Scotland Yard is not enough to reveal the truth .
A senior police investigator , who spoke on condition of anonymity to the Associated Press because of the sensitivity of the investigation , said Thursday that police in Pakistan already had secured key evidence , including the suspected bomber 's remains , two pistols and mobile phones .
Scotland Yard investigators , with their superior forensic techniques , could help determine whether either pistol was fired in the attack and also could examine video , he said .
WASHINGTON --
For all the lamenting about gridlock on Capitol Hill this year , Congress 's tortured year did create some winners : the companies and industries that avoided tax increases and subsidy cuts as legislation was blocked or narrowed .
From cigarette makers and hedge - fund managers to health insurers and oil companies , many of the business interests targeted by Democrats when they took control of Congress made it through the year without taking financial hits .
Intensive lobbying by the affected industries was a factor , ...
This holiday season has seen an explosion in thefts of expensive , platinum - laced catalytic converters from parked cars , and authorities report that high - clearance sport utility vehicles are the targets of choice for thieves .
With a common socket wrench and 90 seconds , they leave drivers stuck with cars that sound like Harley - Davidson motorcycles , and facing repair bills topping $ 1,000 .
“ It ’s an epidemic .
It ’s everywhere , ” said Lt. Bob Turnbull of the El Segundo Police Department .
Thefts of catalytic converters have been logged in the last month in Los Angeles , Pasadena , the Bay Area and Sacramento .
Arrests have been reported from Seattle to Virginia , near Pittsburgh , in the Maryland suburbs of Washington , D.C. , and in Tennessee , where the Highway Patrol busted a thief cutting converters from cars impounded in one of its own lots .

“ We ’ve had them all over the place ; we ’ve had them in broad daylight in a Vons parking lot , ” said Det. Jason Knickerbocker of the Manhattan Beach Police Department .
“ Most of them are at night .
A lot of times , we never find the victim . ”
The prize is a catalytic converter , a device used to reduce emissions .
Platinum is more valuable than gold , and the contents of a typical converter are worth $ 40 to $ 50 to scrap - metal dealers .
Some thieves use saws , but the preferred weapon in Southern California is a ratchet with a 14 - millimeter socket .
The thief crawls under the car and unfastens the bolts holding the converter , a process that accomplished crooks can complete in 90 seconds .
Drivers are particularly vulnerable during the holiday season , when masses of shoppers swarm parking lots and when revelers often leave home for several days , returning to discover they have been victimized .

Higher - clearance vehicles such as SUVs and particularly Toyota trucks and 4 - Runners are favorites in Los Angeles , authorities report .
Nationwide , authorities have reported thieves targeting pickups , Lexus and Toyota SUVs , all types of vans and some passenger cars .
Even auto dealers have been hit , according to reports .
Late last month , Turnbull ’s detectives apprehended five alleged thieves , and their investigation led to an additional four arrests .
Detectives believe that the group was working as a ring , hitting one city and then moving to another .
Before Thanksgiving , detectives broke up a three - man ring that had been hacking converters from the vehicles of commuters who had parked in the Lakewood Station lot of the Green Line .
They sold them to a Compton auto wrecking yard .
The brazen thieves cruised around the lot , looking for the model they wanted , and quickly removed the devices , said Gayle Anderson of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority .

There ’s little that can be done , other than catching thieves red-handed .
“ There are no identifying marks on these converters , ” Turnbull said .
“ When they take them into a scrap metal place or a mechanics shop , there ’s nothing to trace it with . ”
Last week , thieves hit an SUV parked in a garage at Mattel , the giant toy maker based in El Segundo .
Thanks to surveillance videos , company security officers narrowed the possibilities , and police were able to extract a license plate number , which led to an arrest .
Most victims are not so lucky .
Advertisement
They often do n’t realize what has happened , police report .
With organized thieves hopscotching the county , reports of thefts and arrests and recovery of stolen converters are sometimes made in different towns , authorities said .
Police say taking simple precautions can reduce the chances of becoming a crime victim .
The primary rule is to park in a garage .
The next best safeguard is welding the converter to the body of the car , Turnbull said .
At a cost of about $ 50 , the device becomes part of the vehicle : much more difficult -- and time consuming -- to remove , he said .

CASTIGLIONE DI CERVIA , Italy  Panic was spreading this August through this tidy village of 2,000 as one person after another fell ill with weeks of high fever , exhaustion and excruciating bone pain , just as most of Italy was enjoying Ferragosto , its most important summer holiday .
“ At one point , I simply could n’t stand up to get out of the car , ” said Antonio Ciano , 62 , an elegant retiree in a pashmina scarf and trendy blue glasses .
“ I fell .
I thought , O.K. , my time is up .
I ’m going to die .
It was really that dramatic . ”
By midmonth , more than 100 people had come down with the same malady .
Although the worst symptoms dissipated after a couple of weeks , no doctor could figure out what was wrong .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Technology might be just as addictive as alcohol and drugs and could also wreak havoc with personal and work relationships , a leading expert said .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
John O’Neill , the director of addictions services at the Menninger Clinic in Houston , Texas refers to it as “ technology overload ” when he sees addiction - like behavior in his patients using cell phones or emails .
“ I think they share some of the same components as people who become addicted to alcohol and drugs in that we start to see that someone cannot really put it down and cannot stop the use of it even when there are some consequences , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ We can become overloaded by technology and suffer consequences in our relationships , ” he added .
O’Neill ’s observations are backed up by psychologists who have classified technology addiction as an impulse disorder that can be as socially damaging as alcoholism , gambling and drug addiction .
The Internet / Computer Addiction Services in Redmond , Washington , which runs treatment programs and provides therapy , estimate that 6 to 10 percent of the approximately 189 million Internet users in the United States have a dependency on technology .
O’Neill said it ’s all about teaching people how to manage their behavior in a healthy way .
“ How do you learn to set limits , develop boundaries , how do you make some sense out of what does it mean to healthily use the technology , or to healthily enter into a relationship with someone , ” O’Neill said .
He added that warning signs that someone may be sliding into an unhealthy relationship with technology include using text messages , email and voice mail when face - to - face interaction would be more appropriate , or limiting time with friends and family to tend to your email , return phone calls or to surf the Internet .
An inability to leave home without a cell phone , to relax without constantly checking email or to stop using the Internet are also worrying signs .
When the Internet becomes a more powerful draw than spending time with family or friends , or when someone pays more attention to gadgets than what is happening in real life are more danger signs .
But O’Neill said there is no reason to become alarmed about daily use of texting or emails .
“ We ’ve spent a lot of time and a lot of years talking about what does it mean to healthily use something , what does it mean to healthily drink a glass or two of wine as opposed to drinking a bottle .
“ I think some people are drinking a bottle of technology and some people are able to drink a glass . ”
The Menninger Clinic is an international specialty psychiatric center that provides treatment , research and education .
U.S. Atty . Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales has so politicized the Justice Department that he should step down for the sake of the nation , the Senate ’s third - ranking Democrat said Sunday .
Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York -- citing recent disclosures about the FBI ’s improper use of administrative subpoenas to obtain private records and the controversy over the dismissal of eight U.S. attorneys in December -- told CBS ’ “ Face the Nation ” that Gonzales , who previously served as White House counsel , was “ no longer just the president ’s lawyer , but has a higher obligation to the rule of law and the Constitution . ”
Schumer , a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , charged that under Gonzales the Justice Department had become even more politicized than it was under President Bush ’s first attorney general , John Ashcroft .
“ And so , ” Schumer said , “ I think for the sake of the nation , Atty .
Gen. Gonzales should step down . ”

Appearing on the same program , Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , did not go so far as to suggest that Gonzales step down .
But he said that a report released Friday by the Justice Department ’s inspector general raised questions about the investigatory powers given to federal agents under the Patriot Act , which Congress reauthorized last year .
Resignation , Specter said , is “ a question for the president and the attorney general , but I do think there have been a lot of problems .
Before we come to conclusions , I think we need to know more facts . ”
Specter said the inspector general ’s report showed widespread violations of Patriot Act requirements designed to protect privacy rights of U.S. citizens .

Stating that the act has been “ very badly abused , ” Specter said Judiciary Committee hearings planned for this month -- including one with FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III -- not only should look at the failures but should include “ very active consideration about withdrawing some of those powers . ”
As for the alleged firing of U.S. attorneys for political reasons , Specter said he was concerned about the removal of the U.S. attorney in New Mexico , David C. Iglesias , who has said he received calls last year from two GOP members of Congress from New Mexico , Sen. Pete V. Domenici and Rep. Heather A. Wilson .
The legislators , he told Congress last week , were asking about the progress of a corruption investigation against Democrats in the state , and he said he interpreted the calls as pressure to bring indictments before the 2006 midterm elections .
Specter said he was less concerned whether politics had been involved in the removal in 2005 of a U.S. attorney in Maryland , Thomas DiBiagio .
Specter said DiBiagio had claimed similar political pressure from legislators but had failed to immediately report any calls he had received .
There were “ really good reasons ” for DiBiagio ’s dismissal , Specter added .
Though Justice Department officials say that the U.S. attorneys ousted in December were removed for performance - related reasons , critics have charged that the dismissals were politically motivated and , in some cases , followed complaints that the prosecutors had failed to aggressively investigate Democrats .

Appearing on CNN ’s “ Late Edition , ” Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. ( D - Del. ) , another Judiciary Committee member , said that “ Gonzales has lost the confidence of the vast majority of Americans . ”
Responding to the senators ’ comments , a Justice Department spokesman , Brian Roehrkasse , said in a written statement that Gonzales had demonstrated “ decisive leadership by demanding a new level of accountability . ”
On Saturday , during a question - and - answer session with reporters in Montevideo , Uruguay , Bush expressed continued confidence in both Gonzales and Mueller .

The ruling is almost certain to have an impact on gun laws throughout the country .
The security guard , Dick Heller , said : " I want to be able to defend myself and my wife from violent criminals , and the constitution says I have a right to do that by keeping a gun in my home .
The police can't be everywhere , and they can't protect everyone all the time . "
But the mayor of Washington , Adrian Fenty , said the city council had " enacted the handgun ban more than 30 years ago to reduce handgun violence " .
It had saved many lives since then .
Washington has the toughest restrictions in the US , but the ban only applies to handguns - residents can still keep shotguns and rifles at home .
The court decision to review the issue , announced on Tuesday , follows an appeals court ruling earlier this year that Washington 's handgun ban is illegal .
The supreme court ruling will go to the centre of the debate between those who claim the US constitution enshrines the right of individuals to bear arms and those who say the founders ' intentions were that this should apply only to states and their militias .
The second amendment , adopted in 1791 , says : " A well - regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . "
The supreme court is scheduled to hear the case in March and is expected to issue its ruling in June .
The court currently has a rightward tilt , in part because of President George Bush 's appointees , although the balance is held by Justice Anthony Kennedy .
While essentially a conservative , Kennedy is occasionally capable of surprise decisions .
One of the core suggestions by Chris Clarke on how to make a libertarian 's head explode is to confront them with the " true history " of their ideology .
What is ironic is that most libertarians already understand their history better than Clarke does , and those that would be surprised by Clarke 's statement hardly hold a consistent libertarian ideology .
Clarke 's claim :
Most American Libertarians have precious little grasp of the history of their political philosophy .
They seem to think that the Libertarian school of thought sprang fully formed like Athena from Ayn Rand ’s beetled brow , with Robert Heinlein as attending midwife .
Libertarianism ’s true origins , however , unsettle most Libertarians to the point where the mere acceptance of that history often starts those rusty old mental gears grinding again .
To wit , and here is tactical nuclear sentence number one : " Libertarianism originated in the philosophy of a left - wing French political philosopher who also influenced Karl Marx . "
The French Philosopher in question is , as some of you have guessed ( and with whose description a few of you are no doubt ready to quibble ) , Pierre - Joseph Proudhon , who famously penned the Libertarians ’ Sekrit Motto , " Property is Theft . "
Of course unlike modern Libertarians , Proudhon meant that as a condemnation .
Among the pre-Marxist political thinkers strongly influenced by Proudhon was Johann Kaspar Schmidt , who under the pen name Max Stirner wrote one of the first true capital - L Libertarian texts , Der Einzige und sein Eigentum , which can be translated either as " The Ego and Its Own " or , more literally and more tellingly , " The Individual And His Property . "
Stirner became a nucleus of a nascent school of political thought then called " individualist anarchism , " *** whose inheritance - tax - free heirs include Ludwig Von Mises , The Austrian and Chicago Schools , Murray Rothbard , Alan Greenspan , and so on .
No , Ayn Rand is not the mother of libertarianism , her ideology is Objectivism and many of her most loyal followers look down on libertarianism .
More than anything else , one of my primary goals with this series is to hammer home the point that Ayn Rand 's movement is Objectivism , not libertarianism , and the two are not one in the same .
Objectivists believe that they have a comprehensive philosophy that guides all of their actions , including their political views .
To them , libertarianism is just a set of opinions and beliefs about government .
Many , if not most , libertarians find Ayn Rand 's ideas interesting and believe that she got some things right .
Occasionally similar ideas and conclusions does not mean that they are the same .
Al Gore and Jerry Falwell are both Christian but they are not identical .
Alternatively , some liberals and progressives may agree with some of the critiques of capitalism by Karl Marx without being full fledged supporters of the Communist Revolution .
Ayn Rand remains a controversial figure within libertarianism as her outlook focused on the ends , not so much the means .
As such , Objectivists at times end up supporting government as a means to an end , while libertarians are fundamentally distrustful of government as a means , regardless of the end .
Objectivists , far more than libertarians , are supportive of the War in Iraq as a way of spreading " liberty " and " democracy . "
Clarke is right to point out the influence that Proudhon had on Von Mises , Rothbard , the Austrian and Chicago schools , and others who have built American libertarianism .
This is not news to libertarians .
But I think that Clarke is right in that some libertarians do need to be criticized for their view of history .
There is a constant claim within libertarianism that the movement is nothing more than the classical liberalism of the Founding Fathers still alive in today 's modern world .
Not all libertarians make this claim , but enough do for it to warrant deeper discussion .
Find yourself a copy of the United States Constitution .
Perhaps you have a copy handy on your bookshelf , otherwise you can just look it up online .
A lot of Libertarians will hold up the Constitution as a great and sacred document , a kind of a political Garden of Eden that we have fallen from .
Michael Badnarik , 2004 Libertarian Presidential nominee , styles himself a constitutional scholar for the masses ; 1988 Libertarian Presidential nominee Ron Paul votes no on anything that is n't specifically enumerated in the Constitution .
Even without directly mentioning the Constitution , the right - libertarian Cato Institute talks about " the principles of the American Revolution -- individual liberty , limited government , the free market , and the rule of law . "
Over and over again , the modern day libertarian movement turns to our founding document as a patriotic reassurance that they are in the right .
Yet they are unable to overcome a simple problem : the Constitution is not a libertarian document .
To equate libertarianism with the classical liberalism that influenced our Founding Fathers is a philosophical error .
While no doubt many classical liberals call themselves libertarians today , the modern movement has been heavily influenced by Austrian economics and Murray Rothard and takes a far more negative view of the state than the old men with wigs who wrote the Constitution .
Even the minarchists ( libertarians who believe that society needs a state , in contrast to anarchists who believe that society does n't need a state ) who stop short of outright anarchism and the abolition of the state would have been seen as the most radical of radicals in the early Republic ; they would have made the Locofocos look mainstream .
John Locke , Adam Smith and the rest of the classical liberal gang did express a mistrust of state power and its granting of monopolistic privilege , but they also supported a state for the maintenance of law and order in the face of natural anarchy .
A quick glance at the Constitution reveals that the Founding Fathers , far from consistently favoring a system that viewed the state as a necessary evil , saw a role for government to " establish Justice , insure domestic Tranquility , provide for the common defence , promote the general Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity . "
The minarchist may still argue that these broad general principles are fully compatible with a limited government favored by modern day libertarians .
But the Constitution is also the source for Congress 's power to lay excises ( the ancestor to our modern day sin taxes , which libertarians often criticize ) , to lay tariffs and regulate commerce ( protectionism , a huge no - no to libertarianism ) , to borrow money and therefore establish a national debt ( say goodbye to balanced budgets , another libertarian ideal ) , to establish post offices and post roads ( see my previous complaints about this monopolistic agency ) , and to grant patents and copyrights ( which is a contentious subject within libertarianism , some favoring it and some opposing it ) .
Even a strict interpretation of the Constitution would grant the government powers that libertarians today complain about .
General welfare , that loosely defined term that continues to drive libertarians crazy in discussing constitutional interpretations , was a very real concept to these classical liberals .
The patent system is one example of how government intervention in creating monopolistic privilege was justified because of its positive impact on the general welfare .
" To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts , " Congress was granted the ability to grant patents and copyrights .
While this was undoubtedly an intrusion into the free market as understood at the time ( patents in British law were specifically treated as a form of monopoly ) , it was seen as a proper role of government in promoting the general welfare through encouraging science .
Overtime , of course , the argument would develop that inventors had some type of " intellectual property right " to a patent , but that was hardly the focus of the Founding Fathers .
Far from being a political Garden of Eden , the original Constitution was itself a fall from libertarian utopia .
While L. Neil Smith sees the Constitution itself as the original sin with the Articles of Confederation the libertarian Garden of Eden , it is more realistic to accept that the Founding Fathers and the newly independent states that they represented were not libertarian .
Other libertarians try to place the fall from grace at the Civil War , when President Lincoln and his Radical Republican Congress implemented a host of statist policies ranging from protectionism to massive transportation subsidies to well connected businessmen .
See here for an example of libertarianism criticism of Lincoln
Yet one can hardly defend the antebellum republic as libertarian given the system of slavery .
The Constitution did nothing to change this , it in fact solidified by including Article 4 , Section 2 , Clause 3 : " No Person held to Service or Labour in one State , under the Laws thereof , escaping into another , shall , in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein , be discharged from such Service or Labour , But shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due . "
And how do we view the track record of expansionism ?
President Madison started an avoidable war in an attempt to seize control of Canada , while President Polk provoked war with Mexico to fulfill Manifest Destiny .
Part of the fame of Andrew Jackson was his role in seizing control of Florida as General , without Congressional approval it should be noted .
John Anthony Quitman and William Walker were less successful in their own filibustering expeditions .
Interventionism seems to have a long history in American history , and I can only guess how liberventionists ( people who claim to be libertarians yet have an approach far closer to Objectivism , with its support of state intervention for the cause of liberty -- this is one form of vulgar libertarianism ) who today cheer on the Iraq War in the name of " liberty " would react to my criticisms of the expansion of our republic .
The United States of America has never had a libertarian government , assuming there can be such a thing .
The existence of legal slavery ought to rule out the antebellum republic , regardless of how limited its financial resources were compared to the nation as a whole .
It seems to me that only the critics of libertarianism and vulgar corporate apologists who like the idea of monopolies running the economy attempt to argue that the Gilded Age was libertarian .
And once you get up into the Progressive Era , no one , not even critics of libertarianism will make such a claim , although I do think we somehow always end up getting blamed for the Great Depression .
Of course , other critics ( or even the very same that will in another breath point out that we 've tried libertarianism ) will also say that libertarianism is a utopian scheme because it 's never been done before .
I 've never seen someone eat their cake and have it too , but it seems like people keep trying anyway .
It is no fault of libertarianism and the strength of its ideas that it has n't been tried before .
Libertarianism is something new , there is nothing classical about it .
As I illustrated above , the classically liberal constitution granted Congress the explicit ability to grant patents and lay tariffs , two of the four cornerstones of privilege and statism according to Benjamin Tucker ( a very influential American anarchist ) .
And it left unchallenged the system of privilege in the land and money monopolies , although the period of free banking in the antebellum republic probably did come close to breaking the latter .
By opposing the statist status quo , the libertarian movement no doubt appeals to those that still have a classically liberal view of politics .
But the libertarian movement is larger than just that , it holds a radically skeptical view of government 's ability to promote the general welfare without creating privilege and inequality .
Following through this critique of government to its natural ends arguable will result in anarchist conclusions , but libertarianism still has the perception of being minarchist .
I do n't think it matters if libertarianism advertises itself as explicitly minarchist or anarchist , the critique of government is the founding principle and it is what distinguishes it from classical liberalism .
Much as modern day Christianity and Rabbinical Judaism developed out of radically different Temple Judaism over two millennium ago , modern day liberalism and libertarianism share a similar ancestry .
This is something that is disputed by some activists on both sides of the debate .
But ancestry does not mean that they are one and the same , libertarianism has expanded on classical liberalism 's critique of government while modern liberalism has instead focused on classical liberalism 's belief in democracy and the ability to govern with a mind toward the common good .
Classical liberalism held both of these seemingly paradoxical principles , with some followers leaning more toward one or the other .
Following the abortive attempt by Hamilton and the Federalists to establish a truly conservative society in the Americas , most of our political debate has been within the range of liberalism .
While adopting some of the programs of Hamilton , the American System of Clay was designed to encourage broad economic growth and intensification , not a new aristocratic elite .
This is illustrated by Clay and the Whigs favoring high tarrifs , which would have a widespread impact in benefiting all domestic manufacturers of the protected good , in contrast to Hamilton 's support for subsidies and bounties that , like today 's agricultural subsidies , would benefit larger producers at the expense of the small independent artisan .
Libertarianism is not a fetish worship of liberty , nor is it clinging to our Constitution as an ideal document .
It is intellectually dishonest to claim classical liberalism as our own and modern liberalism as some form of a bastard son ; both movement can claim classical liberalism as an influence .
Focusing on rolling back the clock to 1859 or 1800 is not libertarian , it is both radical and conservative in clinging to the past as better than our present condition .
You may ask though , just how has libertarianism gotten itself caught up with Objectivists and corporate apologists .
In this political typology by David Bruhn , he attempts to distinguish between ends and means .
Libertarianism is ultimately an ideology focused on means , it is critical of government as a means to any end .
However , political activists in the past have influenced the conventional wisdom of what a society without a government , or with little government intervention , would look like .
During the fusionism of the 1950s , it was argued that social conservatives should be libertarians because without a strong government to influence society and culture , family and church would be the two primary institutions to impact morality .
Decades later , social conservatives have jumped off the libertarian bandwagon and are now pushing for a large degree of government intervention in society to enforce their own moral code .
So you can see , libertarianism can attract two types of people :
1- Those that are libertarian because they agree with the libertarian means of minimal government .
2 - Those that are libertarian because they believe that libertarian means will produce the end result that they desire .
As conventional wisdom changes , so does this second group .
The biggest problem for overcoming stereotypical views of libertarianism comes from this second group .
They are the individuals who are first drawn to libertarianism because they think it will give them what they want , and overtime they identify libertarianism not with the means , but the end result they desire .
And soon you have the corporate apologists , the vulgar libertarians , who believe that libertarianism means taking the side of corporations in any political dispute .
This is in contrast to the authentic libertarian position , which is critical of corporations because of their manipulation of the political process in an attempt to distort the free market .
As anarcho - capitalist David Friedman says , " The capitalist system of coordination by trade seems to be largely populated by indigestible lumps of socialism called corporations . "
Libertarianism is not simply an ideology that believes that those poor old bosses need all the help they can get .
This diary has already gone on very long , but I welcome you to offer up any and all questions you may have about libertarianism and its origins .
I hope to continue these discussions in the future and attempt to talk more about the specifics of libertarianism , but for now I am focused on clearing up misconceptions about its origins .

“ It has a strong labor force , excellent productivity and technology and a deep and liquid financial market that is in the process of trying to repair itself , ” Mr. Bernanke said .
“ So I think we need to keep in mind also that the economy does have inherent strengths and that those will certainly surface over a period of time . ”
But James W. Paulsen , a strategist at Wells Capital Management , reflected the view of many investors that help from Washington would come too late .
“ By the time they actually pass anything , it will be past the time we need it , ” Mr. Paulsen said .
Democratic leaders said they were hopeful about reaching a deal in a few days , but they could end up feuding with Mr. Bush over who should benefit most from the stimulus measures .
Democrats are drafting a package that would cost about $ 100 billion and is likely to include one - time tax rebates for workers , expanded unemployment benefits and other measures aimed at middle - income and low - income people who are most likely to spend any extra money immediately .
Mr. Bush and many Republican lawmakers have argued that any stimulus measure has to include incentives for businesses to spur job creation .
But after speaking with the president by telephone , Democratic leaders said they were optimistic about reaching agreement .
“ The acknowledgment by the president today of the immediate need for a stimulus package is significant progress , ” said the House speaker , Nancy Pelosi of California , after the call .
“ In the next few days , through bipartisan negotiations , we are hopeful that we will agree on legislation that provides timely , targeted and temporary assistance . ”
To be sure , there was grumbling .
The Senate majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , was irritated that Mr. Bush had abruptly decided to outline a plan on his own instead of developing a bipartisan package with Democrats .
“ The President ’s strategy threatens to unnecessarily politicize the inevitable bipartisan negotiations we will need to quickly enact legislation , ” Mr. Reid complained .
From the South Side to the State House Deval has devoted his life to lifting the voices of others .
Born on the South Side of Chicago , he lived with his grandparents , his mother , and his sister in their grandparents ’ two bedroom tenement , much of that time on welfare .
Through the love and support of family , great teachers , adults in the neighborhood and in church , he became the first in his family to attend college and law school .
After law school , he joined the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and led the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice .
As the Assistant Attorney General , he coordinated the investigation of arson at black churches across the South .
Deval has always been called to service , but that service has not always been in the public sector .
He led reforms at Texaco , where a court appointed him to create a more equitable and inclusive workplace , and at Coca - Cola , where he stood up for employees and unions .
In 2006 , completing one of the most extraordinary political journeys the state of Massachusetts had ever seen , he won a landslide victory to become Massachusetts ’ first black Governor .
Serving from 2007 - 2015 , he used his time in the State House to pull together disparate factions to achieve lasting reform .
By the end of his second term , Massachusetts ranked first in the nation in energy efficiency , first in health care coverage , and first in student achievement .
After ranking 47th in the nation for job creation , Massachusetts grew to a 25 - year employment high .
It became a global center for life sciences , biotech , clean tech , and advanced manufacturing .
After he left office , Deval joined Bain Capital to launch an impact investing fund .
This new fund , Bain Capital Double Impact , has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into mission - driven companies that target both social and environmental good .
His life has always been about rejecting false choices , and his new fund was meant to show that private companies can be a force for public good .
Throughout his time in public office and in the private sector , he has been a leader in developing solutions to the challenges we continue to face as a country : climate change , health care , the future of work and innovation .
Mr. Hoekstra did not provide details , including who may have told Mr. Rodriguez not to destroy the tapes .
The lawmaker said it was important to have Mr. Rodriguez testify before the committee to get his version of events .
A lawyer for Mr. Rodriguez , Robert S. Bennett , challenged Mr. Hoekstra ’s comments about what agency officials told his client .
“ Nobody , to our knowledge , ever instructed him not to destroy the tapes , ” Mr. Bennett said .
“ Had the director or deputy director or general counsel told him not to destroy the tapes , they would not have been destroyed . ”
Mr. Rizzo was the first C.I.A. official with direct knowledge of the events surrounding the destruction of the tapes to appear before the House Intelligence Committee , which is in the midst of an investigation that could last for several months .
Gen. Michael V. Hayden , the C.I.A. director , testified before the committee last month , and lawmakers have said they intend to call several current and former officials from the C.I.A. and the White House to appear before the House panel .
A federal prosecutor , John H. Durham , is currently leading a separate criminal investigation to determine whether Mr. Rodriguez or other officials may have broken any laws by destroying the tapes or concealing them from the courts and the national Sept. 11 commission .
The tapes showed agency operatives using harsh interrogation methods on two Qaeda detainees , Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri .
And now , the moment you ’ve all been waiting for ( since last Monday ) !
I have picked a handful of questions from all your lovely inquires .
If I did n’t pick yours , I ’m sorry , there were seriously a ton of really good ones that I did not pick simply because I did n’t have a solid , clear cut answer , or because I would n’t be able to answer them in just a paragraph or less .
Anyways , without further ado :
jeffbaker307 asks :
Do you write any short stories ?
Yes !
Short stories are like my specialty .
That and poetry , especially haikus , because writing long things is kind of proving to be harder than I thought it would be .
But , yeah , I love short stories !
I used to write a lot more of them when I was in high school and had to constantly write short stories for creative writing class , but I definitely still enjoy it .
In fact , I shared one of my short stories on here back when I was writing in 2018 !
Susan asks :
What is your favorite dinosaur ?
I have always really loved long necks , aka the brachiosaurus .
Just really seems like a gentle giant , you know ?
I love that they ’re so huge and yet they ’re herbivores .
They ’re always portrayed in dinosaur movies as the super friendly nice ones , and I think it ’s made me biased .
But honestly their design is just so cool , I mean they ’re just ridiculously tall !
Like their head had to have been twenty degrees colder than their legs at all times .
David Karger asks :
It sounds like you live in an area where your neighbors are rather more conservative than your parents .
Has growing up there pulled your politics to the right of your parents as well ?
Oh lord no .
I ’m super far left .
Which , in my opinion , anyone who is “ radically left ” is n’t really that far left , they just want basic human rights afforded to everyone , which is n’t that radical , but some people think it is .
I guess I ’d say I ’m liberal , but I agree with a ton of socialist type stuff , too .
In my mind , everyone should have access to a home , a hot meal , and a shower , no matter what .
Homelessness and starvation is a failure of our government to serve its people .
Growing up here has made me experience Trump supporters and their hatred first hand , and I ’m more left than ever .
AlexaJade asks :
What is your favorite flower ?
I love all flowers !
There ’s so many fantastic , beautiful , colorful ones .
But I ’ve always been partial to tiger lilies .
There ’s something about seeing a big patch of them growing wild in a ditch and swaying in the breeze while driving down a country road .
I first saw one when I was ten , at my friend ’s grandparents ’ house , and her grandma gave me some bulbs , so I could plant them , too .
But they never grew .
I wish my yard had them , like so many naturally do around here .
Any bouquet is automatically enhanced by lilies .
They ’re show stoppers .
It ’s funny , orange is my least favorite color , and yet tiger lilies just really take the cake .
mopiegirl asks : I ’ve always loved the name Athena ; how do you feel about your name ( and / or nicknames ) ?
Thank you !
I actually really love my name , I ’m so glad my parents named me it ( shoutout to them and their awesome name skills ) .
I have always loved Greek mythology , which may or may not be a result of narcissism because of my name , especially since Athena has always been my favorite and I adore her .
I also like my name for more vain reasons .
I like when strangers tell me my name is pretty , when people say it ’s such a beautiful name .
I dislike nicknames .
The Wooglie asks :
What ’s your favorite TV show you ’ve watched in 2020 so far ?
I do n’t want a lot of TV shows , it ’s hard for me to have patience to watch like , nine seasons of something , especially if it ’s one of those shows where seasons 1 and 2 are pretty good and then the rest absolutely blow .
But I do really like Lucifer , especially since Netflix took over and they only have like ten episodes per season instead of like twenty - five .
However , I think The Boys on Amazon Prime is the winner here .
It is quite the show .
I highly recommend it .
I ’m currently keeping up with the episodes of season 2 they ’ve been releasing weekly , and it ’s getting wild .
Who am I kidding , it was wild from the get go !
I adore it .
Hillary Rettig asks :
Which college course to date has had the biggest impact on you , and why ?
I would say my favorite so far , and the one that has been the most impactful , was Children ’s Literature , aka ENG 262 .
I passed with a B +!
I took it in the spring of my freshman year .
It was wonderful !
My professor was this lil ’ ol ’ lady who wore sweaters and skirts everyday and read us picture books .
In the class , we started off the semester with picture books like Where the Wild Things Are , and then worked our way up through books such as Charlotte ’s Web , Holes , The Giver , The Outsiders , and The Hunger Games .
I had to do a report over The Outsiders and honestly , digging deeper into a children ’s book I had read in seventh grade was kind of eye opening .
There ’s so much more packed into these books than you realize .
Children ’s authors are tasked with taking a great story and making it accessible for young readers , and that is an incredible talent .
Children ’s authors are shaping the minds of the future , and that ’s no small feat .
I had never considered being a children ’s author before , but now I ’m kind of considering it .
I want to be a lot of things , y’know ?
Literature has a lot of variety .
Chris M asks :
You were a vegetarian and stopped , were n’t you ?
What are your reasons then and now and what are your opinions on the ethics of meat consumption ?
I was vegetarian for five years , starting when I was eleven , almost twelve , and ending on my 18th birthday .
I went to Minicon when I was eleven and met a vegetarian named Isabel , and I had a conversation with her about vegetarianism .
I could n’t imagine not eating meat , but our conversation enlightened me .
I started thinking about how utterly fucked up the meat industry is .
Factory farming is an abhorrent thing , one of humanity ’s cruelest creations , and after doing what meager research an eleven year old can do , I became too disgusted and sad with the idea of eating meat , so I stopped , cold turkey .
I stopped for no good reason other than that I grew tired of it .
It ’s not super hard to be vegetarian , but it does take more effort than not being vegetarian , especially when you live in rural Ohio .
I just try not to think about it anymore .
I try not to think about the mass suffering of animals , the nonstop slaughter of creatures who do n’t deserve it .
It ’s just like the consumption of clothes from Old Navy or buying iPhones .
You know they ’re made overseas in sweatshops and you know the behind the scenes are n’t pretty , but you just do n’t think about it .
It ’s so easy to just pretend to be ignorant to the suffering of others as long as it benefits you .
Our world is so very “ City of Omelas ” , and meat consumption is a part of that mindset of “ just turn away and pretend like it ’s not happening ” for me .
But in those moments you get a steak that ’s just a bit too rare , or the heads are attached to the shrimp you ’ve ordered , it comes flooding back ; the guilt , the disgust , the abhorrence .
I used to think hunting was cruel and harshly judged those who could go out and kill something themselves like that , but I see now that buying Tyson Chicken Nuggets or Oscar Meyer Bologna is far worse .
I ’ve been thinking of going vegetarian again lately .
Dean Rabo asks :
Do you believe in life after death ?
No .
I ’m not religious and I do n’t believe in an afterlife .
Once you ’re done , you ’re done .
It ’ll be just like before you were born : nothing .
You will have no consciousness , no awareness , there is nothing but the void , forever .
I do n’t like thinking this way .
I wish I believed in something nice , like Heaven , but I do n’t .
And even if I believed in Heaven , that ’d mean I ’d believe in Hell , too , and that ’s where I ’m going , if it exists , so I guess it ’s better that there ’s nothing .
There is no soul , no pearly gates awaiting you upon your inevitable demise .
Just the unyielding darkness .
This fraction of existence if all you get , and then you will never exist again for all time .
Enjoy it the best you can .
peggyleslie asks :
What gives you joy ?
After that super depressing answer above , I ’m glad to end on something lighter !
Things that give me joy include ( but are not limited to ) : rainbows , baking cookies , flowers , kittens , eating a ripe cherry tomato right off the vine , the smell of rain , chai lattes , reading a good book in a hot bubble bath , the beach , farmers markets , bubble tea , picking out a pumpkin from a pumpkin patch , making apple cider and hot chocolate from scratch , smelling candles at the grocery store , getting pedicures , aaand spending time with my family .
Bonus question from glinda :
What ’s your favorite ice cream flavor ?
Cotton Candy !
Now and forever .
I had fun doing this .
I liked a lot of your questions !
Thank you to everyone who participated .
I ’d like to do this again sometime , so if your question did n’t get picked , you could try asking again next time .
Have a great day !

Two elderly men thought to be the last speakers of a Latin American language are refusing to speak to each other .
They are in their seventies now and should be doing their bit to pass their language on to other people in their community .
But a Mexican institute says it is concerned that their rare language may never be heard again .
The two old men who are n't talking live in the Mexican state of Tabasco and their mother tongue is an indigenous language called Zoque from Tabasco .
Fernando Nava is a linguist and knows the pair .
" They do n't speak to each other by personal reasons , nothing to do with the language itself , " he said .
" They have a personal story .
One of them is a prosperous man , the other one is a poor man . "
Mr Nava works at the Mexican Institute of Indigenous Language and he says the institute is trying to encourage family members to learn Zoque from Tabasco .
" We hope one of their families will take more interest , " he said .
But the institute is up against an old obstacle .
Many people would like to learn another language but do n't always follow through .
" They say in front of you , they say , ' It 's nice , our grandfather is very important people ' , but it 's difficult to have a persistent problem to get new speakers of the language . "
In 1960 , according to a Mexican Government survey , there were 367 speakers of Zoque from Tabasco .
In the early 1970s , linguists could only find 40 people who spoke the language .
And now there are apparently only two : grumpy old men .
Indigenous languages are disappearing at a steady rate .
The United Nations organisation UNESCO ( United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organisation ) estimates that half the languages in the world today could be lost within " a few generations " .
Dr Paul Sidwell works to save endangered languages .
He is a visiting fellow at the Australian National University 's Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies .
" The first thing to do is to record the language , to document it in as far as we can , in all the different ways it 's used , document the lexicon , the grammar , " he said .
" Once we have a description of the language , then we know what it is we 're trying to preserve . "
Dr Sidwell says if the men refuse to speak to one another , there may be other ways to save the language .
" The first thing I would tell them is to write things down , to document in writing their knowledge of the language if we can't actually record them speaking , " he said .
" So , if they 're writing down recollections , stories , folktales , recollections of conversations , then at least they 're maintaining their use of the language and we have the benefit of the permanent record that emerges from that writing .
" And then maybe their attitude will warm up a bit to speaking again . "

Mr Spielberg formally announced his decision in a statement
In a statement , he accused China of not doing enough to pressure Sudan to end the " continuing human suffering " in the troubled western Darfur region .
At least 200,000 people have been killed and two million forced from their homes in the five - year conflict .
Beijing has not yet responded to the move , which correspondents say is its first big setback in staging the Games .
This is a noble move by Spielberg - he will certainly go down in history as someone who gave human lives precedence over fame and money
Abdul Wahid Mohammad Ahmed al - Nur
Sudanese rebel leader
China 's dilemma over Darfur
A source in the Beijing Olympic Committee said a response was being discussed at the highest levels but had not yet been made public .
But the BBC's James Reynolds in Beijing says the decision will anger and worry the authorities there .
Since Beijing won the right to host the Games it has always tried to keep China 's politics and China 's Olympics separate , he says , and it has attacked anyone who has tried to link the two .
Boycott call
Mr Spielberg , who had been brought in as artistic adviser for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games , said the cause of Darfur was more important than his role .
" I find that my conscience will not allow me to continue business as usual , " he said in a statement .
" At this point , my time and energy must be spent not on Olympic ceremonies , but on doing all I can to help bring an end to the unspeakable crimes against humanity that continue to be committed in Darfur . "
OLYMPICS ROW Famous names involved in advising the Olympics include director Zhang Yimou and Kung Fu star Jackie Chan Hollywood stars Mia Farrow and George Clooney have criticised China over Darfur Architect Ai Weiwei , who designed the main Olympic stadium , says the Games are a " public relations sham "
Athletes put focus on Darfur
He added : " Sudan 's government bears the bulk of the responsibility for these on - going crimes , but the international community , and particularly China , should be doing more . "
Rebel groups in Darfur said this was exactly the kind of pressure that was needed to get Beijing to change its policy towards the Sudanese government .
" This is a noble move by Spielberg , " Sudan Liberation Movement ( SLM ) leader Abdul Wahid Mohammad Ahmed al - Nur told the Sudan Tribune newspaper .
" He will certainly go down in history as someone who gave human lives precedence over fame and money . "
Ahmed Abdel Shafi , who leads an SLM splinter group , told the BBC : " I commend him for his strong position .
This is a lesson to the rest of the world that people should distance themselves from China . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
The real question is why the Olympics were awarded to China in the first place Vladi , California
The International Olympic Committee said the decision was a personal one made by Mr Spielberg .
" The IOC recognise Darfur is a highly complex issue , with tragic circumstances , but is a matter for the UN to resolve , " the committee said in a statement .
' Desperate time '
Sudan , with its vast oil reserves , sells some two - thirds of its oil to Beijing .
In turn , Beijing sells weapons to the Sudanese government and has defended Khartoum in the UN Security Council .
As a result , China has been criticised for its links with a government ostracised by many for its role in the ongoing crisis in Darfur .
Earlier on Tuesday , as part of a " Global Day of Action " focusing on Darfur , an open letter signed by Nobel Peace Prize laureates and former Olympians was sent to China 's president .
Actress Mia Farrow , who signed the letter and had pressed Mr Spielberg to end his involvement , said his decision sent out the right signal to the Chinese government .
She said : " I 'm delighted by his decision and it's a desperate time for Darfur , so this is a shred of good news in a very bleak week . "
SYDNEY , Australia  Australians believe the American hamburger and U.S. slang are infringing on their culture and they are " not at all pleased " about it , according to a survey released Monday .
The telephone poll of 1,213 people by the government - funded U.S. Studies Center at the University of Sydney measured Australians ' attitudes about their closest ally , the United States .
Asked to judge the influence of American culture on Australia , 67 % of respondents said they were " not at all pleased " about the prevalence of U.S. - style fast food in Australia .
Australians ranked fast food second only behind U.S. foreign policy as an issue they were " very worried " about .
The survey did not ask respondents for specific examples , though fast food chains selling burgers and french fries are more common now in Australia than the once - ubiquitous corner store selling fish and chips .
A further 52 % said they were very unhappy with the influence of " the American language " on the way people speak , which could easily now include phrases such as " Hey , buddy " instead of " G'day mate . "
The result reveals Australians ' love - hate relationship with their U.S. counterparts , with a vast majority reporting they were at least " somewhat pleased " with the impact of American films and television — the most likely source of Australians ' exposure to U.S. slang .
Professor Murray Goot , who led the research , said Australians view their distinctive accent and slang as a " defining part of what it is to be Australian " and are therefore worried about outside influences .
" I think there 's a sense in which Australians see changing language as changing their identity as Australians ... in a way they do n't see the idea of watching American movies or television shows as , in itself , quite that sort of problem , " Goot said .
The results , which comprise the second half of a broad investigation into Australian feelings about the United States , also found that Australians have less confidence in the U.S. than they did 21 years ago .
While 62 % had a favorable view of the American system of government in 1986 , only 49 % felt the same way in 2007 .
In 1986 , 56 % of those surveyed said they were confident the U.S. could deal wisely with its social and economic problems .
In 2007 , only 44 % of respondents agreed .
The first half results , released in October , found that while most people do n't like President George W. Bush or the war in Iraq , they strongly believe the United States is an important security partner for Australia .
The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 % .

Pork is a staple of the Chinese diet
The benchmark lending rate will rise to 7.47 % from 7.29 % with effect from Friday , while the main deposit rate will increase to 4.14 % from 3.87 % .
Chinese inflation hit 6.9 % in November , its highest level since 1996 .
Separately , Beijing has promised to double subsidies for pig farmers to ensure pork supplies and lower prices .
Soaring food costs , and especially the price of pork which is up 56 % in the past year , have been blamed for driving the main inflation rate to an 11 - year high in November .
Larger farms
China 's pork output fell this summer due to higher feed costs , and after disease led to a livestock cull .
The government has said it will pay farmers a subsidy of 100 yuan ( $ 13 ; £ 6.50 ) for every fertile sow next year .
On Wednesday , the government vowed to spend 2.5 bn yuan next year to help farmers build " standardized , large scale " pig farms , the Xinhua News Agency said .
Beijing also decided to extend sow insurance , which was launched in August to cover losses from diseases and natural disasters , to " as many sows as possible " .
The government also said it would release part of its corn reserves to the market to reduce food inflation pressure , Xinhua said .
The last interest rate rise was introduced in September .
" Given the background of upward pressure in domestic prices ... and in order to guide the public 's expectations about inflation , we have put into play price adjustment tools , " the central bank said .
Bush bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Podhoretz in 2004 , at the very time that Democrats were attacking him for a war that was not going as advertised .
Podhoretz secretly urged Bush to bomb Iran
President Bush and Karl Rove sat listening to Norman Podhoretz for roughly 45 minutes at the White House as the patriarch of neoconservatism argued that the United States should bomb Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
The meeting was not on the president ’s public schedule .
Advertisement
Rove was silent throughout , though he took notes .
The president listened diligently , Podhoretz said as he recounted the conversation months later , but he “ did n’t tip his hand . ”
“ I did say to [ the president ] , that people ask :
Why are you spending all this time negotiating sanctions ?
Time is passing .
I said , my friend [ Robert ] Kagan wrote a column which he said you were giving ‘ futility its chance . ’
And both he and Karl Rove burst out laughing .
“ It struck me , ” Podhoretz added , “ that if they really believed that there was a chance for these negotiations and sanctions to work , they would not have laughed .
They would have got their backs up and said , ‘ No , no , it ’s not futile , there ’s a very good chance . ’ ”
Podhoretz walked out of the meeting neither deterred nor assured the president would attack the Persian state .
Yet prior to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s visit to New York for the United Nations ’ General Assembly , Podhoretz said he believes that “ Bush is going to hit ” Iran before the end of his presidency .
His assumption is based on intellectual instinct .
If Podhoretz were merely another old man of the chattering class , his intellectual instincts would hardly be worth pondering .
But Podhoretz , after a half - century in argument , remains fiercely relevant .
He is a senior foreign policy adviser to Republican front - runner Rudy Giuliani .
He participates in weekly conference calls with the campaign and says he is in constant contact via e-mail with the foreign policy team .
The meeting with the president was at Podhoretz ’s request .
No less a figure than Rush Limbaugh said on Wednesday , during his radio show , that Podhoretz ’s most recent book is “ a no-holds - barred , brilliant explanation of just what we face around the world , not just here in our country . ”
That book , “ World War IV : The Long Struggle Against Islamofascism , ” is not so much a study of the “ Islamofascism ” he argues Americans must fight , as it is a treatise justifying his own fight .
He indicts the foes of neoconservatism ( of which there are many ) , and defends the Bush doctrine of pre-emption ( a task few would attempt today ) .
Podhoretz sometimes seems to be the last neoconservative still in the political arena .
One of the movement ’s formative minds , Francis Fukuyama , has recanted .
Paul Wolfowitz ingloriously left the White House and was later pushed off the world stage , quite literally , after his brief stint leading the World Bank .
Dick Cheney , their consummate paleoconservative ally , has seen his influence over the president diminish .
Then there is Iraq .
If an idea is only as good as its implementation , the protracted war in Iraq has left neoconservatives struggling to prove they had a good idea .
Undeterred , Podhoretz plods onward .
He remains the unabashed hawk .
History will redeem him , Iraq and this president , Podhoretz asserts .
“ When this war ’s won — I do n’t say if , I say when ; I am uncharacteristically optimistic — what will happen is the political configuration of the entire region will be changed , ” he insisted .
“ That will involve a replacement of all the despotisms with regimes that are on the way to becoming free societies . ”
This was a characteristic neoconservative comment in 2003 , at the outset of the war in Iraq .
But Podhoretz is still saying it four years later , sitting in his Upper East Side Manhattan apartment between pictures of his grandchildren and the archives of Commentary , where he was the editor for 35 years .
The nation ’s highest civilian award , the Presidential Medal of Freedom , is framed in his living room .
Bush bestowed it in 2004 , at the very time that Democrats were attacking him for a war that was not going as advertised .
Podhoretz now finds himself defending both the rosy picture he and fellow neoconservatives painted in the run-up to war , as well as the reasons America has been involved in it longer now than World War II .
It is world war that dominates Podhoretz ’s work today .
He argues that World War III was the Cold War and that World War IV is the war on terrorism , a view echoed by the likes of Clinton - era CIA Director James Woolsey .
Only when the current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are understood as one larger conflict , Podhoretz argues , can one grasp the gravity of the struggle before the United States .
The Bush Doctrine — as he summarizes it , “ to make the Middle East safe for America by making it safe for democracy ” — puts democratization at the top of the agenda .
During the Cold War containment was the priority ; democracy was secondary .
Neoconservatives , by contrast , argue that democracy is a means to an end .
Perhaps ironically , democracy may be one of the great impediments to Podhoretz ’s getting his way .
A good portion of his book is devoted to arguing why the president should press on despite the domestic unpopularity of the war in Iraq — effectively short - circuiting democracy here in America .
He does acknowledge that after Vietnam , Americans became impatient with war , especially when it seems mismanaged and ill - conceived ( which he argues Iraq was not ) .
Still , Podhoretz says , “ We have to find a way to fight the war with the people we now are . ”
Podhoretz cannot be dismissed as an ideological outlier .
Despite a majority of Americans favoring a withdrawal from Iraq , a substantial minority subscribe to his argument that the war there is part of a larger one .
As recently as this summer , according to the Gallup Poll , 44 percent of Americans considered the war in Iraq “ to be part of the war on terrorism which began on Sept. 11 , 2001 . ”
But when he details his worldview , he severs himself from the bulk of foreign policy wonks , both conservative and liberal .
Podhoretz argues the war in Iraq has not empowered Iran .
He believes that Iraq had biological and chemical weapons , but they were likely shipped out to Syria .
And , says the man with the ear of the current and possibly next president , the war in Iraq is a success .
“ The seeds of this democratization are planted , ” as Podhoretz describes Iraq .
“ The opposition to this process of democratization turned out to be much more ferocious than anybody anticipated , including me .
So it took a while for our people to learn how to deal with it , ” he continued .
The greatest proof that Podhoretz is right , he insisted , is the very intensity of attacks in Iraq .
“ If the enemy of that process [ of democratization ] thought it was a failure , they would n’t be blowing themselves up to frustrate it or derail it , ” he argued .
“ They agree that this is not only happening , but that it is a danger to them .
They agree with Bush .
They agree with me , ” Podhoretz chuckled .
“ That ’s why they are fighting so hard . ”
The First Law of Technology says we invariably overestimate the short - term impact of new technologies while underestimating their longer - term effects .
The invention of printing in the 15th century had an extraordinary short - term impact : though scholars argue about the precise number , within 40 years of the first Gutenberg bible between eight and 24 million books , representing 30,000 titles , had been printed and published .
To those around at the time , it seemed like a pretty big deal .
' In our time ' , wrote German humanist Sebastian Brandt in 1500 , '... books have emerged in lavish numbers .
A book that once would 've belonged only to the rich - nay , to a king - can now be seen under a modest roof ...
There is nothing nowadays that our children ... fail to know . '
They did n't know the half of it .
They did n't know , for example , that Gutenberg 's technology , which enabled lay people to read and interpret the bible for themselves , would undermine the authority of the Catholic church and fuel the Reformation .
Or that it would enable the rise of modern science by facilitating the rapid and accurate dissemination of ideas .
Or create new social classes of clerks , teachers and intellectuals .
Or alter our conception of ' childhood ' as a protected early stage in the lives of young people .
In an oral culture , childhood effectively ended at the age when an individual could be regarded as a competent communicator , ie , about seven - which is why the Vatican defined that as ' the age of reason ' after which individuals could be held accountable for their sins .
In a print - based culture , communicative competence took longer to achieve and required schooling , so ' childhood ' was extended to 12 or 14 .
All these long - term impacts were not - indeed , could not have been - foreseen .
Yet they represent the profound ways in which Gutenberg 's technology transformed society .
Today 's Gutenberg is Sir Tim Berners - Lee , inventor of the web .
In the 17 years since he launched his technology on an unsuspecting world , he has transformed it .
Nobody knows how big the web is now , but estimates of the indexed part hover at around 40 billion pages , and the ' deep web ' hidden from search engines is between 400 and 750 times bigger than that .
These numbers seem as remarkable to us as the avalanche of printed books seemed to Brandt .
But the First Law holds we do n't know the half of it , and it will be decades before we have any real understanding of what Berners - Lee hath wrought .
Occasionally , we get a fleeting glimpse of what 's happening .
One was provided last week by the report of a study by the British Library and researchers at University College London .
The study ( available from tinyurl.com / 2eslnr ) combined a review of published literature on the information - seeking behaviour of young people more than 30 years with a five - year analysis of the logs of a British Library website and another popular research site that documents people 's behaviour in finding and reading information online .
The findings describe ' a new form of information - seeking behaviour ' characterised as being ' horizontal , bouncing , checking and viewing in nature .
Users are promiscuous , diverse and volatile . '
' Horizontal ' information - seeking means ' a form of skimming activity , where people view just one or two pages from an academic site then " bounce " out , perhaps never to return . '
The average times users spend on e-book and e-journal sites are very short : typically four and eight minutes respectively .
' It is clear ' , says the study , ' that users are not reading online in the traditional sense , indeed there are signs that new forms of " reading " are emerging as users " power browse " horizontally through titles , contents pages and abstracts , going for quick wins .
It almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the traditional sense . '
These findings apply to online information seekers of all ages .
The study confirms what many are beginning to suspect : that the web is having a profound impact on how we conceptualise , seek , evaluate and use information .
What Marshall McLuhan called ' the Gutenberg galaxy ' - that universe of linear exposition , quiet contemplation , disciplined reading and study - is imploding , and we do n't know if what will replace it will be better or worse .
But at least you can find the Wikipedia entry for ' Gutenberg galaxy ' in 0.34 seconds .

A queasy feeling washed over me Thursday when I turned on the television to see the Iowa Caucus results .
There was Mike Huckabee , the boy wonder ( yet , establishment hack ) who came out of nowhere ( a la Jimmy Carter ) to become the front - runner , droning on about something ( I was n’t listening ) .
And , standing strategically behind him , staring blankly into space , like a mind - controlled drone , was the actor , Chuck Norris . { *1}
As I ’m looking at the screen , wondering what the significance of the positioning is , from somewhere in the back of my mind , a voice speaks , “ The Hebrew Hammer . ”
Huh ?
Another voice tells me , “ I ’ve seen this before . ”
What is going on here ?
Since I “ woke up , ” I ’ve learned to trust my instincts when they sometimes tell me to question what I see in front of my very eyes . {* 2}
This is not “ news . ”
This is theater .
Where have I seen this before ?
Huckabee , the good ole God-fearing Southern boy , looks a bit innocent , a lot wide - eyed and a bit naive .
And , here he is on the podium , ready to begin his big adventure ( in this case , to try and receive the Republican nomination ) .
Did n’t Mark
Twain write a story about a wide - eyed naive Southern youth undertaking a big adventure ?
So , today ’s Huckleberry Finn is incarnate as the “ Christian ” Mike Huckabee , who apparently has God in his cell phone ’s address book .
I wonder what country code Mike uses to dial his “ God ? ” I ’ve got a sneaky feeling that it ’s 972 . { *3}
First of all , Mike Huckabee is not a Christian .
He is a Christian Zionist .
What is a Christian Zionist ?
Well , it ’s a complicated topic , but it goes back to when the plans for the creation of the state of Israel were first being drafted by the British Zionists ( late 1800 ’s ) .
{* 4} Taking ancestral lands from the Arabs through armed force [ i.e. , murder ] and then expecting a survivable Jewish state would be an impossibility , unless you could guarantee that the world ’s premier superpower would back it unconditionally .
That world power would be the United States of America .
The dilemma was , how does one get a nation of Christians , who at the time , considered Jews to be the “ killers / betrayers of Christ , ” to support the future state of Israel .
First , you ’d have to create a movement to reinterpret the Bible in a manner telling Christians they were obligated to die for “ God ’s chosen people . ”
Enter the Scofield Bible [ “ written ” by Cyrus Scofield , who ’d been serving time in Missouri for forgery ] .
Enter the rise of Christian Evagelist movement ( expanded greatly via tele - evangelism ) .
Mike Huckabee is an end product of that movement .
Now , back to Chuck Norris .
Who is Chuck Norris ?
Well , officially , the story goes he was a martial arts champion , turned actor , turned Christian writer .
He ’s got a tough guy image and a whole series of pathetic one - liner jokes dedicated to that personage .
But , as we should know well by now , the media propaganda machine can turn anyone into anything .
He ’s made quite a few movies which portray Arabs as a bunch of subhuman nut - jobs , that Norris comes along to kick the crap out of .
A critical mind may [ should ] wonder who benefits from demonizing Arabs in the American mind .
On it ’s own , that still does n’t mean anything .
He ’s apparently written a few Christian books , so surely , he must be a Christian .
A check on Wikipedia reveals nothing to counter this ( but , anyone who ’s spent any amount of time researching anything knows that Wikipedia is an utterly suspect source ) .
Trying to dig deeper , we find a few rumors that his real name is Daniel Goldberg and how he ’s been seen wearing a “ chai ” around his neck .
Still , a little nebulous until we learn that even his own biography boasts of his receiving the “ Jewish Humanitarian of the Year ” award .
Aside :
Using deductive reasoning , it would be safe to conclude that not only is Chuck a phony Christian , but that he is also a phony Patriot .
Now we ’re getting somewhere .
So , why would Norris hide his Jewish roots ?
I ’m sure were we to ask his publicist , we ’d get the same old true tired tale we hear from so many other Jewish celebrities who ’ve adopted non-ethnic sounding names : because they did n’t want to have “ antisemitism ” ruin their prospects when their career was starting .
Does any living person [ note : brain - dead does not mean living ] actually still believe that yarn ?
As if looking at any list of Who ’s Who in Hollywood would lead anyone to deduce that Jews were in any way excluded .
So , this begs the question .
Why would this “ devoutly ” Christian tough guy try to hide that he is Jewish ?
Why would he throw his weight behind Mike Huckabee .
Perhaps , because Chuck Norris is also a Christian Zionist ?
Alas , seeing these two “ actors ” on the Iowa stage together makes a lot of sense .
The Christian Zionist , standing next to the Christian Zionist .
The tough guy standing behind the small kid [ Huckabee does look a little too much like the scared little boy in the schoolyard does n’t he ? ] .
But , again , other than “ the show , ” so far I ’ve discovered nothing to let us think that something truly insidious is afoot here .
That is , until , we try to figure out Mike Huckabee ’s sudden rise from “ Mr. No Chance ” to “ Mr. Front Runner . ”
As I heard a host on Oracle Broadcasting say on a radio show Friday , a win in Iowa was crucial for the Huckabee campaign , because now they can generate “ real ” support from him , solely by relying on the “ follow the winner ” mentality demonstrated by general public .
How many New England Patriots “ fans ” does one encounter these days , compared to a few years ago ?
So , is there anything about the Iowa caucus that may explain Huckabee ’s unexpected success ?
Well , the vote was tallied by a company named Elron Electronics .
Would it surprise anyone to learn Elron is an Israeli defense firm ? {* 5 } Why is an Israeli defense company counting the votes in an American primary ?
The story on stage is now complete .
It ’s an old tale , but still makes for good theater .
The little boy , Huckleberry Finn , overcoming great odds .
The Hebrew Hammer , a not so smart , but tough guy who chooses to protect him ( a la My Bodyguard ) .
Should Fritz Springmeier be correct about the extent of these programs into politics and “ entertainment , ” then it ’d be a safe bet that Chuck is thus a [ mind - controlled ] slave , fait accompli .
And alas , no tale can be told without an narrator , so let ’s not forget Elron after the curtain is lifted at the end of the show .

August Ferdinand Mobius a 19th century German mathematician and astronomer found that by joining the two ends of a piece of paper together to form a loop BUT twisting the ends before they were joined a continuous loop of only one side was formed .
With the Grandmother paradox we essentially have a time with a Grandmother and a time without .
Also if you follow the description in quotes at the top of this page it appears that one follows the other and loops back to the beginning .
We can use the Mobius Strip and adapt it to show a possible interpretation of how Time is twisted in the Grandmother paradox .
This is difficult to show on a two - dimensional computer screen or paper so you will need to construct one by printing out the diagram below .
You will need scissors , sticky tape and glue .
Follow the instructions and then read the description that follows below .
Description Starting at point A in 1960 the Grandmother is 40 .
Move to the right through the twentieth century to 1990 when the Grandmother dies at 70 .
Then in 1999 the Time Traveller makes his trip to 1930 and kills his Grandmother .
Follow along moving to the right again through the twentieth century noticing how this time there is no Grandmother and continue all the way to 1999 .
This time there is no time trip because there is no time traveller .
He was not born because his Grandmother did not exist
So he could not kill his Grandmother so she does exist and she is 10 .
Move to the right again through the twentieth century back to point A in 1960 where the Grandmother is 40 .
And so on ......
It is interesting to note that the times at any one place on the loop are the same on both sides  or times  and that the arrow of time shown in the centre is always pointing in the same direction .
Perhaps this is one way of showing how Time itself could be twisted  in a higher dimension when it comes to time travelling and is able to cope with any so - called paradox .
Then whether this Mobius Time Loop is in fact a single universe or that each side is a parallel universe splitting at the time travel trip is perhaps something to discuss later .
If you have any comments on the above I would be very interested to hear them .
Perhaps other paradoxes can be shown by using this Mobius Time Loop .

( CNN ) -- Georgia televangelist Creflo Dollar is refusing to turn over any more financial documents to the Senate Finance Committee , even though they are overdue .
Creflo Dollar says if Sen. Charles Grassley wants more information , he 'll have to subpoena him to testify .
Last month , the committee 's ranking Republican , Sen. Charles Grassley , asked Dollar and five other TV and megachurch preachers to provide him detailed reports on how they 're spending billions of dollars in church donations .
He wants to make sure their ministries are n't violating their tax - exempt status by spending church donations on personal luxuries .
Five of the six ministries have either turned over documents or asked Grassley for more time , which the senator readily agreed to give them .
But Dollar and his World Changers Church have refused , and he 's hired a lawyer .
He said if Grassley wants more information he 'll have to subpoena him to testify before the committee .
The Iowa senator is surprised by Dollar 's ultimatum .
" If he sticks to his guns , " Grassley said , " this will be the first nonprofit that I know of that has n't cooperated with us over the last five or six years . "
Watch why Dollar does n't want to turn over the documents »
In November , Dollar told CNN that his church was not in violation of any tax laws .
" We 've always said at the very beginning we have no problems if it's a valid request , " Dollar said .
" And , you know , we comply with the IRS . "
Dollar is making no apologies for living in a $ 2.5 million mansion in Georgia , driving a church - bought Rolls Royce and having access to a luxury Manhattan apartment .
He said the church owns some of his luxury items and he bought the rest with his own money .
Dollar also told CNN he did turn over some documents to Grassley 's office and was confident they would be sufficient .
According to the Atlanta Journal - Constitution , one of those documents spelled out how much money the church raked in last year : $ 69 million .
Again , Dollar makes no apologies .
His prosperity ministry preaches a form of Word of Faith theology , which teaches God wants the faithful to have the best in life , including material things .
He said Grassley is sticking his nose where it does n't belong -- in church doctrine .
Grassley strongly objects to that sentiment .
" For the focus of this inquiry , ministries are the same as any other nonprofit organization , " he said .
" It 's a question of abiding by tax laws . "
Rusty Leonard , who runs an online citizen 's watchdog group , Ministrywatch.com , is on Grassley 's side .
He said Dollar 's church should be transparent so donors know how their money is being spent .
He said Dollar should be happy to comply with Grassley 's request , unless he has something to hide .
" I guess , looking at it from their perspective , they could potentially go into Grassley 's confessional and end up walking out in handcuffs , " Leonard said .
" So they have to be very careful about what they release . "
Grassley , so far , is n't threatening Dollar with a subpoena , but he did n't rule it out either .
He said he 's used it in the past to great effect .
Here 's how the other minstries have responded to requests for accounting , according to Grassley 's office :
Kenneth and Gloria Copeland ( Kenneth Copeland Ministries ) : Attorneys delivered material to Grassley 's staff on Thursday .
Benny Hinn ( World Healing Center Church , Inc. ) : Grassley 's staff is scheduled to meet with the ministry 's attorneys on Friday .
Eddie Long ( New Birth Missionary Baptist Church Ministry ) : Representatives said publicly that the ministry will cooperate .
Grassley has not received any material or had contact from the ministry .
Joyce Meyer ( Joyce Meyer Ministries ) : Grassley 's staff received material from the organization on Tuesday and is reviewing it .
Randy and Paula White ( Without Walls International Church Today ) : Received initial contact from attorneys who said they will contact Grassley 's staff shortly but has had no further response .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Just when you thought it was over , trouble in the $ 2.3 trillion bond - insurance business could trigger another wave of big write - downs from banks and brokerage firms , experts said Friday .
Leading bond insurers Ambac Financial ABK , and MBIA Inc. MBI , - 4.41 % look increasingly likely to lose their AAA ratings .
While almost unthinkable just six months ago , such concerns are also causing turmoil in the $ 2.5 trillion municipal - bond market .
Bond insurers agree to pay principal and interest when due in a timely manner in the event of a default -- a $ 2.3 trillion business that offers a credit - rating boost to municipalities and other issuers that do n't have AAA ratings .
Without those top ratings , their business models may be imperiled .
A more worrying consideration is that when a bond insurer is downgraded , all the securities it has guaranteed are , in theory , downgraded as well .
“ ' The destruction of the bond insurers would likely bring write - downs at major banks and financial institutions that would put current write - downs to shame . ' ” — Tamara Kravec , Banc of America Securities
If Ambac and MBIA lose their top ratings , billions of dollars of muni bonds will be downgraded , and the guarantees that have been sold on mortgage - related securities such as collateralized debt obligations , or CDOs , will lose value .
Bond insurers guarantee roughly $ 1.4 trillion worth of muni bonds and more than $ 600 billion of structured finance securities , such as mortgage - backed securities and CDOs , according to Standard & Poor's .
Ambac alone has guaranteed about $ 67 billion of CDOs .
" The destruction of the bond insurers would likely bring write - downs at major banks and financial institutions that would put current write - downs to shame , " Tamara Kravec , an analyst at Banc of America Securities , wrote in a note Friday .
Kravec cut her rating on Ambac and MBIA on Friday because she thinks that ratings downgrades are " highly probable " now .
Indeed , Fitch Ratings cut Ambac's AAA rating to AA on Friday , becoming the first major agency to take that step .
Fitch downgraded 137,390 muni bond issues and 114 other securities guaranteed by Ambac soon after .
Merrill Lynch & Co. MER , +27.69 % took a $ 3.1 billion write - down on Thursday related to the firm 's CDO hedges .
Merrill had bought CDO guarantees from bond insurers including ACA Capital , a smaller player that 's now struggling to survive .
Most of the write - downs were related to ACA .
See full story .
CIBC CM , - 1.44 % and French banking giant Credit Agricole unveiled similar write - downs in December , related to guarantees they bought from ACA .
See story on ACA troubles .
' Whopping '
But ACA is much smaller than Ambac and MBIA .
If the two larger bond insurers are downgraded , banks and brokers that have bought guarantees from them may have to write - down their exposures further .
Merrill has net CDO exposure of $ 4.8 billion .
But that includes a lot of hedging , mainly through guarantees bought from bond insurers .
Excluding those hedges , the brokerage firm still has a " whopping " $ 30.4 billion of CDOs on its balance sheet , Brad Hintz , an analyst at Bernstein Research , noted on Friday .
" We remain very uncomfortable with Merrill 's CDO balance sheet exposure , " the analyst wrote in a note to investors .
" If the counterparties are downgraded , and they cannot post additional collateral , we would expect that Merrill Lynch would have to take a valuation reserve against that specific exposure . "
Citigroup C , - 2.12 % set aside $ 900 million during the fourth quarter to cover heightened credit risks related to counterparties it uses to hedge CDO risks .
Muni bond turmoil
The impact on the muni - bond market may be just as big , experts said Friday .
There are $ 2.5 trillion to $ 3 trillion of muni bonds .
Roughly half of those are insured by bond , or " monoline , " insurers like Ambac and MBIA .
So more than $ 1 trillion of muni bonds are now in danger of being downgraded .
That could trigger losses for muni-bond investors .
" Assuming the " monoline " insurers lose their triple - A ratings , underlying insured muni bonds could be susceptible to downgrades and downward repricing , leading to losses for muni- bond mutual funds , " Michael Kim , an analyst at Sandler O'Neill , told investors in a note Friday .
Shares of big muni- bond fund managers , including Franklin Resources BEN , - 0.79 % and Eaton Vance EV , - 0.83 % have already been hit by such concerns , Kim said .
Franklin stock has slumped 22 % so far this year ; Eaton Vance is off 27 % .
Information vacuum
Most muni bonds insured by Ambac and MBIA are now trading as if there is n't any insurance , Richard Larkin , a municipal - trading desk analyst at JB Hanauer & Co. , commented Friday .
" The market has lost all faith in bond insurance and the ratings agencies , " he said .
" Prices are being discounted because people wonder whether there is any value to the insurance . "
That 's a big problem , because there are no official ratings for many of the underlying issuers of muni bonds , such as cities , school districts and utilities , he added .
When municipalities sold debt , they asked agencies like S&P and Moody 's to evaluate the securities with bond insurance attached .
“ ' The market has lost all faith in bond insurance and the ratings agencies .
Prices are being discounted because people wonder whether there is any value to the insurance . ' ” — Richard Larkin , JB Hanauer & Co .
If the insurance on this debt becomes less valuable , muni bond investors have few ways of checking the new creditworthiness of the issuer , Larkin said .
That 's creating an " information vacuum " because the rating agencies are n't going to re-evaluate muni bond issuers unless the municipalities request and pay for new analysis , he said .
" The lack of public underlying ratings on insured debt is a big problem , and if more bond insurers are downgraded , the rating agencies are not likely to fill the vacuum and publish underlying ratings unless they are paid additional fees to do so , " Larkin explained .
" Trades are being made based on people 's best guesses of the creditworthiness of issuers , " he added .
" And if these downgrades happen , that will be the environment going forward .
Not a good one . "
The government 's legal arguments justifying the detention of hundreds of people at the Guantánamo Bay naval base have been repudiated three times by the U.S. Supreme Court .
But it 's not just outsiders who take issue with the U.S. Justice Department strategy :
Up to one fourth of the department 's own civil appellate staff has recently opted out of handling the government 's cases against detainee appeals , two sources familiar with the matter tell U.S. News .
These conscientious objectors — their exact number is not known — have decided not to take part in the government 's litigation against the detainees because of disagreements with the legal approach , these sources say .
They would not elaborate on the specific reasons for the objections , but critics have long objected to the government 's failure to formally charge detainees and have pushed for closing Guantánamo because of allegations of torture and inhumane conditions .
Defense lawyers also contend that the government has stymied their cases by withholding documents and curbing client access .
The quiet rebellion has emerged in recent months among the approximately 56 attorneys in the appellate section of the Justice Department 's civil division following a court ruling in February that placed the defense of the approximately 130 remaining Guantánamo cases under the responsibility of the appellate lawyers .
More than 300 men captured shortly after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 are still being held at Guantánamo over alleged ties to terrorists , although all but a handful have never been formally charged with crimes .
Though the objectors have created some tension among the appellate staff , it 's unclear that their opposition has hampered the government 's efforts — especially because the court ruling will be reviewed by the Supreme Court this term .
But the staff attorneys ' objections highlight how dissension has grown even within the department 's own ranks .
Justice Department spokesperson Charles Miller declined comment .
The Justice Department has no formal policy allowing attorneys to opt out of certain cases , unlike some law firms that make clear they wo n't penalize associates who , for instance , choose not to defend tobacco companies .
But , informally , attorneys have rejected certain types of cases .
Most famously , in 1982 , then Deputy Solicitor General Lawrence Wallace signed off on a brief in Bob Jones University v. United States but in a footnote noted his opposition to the department 's position .
The argument went against an Internal Revenue Service policy that denied tax - exempt status to institutions that discriminated by race .
The government 's treatment of the Guantánamo detainees has a troubled legal history .
The Justice Department initially denied the detainees any legal rights , arguing that the federal courts had no jurisdiction over foreigners captured overseas and held on the base in Cuba .
But in 2004 , the Supreme Court ruled that the federal courts had the obligation to hear petitions challenging the detainees ' detention because Guantánamo Bay is controlled by the U.S. military .
In an effort to block a flood of litigation , Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act in December 2005 , barring cases challenging detainees ' detention — habeas corpus petitions — from the federal courts .
But in 2006 , the Supreme Court ruled that the law did not apply to cases that had already been filed .
That left a slew of petitions in the federal courts .
The ruling also threw out the White House 's newly created military commission system because it did not comply with the Geneva Conventions .
Congress tried to stanch the litigation once again in October 2006 with the Military Commissions Act , which banned all habeas petitions by Guantánamo detainees .
But it allowed them to file more narrow challenges of their status as enemy combatants — only in the more conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit .
The detainees tried to challenge the law , but in February a divided three - judge panel on the D.C. Circuit ruled against them , effectively moving all detainee litigation into the D.C. Circuit and into the hands of the civil appellate lawyers .
IronPython is a great way to use the .NET framework .
It comes packed full of Python dynamic goodness .
Unfortunately it is n't perfect .
One noteworthy hole in the IronPython .NET integration is attributes .
You ca n't use attributes in IronPython , which can sometime be a problem .
IronPython and .NET Attributes With Python you can create new classes at runtime , modify them , and even switch out their __class__ or __bases__ attributes .
This makes them very different to C# classes .
IronPython class is actually a .NET object rather than a true class .
This means that you can't treat IronPython classes as .NET classes , and you can't ( yet ) use attributes .
One way round this would be to use the Reflection .
Emit API ( on which IronPython is built ) .
There is a good codeproject article giving an introoduction to the subject , but that piece of magic will have to be the subject of another IronPython article .
This article is about an alternative approach - dynamically generating and compiling C# .
The normal way round this problem is to create stub C# classes with methods that you can override in IronPython .
This does n't always work though ; sometimes you want to dynamically specify the arguments to the attributes - which can only be done at compile time with C# .
This article explores a way round the problem , with a solution that potentially has many other uses .
It provides a way to dynamically compile C# source code into assemblies .
These assemblies can be used in memory or saved to disk .
President Bush compared Nancy Pelosi to his mother
The President 's jokes
" A year ago my approval rating was in the 30s , my nominee for the Supreme Court had just withdrawn , and my vice - president had shot someone .
" Ah , those were the good ol ' days , " he said , to applause from the audience .
Journalists were also treated to a Karl Rove rap at the meal where presidential self - deprecation is the tradition .
' Hurt ' Cheney
Mr Bush began his speech at the Radio and Television Correspondents '
Association dinner in Washington by thanking the association for providing the food and " Senator Webb for providing security " .
A senior aide working for Jim Webb - a Democratic senator from Virginia - was arrested this week as he was caught carrying a loaded handgun into the Capitol building .
I have to admit we really blew the way we let those attorneys go .
You know you 've botched it when people sympathise with lawyers
President George W Bush
" He 's had a rough few weeks .
To be honest , his feelings were kind of hurt .
He said he was going on vacation to Afghanistan , where people like him , " he said , alluding to a recent visit to Afghanistan by Mr Cheney in which he was targeted by a suicide bomber .
Using a deadpan delivery style to good effect , Mr Bush spoke of the controversy surrounding the firing of eight federal prosecutors working at the Department of Justice .
" I have to admit we really blew the way we let those attorneys go , " he said .
" You know you 've botched it when people sympathise with lawyers . "
Pop - up book plan
One of the biggest laughs came when the president spoke of plans for his post - White House memoir - he said that former President Bill Clinton had written a 10,000 page - long tome .
" I 'm thinking of something really fun and creative for mine , " he said .
" You know , maybe a pop - up book . "
He asked the audience which title they liked best - " How Dubbya Got His Groove Back " , " Who Moved My Presidency ? " or " Tuesday with Cheney " .
MC Karl Rove shows his moves
Nodding to Nancy Pelosi , sitting at the head of the top table , Mr Bush said he had wondered how he would get along with the Democratic House Speaker when she took over as the first woman to run the House of Representatives :
" Some say she 's bossy , she 's opinionated , she 's not to be crossed , " the president said .
" But hey , I get along with my mother . "
Looking out across the room packed with journalists and their guests , Mr Bush pointed out that presidential hopeful Barack Obama had chosen not to attend .
" Not enough press , " the president joked .
Mr Bush 's appearance at the black - tie dinner , which is attended by media personalities , celebrities and politicians , continues a tradition begun by President Calvin Coolidge in 1924 .
As part of the evening 's entertainment , comedians Colin Mochrie and Brad Sherwood from the US TV show Whose Line is it Anyway got White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove to join in a rap song poking fun at Mr Rove 's hobbies : stamp collecting and quail hunting .
Shouting out " I'm MC Rove " , Mr Rove danced about the stage and postured like a rap star , much to the delight of the watching press .
Howdy ,
Without the insights of good pop psychology , I cannot fathom how my neighbor is n’t wracked with shame every second of his miserable life .
Because he truly is a Grade A asshole .
It ’s not just me .
Six other neighbors , on all sides , hate this guy ’s guts with varying levels of passion ( cuz he harshes everyone ’s mellow and disrupts the groove of the cul - de - sac ) .
The Homeowner ’s Association regularly slams him with fines ( cuz he thinks he ’s above the rules ) .
And I ’m never surprised to see cop cars parked in his driveway .
I could go on , but you get the idea .
The dude ’s obviously a low - life scum , living among people who just want peace and quiet .
If I was him , I ’d immediately sign up for industrial - strength therapy , and maybe start a brisk program of frequent self - flagellation as punishment .
But I ’m not him .
I ’m someone else , looking at him with utter bafflement , because I cannot understand how he can live with himself , being such an asshole .
Yet , using the simplest basics of psychology … I “ get ” it .
And “ getting ” it makes me both a better story - teller , and a better marketer .
It ’s really very straightforward : In Mr. A - hole ’s mind , he ’s a great guy .
Misunderstood , prone to accidents that could happen to anyone , a smidgen too quick to get angry about stuff that anyone would get pissed off about .
He has a whole menu of excellent reasons that — in his mind — explain everything he does in a way that makes him either totally forgiven and excused … or the victim of unpreventable circumstances .
He has rationalized his behavior so that he ’s the good guy at the center of his world .
And no amount of incoming data that challenges that rationalization will change anything .
The dude is bottled up tight .
Certain of his own righteousness .
Serial killers think like this .
Politicians , too .
Also thieves , social outcasts , actors , perverts and scamsters .
And you , too .
And me .
And everyone you market to .
It ’s part of being human .
Now , you and I may also have some redeeming traits , like a code of behavior that prevents us from hurting other people or avoiding doing the right thing ( or parking half on a neighbor ’s lawn ) .
We are , in fact , a roiling pot of conflicting and battling emotions , urges , habits , learned behaviors and unconscious drives .
Every day , if we ’re lucky , the mixture remains mostly balanced and does n’t explode or morph into something toxic .
But it ’s all in there .
And it ’s all fighting for supremacy .
The book ‘ How To Win Friends And Influence People ” , by Dale Carnegie , is called the salesman ’s bible because of a simple tactic that works like crazy .
That tactic : Learn to walk a mile in another man ’s shoes before judging him .
Or sizing him up .
This tactic does NOT come with our default settings as humans .
You gotta learn it .
Once you ’ve been around very small children , you realize how deeply ingrained our selfish desires are .
We excuse them in kids , but strive to civilize the little terrors by corraling those desires into submission .
Takes a while .
People who grow up without that kind of mentoring can be hard to deal with .
Some special cases — those blessed with an endless supply of sociopathic charm — can still make it work , and live lives of selfish abandon .
Good for them .
But most of us realize that we gotta share the sandbox with others , and that means sublimating our greedy ape - urges most of the time .
Still , if you ’re gonna be a great salesman , you gotta become a great student of human nature … and notice , catalog , understand , and USE insights like this .
So when you tell a story , it ’s easy to figure out what the listener needs to hear to stay interested .
When you sell something , it ’s easy to know how to incite desire , because you know what people want ( which is almost always NOT what you want them to want ) .
And when you ’re approaching prospects cold — cuz they do n’t know who you are — you are able to quickly discern who THEY are , and adjust your tactics accordingly .
But you cannot attain this state of understanding human behavior … without experiencing all the different parts of human behavior out there .
Okay , you do n’t want to experience everything .
People do some truly disgusting and repulsive stuff that is beyond the boudaries of acceptable experience for the rest of us .
But within reason , you at least need to learn how to walk in another person ’s shoes for a mile .
( That ’s supposed to be an old American - Indian saying , a take - off on the Judeo - Christian “ golden rule ” of treating others as you would be treated yourself . )
It helps to understand basic psychology .
It ’s probably out of print , but the old best seller “ I ’m Okay , You ’re Okay ” ( which is about transactional psychology , but never mind that part ) lays out a pretty good start for rookies .
Once you see a few examples of how your thinking on a matter may not jive with the other guy ’s thinking … you ’ll have the seeds of understanding how to delineate what those differences are , and how they affect your relationship .
It ’s really not that tough , once you get wet .
Basically , the bottom line of understanding human behavior is all about accepting the reality of the situation .
Yes , he ’s an asshole , according to your rules .
But in his rule book , you ’re probably the asshole .
If you insist on not allowing his viewpoint to exist , there will be blood .
In marketing , if you do n’t learn to understand how other people see you and your efforts to sell , there will be no sale .
It ’s tough to walk in another dude ’s shoes even if you LIKE him .
Think of your best friend .
His taste in clothes is abysmal , he insists on wearing his hair in a stupid style , he watches bad television shows , and eats horrible crap .
Yet , somehow you overlook these things , and get along .
The challenge , as a marketer , is to suck up your distaste for people who do n’t share your worldview … and be a chameleon .
That ’s the lizard that blends in with any background ( except plaid — we used to try to make the little lizards explode by placing psychedelic prints on the bottom of their cage ) .
( Does n’t work , in case you ’re wondering . )
You do n’t have to compromise your cherished beliefs , or alter your own worldview .
( Unless you discover you should . )
Just understand that there are more complex personality tweaks in the people around you than there are stars in the sky .
And your job , as a marketer , is to understand that the person you ’re selling stuff to may need all sorts of weird , twisted info or soothing advice or whatever to make a buying decision .
It ’s not hard , once you learn how to walk a mile in other people ’s shoes … and then DO it , on a regular basis .
And you gotta do it even with the assholes around you .
I still loathe my neighbor , but I can’t really hate him .
He ’s infuriating , but the real reason he pisses everyone off … is that he ’s just not good at social interaction .
HE cannot walk three feet in someone else ’s shoes , has no clue what that would accomplish anyway , and lives in such a tight little box that he ’s really just a walking prison of discomfort and exitential anguish .
I still wish he ’d move , though .
Anyway …
Here ’s a little task for you : Identify a trait in someone around you … that irks you no end .
( Maybe humming off - key , or always being late , or telling boring stories . )
And spend a few minutes seeing that behavior from the inside .
Become , for a moment , that guy .
Walk a mile in his shoes , and rationalize how you feel .
You do n’t need to adopt the trait , or learn to “ like ” it .
Just understand it .
Get hip to the way the other guy has come to terms with himself .
This is powerful knowledge .
This is how top marketers move through the world , with deep personal insight to how other humans get through their day .
I ’d love to hear , in the comments section , what you discover when you do this task .
Stay frosty ,
John Carlton

Fighting Them In Iraq , So We Do n’t Have To Fight Them Here
This says it all :
French web survey company XiTi Monitor has published Firefox market share statistics for 2007 , which indicate that the open - source web browser is continuing to see gains at the expense of Internet Explorer , particularly in Europe .
XiTi 's breakdown of monthly Firefox market share gains for the past year show that the browser climbed from about 20 percent two years ago to 23.1 percent in December 2006 to a record 28 percent in December 2007 .
Firefox market share hit a plateau and hovered around 27.7 percent between June and September before taking a 0.7 percent drop in October , but then recovered prior to reaching 28 percent last month .
XiTi also provides market share statistics for 32 individual European countries .
Finland currently has the highest Firefox market share in Europe with 45.4 percent , followed by Slovenia with 44.6 percent and Poland with 42.4 percent .
In December alone , Internet Explorer fell to 66.1 percent in Europe after losing 0.9 percent market share .
During the same time period , Firefox gained 0.7 percent .
The statistics show that Safari currently has only 2 percent market share in Europe .
Data source : XiTi Monitor
XiTi also provides some insight into adoption rates of recent versions .
Less than half of all Internet Explorer users are running Internet Explorer 7 rather than earlier versions , whereas 93 percent of Firefox users are running Firefox 2 .
Firefox market share by country ( percent ) ; Data source : XiTi Monitor
Firefox 's continued success in Europe may undermine some of the arguments made by Norwegian browser maker Opera in an antitrust complaint filed against Microsoft in December of last year .
Opera accused Microsoft of abusing its dominant position in the web browser market by tying Internet Explorer to Windows .
Earlier this month , the EU decided to open an investigation against Microsoft in response .
Firefox adoption is likely encouraged by the perception of superior security and the availability of extensions and other user - driven enhancements .
Firefox 's current market share growth rate was decent in Europe in 2007 , but the official release of Firefox 3 ( which is currently in beta stage ) could potentially incite more significant market share increases in 2008 .
What is TypoHound ?
Many eBay auctions contain typos in the listing title .
For example , ' Samsung ' may be spelt ' Samung ' .
This means that when someone searches for ' Samsung ' , the misspelled auction is not shown .
Thus no bids are placed on it .
TypoHound generates common misspellings of the keyword you enter .
Few people can find these auctions to bid on , so you can bag incredible bargains !
5 Intriguing Studies of Human - Dog Psychology
• Next article in this series : • Previous article : Stop Staring at Me !
Do owners look like their dogs ?
Do we think they understand us ?
And more fascinating questions …
1 . Is talking to a dog like talking to a baby ?
Are these people talking to their babies or their dogs :
“ Coochie - coochie - coooo ! ”
“ Who ’s a clever little boy ? ”
“ Oh my God , the living room carpet is ruined ! ”
Difficult to tell right ?
So Mitchell ( 2001 ) thought , which is why he decided to compare how people talk to infants with how they talk to dogs .
He found both similarities and differences :
Similarities : high - pitched voice , repetitive use of grammatically acceptable words , present - tense verbs .
Differences : Dog - talk involved shorter sentences and more orders while baby - talk included more questions .
Which all raises the question of whether we ’re treating our babies like dogs or our dogs like babies .
Either way , the authors point out the main problem in talking to both babies and dogs is it “ involve [s ] communicating with a limited and inattentive addressee . ”
I think that ’s a bit harsh on dogs .
2 . Do we think dogs understand us ?
What with all that baby - talk going on , you ’d think that dogs would pick up the odd word or two .
To examine people ’s perceptions of their dog ’s understanding Pongracz , Miklosi and Csanyi ( 2001 ) gave Hungarian dog - owners a questionnaire .
It asked them to rate the types of utterances they thought their dogs could understand .
Top of the list came questions , followed by permissions and information giving .
It seems these dogs are regular little Lassies .
But what proof is there that they really understand ?
Well , we can only tell by how the dog responds .
So , next the authors asked dog - owners how often their dogs demonstrated understanding by obeying a command .
Our hardy Hungarian dog - owners reckoned :
Dogs obeyed 31 % of the time under all circumstances .
Dogs obeyed 53 % of the time when the context was right
Seems pretty high to me .
Or perhaps Hungarian dogs are very smart .
3 . Are dogs ice - breakers ?
Even if dogs ca n’t understand what we ’re saying they ’re still fantastic props for starting conversations .
When taking a dog for a walk , you ca n’t help getting chatting to people .
OK , so you ’re mainly apologising to parents as your dog mauls their children , but at least its social contact , right ?
The evidence for this one is provided by Rogers , Hart and Boltz ( 1993 ) in an observational study of elderly dog walkers .
They found dog owners have more conversations in which , surprise surprise , they often talked about their dogs .
Not only that , but dog owners tended to report higher satisfaction with their emotional , social and physical states .
So not only do dogs start conversations , they may also make you healthier .
4 . Do dogs resemble their owners ?
I recently covered a study finding that couples come to resemble each other facially over time .
So what about dogs and their owners ?
There are a few studies on this – well actually there ’s three academic articles and just one study .
a. Roy and Christenfeld ( 2004 ) find that , yes , dogs do resemble their owners , but only if they ’re purebreds – that ’s the dogs now , not the owners .
So , the old chestnut is true .
Hooray !
b. Levine ( 2005 ) , reanalysing the data collected in the first study , say no – there ’s problems with Roy and Christenfeld ’s ( 2004 ) study .
This means we ca n’t yet be sure purebred dogs resemble their owners .
A new study is required .
Booo .
c. The authors of the original study say yes their original study was correct ( Roy & Christenfeld , 2005 ) .
Hooray !
( I think ? )
The world still awaits the conclusion …
5 . Is it wrong to eat your dog ?
Dog lovers : look away now .
Cat lovers : sharpen your knives .
Haidt , Koller & Dias ( 1993 ) wanted to find out how culture affects the way we moralise about different types of behaviours using fictional stories .
One story participants were told goes like this :
“ A family ’s dog was killed by a car in front of their house .
They had heard that dog meat was delicious , so they cut up the dog ’s body and cooked it and ate it for dinner . ”
Then they ’re asked if the dog - chomping family should be stopped .
Turns out the answer you give depends on your culture and socioeconomic status .
If you live in the US and you ’re well off you ’re likely to agree that eating your dog may be disgusting but seeing as it is n’t harmful , should n’t be stopped .
On the other hand , if you ’re a poor US citizen , or you live in Brazil , you ’re much more likely to moralise and think the dog- chompers should be stopped in their tracks .

An Arizona woman who wanted to take her 1 - year - old conjoined twin daughters on a cross-country flight to visit relatives was frustrated because she was told she'd have to buy an extra seat .
Mandy Bailey says Atlanta - based Delta Air Lines originally told her she must buy an extra seat because both children need access to an oxygen mask in case of an emergency .
Delta officials also suggested that Bailey contact the American Red Cross to see if it would pay for it .
But Delta officials changed their mind Wednesday and said an extra ticket would n't be needed for the twins .
The twins are joined at the chest and share a heart .
The girls each have their own lungs .

After analyzing the overall structure we can now begin to look at the movie in detail .
This part of the series will analyze the first 16 minutes of 2001 : A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick .
( Note : All images are copyright Metro Goldwyn Mayer ( MGM ) and used solely for the purpose of analyzing 2001 )
( Another note : as stated in the introduction part of this series , this analysis will work almost solely on certain images or moments .
Therefore it is written in a purely linear way , from the beginning of the movie to the end and might therefore be not the usual film analysis you find on the net )
The first part of the chapter “ The Dawn of Man ” can be seen as one of the most unusual beginning of a movie ever printed on film .
Not only are we greeted with a bunch of apes after a wonderful tune of music , but also we hear no dialogue or anything that would describe what is happening on screen .
Some might say this start is boring and useless but for the story of 2001 it is essential .
After the MGM logo disappears we are treated with the first moment of 2001 :
We see a view of space or , to be more precise , a view of earth , behind it the sun and partly covered by the moon .
Now this first minute seemingly does n’t need to be analyzed because this scene is the introduction of the movie and its title .
But in fact it is more than that .
If you know the ending , you can say that the beginning of 2001 we see is the point of view of the entity .
This factor is being stressed by the music because it is the same we hear in the end , “ Also Sprach Zarathustra ” .
Therefore , the beginning we see is in fact the ending and all that follows afterwards in 2001 is the telling of everything up to this moment .
And since the story began four million years ago , Stanley Kubrick takes us there .
If you watch Horror Movies or Thriller you know this story device since it is used quite regularly in the industry although no one might ever have used such a “ subtle ” ending at the beginning .
( Another note : 2001 might also be counted as one of the very few movies that span such a long timeframe for its telling )
After the title with its music we are taken right into the beginning of everything , or “ The Dawn of Man ” :
Kubrick takes the title literally and shows us the dawn of a new day on earth that is to say a large unfriendly place on earth which might be located somewhere in Africa .
The following shots enhance the feeling that we are in a dangerous and deserted place ( quite the contrary to the mystical eden ) as Kubrick shows some bones of animals and apes ( which are not buried ) , before cutting to the actual apes :
This sequence not only shows that the apes are not being feared by the tapirs ( some of the apes are even being “ ridiculed ” by them ) but it also introduces us to a very important motif we will encounter many times again for the rest of the movie : food and eating .
As you can see , the apes are at the beginning of the journey by being shown eating plants , one might consider the most basic way of eating and surviving as it rather easy to pick them .
Kubrick even goes one step further by contrasting the eating of the apes with the eating of carnivores : an ape is getting killed by a leopard .
It is interesting to note that for this scene Kubrick managed to add a glow in the leopard ’s eyes .
This stresses the feeling that carnivores are dangerous , perhaps even demonic or supernatural for the apes , in every case more powerful .
Moreover this scene introduces another important motif in 2001 : Death and Killing .
This is not only shown by the actual killing but also by the bones which are placed all over in this setting .
The death motif here is shown in a rather “ basic ” form compared to the deaths in the later parts of the movie .
This time it is “ simply ” a killing to eat and therefore to survive .
But since the ape does n’t yet understand this concept , the leopard gets this demonic appearance .
This glow might also be some sort of hint Kubrick added for the audience regarding the later monolith .
Since it can not be fully comprehended by us , it might by some be ( wrongly ) interpreted in a supernatural way .
Kubrick then cuts to a water hole , another occurrence of the food motif .
The form of drinking we witness here is the most primitive one we see in 2001 and it also is the exact opposite to the form of drinking we will see at the end of the movie ( also mirrored by the sets they happen in ) .
Eating and drinking at the beginning and at the end therefore build a mirror or a bracket surrounding the whole movie .
And , at the water hole we for the first time hear some primitive form of communication between the apes .
And , as it is later again picked up , they only communicate to mark the water as one ’s own and to scare away other apes .
This becomes more apparent as shortly afterwards a different group arrives at the water hole and scares “ our ” bunch away from it with movements that seem to be more some form of ritual .
This moment during the fight is very interesting .
As you can see , the “ leader ” of the other group jumps into the water .
This moment can also be interpreted in that way that the apes have no feeling for their food and in fact walk over it .
Again , compared to the celebration at the end of 2001 ( and our more or less civilized today ) this here is marks the opposite .
This shot is quite enigmatic , being placed just before the night in the desert .
Since Stanley Kubrick could have used any animal here it is quite possible that he wanted to imply a certain color code .
Because the soon to arrive monolith is completely black , the zebra could be a symbol for change or metamorphosis .
In this sense , the color white would stand for stagnancy , perhaps even ignorance .
In this sense , Stanley Kubrick reversed the usual color connotations ( black being a symbol for evil / death ) .
The leopard on top of the zebra again wears the glowing eyes .
This not only stresses the demonic appearance but also , because it is getting dark , might imply that hiding is useless as the leopard sees everything ( which is stressed by the roars during the later night ) .
On a more abstract level you could interpret this shot that way that a certain way of change or evolution is part of nature ( the zebra ) , most often being triggered by the fight for life ( the leopard ) .
But this change has certain limits that cannot be overcome ( or might not be fast enough ) .
Because of those circumstances the monolith soon comes into play .
( This assumption of the speed of change becomes much more important if we assume that those two groups of apes are the only living specimen of this kind .
As the beginning implies at least one group – “ our ” group – might be close to extinction )
After this night the monolith is standing right in front of the apes so it is impossible to overlook it .
Although this moment is quite self - explanatory ( fear becomes curiosity ) it is nevertheless very important for the movie on an abstract level as Stanley Kubrick introduces us to another motif : the Contact with the Monolith .
This shot shows that after some seconds the whole group of apes is sitting right at the monolith and touches its surface extensively .
In a way you can say that the “ positive ” charge of the black monolith is being transferred to the black apes as they and the monolith almost seem to become one single black mass .
This is the last shot of the sequence in which the apes touch the monolith .
This shot in itself is , from a pragmatic and physical standpoint , impossible for some reasons :
Although it is not absolutely sure how much time passed from the shot with the apes it can be assumed that it is an immediate cut .
And by comparing this shot with the one above you can see , that in the first one , the sun is not visible in the shot .
The moon could n’t be that visible if the sun is that close .
The clouds on the right are lit from below .
It is quite impossible that the perfectionist Kubrick would have made such many mistakes in one shot , which means it was intended .
As you can see , the perspective Kubrick chose implies an upward direction or a space oriented direction : the monolith opens the gate to evolution , and in the end space .
Besides the upward direction the monolith moreover points at one direct position in space : the moon , which will be the next stop for man ’s evolution .
The “ sun ” we see here is most likely not the real one , but a metaphorical symbol for knowledge , intelligence or wisdom that “ dawns ” in the apes – a motif , used extensively in the first 16 minutes .
Another interesting element at the end of this scene or moment is the strong cut used .
From the eerie singing and the metaphorical charged imagery Kubrick smash cuts right away to a shot showing the silent desert : as fast as the monolith appeared it also disappeared as fast .
Even more , the apes forgot it rather quickly after it went away .
The following moment marks the first step of the apes into a new kind of evolution and is another turning point of 2001 :
The ape not really invents something new , but more precisely finds a new way of using something he knows all day long ( the bones are everywhere ) , triggered by the monolith which is shortly shown in this sequence .
The ape “ invents ” a tool , the most important motif in 2001 which from now on is almost everywhere .
By using the color connotation mentioned above , the black ape ( with a dawning intelligence ) is beginning to use something negative ( death – the bones of a tapir ) for later positive ( and negative ) things .
The ape gives the up to now useless thing a new meaning and new use .
But the ape not only “ invents ” the tool , he immediately takes two more steps : he uses the bone / the tool to kill a tapir ( the second step and a new occurrence of the killing / death - motif ) so the group can eat meat ( the third step ) .
Although one cannot say for sure that the apes were carnivores to begin with , Kubrick at least never hinted something like this ( he rather showed the opposite as the tapirs had no fears and apes showed no signs of trying to kill them ) , which means , that the third step also was something new for them .
After the first killing of a tapir everything has changed .
As you can see , the ape again and again looks around him to see if any animal comes close to him to steal his food .
Compared to the beginning , it is now quite the opposite as in this shot no animal is visible .
This is later enhanced as the tapir keep some distance and no leopard is been seen again .
They are gone .
The apes have taken a big step forward which started to “ alienate ” them from the rest of nature .
By looking at this shot ( when our group wants to reclaim the water hole ) , one can see that , compared to the other apes in the back of the image doing their grunting ritual , the apes with the bones walk more upright and their movements are way more controlled and slower .
Kubrick not only uses this to show the physical manifestation of evolution triggered by the monolith and the usage of tools , he also introduces another ( minor ) motif in 2001 : walking , shown here in its first incarnation .
The apes ( in some sort the baby humans ) learn the first steps of walking .
This is another big moment of the first part of “ The Dawn of Man ” : an ape kills another one .
What is interesting is the fact , that this killing is , at first , an accidental killing .
If you watch this moment you can see that the other ape is charging in to the bone - wielder .
The latter one seems surprised , frightened and immediately ( and by instinct ? ) gives the fatal blow .
Now the apes show a deeply human form of action : they follow the leader .
Although unsure they do the same as him : they smash the dead body again and again .
Kubrick here shows us that we humans still are apes in our most inner cores .
Followers and cowards with no true form of communication , or communication downgraded to useless rituals .
This moment therefore works on many levels .
It is on the one hand a commentary to our current state of evolution and on the other hand a showing of the situation of the apes .
( And this leads me to a long side note and perhaps different commentary to this scene :
Although it seems clear that the monolith disappeared before the killing , can we assume that the ones who placed it did n’t know of the situation ?
Kubrick clearly shows us the conflict at the water hole .
And since he showed us it we can take it as an indicator that the entities knew of it , too .
They must have had at least a feeling that this was going to happen , because otherwise I they would seem very naïve .
But if we interpret the whole situation and this “ political ” setting that way , it means , that the statement Kubrick makes is rather “ disillusioned ” : conflict and death is part of the evolution of man .
This is also indicated by the legendary match cut passing 4 million years of time , shortly after the killing .
Kubrick cuts from a flying killing tool to a killing tool in the future . )
This killing moment shows also another occurrence of two motifs with a first shift : the tool and killing .
The killing , up to now being used solely for the hunt for food , is now being used to kill of no higher reason or motivation .
The tool also is now used outside of its normal usage of killing animals ; it does n’t completely serve man anymore .
On the other hand , the tool does n’t act on its own .
But there is even more : one can say the bone wielders only could win against their opponents because of this tool .
This also means that the apes and their survival are completely dependent of it from now on .
The shot above marks one of the most iconic moments in film history .
The bone is in this shot the first part of the match cut that sends us directly into space ( whereas the screenshot is taken one or two frames before the cut ) .
In this regard , the upward direction implied by the first half of the “ bone flight ” is like a sign the ape sends out into the world .
What is now interesting is the fact , that Kubrick makes the cut when the bone is falling down again .
So , in a way he contradicts the moment of glory by reminding us , that nothing can be “ high ” forever .
He even goes further by cutting in exactly that moment , when the bone is in a downward angle ( see screenshot ) .
Since in the western world a lower left to upper right direction is considered development , future and so on , we can assume that this direction is the total opposite .
Therefore this shot negates itself : the tool is the symbol for the first technological advancement , which is contradicted by the downward movement and direction .
So in the end it is or was no real development we have witnessed .
With this shot ends the analysis of the first 16 minutes of 2001 , a sequence unusual and enigmatic on almost every level .
Kubrick here shows us his talent for storytelling , as he literally tells the beginning of everything .
He does n’t tell it through an archeologist or someone else , but he simply shows us .
In that regard it is also intriguing that in this whole time not one word has been spoken ( motif of communication ) yet we fully understand the basic story on screen .
Of course the understanding / interpretation is a completely different story as each one can interpret the metaphorical symbols in one ’s own way .
In the end this also means , that the interpretations of these image and shots are my own which you can fully discard if you like .
I hope you enjoyed my view of and on the first 16 minutes of “ 2001 : A Space Odyssey ” .
If you have some insights or want to comment on it feel free to do it .
The next part of this series will deal with the second part of “ The Dawn of Man ” : the story of Dr. Floyd and the monolith on the moon .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China has dismissed Internet gossip that its first photo of the moon taken from a lunar orbiter might have been plagiarized from NASA , local media said on Monday .

China has dismissed Internet gossip that its first photo of the moon taken from a lunar orbiter might have been plagiarized from NASA , local media said on Monday .

The country launched its first lunar probe , the Chang’e 1 , in October and released a photo featuring a patch of grey moon surface splotched with craters last week , hailing the mission as a “ complete success . ”
But some Chinese Internet users have questioned its originality after comparing it with an almost identical lunar image from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 2005 .
“ There is absolutely no forgery , ” Ouyang Ziyuan , chief scientist for the lunar probe , told the Beijing News .
The Chinese and U.S. lunar images looked similar only because they had aimed at the same area of the moon ’s southern hemisphere , Ouyang was quoted as saying .
“ But a careful examination will tell some small differences , ” Ouyang said .
There were two craters on a certain spot of the Chinese photo , but there was only one on that same spot of the American picture , the Beijing News quoted him as saying .
“ Maybe it ’s because the resolution of the American photo was not high enough , or a new pit might have been generated by an asteroid hitting the moon between 2005 and 2007 , ” Ouyang said .
“ I understand the doubts of the Internet surfers .
They hope the Chinese lunar probe can do well so they do n’t want the photo to turn out to be fake , ” he said .
A three - dimensional image of the moon surface taken by the Chang’e 1 was released on Sunday and some data collected by the satellite would be shared with the public , the Beijing News said .
China has an ambitious space program , eyeing its scientific and military benefits as well as domestic political gains from its boost to patriotism .
In 2003 , China became only the third country to put a man into space using its own rocket after the former Soviet Union and the United States .
It then sent two astronauts on a five - day flight on its Shenzhou VI mission in October 2005 .
It plans to launch a third manned mission , Shenzhou VII , into space next year which would involve a space walk .
Other Asian powers have also announced lunar plans .
Japan launched its first lunar satellite in September and India plans one in 2008 .

In May 2007 I found a book in a used bookstore called Future Stuff , by Malcolm Abrams and Harriet Bernstein .
It was published in 1989 , and it described about 275 consumer products that :
... should be in your supermarket , hardware store , pharmacy , department store , or otherwise available by the year 2000 .
It was based on interviews with the people who were working on these products .
It made concrete predictions , with dates and estimated prices .
The predictions were more or less wrong .
This is what happens when you predict the future .
What I did n't expect was the sheer variety of ways in which the predictions were wrong .
Most books of predictions I 've seen come from the 1960s or earlier , and their predictions have no relationship to today 's reality .
But when I started looking up the technologies described in Future Stuff , I found that almost all of them do exist in some form or another .
Some of them exist more or less as described ( " Flat TV " ) .
Some exist more or less as described but nobody buys them ( " Vending Machine French Fries " ) .
Some are too expensive to be practical ( " Privacy Windows " ) .
Some were big hits in totally different fields than the ones they were marketed to ( " Binocular Glasses " , " Self - Stirring Saucepan " ) .
Many exist in greatly improved form thanks to mobile phones ( " Watch Pager " ) and the Internet ( " Weather Cube " , " The Guerilla Information Network " ) — two technologies that existed when Future Stuff was published , yet which do n't seem to be mentioned at all .
Some achieved success by abandoning the high - tech trappings with which Future Stuff burdens them ( " Telephone Smart Cards " , " Solar - Powered Cooker " ) .
Some made a fortune ( " Impotency Pills " ) for someone other than the person mentioned in Future Stuff .
Some failed because of tragic flaws ( " Frozen Beverage Mug " , " Non-Fattening Fat " ) , others for contingent reasons of history ( " Digital Tape Measure " , " Self - Weeding Lawn " ) .
Some remain pipe dreams today ( " The Flying Car " ) .
And some ( " Mood Suit " ) were just ridiculous .
This website is an audit of 1989 's future .
It ran from June 10 , 2007 to March 11 , 2008 , presenting one Future Stuff entry per day .
I found out what happened to the predicted products , and to the people and companies who were going to bring them to you .
I dug up the appropriate patents and old articles about the products .
All the amounts in Future Stuff are 1989 dollars .
I give inflation - adjusted amounts for rough comparison , usually in 2007 ( 2006 actually , but who 's counting ) dollars .
To keep things from getting too confusing , I qualify each amount of money with a year : $ 10/1989 is ten dollars in 1989 money , and it 's worth about $ 16/2007 .
I 'm indebted to The Inflation Calculator for making this information easy to access .
One thing you 'll see over and over again is a race between inflation and Moore 's Law .
Moore 's Law wins big time .
Best - Of
Some people do n't really want to read reviews of all 275 Future Stuff entries , so I picked twenty of my favorites as a sort of sampler .
The Entries
Every item in Future Stuff has three pieces of information associated with it .
I 've reproduced them in a table for each item :
How likely it is the product will get on the market .
This seems taken directly from the people making the product .
100 % means the product " exists in a form that can be marketed and sold " — not , importantly in retrospect , that it is or ever will be marketed or sold .
When the product will be on the market .
If the probability is 100 % , the ETA is almost always 1990 .
How much the product will cost , in 1989 dollars .
" N/ A " means they do n't think the product will be sold directly to consumers .
More accurately , it means they could n't get a number out of whoever they were talking to .

The world is drowning in debt : personal debt , national debt , credit card debt , mortgage debt .
Doomsday economists predict an imminent debt crisis that will plunge the world into another Depression , and TV talk shows are stuffed with experts extolling the latest scheme for living " debt - free . "
But what exactly is this monster called debt that 's sucking up all of our income , ruining our credit scores and making politicians sweat ?
Is debt always a bad thing , or is a little debt necessary to achieve some of life 's most important financial milestones , like buying a home , a car , and paying for a college education ?
In this HowStuffWorks article , we 'll explain the difference between good debt ( yes , it exists ) , bad debt , consumer debt and public debt , and even offer some advice on how to get out of debt .
Debt and credit are two sides of the same coin .
Debt is something owed and credit is something given , usually in the form of money .
A person who receives credit is the debtor or borrower , and the person who gives credit is the creditor .
­ To receive credit , the debtor must enter into a contract with the creditor specifying the terms by which the debt will be repaid .
This contract is often called a loan .
­ The terms of a loan include the amount of time the debtor has to repay the full amount and the interest he will be charg­ed over that time .
Interest is a fee charged by the creditor , calculated monthly­ or annually , and expressed as an interest rate , or percentage of the principal .
The principal is the amount of money borrowed , minus any payments that have already been made ( excluding interest payments ) .
The most common types of consumer debt are credit card debt , home mortgages , home equity loans , car loans and student loans .
Besides consumer debt , there 's something called public debt .
Public debt is money owed by governments .
We 'll talk more about consumer and public debt later on .
­ Other debt classifications are secured and unsecured debt .
A secured debt is backed by collateral , or something of real value .
A mortgage is a secured debt because the loan is backed by the value of the house itself .
­
Credit card debt is considered unsecured debt , because there is nothing of value backing the debt , only the borrower 's credit history .
If the borrower can't make his credit card payments , he has to find a way to come up with the money , which could mean borrowing more debt .
This is why credit cards and other unsecured debt are the most dangerous types of debt to accumulate .

If it looks like a recession and feels like a recession ...
“ Quite frankly , ” said Senator Charles Schumer , peering over his glasses at the Fed chairman , Ben Bernanke , “ I think we are at a moment of economic crisis , stemming from four key areas : falling housing prices , lack of confidence in creditworthiness , the weak dollar and high oil prices . ”
He asked Mr. Bernanke , at a Congressional hearing Thursday , if we were headed toward a recession .
An aide handed the chairman his dancing shoes , and Mr. Bernanke executed a flawless version of the Washington waffle .
He said : “ Our forecast is for moderate , but positive , growth going forward . ”
He said : “ Economists are extremely bad at predicting turning points , and we do n’t pretend to be any better . ”
He said : “ We have not calculated the probability of recession , and I would n’t want to offer that today . ”
With all due respect to the chairman , he would see the recession that so many others are feeling if he would only open his eyes .
While Mr. Bernanke and others are waiting for the official diagnosis ( a decline in the gross domestic product for two successive quarters ) , the disease is spreading and has been spreading for some time .
The evidence is all around us .
Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland told Mr. Bernanke that many members of Congress are holding forums in their districts “ to help people who are coming to our doors , literally with tears in their eyes , and trying to figure out how they ’re going to manage a foreclosure that ’s right around the corner . ”
Back in 1967 , Gene Amdahl famously pointed out what seemed like a fundamental limit to how fast you can make your concurrent code :
Some amount of a program 's processing is fully " O ( N ) " parallelizable ( call this portion p ) , and only that portion can scale directly on machines having more and more processor cores .
The rest of the program 's work is " O ( 1 ) " sequential ( s ) . [ 1,2 ]
Assuming perfect use of all available cores and no parallelization overhead , Amdahl 's Law says that the best possible speedup of that program workload on a machine with N cores is given by
Note that , as N increases to infinity , the best speedup we can ever get is ( s+p ) / s. Figure 1 illustrates why a program that is half scalably parallelizable and half not wo n't scale beyond a factor of two even given infinite cores .
Some people find this depressing .
They conclude that Amdahl 's Law means there 's no point in trying to write multicore - and manycore - exploiting applications except for a few " embarrassingly parallel " patterns and problem domains with essentially no sequential work at all .
[ Click image to view at full size ]
Fortunately , they 're wrong .
If Amdahl 's Game is rigged , well then , to paraphrase a line from the movie WarGames :
The only way to win is not to play .
( Special Report ) - Tata Motors , India ’s largest automaker , is set to debut the world ’s first commercial air powered vehicle .
The Air Car , developed by Formula One engineer Guy Negre for Moteur Developpment International ( MDI ) , uses compressed air to power its engine .
6000 Air Cars will be on the streets of India by August 2008 .
The first model to be sold commercially will be the CityCAT for a measly $ 12700 .
The car takes only a few minutes and $ 2 to fuel up at special compressor units , or drivers can plug the car into the electric grind and power up in 4 hours .
With a top speed of 68 miles per hour and a max range of 125 miles , one might be forgave for expecting the CityCAT to hit the streets of New York City soon .
Sadly , it is unlikely , especially considering the vehicle ’s all glue construction .
But if you ’re German , Israeli , South African , or live in 9 other countries , you can expect to see the cars at a theater stoplight near you .
THE FACTS
Many public services are less reliable on weekends .
But does that apply to medicine as well ?
In the past decade , studies have found that patients treated at hospitals on weekends have inferior outcomes when compared with those receiving care on weekdays .
In some cases , researchers have found , that can also mean a higher death rate .
In one of the largest studies , published last year in The New England Journal of Medicine , scientists followed 231,164 heart attack patients admitted to New Jersey hospitals from 1987 to 2002 .
They found that those admitted on weekends were less likely to receive aggressive treatment , and had slightly higher death rates ( 12.9 percent , versus 12 percent for weekday patients ) .

Another extensive study , in The Annals of Surgery in November , looked at 188,212 patients who had nonemergency surgery .
Those who had their operations on a Friday and spent the weekend recovering on a regular hospital floor were 17 percent more likely to die in the following 30 days than those who had their operations earlier in the week .
On November 9 and 10 , the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) invited several bloggers to visit Shell 's facilities in New Orleans , and also its Brutus Tension - leg Platform , 165 miles south of New Orleans , in the Gulf of Mexico .
The purpose of this post is to tell you a little about my trip .
API has underwritten Gail Tverberg ’s travel expenses to attend the Shell location tour in New Orleans .
Gail is not required to blog about API initiatives .
The only requirement as a condition of underwriting these expenses was to include this disclosure of this relationship on her blog .
First , I need to disclose that API paid for my trip .
There were only three bloggers on this trip :
• Mark Hemingway of National Review
• Margot Gerritsen who teaches energy resources engineering at Stanford University
• Gail Tverberg of The Oil Drum
Also on the trip were Jane Van Ryan of API , Ignacio Gonzalas from Shell Oil , and plus two women assisting Jane with the trip .
Visit to Shell Facility in New Orleans
On Saturday , November 9 , we started by having lunch together and talking a little about the reason for the trip .
Shell and API would like to be more open about oil company operations and would like to have at least a few bloggers understand their operations better .
Also , we talked a little about their view of the future of oil production .
I would describe the views of both Ignacio and Jane to be " peak lite " views .
With rising demand , and many of the older fields now in decline , they have real concerns about developing adequate energy resources to meet tomorrow 's needs .
After lunch , we visited three areas in Shell 's New Orleans facility that are involved with visualization of new sites and monitoring of existing oil fields .
At each of these stops , we saw specially prepared presentations on how the centers operate .
Our first stop was SEPCoVE 3 - D ( Shell Exploration and Production Collaborative Virtual Environment ) .
This is a virtual reality center where a team of specialists can meet to study a particular field 's structure and plan a course of action .
The room has a curved 24 foot screen .
People viewing the images wear special three - D glasses , to get a better 3 - D effect .
We were told that Shell has about a dozen rooms like this around the world .
The visualization centers were developed by the same companies that make 3D animation for amusement park rides .
We saw some seismic 3 - D images , so got a little feel for what the teams are looking at .
While in the SEPCoVE room , we heard a little about Shell 's ventures into newer sources of energy .
One they are particularly optimistic about is a shale oil extraction method using heating and freezing .
It seemed to me that it was likely to be very energy intensive .
Next we visited the Shell / Halliburton Real Time Operations Center ( RTOC ) .
This is a center that can monitor up to 12 critical fields at a time .
This is a large room filled with 75 monitors and 12 large screens .
One of the goals in both SEPCoVE and RTOC is to minimize down - time of drilling rigs , since they are very expensive .
Third , we visited the Production Operations Management Center ( POMC ) .
We were told that a better name would be the Production Operations Monitoring Center , since what this group really does is monitoring , rather than management .
In this room , a large number of less critical fields are monitored , to make certain that they are operating within expected parameters .
Part of the reason for POMC is to get maximum use from the limited number of people trained to do this kind of monitoring .
By having both the recent graduates and the more experienced workers together in the same room , it is possible for the more experienced to help train the less experienced , and to leverage their knowledge to handle a large number of fields at a time .
Trip to Brutus TLP
Saturday morning , we took a helicopter to visit the Brutus Tension - Leg Platform ( TLP ) .
A TLP has four " hulls " ( like legs ) at the corners , and is tethered to the sea floor by 12 " tendons " .
The facility makes all its own power -- generally from the natural gas it produces -- and desalinates sea water for drinking .
We had a beautiful day for the visit -- temperature in the upper 70's , sunny , with little wind .
On the day we visited , the platform was perfectly still .
We were told that on windy days , it moves in figure 8's .
The platform cost a little under $ 1 billion to make , and was designed with a 30 - year lifetime .
The management of the platform spent the day showing us around .
This was much more attention than I had expected .
One of the first things I asked was how much Brutus was producing .
I had read in the literature that it began operation in 2001 , and was designed with a maximum capacity of 100,000 barrels of oil and 150 million cubic feet of gas per day .
I was told that the previous day 's production was 28,000 barrels of oil and 40 million cubic feet of gas .
This production may not have been entirely representative , but it was clear that the platform is producing quite a bit less than it was designed for .
We were told that Shell has plans to add some type of gas lift in the second quarter of 2008 , to enhance recovery .
When I got back , I looked at Matt Simmons ' slide from the Houston ASPO conference regarding Gulf of Mexico production .
Click to enlarge .
Brutus is the black sliver starting in 2001 .
It rises to a quick peak , and starts declining , like the other GOM sites shown on the graph .
On the trip , I was told that other Shell GOM sites are also planning some type of secondary recovery , starting in the next year or so .
If I understood correctly , many of these are to be water injection .
It seems to me that Gulf of Mexico production will drop to non-economic levels for many of these fields within the next few years , even with secondary recovery methods .
I asked whether the Brutus platform could be moved to another location , since it still has most of its 30 - year lifetime left .
I was told that the only way this would work is if a new location is found that is of approximately the same depth ( 2,985 feet ) as the current location .
At this point , few new drilling sites are opening up in the 3,000 foot depth range .
I expect that this is one reason that Shell ( and others ) are very interested in getting the portion of the Gull of Mexico near Florida opened up for exploration .
If further Gulf exploration is delayed for 15 or 20 years , it may be necessary to start over with new platforms .
By that time , onshore pipelines may also have deteriorated with disuse , and trained personnel may be unavailable .
The facility was much nicer than I had expected .
Workers have rooms with bunk - beds , a desk and a television .
Each room has a private bathroom for the two workers in the room .
( I was told that this is unusual - - most platforms have group bathrooms ) .
The dining room is open for snacks as well as meals , and offers several choices of entrees .
There were a couple of large gathering rooms , with large television screens .
I noticed a " Wii " video game box next to one .
No alcohol is permitted on board , and random drug testing is required .
We were told that our group doubled the number of women on board , so about five out of the 90 or so workers on the platform must be women .
It seems like the Brutus platform would be a good place to work , at least for the next few years , before its operations cease .
Workers spend two weeks on the platform , then two weeks on shore .
Pay is good enough that some live in other states , and fly to New Orleans for two - week tours of duty .
( If air travel becomes less available , workers may have to move closer to the platforms . )
During the two - week tours of duty , the workers work 12 hours on , and then have 12 hours off .
Safety is given a very high priority -- we were told that there is fewer than one injury per year on the platform .
One program that seems to work well is requiring any worker who sees a co-worker doing some activity in an unsafe ( like forgetting safety goggles ) to immediately counsel the co-worker on his behavior .
There is no retribution against the person doing the unsafe activity .
The number and types of these events is tabulated , and used in designing future safety ( re ) training sessions .

Hofmeister Speech / Town Hall Meeting in Atlanta
After I got back from the New Orleans / Brutus trip , I went to see John Hofmeister , president of Shell , speak in downtown Atlanta on " Meeting the Energy Challenge " .
He was in town for the last stop on a 50 - city tour , giving this speech and conducting town - hall meetings .
I would guess there were 300 or more attendees - all of the chairs were taken , and people were standing in the back of the room .
Most of the invitees were from the general public , and were not peak - oil aware .
Mr. Hofmeister made what he called several outrageous statements .
He said that the energy market had stopped working , so that increased price was not leading to increased supply .
He blamed this on a variety of factors - greater demand from China and India ; countries subsidizing the cost of fuels ; resource nationalism ; and oil exporters acting in their own self - interest .
Another " outrageous " statement he made was , " America is the only oil - importing nation that prohibits the development of its own resources . "
He credits this prohibition with moving jobs out of the country and worsening the balance of payment situation .
He went on to talk about various alternatives to oil production that are being considered ( including hydrogen ) .
He asked the audience for their input regarding alternatives in the town - hall session that followed .
I thought Shell was to be commended for bringing the issue of energy security to the American people in the 50 - city tour .
I was disappointed that Hofmeister did n't mention peak oil as a concern , and did n't go into any pros or cons of the various alternatives .

I 'd like to announce the tutorials sessions for PyCon 2008 ( US ) .
As you may know , this year PyCon is being held in Chicago , Illinois March 14 - 16 with the Thursday before ( the 13th ) being " Tutorial Thursday " .
We are expecting nearly 600 Python enthusiasts to meet up for the conference and have 29 tutorial sessions scheduled on Thursday in three sessions ; morning , afternoon , and evening .
There is an extra fee to attend a tutorial , but the sessions are 3 hours long ( with a break ) and are taught by some of the smartest cookies in the Python community .
Pop on over to http://us.pycon.org/2008/about/ for more informationHere 's a list of the sessions currently offered ( we may cancel a session if there are fewer than 10 people registered , but that does n't happen very often ) .
In particular , note that there are 4 different introduction to Python tutorials aimed at different audiences .
Two former intelligence officials said that Porter J. Goss , the director of the agency at the time , was not told that the tapes would be destroyed and was angered to learn that they had been .
Through a spokeswoman , Mr. Goss declined to comment on the matter .
In his statement , General Hayden said leaders of Congressional oversight committees had been fully briefed about the existence of the tapes and told in advance of the decision to destroy them .
But the two top members of the House Intelligence Committee in 2005 said Thursday that they had not been notified in advance of the decision to destroy the tapes .
A spokesman for Representative Peter Hoekstra , Republican of Michigan , who was the committee ’s chairman between 2004 and 2006 , said that Mr. Hoekstra was “ never briefed or advised that these tapes existed , or that they were going to be destroyed . ”
The spokesman , Jamal Ware , also said that Mr. Hoekstra “ absolutely believes that the full committee should have been informed and consulted before the C.I.A. did anything with the tapes . ”
Representative Jane Harman of California , the top Democrat on the committee between 2002 and 2006 , said that she told C.I.A. officials several years ago that destroying any interrogation tapes would be a “ bad idea . ”
“ How in the world could the C.I.A. claim that these tapes were not relevant to a legislative inquiry ? ” she said .
“ This episode reinforces my view that the C.I.A. should not be conducting a separate interrogations program . ”
In both 2003 and 2005 C.I.A. lawyers told prosecutors in the Moussaoui case that the C.I.A. did not possess recordings of interrogations sought by the judge .
Mr. Moussaoui ’s lawyers had hoped that records of the interrogations might provide exculpatory evidence for Mr. Moussaoui , showing that the Qaeda detainees did not know Mr. Moussaoui and clearing him of involvement in the Sept. 11 , 2001 , plot .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - With U.S. policy at the center of debate at a Bali climate change meeting , Democrats in Congress said on Monday that the White House manipulated science for years to cast doubt on reality of global warming .
“ The Bush administration has engaged in a systematic effort to manipulate climate change science and mislead policymakers and the public about the dangers of global warming , ” the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said .
Congressional Republicans released their own report , calling the accusations “ a partisan diatribe , ” while White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said the Democrats ’ charges were rehashed and untrue , and timed to coincide with the Bali conference .
James Connaughton , head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality , denied the accusations : “ Claims that this administration interfered with scientists and with the science are false . ”
The Democrats reported that the council exerted “ unusual control over what federal scientists could say publicly about climate change , and that it was standard practice for the council to decide whether or not U.S. scientists could give interviews to the media .
This became more apparent after Hurricane Katrina hit the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2005 , when the White House and the Commerce Department steered press queries away from government scientists who linked climate change and more intense hurricanes , the Democratic report said .
EDITING CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS
“ There was a systematic White House effort to minimize the significance of climate change by editing climate change reports , ” they wrote .
They said council staff edited the administration ’s “ Strategic Plan of the Climate Change Science Program ” to exaggerate scientific uncertainties or to diminish the importance of the human role in global warming .
The report ’s release came on the same day that the United States urged participants in the Bali meeting to drop a 2020 target for deep cuts in greenhouse gases by rich nations from guidelines for a new pact to slow global warming beyond 2012 .
Harlan Watson , the chief U.S. climate negotiator , said the tough targets included in a draft document in Bali would be “ prejudging what the outcome should be . ”
The draft text suggested that rich countries like the United States should aim to cut emissions of climate - warming gases by between 25 and 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
Watson ’s statement was consistent with the Bush administration ’s long - term stance on climate change .
While acknowledging the reality of global warming , the White House has opposed specific targets to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide -- spewed by coal - fired power plants and petroleum - fueled vehicles -- arguing that this would hurt the U.S. economy .
Washington has also stressed that any successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 , must include all countries with high greenhouse emissions , including fast - growing China and India , which were exempt from the Kyoto requirements .
The United States is now the only major developed country outside the Kyoto Protocol .

Howard Government Suffers Defeat
By PATRICK BARTA and RACHEL PANNETT
November 24 , 2007 7:39 a.m. SYDNEY -- Australian Prime Minister John Howard suffered a humiliating defeat in national elections Saturday , according to preliminary results , most likely ending the political career of one Asia 's most enduring conservative leaders and a key ally of U.S. President George W. Bush in the region .
Voters were ready to hand control of the government to Australia 's opposition Labor party , headed by former diplomat Kevin Rudd , who has promised to boost relations with China , pull some troops from Iraq , and re-make Australia as a leader in the global effort to stop global warming .
The defeat appears so complete that the 68 - year - old Mr. Howard , Australia 's second - longest - serving prime minister , appeared likely to lose his own parliamentary seat , which he has held for 33 years .
With 70 % of the votes counted , Labor was on track to win at least 80 of the 150 seats in Parliament 's House of Representatives , where governments are formed , compared with just 60 in the last election in 2004 , according to Australian Broadcasting Corp .
Full results wo n't be known for several days but concessions from the Howard camp are expected before long .
See tunney 's diary with more links and analysis .
This was not a referendum over Iraq ( local issues predominate , including a scandal about election dirty tricks )
But the furore over bogus leaflets being distributed in the western Sydney seat of Lindsay made it big in the world pages of the leading broadsheets .
Purporting to be from a fictitious Islamic group , the Islamic Australia Foundation , the flyers claim Labor wants the Bali bombers forgiven and supports construction of a controversial mosque .
Greg Chijoff , husband of Liberal candidate for Lindsay Karen Chijoff , was forced to quit the party over the scandal .
The Independent ran the headline : " Howard rocked by smear scandal as defeat looms " , while The Daily Telegraph said : " Dirty tricks row hits Howard 's final plea " .
but one by one world leaders who supported the invasion are being pushed out of office ( Aznar , Blair and now Howard , to name three ) .
Their replacements are n't likely to be so trusting of Bush , though policy will not radically change , either .
Bottom line ?
It does n't matter what part of the world you live in .
George W Bush is an albatross around the neck of every politician who supports him .
Oh , and that 's true in the US as well [ though as our Australian friends note , that 's not why Howard lost ] .
We would like to acknowledge our debt , in the construction of this instrument , to Rear - Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort .

For those of you who do n't play Second Life , it may come as a surprise that the virtual world is still turning .
But it is , and there 's still drama going down over — you guessed it — money handling within the " game . "
Second Life operator Linden Lab is hoping to head off some of that drama by instituting a ban on virtual banks that are n't government - sanctioned in real life .
The company said in a blog post this week that after reviewing resident complaints , in - world banking activities , and the law , the move is in the best interests of its users .
A number of virtual banks have popped up within Second Life , and they work the same way that real banks do — they promise appealing interest rates to Second Life residents willing to hand over their Linden dollars , among other things .
Since Linden dollars can be translated into real - world dollars , the individuals running the " banks " presumably deposited the cash into their own ( real ) banks in order to grow that interest .
But residents started getting burned by banks not being able to live up to their promises .
One bank , Ginko Financial , ended up folding in August , taking all of its customers ' money with it .
Since then , a number of other banks have defaulted on their promises , too .
Since the banks are n't official ( and therefore are not FDIC insured like a real bank would be ) , Second Life residents had no recourse and were out all of their hard - earned cash .
Normally , Linden Lab would stay out of it — residents are free to screw themselves over however they please within the virtual world .
But the company said that it believes these banks introduce " unique and substantial risks " to the game by offering unsustainably high interest rates , and are doomed to collapse .
" As these activities grow , they become more likely to lead to destabilization of the virtual economy , " the blog posting reads .
" At least as important , the legal and regulatory framework of these non-chartered , unregistered banks is unclear , i.e. , what their duties are when they offer ' interest ' or ' investments . ' "
Therefore , as of January 22 , Linden Lab will be removing all objects that are related to in - world banking .
Until then , the company hopes that the banks will settle their debts with residents as best they can , but if they are caught trying to operate after January 22 , they will be punished by possible suspension , termination of accounts , and ( * gasp * ) loss of land .
Legitimate banks that provide a government registration statement or financial institution charter will be allowed to continue doing business , as will entities conducting marketing or education .
This is not the first time Linden Lab has stepped in and banned questionable activity relating to money .
In July of last year , gambling was banned in the virtual world , which some believed was related to an FBI investigation into casinos in Second Life .
Because of the cloudy nature of the law when it came to gambling with Linden dollars , the company decided to head things off at the pass with the ban .
For the next couple of weeks , those in - world banks could face new problems while everyone rushes to get their money out .
Like the ( real life ) stock market crash of the 1920s , Second Life residents have been gathering en masse at their virtual financial institutions to figure out what 's going on .
It 's times like these when we 're glad none of us at the Ars Orbiting HQ plays Second Life anymore .
From walking to zipping , Part 3 : Caught in a zipper
In two previous posts , we saw how to walk right , down , and up through a hierarchical value .
At each step of the walk , the visitor may inspect the part of the value at the current location and change it if desired .
The visitor may operate in any monad , such as IO , so the inspection may occur by printing to standard output and the change may be directed from standard input .
This third and final post of the series shows how to walk left .
Again , you can download this post as a program .

Functions ()
In this post , we focus on a particular monad : not IO but what we call the Zipper monad .
A computation in the Zipper monad either finishes with a value , or produces some output and awaits some input interactively .
The output is the current value of a part , along with the incoming direction from which the walk arrived at the part .
The input is the outgoing direction to which the walk should continue from the part , and optionally a new value for the part .
data Zipper from to part a = Done a | Stop from part ( Maybe part -> to -> Zipper from to part a ) deriving Show instance Monad ( Zipper from to part ) where return = Done Done a >>= k = k a Stop from part c >>= k = Stop from part c' where c' part ' to = c part ' to >>= k
The Zipper monad is designed to be the reification of a walk .
That is , we can turn any walk over a value into a Zipper computation without losing any information .
As you might expect , this reification amounts to an inversion of control using the continuation monad transformer ( ContT in the monad transformer library ) : we pass a special visitor to the walk ( visit below ) that captures the continuation of the visit into a Stop computation .
zipper ::
Walk from to part whole -> whole ->
Zipper from to part ( Maybe whole ) zipper walk whole = runContT ( walk visit whole ) return where visit from part = ContT ( Stop from part . curry )
In short , a zipper is a suspended walk .
To continue the example at the end of the previous post in this series , let us use this zipper function to walk through term .
Recall that term is ( λx.xx ) ( λx.xx ) .
When we convert the walk to a Zipper using zipper , we no longer need to direct the walk right away .
Instead , we get a value that we can use to continue the walk at our leisure .
Let ’s call this value start .
start = zipper ( throughout ( stop Before ) ) term * WalkZip3 > : type start start :: Zipper ( Exit Before ) ( Enter After ) Term ( Maybe Term ) * WalkZip3 > start Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ) < function >
As the last line above shows , the suspended walk start has arrived at the entirety of the term from the left .
To continue this walk , we define a convenience function continue , which simply extracts the continuation from a Zipper that is at a Stop .
continue :: Zipper from to part whole ->
Maybe part -> to ->
Zipper from to part whole continue ( Done _ ) = error " Zipper is done , not at a stop " continue ( Stop _ _ c ) = c
Taking advantage of the fact that GHCi always binds the variable it to the last expression evaluated , we can conduct the same walk as at the end of the previous post .
* WalkZip3 > continue start Nothing Enter Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue it Nothing ( To After ) Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue it Nothing Enter Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue it ( Just ( V " x " ) ) Enter Stop ( Exit True Before ) ( V " x " ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue it Nothing ( To After ) Stop ( Exit True Before ) ( L " x " ( V " x " ) ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue it Nothing ( To After ) Stop ( Exit True Before ) ( A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( V " x " ) ) ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue it Nothing Enter Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue it Nothing Enter Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue it Nothing ( To After ) Stop ( Exit True Before ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue it Nothing ( To After ) Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( L " x " ( V " x " ) ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue it Nothing ( To After ) Stop ( Exit True Before ) ( A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( V " x " ) ) ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue it Nothing ( To After ) Done ( Just ( A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( V " x " ) ) ) )
( Exercise : write a convenience function for the special case of continue that corresponds to entering a blank line at the keyboard . )
What Zipper lets us do that we could n’t do before is to go off and do something else at any step .
We can resume a suspended walk as long as we keep a Zipper value around to represent it .
In fact , we can resume the same suspended walk multiple times ( or not at all ) , just as we can invoke any other function multiple times ( or not at all ) .
For example , we can continue from the same start in two different ways , and switch to one way whenever we get tired of the other .
Such multiprocessing is one of the earliest applications discovered for continuations .
* WalkZip3 > continue start ( Just ( A ( V " y " ) ( V " z " ) ) ) Enter Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( V " y " ) < function > * WalkZip3 > let saved = it * WalkZip3 > continue start ( Just ( L " x " ( V " x " ) ) ) Enter Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( V " x " ) < function > * WalkZip3 > let saved ' = it * WalkZip3 > continue saved Nothing ( To After ) Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( V " z " ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue saved ' Nothing ( To After ) Stop ( Exit True Before ) ( L " x " ( V " x " ) ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue saved Nothing Enter Stop ( Exit True Before ) ( V " y " ) < function >
Reifying walks into zippers turns out to be the key to walking to the left .
Our goal in the rest of this post is to add the red arrow “ To Back ” in the following local picture of a walk —
— or equivalently , to add the red arrows in the following global picture of a walk .
Intuitively , to walk left is to backtrack from walking right , so a first approximation to walking left is to save up a bunch of suspended walks — one for each previously encountered stop to the left of our current location — and resume them in last - in - first - out order as necessary .
However , when we backtrack to the left , we need to make sure not to lose any changes to the data that we might have made on the right .
To avoid losing the changes , we record them in a data structure that we call Diff .
data Diff part to = Diff ( Maybe part ) to ( Diff part to )
A Diff value is a serial record of a visitor ’s behavior over the course of a walk .
It is best to think of the definition of Diff above as an infinite list of pairs , each a move by the visitor .
The first component , of type Maybe part , is an optional new part .
The second component , of type to , is an outgoing direction .
If we draw this infinite list as a tree , then to move from the list to a suffix of it is to go down the tree .
Even though a Diff is an infinite data structure , it is convenient to be able to show it .
We show just the top 3 levels .
instance ( Show part , Show to ) =>
Show ( Diff part to ) where shows
Prec = loop 3 where loop 0 _ _ = showString " ... " loop l d ( Diff part to diff ) = showParen ( d > 0 ) $ showString " Diff " . shows Prec 11 part .
showChar ' ' . shows
Prec 11 to .
showString " $ " . loop ( l - 1 ) 0 diff
An empty ( initial ) Diff record is a visitor that keeps moving to the right without making any changes .
same :: ( To to ) =>
Diff part to same = Diff Nothing after same * WalkZip3 > same :: Diff part After Diff Nothing After $ Diff Nothing After $ Diff Nothing After $ ... * WalkZip3 > same :: Diff part ( Enter After ) Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ ...
Given a Zipper , we can replay any Diff against it : just pass successive records in the Diff to successive continuations offered by the Zipper , until the Zipper is Done .
replay :: Zipper from to part whole ->
Diff part to -> whole replay ( Done whole ) _ = whole replay ( Stop _ _ c ) ( Diff part to diff ) = replay ( c part to ) diff
For example , we can replay the Diff called same against the Zipper called start .
Not surprisingly , such a replay yields no changes to the term .
* WalkZip3 > replay start same Nothing
Other Diff s are more exciting to replay .
We can replace the entire term , for instance .
* WalkZip3 > replay start ( Diff ( Just ( V " v " ) ) ( To After ) same ) Just ( V " v " )
Or we can replace just the first subterm .
* WalkZip3 > replay start ( Diff Nothing Enter $ Diff ( Just ( V " v " ) ) ( To After ) $ same ) Just ( A ( V " v " ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) )
In fact , we can do much better : given a Zipper , we can not only replay a Diff passively , but more generally walk through a Diff actively .
That is , we can change a Diff while replaying it against a Zipper .
After all , a Diff is just a tree structure , whose parts are its suffixes when regarded as a list of moves .
Therefore , we can walk through a Diff in the directions we have already built : walking down means to move into the future , whereas walking right or up means to move into the past .
If the visitor to the Diff changes it during the walk , then we simply replay the new Diff in place of the old one .
The walk Diff function below converts a zipper into such a walk .
walkDiff :: ( To to ) => Zipper from to part whole ->
Walk ( Exit ( Zipper from to part whole ) ) ( Enter After ) ( Diff part to ) ( Diff part to ) walk Diff zipper = stop zipper `around` \visit ~ ( Diff part to diff ) -> case zipper of Done _ -> return Nothing Stop _ _ c -> liftM ( liftM ( Diff part to ) ) ( walkDiff ( c part to ) visit diff )
In this walk , the type of incoming directions is that of a Zipper .
This way , every time we stop at a Diff , the visitor can use information about the current location to decide what to do .
To replay the Diff , we pass its part and to components to the continuation c in the Zipper ( on the last line in the code above ) .
To recap , we can reify any walk into a zipper , and we can convert any zipper into a walk over a Diff .
To try this out , let ’s convert start into a walk over same , then reify this walk into a zipper .
* WalkZip3 > zipper ( walkDiff start ) same Stop ( Exit False ( Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ) < function > ) )
( Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ ... ) < function >
All this nesting looks scary , but it merely repeats what we put in : the first half of the output above is start , and the second half is same .
We can now replay same against start step by step and meddle in it as we please , as in a debugger .
If we are happy with the current Diff , namely same , we can take one step forward in the replay .
To step forward in the replay is to go down ( that is , Enter ) the Diff .
* WalkZip3 > continue ( zipper ( walkDiff start ) same ) Nothing Enter Stop ( Exit False ( Done Nothing ) ) ( Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ ... ) < function >
The first line in the output above shows that the replay has completed .
The result is Nothing , just as when we evaluated replay start same above .
If that ’s not exciting enough , we can edit the Diff before stepping forward .
For example , let us edit the Diff so that it starts by entering the term rather than going right through it .
* WalkZip3 > continue ( zipper ( walkDiff start ) same ) ( Just ( Diff Nothing Enter same ) ) Enter Stop ( Exit False ( Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) < function > ) )
( Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ ... ) < function >
In the output above , the first half is the Zipper after one step of replay , and the second half is the Diff after one step of replay .
Note that we are now at the first subterm .
We can take another step forward in the replay , without editing the Diff this time , to move to the second subterm .
* WalkZip3 > continue it Nothing Enter Stop ( Exit False ( Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) < function > ) )
( Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ ... ) < function >
That looks like the same output , but we are now at the second subterm .
Let ’s edit the Diff here to edit the Term here .
* WalkZip3 > continue it ( Just ( Diff ( Just ( V " v " ) ) ( To After ) same ) ) Enter Stop ( Exit False ( Stop ( Exit True Before ) ( A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( V " v " ) ) < function > ) )
( Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ ... ) < function >
In the first line of the output , Exit True Before tells us that the Zipper has returned to the top level of the term ( by moving right from the second and last subterm ) .
On the second line is the new term , in which the second subterm of the term has changed to V " v " .
If we like this new term , there are two ways to finish up .
First , if we just step forward once more in the replay , then we reach the end of the replay and recover the final term .
* WalkZip3 > let changed = it * WalkZip3 > continue changed Nothing Enter Stop ( Exit False ( Done ( Just ( A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( V " v " ) ) ) ) )
( Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ ... ) < function >
The rest of the infinite number of moves in same remain unused as shown by the second component of Stop above .
Second , if we keep stepping back in the replay — by stepping up ( or equivalently , right ) in the walk over our Diff — then we gradually undo our changes to the term but retain them in the changes to the Diff .
Watch the Diff s returned below as we build an increasingly non- same list of moves .
* WalkZip3 > continue changed Nothing ( To After ) Stop ( Exit True ( Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) < function > ) )
( Diff ( Just ( V " v " ) ) ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ ... ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue it Nothing ( To After ) Stop ( Exit True ( Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) < function > ) )
( Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff ( Just ( V " v " ) ) ( To After ) $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ ... ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue it Nothing ( To After ) Stop ( Exit True ( Stop ( Exit False Before ) ( A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ) < function > ) )
( Diff Nothing Enter $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff ( Just ( V " v " ) ) ( To After ) $ ... ) < function > * WalkZip3 > continue it Nothing ( To After ) Done ( Just ( Diff Nothing Enter $ Diff Nothing ( To After ) $ Diff ( Just ( V " v " ) ) ( To After ) $ ... ) )
Finally — on the last three lines above — we get an updated Diff containing the history of all the changes we made to the term .
At any point above , we could have switched from stepping back in the replay to stepping forward again ( in other words , switched from stepping out of the Diff to stepping in again ) , and our recorded changes would have been reinstated .
This reinstatement of a historical record of changes is what we need to walk left without losing changes to the right .
We are in the home stretch now .
All that ’s left to do is to package up the insights demonstrated interactively above into a function that adds a Back direction to any traversal .
Let ’s define a new data type of outgoing directions .
data BackForth to = Back | Forth to deriving ( Eq , Ord , Read , Show ) instance ( To to ) => To ( BackForth to ) where after = Forth after instance ( Next from to ) =>
Next from ( BackForth to ) where next = Forth .
next
Now we are ready for the back Forth function , which turns any walk with outgoing direction type to into a walk with outgoing direction type BackForth to .
In other words , back Forth adds a new outgoing direction ( namely Back ) to any walk .
backForth :: ( To to ) =>
Walk from to part whole ->
Walk from ( BackForth to ) part whole back Forth walk visit whole = liftM ( either id ( >>= replay za ) ) ( runErrorT ( walkDiff za visit ' same ) ) where za = zipper walk whole visit ' ( Exit _ ( Done whole ) ) _ = throwError whole visit ' ( Exit _ ( Stop from part _ ) ) ( Diff partD toD diffD ) = do ( part , to ) <- lift ( visit from ( fromMaybe part partD ) ) let diff ' | isJust part = Just ( Diff part toD diffD ) | otherwise =
Nothing return ( case to of Back -> ( diff ' , after ) Forth to -> ( if to == toD then diff ' else Just ( Diff part to same ) , Enter ) )
The main body of this definition ( liftM ( ... ) (... ) ) deals with the two ways in which a walk returned by back Forth may terminate .
They correspond to the two ways to “ finish up ” discussed above .
The first way is to reach the end of the replay , which means that we have walked off the right edge of the whole .
In that case , we are deep inside a traversal over a Diff , so we stop that traversal promptly by throwing an exception using throwError in the sum monad transformer ( ErrorT in the monad transformer library ) .
The second way is to reach the beginning of the reply , which means that we have walked off the left edge of the whole .
In that case , we have an updated Diff and simply replay it against the original whole .
The rest of the code , in particular the auxiliary definition of visit ' , converts a visitor to the whole that may ask to go either Back or Forth into a visitor to the Diff that may ask to go either up or down .
To support our use of the sum monad transformer , because Haskell ’s Monad class includes the extra member error , we need to define how to make an error value of type Maybe whole .
We do n’t actually use this definition .
instance Error ( Maybe whole ) where noMsg = Nothing
It ’s time to put it all together .
Recall from the first post that gwalk ( stop Before ) is a walk that traverses the immediate parts of a whole by moving right at every step .
For demonstration , let ’s define walkTerm to be the special case where the parts and the whole are both λ- terms .
walkTerm :: Walk Before After Term Term walkTerm = gwalk ( stop Before ) * WalkZip3 > walkTerm keyboard term Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ?
( Just ( V " y " ) , After ) Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ?
Just ( A ( V " y " ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) )
Applying back Forth to walkTerm enables it to move left as well as right .
* WalkZip3 > back Forth walkTerm keyboard term Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ?
( Just ( V " y " ) , Forth After ) Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ?
( Just ( V " z " ) , Back ) Before : V " y " ?
Before : V " z " ?
Just ( A ( V " y " ) ( V " z " ) )
Applying throughout to back Forth walkTerm enables it to move up and down as well as left and right .
* WalkZip3 > throughout ( backForth walkTerm ) keyboard term Exit False Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ?
Exit False Before : V " x " ? Exit True Before : V " x " ? Exit False Before : V " x " ?
( Just ( V " y " ) , To Back ) Exit False Before : V " x " ?
( Nothing , To ( Forth After ) ) Exit False Before : V " y " ?
( Nothing , To ( Forth After ) ) Exit True Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " y " ) ) ?
( Nothing , To ( Forth After ) ) Exit False Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ?
( Nothing , To ( Forth After ) ) Just ( A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " y " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) )
Generalizing this development , we define a generic function to walk through any data structure in all four directions .
through :: ( Data a ) => Walk ( Exit Before ) ( Enter ( BackForth After ) ) a a through = stop ' `around` throughout ( backForth ( gwalk stop ' ) ) where stop ' visit = liftM fst .
visit before
The final test below produces the same output as the previous test , except it starts and ends at the top level with the entire value .
* WalkZip3 > through keyboard term Exit False Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ?
Exit False Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ?
Exit False Before : V " x " ? Exit True Before : V " x " ? Exit False Before : V " x " ?
( Just ( V " y " ) , To Back ) Exit False Before : V " x " ?
( Nothing , To ( Forth After ) ) Exit False Before : V " y " ?
( Nothing , To ( Forth After ) ) Exit True Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " y " ) ) ?
( Nothing , To ( Forth After ) ) Exit False Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ?
( Nothing , To ( Forth After ) ) Exit True Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " y " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ?
Just ( A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " y " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) )
To conclude , this series of posts has presented a notion of traversal that is generic in the type of directions and the monad of visits .
Starting with unrelenting forward movement , such traversals can be transformed in several ways :
When you install live chat capabilities on your dealership website , you ’re changing the entire way that your website functions .
The ability to talk one - on - one with customers will provide your website with the ability to bring the talents of your sales team to bear on online customers – vastly increasing your ability to close deals and earn higher profits .
To take advantage of this capability , all you need to do is contact a software development specialist that works specifically on sales and marketing applications for auto dealerships .
Recent Changes for Online Dealerships
Live Chat is merely one of a series of new online apps designed to change the way that a dealership uses their website .
In the past , car sellers mainly used their online presence as a way to display inventory for existing customers and casual web traffic to view .
While they were able to advertise some deals , the dealership website held little potential to retain and capture web traffic .
Building Better Customer Relationships
For the customer looking for research , one company ’s webpage was as good as the other .
Websites offered limited images and information with no ability for further inquiry .
Adding a live chat option changes everything .
New customers are now able to engage a live operator with questions about the vehicles that interest them .
Building Better Leads
They can also provide information to the dealership regarding their tastes and finances in order to allow your team to make better assessments of which vehicles will suit each particular customer .
Using the information gather in live chat , your dealership can easily drive more leads though your site in order to increase your end sales dramatically .
Let Your Sales Team Take the Lead
Live chat operators engage people browsing online in order to build better leads and create new customers .
As the process develops , your in - house sales team can join in the conversation in order to bring their marketing skills to bear online and better direct that customer towards a satisfying purchase .
Providing your sales staff with the ability to work online also allows them to offer personalized upgrade offers and on - the - minute deals catered to that particular customer .
Share Video and Photos
An online messaging service is n’t just about creating great conversations that attract new customers , it ’s about bringing everything that you have to offer to the digital forum in order to create a website that is every bit as powerful a sales resource as your physical dealership location .
That ’s why live chat also allows your sales team to share photo and video right in the conversation .
When you install a live chat service on your dealership website , you are n’t just offering a new service –
you ’ll be taking your website to a whole new level .
Offering a better online experience can help generate better leads and even lead to online auto sales .
Your capabilities all depend on whether or not you get in touch with a company that offers advanced solutions for dealerships online .

Swedish authorities and anti-piracy groups are taking extreme measures to shut down The Pirate Bay .
Their latest trick is to use child pornography as a tool in their war on piracy .
Ethical ?
No. Effective ?
Could be .
Meet the people behind The Pirate Bay Conspiracy .
Pirate Bay admin Brokep identified some of the key players conspiring against the popular BitTorrent tracker .
First of all the Swedish anti-piracy lobby groups .
They stated at an official meeting in Stockholm that child porn could be used for anti-piracy issues .
Most people will probably agree that child porn is sick , but using it to filter the Internet is just disgusting .
They should devote their time to catch people who upload that stuff instead .
Or are they so desperate that they are uploading it themselves , so they have an argument to shut The Pirate Bay down ?
Let ’s hope not .
The second key player in The Pirate Bay conspiracy is Stefan Kronquist , who works for the IT - crime section at the State criminal police department .
According to TPB admin brokep , Steven is the person in charge of the Pirate Bay case .
Brokep adds : “ Stefan is probably mad at us for me fighting with them over the Kopimi.com filter entry they admitted blocking wrongfully ” .
Last but not least , Thomas BodstrÃ¶m , a former Minister of Justice who ’s known ( and hated ) for his plans to turn Sweden into an Orwellian state .
BodstrÃ¶m was held responsible for the Pirate Bay raid last year , after the US gently pressured him into taking action .
“ He really hates us and wants to shut us down , ” says Brokep .
“ When the election last year was held we even put up a logo with his face on The Pirate Bay in order to celebrate that he was in the losing side of the election and was no longer a minister ” .
It now turns out that this former Minister is closely involved with Internet filtering .
As Brokep mentions : “ He went on to become the chairman of the board for the group ECPAT , a non-governmental organization that works together with the police in order to control child porn online , one of the big friends over at the child porn department and also one of the big contributors to the child porn filter .
Is this just a coincidence ?
He has personal grudges , political grudges and power to control this . ”
First Telephone Book
Alexander Graham Bell was granted a patent on his telephone in 1876 .
He demonstrated it to visitors to the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition that same year .
In early 1878 , he installed the first telephone exchange , in New Haven , Connecticut .
The first telephone " book " - actually just a single 14 cm. x 21 cm. sheet - was issued in New Haven in 1878 .
Below is a 1978 facsimile of that sheet .
To the right is the same text , suitable for computer searching .
By the way , a New Haven telephone book issued later in 1878 , containing numerous pages and including advertisements , sold at auction in 2008 for $ 170,500 .
This was purportedly the first telephone book with more than one sheet of paper .

ACCORDING to America 's Census Bureau , fewer than 1 m Americans are farmers , considerably less than 1 % of the workforce .
But the farm lobby looks as strong as ever .
So far it is once again winning its fight to maintain the billions in annual subsidies that the federal government showers on American agriculture .
For most Americans — and , indeed , for most members of Congress — federal farm - policy is a complicated and dull distraction from bigger issues .
Farm bills are usually left to a small cabal of lawmakers whose passion for preserving subsidies far outweighs others ' passion for eliminating them .
This year debates over Iraq and health care have pushed agricultural matters well down the list of priorities .
Back in the spring , agricultural reform looked possible .
Taxpayers ' lobbies , environmental groups and government watchdogs had aligned to oppose America 's complicated and inefficient system of farm payments .
The Democrats had taken control of Congress , promising to cut wasteful spending .
Demand for ethanol had pushed corn and soyabean prices to record peaks , and farm incomes were generally high .
Arguments that rich farmers needed government aid were even less credible than usual .
However , as the Senate prepares to debate its farm bill next week , prospects for change again look dim .
The House of Representatives has already passed a bill preserving most subsidies , but throwing soothing sops to opponents in the form of help for biofuels and conservation .
On October 25th a Senate committee approved a draft that would leave subsidies more or less as they are for another five years .
According to a database compiled by the Environmental Working Group , a whopping $ 165 billion went on farm payments between 1995 and 2005 .
But 73 % of that went to 10 % of recipients .
Half went to only eight states .
American farmers , meanwhile , are hardly struggling .
The Department of Agriculture projects that the average farm household 's income this year will be $ 87,000 .
In 2005 a quarter of subsidies came in the form of “ direct payments ” , which go to landowners regardless of what they farm , how much they farm or if they farm at all .
These payments , originally designed to wean farmers off subsidies , have stuck around , along with the subsidies they were meant to replace .
The Senate committee made a nod to reform by declaring those who make more than $ 750,000 a year ineligible for this largesse — but only as long as two - thirds of that income does not come from farming .
The federal government , then , will continue to hand billions to profitable farmers and many others under the bill .
An amendment from Richard Lugar , a Republican from Indiana , proposed slashing direct payments in order to finance other priorities such as food stamps .
But it failed miserably in the committee , which is filled with the farm lobby 's friends .
Now the bill moves to the Senate floor , where it should encounter more resistance .
Mr Lugar plans to introduce a more ambitious amendment there , which would eliminate the worst of the subsidies and replace them with government - run insurance for farm incomes .
It would also apply to farmers of all crops in the country , unlike the current array of subsidies , which mostly benefit “ commodity crops ” such as wheat , corn and soyabeans .
The substantial money saved would go into conservation funds , nutrition programmes and debt reduction .
And lobbyists would have a harder time defending the existing system as a safety net for disaster - prone American farmers .
The prospects for the amendment are not good in the Senate , where rural states are over - represented .
Even so , reformers can take some heart from a couple of hopeful signs .
Debate in the Senate is likely to take longer than it did in the House , giving Mr Lugar and his allies more time to sell their proposal .
Other , more modest , amendments will also come up , including one to limit the size of payments .
Also , George Bush and his acting agriculture secretary have hinted that they will oppose the bill .
A presidential veto might blow the farm debate wide open .
GOP Senators Abandon Craig , Call for Resignation Craig steps down from committees , and several have called for his resignation .
Aug. 29 , 2007  -- Two Republican senators have abandoned disgraced Sen. Larry Craig , R - Idaho , today and called on him to resign his Senate seat .
Presidential candidate Arizona Sen. John McCain and Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman are the first of Craig 's colleagues to join Rep. Peter Hoekstra , R - Mich. , in pushing for Craig 's resignation .
" My opinion is that when you plead guilty to a crime , you should n't serve .
That 's not a moral stand .
That 's not a holier - than - thou .
It 's just a factual situation , " McCain told CNN .
" Sen .
Craig pled guilty to a crime involving conduct unbecoming a senator , " Coleman said today in a statement .
Hoekstra said that Craig " represents the Republican Party " and that " his conduct throughout this matter has been inappropriate for a U.S. senator . "
Craig Asked to Step Down From Top Committee Assignments
With Craig 's mug shot making the media rounds , Senate Republican leaders asked him to step down from several committee assignments today .
" Sen . Larry Craig has agreed to comply with leadership 's request that he temporarily step down , " Senate Republican leaders said in a statement .
Craig was the top Republican on the Veteran Affairs Committee , the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior and the Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee for Public Lands and Forests .
" This is not a decision we take lightly , but we believe this is in the best interest of the Senate until this situation is resolved by the Ethics Committee , " read the statement by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , and fellow Sens. Trent Lott , R - Miss . ; Jon Kyl , R - Ariz . ; Kay Bailey Hutchison , R - Texas ; and John Ensign , R - Nev .
" It 's a very unfortunate situation , very sad and very serious , " Sen .
Trent Lott told Bloomberg TV Wednesday .
" And I think we had to pay very close attention to it as we work on finding out what really went on . "
It marked the second day in a row that Republican leaders in the Senate offered no support to Craig .
Republican leaders announced Craig would face an Ethics Committee investigation just before the senator 's appearance before reporters Tuesday where he explained his guilty plea .
The White House also offered no support to Craig in a statement today .
" We 're disappointed in what 's going on , " White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said .
" We hope that it will be resolved quickly , as that would be in the best interests of the Senate and the people of Idaho . "
Craig : ' I Am Not Gay '
Craig faced television cameras Tuesday in an attempt to explain his guilty plea in a case that followed a lewd conduct investigation .
With his wife by his side , Craig said Tuesday in Idaho : " Let me be clear .
I am not gay .
I have never been gay . "
It was a striking statement from the U.S. senator , who was the subject of a police sting set up in response to complaints of sexual activity in a men's room at a Minnesota airport .
" I did nothing wrong at the Minneapolis airport , " said Craig .
" I regret my decision to plead guilty and the sadness that decision has brought to my wife , family , friends , staff and fellow Idahoans .
And for that , I apologize . "
Craig Pleaded Guilty to Disorderly Conduct Charge
The arresting airport officer has a different story .
Working undercover , Sgt. Dave Karsnia said Craig entered a stall next to him , then tapped his foot and rubbed it against the officer 's , a signal , police say , to engage in " lewd conduct . "
" While I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct at the Minneapolis airport or anywhere else , I chose to plead guilty to a lesser charge in the hope of making it go away . "
Craig now says the guilty plea was a mistake , painting quite a different portrait than he did just three weeks ago in court documents in which he stated " I 'm pleading guilty " to " physical " conduct that tended " to arouse alarm . "
He entered that plea " freely and voluntarily . "
Craig pleaded guilty to those disorderly conduct charges without an attorney .
" I should not have kept this arrest to myself , and should have told my family and my friends about it .
I was n't eager to share this failure , but I should have anyway because I am not gay , " a contrite Craig said Tuesday .
Craig Blames Hometown Newspaper
Craig blamed the situation on pressure from an investigation by his hometown newspaper , which ran a front page story outlining three additional alleged sexual encounters .
In a written statement Tuesday , Republican leaders had no words of support for their colleague in the Senate .
Rather , they called for an Ethics Committee to review Craig 's guilty plea and are " examining other aspects of the case to see if additional action is required . "
GOP Idaho Governor Offers Support
Idaho Republican Gov. Butch
Otter , the man who would be responsible for picking Craig 's replacement if he were to resign , said today that he and his wife support Craig , whom he has known for 40 years .
" I want Larry and Suzanne to know that Laurie and I stand by them , " Otter said .
" I urge everyone to give our senator a fair hearing .
He is an honorable man .
And I am confident that Larry Craig will do what is best for him , his family and the state of Idaho . "
Across the aisle , Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , said he wanted to hear more from Craig himself before coming to any conclusions .
" I at least want to give him a chance to hear his side of the story , " Dodd told CNN .
I 'm a Democrat .
He 's a very conservative Republican .
We do n't agree on much , but give him a little space here to defend himself . "

Twin Musical Tesla Coils Play Mario Bros Theme Song For Yuks
Now we would have selected a different composition to spark out to , but you ’ve got to love this pure geek musical endeavor …
Now here ’s the kicker : there are no speakers !
In the above video , two Solid State Tesla coils are playing the original Mario Bros theme song at the 2007 Lightning on the Lawn Teslathon sponsored by DC Cox ( Resonance Research Corp ) in Baraboo WI .
The music that you hear is coming from the sparks that these two identical high power solid state Tesla coils are generating .
There are no speakers involved .
The Tesla coils stand 7 feet tall and are each capable of putting out over 12 foot of spark .
They are spaced about 18 feet apart .
The coils are controlled over a fiber optic link by a single laptop computer .
Each coil is assigned to a midi channel which it responds to by playing notes that are programed into the computer software .
How insane is this ??
Here are principles I think you ca n’t avoid :
1 . Fire the committee .
No great website in history has been conceived of by more than three people .
Not one .
This is a dealbreaker .
2. Change the interaction .
What makes great websites great is that they are simultaneously effortless and new at the same time .
That means that the site teaches you a new thing or new interaction or new connection , but you know how to use it right away .
( Hey , if doing this were easy , everyone would do it . )
3. Less .
Fewer words , fewer pages , less fine print .
4 . What works , works .
Theory is irrelevant .
5. Patience .
Some sites test great and work great from the start .
( Great if you can find one ) .
Others need people to use them and adjust to them .
At some point , your gut tells you to launch .
Then stick with it , despite the critics , as you gain traction .
6. Measure .
If you ’re not improving , if the yield is negative … kill it .
7 . Insight is good , clever is bad .
Many websites say , “ look at me . ”
Your goal ought to be to say , “ here ’s what you were looking for . ”
8 . If you hire a professional : hire a great one .
The best one .
Let her do her job .
10 mediocre website consultants working in perfect harmony can’t do the work of one rock star .
9 . One voice , one vision .
10 . Do n’t settle .
The Boston Globe 's Charlie Savage , who won the Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the story surrounding George W. Bush 's signing statements , reported on Saturday that after taking a hiatus for most of the first session of the Democratic - controlled 110th Congress , signing statements are back :
President Bush this month issued his first signing statement since the Democratic takeover of Congress , reserving the right to bypass 11 provisions in a military appropriations bill under his executive powers .
In the statement , which the White House filed in the Federal Register on Nov. 13 but which initially attracted little attention , Bush challenged several requirements to provide information to Congress .
For example , one law Bush targeted requires him to give oversight committees notice before transferring US military equipment to United Nations peacekeepers .
Bush also challenged a new law that limits his ability to transfer funds lawmakers approved for one purpose to start a different program , as well as a law requiring him to keep in place an existing command structure for the Navy 's Pacific fleet .
Interesting .
Bush uses a signing statement to challenge a law limiting his ability to transfer Pentagon funds from one approved use to another .
Why might he do that ?
Could it be so that he can find and move alternative funding in the face of any Congressional restrictions on the conduct of the Iraq operation ( up to and possibly including defunding ) ?
Perhaps .
Of course , it could also just be a matter of doing it because he can , and does n't want anyone to forget it , whether he has the intention of exercising that option or not .
But here 's something else equally interesting .
Savage sees the new signing statement language as less aggressive and even perhaps more conciliatory than the strident phrasing used with previous , Republican Congresses :
" The Act contains certain provisions identical to those found in prior bills passed by the Congress that might be construed to be inconsistent with my Constitutional responsibilities , " Bush 's statement says .
" To avoid such potential infirmities , I will interpret and construe such provisions in the same manner as I have previously stated in regard to those provisions . "
By referring only to objections voiced in past documents , Bush 's new signing statement struck a less aggressive tone than those he issued during the years when his own party controlled Congress .
In the past , Bush 's assertion that he could bypass laws was backed by the invocation of broad theories laying out the scope of a president 's power to defy congressional statutes .
In a further sign that the White House adopted a muted tone , the new signing statement also said nothing about two higher - profile provisions in the bill that limit presidential power :
One law prohibits the military from using foreign intelligence information that was collected illegally , and the other forbids expending funds to establish permanent US military bases in Iraq .
I 'm not so sure .
It 's certainly true that the " further sign " is indisputable .
Bush did say nothing about the limits on the use of foreign intelligence ( though he'd previously issued signing statements on exactly the same language ) and permanent bases .
Exactly why he did n't is a mystery .
And if it was because he hoped , for instance , that forbearance on the intelligence issue would buy him the retroactive amnesty he demands for his friends in telecom , well then devious though it might be , it has to count as conciliatory .
And no one can argue that silence is n't an indicator of " a muted tone . "
But ...
Tony Fratto , a White House spokesman , denied that there was any " public relations " motive behind the change .
Shorter signing statements , he said , are " just easier . "
" It 's been said , " Fratto said .
" It 's our position and it has n't changed . "
One instance where can usually take the White House at its word on is when it insists it has n't changed its position with respect to disrespecting Congress .
As for the first sign of this new , muted tone , I 'm not so sure .
Here 's Bush 's language :
To avoid such potential infirmities , I will interpret and construe such provisions in the same manner as I have previously stated in regard to those provisions .
That 's what lawyers would call an " incorporation by reference , " which Black 's Law Dictionary defines as :
The method of making one document of any kind become a part of another separate document by referring tot he former in the latter , and declaring that the former shall be taken and considered as a part of the latter the same as if it were fully set out therein .
So when Bush says , " I will interpret and construe such provisions in the same manner as I have previously stated in regard to those provisions , " that 's just a fancy way of saying , " What I said last time still applies . "
It 's less aggressive looking , to be sure .
But it 's not substantively different from his last rejection of this restriction .
One might contemplate ( in times when the prospect of defunding the war is being bandied about ) exactly why Bush would insist on retaining the power to move Pentagon funds from one approved project to any other , including projects specifically disapproved by Congress .
Just as one might wonder whether Bush 's belief that the August FISA revisions ( and the upcoming FISA revisions ) have retroactively legalized his intelligence collection methods influenced his decision not to comment on the restrictions in this bill .
If the White House is to be taken at its word that its position " has n't changed , " the proof will be in the pudding .
Congress will feel it must wait and see if Bush defies their legislation ( though in truth they would feel exactly the same way even with an explicit statement of opposition ) , which means more waiting and watching .
And wondering whether Congressional oversight will pierce the veil of this " administration 's " secrecy before the deed is done , and political considerations move them to declare it's " too late " to do anything about it anyway .
The clock continues to run , and nobody 's really sure whether this president believes the Congress truly has the power to legislate in any area he declares touches on his " inherent powers " or the " national security . "
That 's a pretty big question mark to have 220 years into the game .
TALLAHASSEE , Florida ( Reuters ) -
If nothing is done to combat global warming , two of Florida ’s nuclear power plants , three of its prisons and 1,362 hotels , motels and inns will be under water by 2100 , a study released on Wednesday said .
In all , Florida could stand to lose $ 345 billion a year in projected economic activity by 2100 if nothing is done to reduce emissions that are viewed as the main human contribution to rising global temperatures , according to the Tufts University study .
That equals about 5 percent of what economists project the state ’s gross domestic product will be by the end of the century .
“ The status quo , the climate that we have right now , is not an available option unless we act immediately , ” said Frank Ackerman , a professor at Tufts ’ Global Development and Environmental Institute and co-author of the study .
“ Doing something may seem expensive , but doing nothing will be more expensive . ”
Ackerman predicted a temperature increase of 10 degrees Fahrenheit , lower rainfall , more severe hurricanes and seas rising by as much as 45 inches because of climate change .
Efforts to meet carbon dioxide reduction goals could lessen the global temperature hike to 2 degrees Fahrenheit while keeping rainfall and hurricane intensity at current levels , he said .
The Tufts study said the sort of mitigation efforts needed to restrict sea level rises to 7 inches or less would cost a U.S. state like Florida between 1 percent and 2 percent of GDP .
Florida , a major tourist magnet that is home to Miami Beach , the swampy Everglades and Disney World and other theme parks in Orlando , is particularly vulnerable to climate change because of its 1,350 miles of coastline .
The study estimated that tourism revenue alone could drop by $ 167 billion a year , or 2.4 percent of state income , if beaches disappear , the Florida Keys , Cape Canaveral spaceport and most of the Miami area end up under water .
Republican Florida Gov. Charlie Crist is among a growing list of state officials who have given up waiting for the federal government to take the lead on cutting greenhouse gas emissions and have passed their own measures to cap pollution by power plants and cars .
A New York - based environmental group , Environmental Defense , commissioned the Tufts study .
“ It is false choice to say that we have to choose between our economy and the quality of our environment or our ability to confront global warming , ” said Jerry Karnas , Florida climate change project director for Environmental Defense .
“ We believe we can create both new markets and new opportunities while we protect Florida for our future . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Gay and lesbian couples are just as committed in their relationships as heterosexuals and the legal status of their union does n’t impact their happiness , according to new research .

In two new studies that compared same - sex and heterosexual couples using different factors and methods to assess their happiness , scientists found few differences .
“ Among the committed couples , there were very few differences that we were able to identify either in terms of how satisfied these couples were , how effectively they interacted with one another or how their bodies responded physiologically while they were interacting with one another , ” Glenn I. Roisman , of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champagne , said in an interview .
He and his colleagues compared 30 gay male and 30 lesbian couples with 50 engaged heterosexual couples , 40 older , married heterosexual couples and dating heterosexual couples .
They found that regardless of sexual orientation , as the level of commitment increased , so did the ability to resolve conflict -- debunking the myth that same - sex relationships are not built on the same level of commitment as heterosexual ones .
In the second study researchers , who focused on how legal status affected relationship quality , followed 65 male and 138 female same - sex couples in civil unions , 23 male and 61 female same - sex couples not in civil unions and 55 heterosexual married couples over a three - year period .
The researchers from the University of Washington , San Diego State University and the University of Vermont found that same - sex couples , regardless of their legal status , were more satisfied with their relationships and reported more positive feelings toward their partners and less conflict than heterosexual married couples .
But gay and lesbian couples not in civil unions were more likely than same - sex couples in civil unions or heterosexuals who were married to end their relationships , according to the study .
Both studies were published in the journal Developmental Psychology .
“ My personal view is that I think it ’s very hard to make the case as has been made that these same - sex relationships are fundamentally different from opposite - sex relationships in the presence of data like these and other data in the developmental literature , ” said Roisman .
A recount of the New Hampshire Democratic primary is underway in two counties in that state , and already the internet is abuzz over initial figures that show some clear discrepancies on optical - scan ballots cast in two polling locations in Hillsborough County , though officials say the discrepancies are the result of human error rather than machine error .
As you recall , Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich and Republican presidential candidate Albert Howard asked the state to recount the primary ballots after a blogger posted a chart showing that Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama received more votes than Hillary Clinton in regions where officials counted the paper ballots by hand than in regions where they were counted by optical - scan machines made by Diebold Election Systems and that Republican presidential candidate John McCain also received more votes than Mitt Romney in hand - counted districts over machine - counted ones .
The implication was that Clinton and Romney somehow benefitted from the optical - scan machines .
Voting activists say that pre-primary polls favoring Obama over Clinton add to suspicions that there was something wrong with the optical - scan machines
So the state is currently conducting a hand recount of ballots cast in the Democratic primary in Hillsborough and Rockingham counties ( Kucinich will decide based on the results of the recount in these two counties whether he 'll pay to have Democratic primary ballots in the rest of the state recounted ) .
So far the numbers out of two polling places in the cities of Manchester and Nashua in Hillsborough County show consistently screwy changes in the totals for all of the top Democratic candidates ( Clinton , Obama , Edwards ) and , therefore , have some voting activists crying foul .
While the vote totals for the candidates in other voting districts changed by a handful – as they 're expected to do in recounts for various reasons – each of these Democratic candidates lost a significant number of votes in the recount at Manchester Ward 5 and Nashua Ward 5 , ranging from 7 % to 15 % of their totals in those precincts .
Here are the numbers for Manchester Ward 5 , with the left - hand number representing the original count from the optical - scan machines and the right - hand number representing the recount ( the number in parentheses indicates the percentage each candidate 's total dropped in Manchester Ward 5 after the hand recount of ballots ) :
Clinton – 683 – 619 ( 9.5 % ) Edwards – 255 – 217 ( 15 % ) Obama – 404 – 365 ( 10 % )
Here are the numbers for Nashua Ward 5 ( I have n't included Obama 's numbers here because he gained 5 votes in this precinct rather than losing any ) :
Clinton – 1,030 – 959 ( 7 % ) Edwards – 405 – 377 ( 7 % )
So what gives ?
According to this story the discrepancies in Manchester Ward 5 are due to human error , not machine error .
Apparently a clerk recording the summary of totals from the machine count mistakenly added votes cast in the vice presidential slot to the presidential totals on the official tally sheet .
The New Hampshire Republican and Democratic ballots each include selections for a vice president and also offer a line for voters to write in the name of a candidate not offered among the vice presidential candidates .
The Democratic ballot this year offered two choices for vice president – William Bryk and Raymond Stebbins .
The Republican ballot listed Jack Barnes .
Some voters on the Democratic ballot opted not to vote for either candidate and wrote in Clinton , Obama or Edwards instead .
At the end of the election when the write - in vice presidential votes were counted , a clerk mistakenly added those write - in vice presidential votes for Clinton , Obama and Edwards to each candidates ' presidential tallies .
The problem was caught during the recount , officials say .
But there was something a little off about this explanation when I first read it .
An initial news report mentioned this as the explanation only for the discrepancies in Manchester Ward 5 , but made no mention of Nashua Ward 5 .
Then another news report out today mentioned that the same problem occurred in Nashua Ward 5 .
This had me wondering what were the odds that two different clerks in two different cities would make an identical mistake like this – a mistake that apparently clerks in other voting districts did n't make .
( Manchester has 12 polling locations , and Nashua has 9 .
It 's probably coincidental that it was Ward 5 in each city where the same problem occurred , although , unfortunately , this is the kind of coincidence from which conspiracy theories are made . )
So I called the city clerks in Manchester and Nashua to find out what happened .
( Unlike counties in other states , New Hampshire counties do n't run elections , cities do – with oversight from the secretary of state 's office ) .
I have n't heard back from Manchester yet but did speak with Nashua city clerk Paul Bergeron .
Bergeron agreed that it would be very odd if two clerks in different cities made an identical error that no one else made but says that in this case the problems in each ward were actually different , though similar enough to confuse reporters .
He says that as he understands it , the initial explanation for Manchester Ward 5 is correct – that the problem was a transcription error that occurred when a clerk mistakenly added write - in votes from the vice - presidential race to the presidential race tallies .
But he says the problem in Nashua Ward 5 was different in that it occurred because election officials there tallied some presidential votes twice .
He explained that after recording the votes cast for president on the Democratic ballots , the optical - scan machines automatically sorted out ballots that contained write - in choices in the vice - presidential race so that election officials could count the write - in votes by hand .
He says that election officials mistakenly believed that the machines had not already counted the presidential votes on those ballots and therefore tallied those votes by hand as well , resulting in double votes for the presidential candidates .
Officials say these problems would have been caught during the normal canvassing period when they reconciled the number of ballots cast with the number of presidential votes counted and the number of voters who signed in at the polls .
So that seems to explain the recount discrepancies found so far .
But even before the state offered these explanations , a group of academics examined the data in New Hampshire and found no evidence that the choice of voting technology in certain counties played a role in favoring one candidate over another , based on what is known about voter make - up in New Hampshire counties and past election performance .
" Our results , " they write , " are consistent with the differences being due entirely to the fact that New Hampshire wards that use Accuvote optical scan machines typically have voters with different political preferences than wards that use hand counted paper ballots . "
Michael Herron , professor of government at Dartmouth College , Walter Mebane , Jr. , professor of political science and statistics at the University of Michigan and Jonathan Wand , professor of political science at Stanford University , authored the report , which you can read here ( PDF ) .
Mebane and Wand , by the way , were part of a team that conducted extensive analysis of the 2000 presidential election , from which they concluded that Al Gore should have won the presidential race .
I mention this only to point out that they have no problem disputing official election results when they see evidence to back such claims .
I 'd also like to underscore a point they make in their New Hampshire report – that although they see no evidence to suggest that the technology played a role in skewing the election results in this case , they support the use of recounts as " the only comprehensive method for evaluating the accuracy of a given election ’s vote tabulations . "
In other words , we 're able to get to the bottom of New Hampshire 's tallies only because the state uses machines that provide a paper trail that can be hand counted to determine the voter 's intent and that serve as an auditing mechanism by which to check the accuracy of the machine totals .
This is why voting activists want all voting machines to provide paper trails and why they want states to be forced to conduct mandatory manual recounts of a certain percentage of ballots – as California does – as a matter of course after every election .
I 'll add one final note about the New Hampshire election and the number of Republican write - in votes that showed up on the Democratic primary ballots .
Readers will see from the recount totals that numerous New Hampshire voters cast a vote for a Republican presidential candidate on the Democratic ballot – using the write - in category to do so .
John McCain was the most popular in this regard – he received 346 write - in votes so far on Democratic ballots cast in Hillsborough County ( I say so far because officials are still recounting ballots cast in one Hillsborough city ) .
Romney received 234 write - in votes .
An assistant in the New Hampshire secretary of state 's office by the name of Diana ( she wo n't give her last name and is the only person answering the phones at present ) says that although New Hampshire has same - day registration – meaning that unregistered voters can walk into a polling place on Election Day and register to vote and choose a party affiliation – voters who have previously chosen a party cannot change their party affiliation on Election Day .
The deadline for changing party affiliation for this election was back in October , she says .
Therefore many voters who were already registered to one party or who had previously voted in a particular party 's primary and were therefore affiliated with that party in the registration database , mistakenly arrived to the polls thinking they could vote any primary ballot they wished or change their party affiliation on Election Day .
When they found they could n't and were given Democratic ballots , they voted outside the party anyway , writing in Republican candidates .
The same thing occurred with write - in votes for Democratic candidates on the Republican ballot .
Unfortunately , votes cast for McCain on the Democratic ballot or for Clinton on the Republican ballot are wasted votes , Diana says , since neither party will count votes cast for their party candidates if the votes are cast on the other party 's primary ballot .
By the way , the Rockingham recount is expected to be completed this week .
You can see the recount results as the state posts them here .
Note that the recount numbers for Weare in Hillsborough County are still not available .
The GOP recount will start after the Democratic recount is completed .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
As odd as it sounds , the government reported that inflation was at a four - decade low in the third quarter , primarily because import oil prices rose so much .
If you do n't understand that , welcome to the confusing world of national income accounting , where up sometimes is down , and where sometimes one plus one can equal zero .
Because of the way the government counts and reports the numbers , real - life inflation was understated and growth was overstated .
The economy did n't really grow 3.9 % , and inflation really was n't 0.8 % .
The numbers are n't as good as they look .
The complicated explantion :
When reporting on gross domestic product , the government counts up all the economic activity in the country , including consumer spending , business and residential investment , and government spending and investment .
Then it adds all the exports , and subtracts all the imports .
The final total is gross domestic product .
The fact that imports are subtracted is an important detail , so remember it .
Of course , all this counting is done in current dollars , the kind you and I have in our pockets , the kind that lose value every day to inflation .
In order to gauge how much of the increase in spending and investment during a quarter was due to real growth and how much to inflation , the government deflates the total number of dollars by its estimate for how much prices rose .
In the third quarter , the government estimated that current dollar spending and investment increased at a 4.7 % annual rate .
After subtracting 0.8 % for inflation , the real growth rate was 3.9 % in the third quarter .
See full story .
How does the government estimate inflation ?
The same way it estimates growth , by looking at individual price changes for consumer spending , business and residential investment , and government spending .
Then it adds the price changes for exports and subtracts the price changes for imports .
It subtacts import price changes .
Remember that .
Sometimes the mechanical formula produces some " quirky , nonintuititive relationships , " said Shelley Smith , who 's in charge of figuring the price index for the government 's Bureau of Economic Analysis .
Most of the time , the government 's formula does n't produce any weird numbers , because the mathematical quirks all cancel each other out .
But in the just concluded third quarter , it did produce quirky numbers that do n't accurately reflect reality , even though they are correct from an accounting point of view .
Imported crude oil prices rose from an average of about $ 69 a barrel in the second quarter to $ 75 in the third , but wholesale gasoline prices fell by about 10 cents to $ 2.07 a gallon .
Imported prices for energy rose , but domestic prices did n't .
In the government 's accounting , prices of imported goods rose at a 10.3 % annual pace in the quarter , but that increase was subtracted when figuring the economy - wide price index .
Import prices subtracted 1.3 percentage points from inflation in the third quarter .
With domestic prices rising slower than they had previously , it was enough to push inflation to four - decade low of 0.8 % .
The accounting is right .
But it 's not reality .

Fox KPTM 42 News
April 21 , 2008
OMAHA ( KPTM ) – Food shortages and rationing has been a third - world problem as of late , but recently , the phenomenon once thought unthinkable in the United States could start happening .
The New York Sun newspaper is reporting that major retailers on both coasts are limiting customers ’ purchases of flour , rice and cooking oil .
The Sun reports that a Costco Warehouse in California ran out of rice , frustrating shoppers .
“ Where ’s the rice ? ” an engineer from Palo Alto , Calif. , Yajun Liu , said .
“ You should be able to buy something like rice .
This is ridiculous . ”
The rice that is left is selling at near one dollar a pound , and in some areas , customers report paying about $ 30 for a 25 - pound bag .
Most Costco members were only allowed to buy only one bag .
One clerk reportedly dropped two sacks back on the stack after taking them from a customer who tried to buy more than the one bag limit .
“ Due to the limited availability of rice , we are limiting rice purchases based on your prior purchasing history , ” a sign above the dwindling supply said , the Sun reports .
Shoppers said the limits had been in place for a few days , and that rice supplies had been spotty for a few weeks .

MOSCOW : India and Russia could jointly develop a new generation space shuttle for manned space flights and negotiations for the project are expected to begin in January , according to a top space official .
" India has expressed desire to participate in the development of a new reusable manned spaceship and from January next we will discuss this issue with the Energia Rocket and Space Corporation , " Chief of Russia 's Federal Space Agency , Roskosmos , Anatoly Perminov said .
Although Perminov did not identify the project , but ' Energia ' Corporation is reportedly developing reusable spacecraft ' Clipper ' , which is expected to replace Soviet - designed Soyuz spaceships in Russia 's national space programme .
Perminov said India was Russia 's privileged space partner with which it was working in different directions and has granted Indian space experts access to many of its ground control facilities .
" With India we are interacting in carrier rockets , their components , dual use systems , global positioning system GLONASS and mission control and ground tracking equipment , " Perminov said here at an year - end news conference .
Russia , which launched three satellites on Christmas to commercially operationalise Soviet developed global navigation satellite system ( GLONASS ) , has taken India onboard in further developing of the system to end dependence on the Pentagon controlled Global Positioning System ( GPS ) , which was twice switched off to enable US strikes during the Balkan and Iraq wars .
" No child left behind " is the greatest thing in the world .
We need privatization of education so our kids can learn to read .
More free trade agreements signed ( he nodded his thanks to the Democrats ) .
Faith based volunteerism , or as he called them " Armies of Compassion " , will solve our social problems .
Everything gets militarized these days , including our compassion .
Be sure to snap to attention and salute before you hug anyone or hand them food at the local soup kitchen .
And do n't forget to say , " Sir Yes Sir " instead of " you are very welcome . "
Our poor Pentagon needs more money because all their toys are broken from the noble war in Iraq .
More stuff like that but I ran out of room on my note pad .
Watching the speech with me was a former Navy officer who was assigned to Aegis destroyers during Bush 's " shock and awe " invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
This particular person , now thankfully out of the Navy , was the officer on the deck when her ship launched the first cruise missile used in the attack .
She told me it was routine to drive the Navy ships ( always in a convoy ) through the Straits of Hormouz and when they did it was " standard operating procedure " for Iran or the United Arab Emirates to scramble little boats that would watch the U.S. Navy ships .
She became quite animated talking about how Bush " blew out of proportion " the recent incident as a way to demonize Iran .
It is always very interesting to see a person , who has had a personal experience otherwise , recognize how a politician is misleading the nation .
This young former Lieutenant will be forever changed by that experience .
So all in all the whole Bush speech was a bore and another sad moment for America .
Why do n't we ever see one Democrat stand up and say , " Bush you are full of sh*t ! "
That would be the real state of the union .
In Decemeber , President Bush claimed to pocket veto the defense authorization bill because his administration concluded -- after the bill was passed -- that a provision in the bill would " imperil " Iraqi assets in the U.S. ( of course , the administration 's panic attack over pissing off the Iraqi government is n't necessarily supported by the facts ) .
But the administration scrambled to dispose of the bill nonetheless , and now the military is facing the headaches and consequences :
The Army has temporarily halted bonus payments for more than 20 enlistment , re-enlistment and service extension programs pending enactment of authorizing legislation . [...]
If enacted as currently written , the legislation would authorize $ 696.3 billion in defense spending during 2008 , including $ 1 billion for Army accession and retention bonuses .
Until a new version of the legislation is enacted , all new bonus agreements signed on , or after , Jan. 1 must include an addendum that stipulates the soldier ’s eligibility for a future bonus .
However , the addendum also stipulates that the bonus is not guaranteed .
Payments will not be made if the affected bonus program is not authorized in the final budget compromise . [...]
Soldiers whose service contracts expire during the impasse have the option of extending month by month until the problem is worked out , or sign a service agreement on the assumption that a new authorization bill will be enacted .
Commercials can be banned for numerous reasons .
Sometimes they ’re too sexy , too inappropriate , too violent , or sometimes even too honest for TV .
The following advertisements were all yanked off the air after their short life - span on regular television .
Lucky for you , you can thank always thank WebTvHub and the internet for never holding back .
7 ) Go Daddy ’s Un-aired Super Bowl Ad
GoDaddy is known for their creative , yet risqué advertisements .
Personally , I do n’t think this one was that controversial , but the network did .
Maybe if it had been a Budweiser commercial it would have been deemed more ‘ appropriate ’ for the Super Bowl .
6 ) Every Car Needs a Trunk Monkey
Screw plasma TVs and 24 inch rims !
This car ’s powerful device wards off angry drivers .
After seeing this ad , I ’m seriously considering buying a Suburban .
This one was pulled for being too violent .
5 ) Perverted Dodge Commercial
Here ’s another car commercial with a twist - wait …that did n’t sound right .
Well , what these guys are talking about does n’t exactly sound right either .
What ’s 7 inches longer , handles great , and is loved by girls ?
A Dodge Durango of course !
4 ) Hilarious Xbox 360 Ad : Crazy Lady
It ’s a proven fact : when old people play video games , they go crazy .
Usually , though , it comes from their frustrating inability to learn the controls .
This lady , on the other hand , is way too into it .
I wish my mom was this enthusiastic about video games !
3 ) Sumo Beepers
Pagers are considered obsolete these days , but this commercial remains a classic .
Make sure to stick around for the ending .
Talk about a big finish !
2 ) Banned Condom Commercial
We ’ve shared this one on WebTVhub in the past , still , I dare you to find a commercial that is more brutally honest than this .
We ’ve all seen a similar seen at the grocery store at least one time .
Here ’s one video that needs to get played on MTV .
1 ) The Funniest Banned Commercial
Here you have it , the funniest banned commercial of all time ( and , yes , this one ’s NSFW ) .
After I saw this , it made me think about international music .
What are we really listening to when we hear music in other languages ?
That concludes my list of the funniest banned commercials .
Sure , there are others that show more gore and skin , but none of those are quite as hilarious .
The next time you see an advertisement in the same league as these , enjoy it before it gets pulled of the air .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - “ Cloverfield , ” a low - budget Godzilla - style horror movie , scared up a monstrous $ 41 million opening at the weekend box office in North America , almost twice the tally of the new romance “ 27 Dresses . ”

According to studio estimates issued on Sunday , “ 27 Dresses ” opened at No. 2 with $ 22.4 million , while last weekend ’s champ “ The Bucket List ” fell to No. 3 with almost $ 15.2 million .
The top - 10 contained one other new release , “ Mad Money , ” which opened at No. 7 with just $ 7.7 million .
“ Cloverfield , ” a $ 25 million movie with a no - name cast from Paramount Pictures , set a record for a January release , surpassing the $ 35.9 million reissue of “ Star Wars ” in 1997 .
It will also set a record for the Martin Luther King holiday weekend .
“ Black Hawk Down ” earned $ 33.6 million during the four - day period in 2002 .
Paramount said its movie will earn more than $ 47 million after the Monday holiday is included .
Box office observers had expected “ Cloverfield ” to open in the $ 20 million range for the three - day period , a little ahead of “ 27 Dresses . ”
They largely discounted Paramount ’s unusual forecast last week that the order would be reversed .
While the two movies appeared to target completely different audiences delineated by gender , the positively - reviewed “ Cloverfield ” played more broadly than expected .
Paramount said men comprised 60 percent of the audience , and 55 percent of moviegoers were aged under 25 .
The audience for “ 27 Dresses ” was three - quarters female , Fox said .
RAMPAGE ACROSS NEW YORK
“ Cloverfield ” marks a reunion between director Matt Reeves and producer J.J. Abrams , the creators of the cult TV show “ Felicity . ”
Seen exclusively through the lens of a camcorder , it follows a group of youngsters on the run from a monster rampaging across New York .
Paramount , a unit of Viacom Inc , employed a word - of - mouth marketing campaign for the film , highlighting the image of a beheaded Statue of Liberty .
Fox spent the previous two weekends holding sneak previews of “ 27 Dresses , ” which stars “ Grey ’s Anatomy ” actress Katherine Heigl as a perennial bridesmaid .
The News Corp - owned studio said the opening was “ fantastic . ”
The film held at No. 1 in Australia for a second week , it added .
Critics ripped both “ 27 Dresses ” and “ Mad Money , ” which also targets female moviegoers .
“ Mad Money ” stars Diane Keaton , Queen Latifah and Katie Holmes as masterminds of an unlikely bank heist .
It marks the debut release of Overture Films , a unit of Liberty Media Corp . ’s cable TV operator Starz LLC .
Overture said the movie would be profitable , especially after DVD sales are factored in .
Elsewhere , the total for Warner Bros. Pictures ’ comedy “ The Bucket List , ” starring Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman , rose to $ 42.7 million .
Fox Searchlight Pictures ’ teen - pregnancy comedy “ Juno ” slipped one to No. 4 with $ 10.3 million , taking its total to $ 85.4 million .
The film began its international campaign in Australia , opening at No. 5 , the studio said .
“ National Treasure : Book of Secrets ” fell one to No. 5 with $ 8.1 million .
Walt Disney Co’s Nicolas
Cage adventure movie has earned $ 198 million to date .
Woody Allen ’s thriller “ Cassandra ’s Dream ” opened poorly in limited release , earning $ 400,000 from 107 theaters .
It was distributed by the Weinstein Co , which is run by Miramax Films founders Bob and Harvey Weinstein .

Story Highlights • NEW : Sen .
Pryor says Gonzales lied to Senate about replacing prosecutors
• Senate panel votes to authorize subpoenas for Justice Department officials
• Panel also postpones authorizing subpoenas for White House aides
• President says he's " not happy " about mistakes surrounding attorney firings
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor bluntly accused Attorney General Alberto Gonzales of lying to the Senate about replacing federal prosecutors with interim appointees and joined calls for Gonzales ' resignation Thursday .
" When an attorney general lies to a United States senator , I think it is time for that attorney general to go , " Pryor said on the Senate floor .
" He did not only lie to me as a person , but when he lied to me , he lied to the Senate and to the people I represent . "
Under a provision of the antiterrorist USA Patriot Act , interim appointees can serve indefinitely without facing Senate confirmation .
Justice Department officials initially told Congress the removals of eight attorneys were performance - related , which prompted an outcry from the fired lawyers .
U.S. attorneys are routinely replaced when a new president takes office , but their removal in the middle of a presidential administration is rare -- and some say unprecedented .
Most of the federal prosecutors claim they were the political casualties of rankling the White House , and some say they were pressured by members of Congress to expedite politically charged cases .
The administration later admitted one of the fired prosecutors , U.S. attorney H.E. " Bud " Cummins in Little Rock , Arkansas , had been removed to make way for Timothy Griffin , a former aide to White House political adviser Karl Rove .
The administration said the remainder were fired over management concerns and policy disagreements .
When asked about the matter in January , Gonzales told the Senate Judiciary Committee the Bush administration planned to replace the interim appointees with nominees who would be confirmed by the Senate .
But documents released after Monday 's resignation of Gonzales ' chief of staff , Kyle Sampson , showed Sampson hoped to " run out the clock " and keep Griffin in place over the objections of Pryor and his Arkansas colleague , Blanche Lincoln .
The Justice Department did not respond to Pryor 's accusations , but White House spokesman Tony Snow said Gonzales continues to enjoy President Bush 's confidence .
Bush said Wednesday he is " not happy " about mistakes surrounding the decision to fire the eight attorneys , but his faith in his attorney general is unwavering .
( Watch Bush defend Gonzales but express displeasure )
Gonzales said Tuesday that Sampson was in charge of the shakeup and was asked to resign for failing to share information with other Justice Department officials .
That failure led to Justice Department officials giving " incomplete " explanations for the shakeup to Congress , the attorney general said .
A lawyer for Sampson declined comment when contacted by CNN .
Tuesday 's disclosures have led to calls for Gonzales ' head from several Democratic senators and one Republican , New Hampshire 's John Sununu .
Subpoenas target Justice
In a voice vote earlier Thursday , the Senate Judiciary Committee authorized the use of subpoenas to elicit testimony from five current and former Justice Department officials in the probe into the dismissals of the eight attorneys .
Subpoenas were authorized for six of the attorneys as well .
" If I do not get the cooperation , I will subpoena , " said Sen. Patrick Leahy , the panel 's chairman , during the hearing .
" We will have testimony under oath before this committee .
We 'll have the chance for both Republicans and Democrats to ask questions , and we 'll find out what happened . "
But the committee 's ranking Republican warned against moving too hastily .
" I think the subpoena issue has to be handled with great delicacy because when a subpoena is issued there is a suggestion that the person will not come in voluntarily , " said Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania .
" When the person will not come in voluntarily , there is a suggestion that the person has something to hide . "
The committee postponed a vote on the authorization to use subpoenas to compel White House officials to testify , including Rove and former White House counsel Harriet Miers .
Chairman : Committee ' misled '
Leahy , a Democrat from Vermont , said Wednesday he told Gonzales that he was " furious " with how his department handled the dismissals .
( Watch Leahy insist on testimony under oath )
The senator went on to say he felt Gonzales and Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty were less than forthcoming when they attended earlier hearings on the matter .
" I believe that they misled my committee .
Whether it was deliberate or not is what we 're going to have to find out , " Leahy said .
Leahy delivered his remarks -- and his threat to subpoena members of the Bush administration , including Rove -- as Sununu became the first Republican senator to call for Gonzales ' head .
Leahy bristled at the idea that Gonzales and White House counsel Fred Fielding would decide whether to " allow " members of the administration to testify .
In remarks directed toward Fielding , Leahy said , " Frankly , I do n't care whether he says he 's going to allow people or not .
We 'll subpoena the people we want .
If they want to defy the subpoena , then you get into a stonewall situation I suspect they do n't want to have . "
The senator recalled a conversation he had with Gonzales in which the attorney general said there were low - level Justice Department staffers he did n't want to testify .
( Watch a Republican strategist defend the firings )
" I said , frankly , Mr. Attorney General , it 's not your decision .
It 's mine and the committee's .
We will have subpoenas .
I would hope that they will not try to stonewall subpoenas , " Leahy said .
Gonzales acknowledges mistakes
Gonzales conceded Wednesday he " absolutely " should have been more involved in the decision to fire the eight prosecutors .
The attorney general said he charged Sampson with determining " where we could do better " after Miers , then - White House counsel , suggested firing all 93 U.S. attorneys , an idea Gonzales says he opposed .
Sampson came back with the list of names of eight U.S. attorneys whose dismissals have sparked the political furor .
Sununu said Wednesday that Gonzales should follow suit or be replaced .
" The president should fire the attorney general and replace him as soon as possible with someone who can provide strong , aggressive leadership , " Sununu said in a statement .
( Watch Gonzales navigate a minefield of questions )
Sununu said Gonzales had lost all credibility because of the firings , controversy over renewal of the USA Patriot Act and a report last week that the FBI had underreported its use of national security letters to snoop on Americans .
" These failures have created a deep , widespread lack of confidence , " Sununu said .
Snow said Bush was disappointed with Sununu 's stance .

Lobby offers GOPers $ 10,000 to prove anti–medical pot claims
The Marijuana Policy Project ( MPP ) next week plans to offer GOP presidential wannabes $ 10,000 if they can back up their claims that medical marijuana is either unnecessary or " too dangerous " for medical use .
According to an MPP official , the Washington , D.C. –based group and two medical marijuana– using patients will hold a news conference in Manchester , N.H. , on Thursday ( Dec. 6 ) at which the pot reform lobby will offer the max political contributions ( $ 5,000 for the primary campaign , $ 5,000 for the general election ) to Rudy Giuliani , John McCain and Mitt Romney if they can provide evidence backing up their statements .
Mind you , the MPP , which believes pot should be regulated like alcohol , does n't expect to be forking out any dough .
To wit : the event will reportedly feature a billboard featuring images of all three candidates sporting Pinocchio - like noses after the fairy tale character whose schnoz grew longer with each fib .
" For months , Giuliani , Romney and McCain have been making statements about medical marijuana that are simply false — claiming , for example , that medical marijuana is either not needed or too dangerous to use as medicine , " the MPP official says .
" We 've offered them the scientific evidence and they 've chosen to ignore it .
So , if they wo n't listen to science or compassion , we 're going to try speaking a language we know they understand — campaign contributions .
It 's time for these candidates to either prove what they 've been saying or stop lying to the voters . ''

America , land of the tubby
The latest stats on adult obesity in the U.S. are out :
The good news is that they do n't seem to be rising dramatically , the bad news is that they 're not going down , either .
A hefty ( no pun intended ) 72 million Americans are now considered to be porcine , but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reports that the adult obesity rates seem to be holding steady at around 34 percent .
According to the CDC , obesity rates in this country had been inching up since 1980 , when around 15 percent of the adult population was considered to be too beefy .
The CDC 's newest report is based on a survey of 4,400 adults ages 20 and older in 2005 and 2006 .
Seems women are doing a bit better than the men in keeping a lid on poundage :
The obesity rate for women has been about the same since 1999 –2000 , whereas for males it has climbed from around 27.5 percent .
No word yet on the latest rates of childhood corpulence , though last time the CDC looked ( 2003 –2004 ) they were on the rise .

Research warns CT scans could up cancer risk
A new study says that millions of Americans , especially children , may be needlessly receiving CT ( computed tomography ) scans , warning that radiation from the x-rays ( which provide three - dimensional views of organs and tissue ) in a few decades could cause as many as 2 percent of all cancers in the U.S.
" We are very concerned about the built - up public health risk over a long period of time , " study co-author Eric Hall of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Medical Center told the Associated Press .
Hall and colleague David Brenner argued in The New England Journal of Medicine that though the scans can be life savers by diagnosing injuries , cancer and other health woes , they are used far too routinely given the potential dangers .
It is commonly believed that x-rays are harmless , because of the relatively small amounts of radiation involved .
But Hall and Brenner show this is unlikely in the case of CT scans .
They base their conclusions on studies of thousands of Japanese atomic bomb survivors who were about two miles ( 3 kilometers ) away from the explosions and received radiation doses similar to several CT scans .
About 62 million scans were conducted in the U.S. last year ( more than four million of them on children ) , up from three million in 1980 .
The researchers stress that in most cases the benefits outweigh the risks , but said that as many as a third of all CT scans are unnecessary , meaning that as many as 20 million adults and more than one million kids a year may be needlessly put at risk .
They recommended three ways to reduce associated risks : lower the CT - related radiation doses in individual patients ; use alternatives with no radiation risk when possible such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ; and decrease the total number of CT scans prescribed .

Hint : Do n't drink the hand sanitizer
Hey kids , take note : Alcohol hand scrubs are designed to clean your hands — not to drink .
Physicians in the U.K. report in the British Medical Journal that the number of incidents of poisoning from alcohol hand rubs reported to London poison centers climbed in the 16 months surrounding widespread introduction of the sanitizers .
They say little kids and elderly adults drank it by mistake but unlike those whose ignorance could be excused , adults tended to deliberately down them .

Over - the - counter drug slows lung damage in cystic fibrosis
Researchers report in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine that ibuprofen can slow the loss of lung function in children and teens suffering from cystic fibrosis ( CF ) .
The reason : lung damage is caused by inflammation and ibuprofen is an effective anti-inflammatory .
In a study of more than 10,000 [ OR : 10,325 ] patients ( 1,365 who took the anti-inflammatory drug and 8,960 who did not ) , those who took high doses of ibuprofen twice daily over a period of two to seven years had a 29 percent less decline in lung function than those who did not use it .
Each dose ranged from 20 to 30 milligrams per kilogram of the patient 's weight ; some took up to 1,600 milligrams per dose ( generally over - the - counter preparations advise a maximum daily dose of 1,200 milligrams for adults and children over age 12 ) .
Researchers said the benefits outweigh the slight risk of gastrointestinal bleeding from ibuprofen .
" There is still some concern about the safety of ibuprofen , " said lead researcher Michael Konstan , director of the Cystic Fibrosis Center at Rainbow Babies and Children 's Hospital , and a professor of pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland .
" We continue to search for even safer approaches to anti-inflammatory treatment for CF .
In the meantime , we think that CF patients , especially children and adolescents with early lung disease , should be treated with ibuprofen . "
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that causes mucus to be thick and sticky .
It clogs the lungs , causing breathing problems and repeated bacterial infections that lead to lung - damaging chronic inflammation that is almost always fatal .

Toll from pet food contamination
A new Michigan State University ( M.S.U. ) survey shows that 348 dogs and cats apparently died this year from eating tainted pet food .
The survey , based on data from veterinarians , veterinary technicians and pathologists , also determined that the deaths may have been caused by a potentially deadly combination of two food contaminants — melamine and cyanuric acid .
" Separately , those two compounds are pretty harmless , but when combined they form crystals which can block the kidneys , " said Wilson Rumbeiha , an associate professor in M.S.U.'s Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health .
" And , unfortunately , these crystals do n't dissolve easily .
They go away slowly , if at all , so there is the potential for chronic toxicity . "
The chemicals were found in pet grub imported from China and had reportedly been added to try to artificially inflate the protein levels .
Reports of dying pooches and kitties led to a massive recall of affected pet foods and treats .
According to the survey , 236 cats and 112 pups were among the victims .
Rumbeiha speculated that more cats got sick because they are smaller ; tiny breed dogs were also found to be more vulnerable .
Among other findings : nearly 98 percent of the cases were in the U.S. and the remaining 2 percent in Canada ; Texas suffered the most cases , followed by Illinois and Michigan ; the animals affected ranged in age from two months to 18 years of age ; and , about 25 percent of the affected animals had preexisting kidney or cardiovascular conditions that made them more susceptible .

Got hormones ?
Want to know if the milk you buy contains hormones ?
Good luck in Pennsylvania .
The state agriculture department there recently barred farmers from telling consumers whether or not they 're feeding their cows hormones .
The move prompted over 65 consumer , agricultural , animal protection , retail and public health organizations to write a letter to Gov. Ed Rendell ( D. ) urging him to override it .
" The PDA [ Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture ] action interferes with consumers ' right to know about the foods they eat , " Joseph Mendelson , legal director of the Washington , D.C. –based Center for Food Safety , said in a statement .
" Many consumers prefer to buy milk produced by cows not treated with artificial hormones , as evidenced by the success in stores across the country of such milk . "
The PDA in October reportedly told 16 state dairies that they could not use certain labels on milk , including " Our farmers ' pledge : No artificial growth hormones " ; " From cows not treated with the growth hormone rBST " ; and " Free of artificial growth hormones . "
The ban is set to take effect on February 1 .
" We urge the State of Pennsylvania to rescind this poorly conceived policy which interferes with the rights of farmers , dairies and consumers , and constitutes inappropriate government interference in the marketplace , " said Ronnie Cummins , National director of the Minnesota - based Organic Consumers Association .
" This new policy on the part of PDA was issued with no opportunity for comment or input from consumers , dairy farmers , processors or the general public , and as such , is a violation of basic democratic process . "
Lawyer did n't transmit TB to other passengers
Apparently no fellow passengers contracted tuberculosis from the globe - trotting lawyer who flew to Italy in May to get married while stricken with a virulent form of tuberculosis .
The Associated Press reports that preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that about 250 U.S. passengers aboard a May 12 Air France flight from Atlanta to Paris with Andrew Speaker tested negative for the respiratory ailment ; ditto those on a return flight from Prague to Montreal , according to Canadian health officials .
Speaker sparked international outrage when it was learned that he continued with his travel plans despite warnings from health officials that he tested positive for the respiratory ailment .

New recommendations from American Pain Society , American College of Physicians are based on research conducted at the Oregon Evidence - Based Practice Center , Oregon Health & Science University
A summary of evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of low - back pain has prompted the American Pain Society ( ASP ) and the American College of Physicians ( ACP ) to issue a new treatment guideline .
The guideline is based on a thorough analysis of published research conducted by investigators at the Oregon Evidence - Based Practice Center at Oregon Health & Science University .
Among the recommendations issued by a panel of experts convened by the ACP and ASP are : Clinicians should rely less on X - rays and expensive diagnostic imaging and reports and more on therapies support by the evidence , including some medications and some alternative therapies .
The guideline and two background papers are published in the October issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine .
" There is good evidence that clinicians should not order X - rays or other imaging tests for patients with nonspecific low - back pain .
They are not helpful and could result in excessive radiation exposure or unnecessary procedures , " said Roger Chou , M.D. , co-author of the new guidelines , senior author of both background papers , and associate professor of medicine ( general internal medicine and geriatrics ) and medical informatics and clinical epidemiology in the OHSU School of Medicine , Oregon Evidence - Based Practice Center at OHSU .
That said , clinicians should order diagnostic imaging tests for patients known or believed to have underlying neurological or spinal disorders , Chou explained .
Chou also is head of the American Pain Society 's Clinical Practice Guideline Program .
About one if four Americans experiences low - back pain at least once a day , resulting in more than $ 26 billion in direct health care costs , studies have shown .
And low - back pain is the fifth most common reason patients make a doctor 's appointment .
The new guideline recommends clinicians weigh carefully potential benefits and risks of any drug and explain that they be used based on the severity of baseline pain and functional impairment .
" Some medications offer some benefits for low - back pain but they have risks , " said Chou .
" For example , acetaminophen is safe but not that effective , NSAIDs [ nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ) like ibuprofen provide more relief but have gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects , and opioids can treat severe pain but pose risks for sedation and dependence over time .
Physicians and patients should discuss proven options and select the ones that best suit their specific needs . "
There are a number of treatments for low - back pain that do n't include medication , such as supervised exercise therapy , chiropractic care and massage therapy .
The guideline suggests these options for patients who do not improve with self - care or pain medication .
The Annals article covers low - back - pain treatment in primary care settings only , and does not make recommendations regarding specialized , invasive procedures to treat the condition .
Chou said APS will release the complete guideline in 2008 covering both the primary care recommendations as well as invasive treatments for low - back pain .
Members of the panel who issued the guideline represent more than 15 different areas of expertise
Their seven recommendations are :
Clinicians should conduct a focused history and physical examination to help place patients with low - back pain into one of three broad categories : nonspecific low - back pain , back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy ( nerve disorders ) or spinal stenosis ( narrowing ) , or back pain associated with another specific cause .
The history should include assessment of psychosocial risk factors , which predict risk for chronic disabling back pain .
Clinicians should not routinely obtain imaging or other diagnostic tests in patients with non-specific low - back pain .
Clinicians should perform diagnostic imaging and testing for patients with low - back pain when severe or progressive neurologic deficits are present or when serious underlying conditions are suspected .
Clinicians should evaluate patients with persistent low - back pain and signs or symptoms of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis with magnetic resonance imaging ( preferred ) or computed tomography only if they potential candidates for surgery or epidural steroid injection ( for suspected radiculopathy ) .
Clinicians should provide patients with low - back pain evidence - based information about their expected course , advise patients to remain active , and provide information about effective self - care options .
For patients with low - back pain , clinicians should consider the use of medications with proven benefits in conjunction with back care information and self care .
Clinicians should assess the severity of baseline pain and functional deficits , potential benefits , risks , and relative lack of long - term efficacy and safety data before initiating therapy .
For patients who do not improve with self - care options , clinicians should consider the addition of non-pharmacologic therapy with proven benefits for low - back pain .
They are spinal manipulation for acute low - back pain ; and for chronic or sub-acute low - back pain options include : intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation , exercise therapy , acupuncture , massage therapy , spinal manipulation , yoga , cognitive - behavioral therapy , or progressive relaxation .

“ Today ’s problems have less to do with the size of the economic pie than the way it is divided . ”
This , according to a New York Times article , is what Hillary Clinton ’s economic advisers believe .
I ’m certain John Edwards ’ economic team would agree with the statement , and I suspect Barack Obama ’s would too .
Is this a sensible view ?
That ’s a large question , but here is one way to think about it .
The solid lines in the following chart show trends since World War II in inflation - adjusted incomes of families at the 60th , 40th , and 20th percentiles of the income distribution .
The data are from the Census Bureau ( here ) .
From 1947 to 1973 , incomes at each of these three levels grew at an annual rate of about 2.7 % .
That was approximately the same as — actually slightly faster than — the rate of growth of the economy as a whole ; GDP per capita during that period grew at a rate of 2.5 % per year .
Since 1973 incomes in the middle and lower portion of the distribution have increased much less rapidly : 0.8 % per year at the 60th percentile , 0.5 % per year at the 40th , and just 0.3 % per year at the 20th .
Is this because the economy as a whole has failed to grow ?
No .
The annual growth rate of per capita GDP since 1973 has been 1.9 % .
Instead , it ’s because most of that economic growth has gone to those at the top of the distribution .
The dashed lines in the chart show what incomes at the 60th , 40th , and 20th percentiles would have looked like had they grown at the same 1.9 % - per - year pace as the economy since 1973 .
The difference is striking .
Incomes for a very large swath of the American population would be much higher — $ 15,000 to $ 30,000 higher — if economic growth since the mid-1970s had been distributed more equally .
Some will respond that the heavily skewed distribution of post - 1973 economic growth contributed to that growth .
In other words , the pie would now be smaller if those below the top had gotten more of it during the past generation .
If you believe that , see this post .

She may look like she 's had an accident with a bowl of spaghetti .
But five - month - old Almita Knutsson 's unusual head wear has a far more serious purpose .
From the 128 probes attached to her scalp monitoring electromagnetic brain activity , scientists will gather information they hope could lead to a breakthrough in the understanding of autism .

The Baby Lab project studies up to 20 children at a time , examining what is going on inside their heads as they are shown a variety of different objects or colours .
" Our goal is to learn how we communicate with each other , how we interpret other people 's feelings and other peoples reactions , " said project leader Dr Par Nystrom .

" Kids with autism have problems in these specific areas .
In the future we hope to be able to help them . "
Over half a million people in the UK suffer from autism , which leaves them struggling to communicate effectively .
Boys are four times more likely to develop it than girls and there is no known cause and no cure .
Researchers at Uppsala University , north of Stockholm , invested hundreds of thousands of pounds in developing equipment suitable for the studies , which are being conducted on children between four and 12 months .
Initially the probes were too heavy and uncomfortable for the babies , but engineers - have now created a lightweight net of foam - covered sensors which makes the experience much more palatable .
Sessions last for less than half an hour and parents are always by the baby 's side .
" The difficult thing with kids is that we have to arrange the experiment as a kind of playtime to keep them happy , " said Dr Nystrom .
" So we play with objects , for example a toy train , and monitor their gaze as we move it around . "
The brain more than doubles its volume over the first year of life and changes substantially as the baby develops .
The Swedish scientists established the experiment to help them learn more about that rapid early development .
One of the key areas of study is eyesight , which changes dramatically from the first few weeks when a baby cannot focus on objects further than eight to 15 inches away , to being able to track objects such as a toy at greater distances .

One afternoon , we returned to Puuhonua o Honaunau to make use of another budget - friendly feature : free beachside barbecue grills .
Equipped with charcoal and utensils from Lucky Farm , and a cooler full of ingredients from local markets , we cooked up a feast of tombo tuna , mahi-mahi and corn on the cob ( which we soaked in a tidal pool to dampen the husks ) .
Along with an octopus - and - cucumber kimchi and a few bottles of pale ale from the Kona Brewing Company , we spent about $ 20 — perhaps a quarter of what the same meal would cost in an up - island restaurant like Merriman ’s in Waimea , where the ponzu - marinated mahi-mahi is $ 34.95 .
Plus , we got to watch the sun sink into the Pacific , turning the water cool and silver before plunging us into darkness .
Try as we did to visit all the island ’s beaches , parks and inexpensive restaurants , we soon came to understand why it ’s called the Big Island : it ’s really big ( almost the size of Connecticut ) .
With limited time , we saw only the white , yellow and gray sand beaches — not the black or green ones ; we lunched on rich kalua pork and poi at Super J’s ( $ 7 ) , but never found the time for loco moco , the Hawaiian comfort dish of hamburger , a fried egg and gravy over rice , at Kenny ’s , on the east coast .
Saddest of all , we never made it to Volcanoes National Park .
But we did join Arnaud and Stéphanie , a young French couple who ’d lucked into the Coffee Barn , on an excursion to Mauna Kea , the 13,796 - foot mountain that is Hawaii ’s tallest .
After a brief stop at the golden beach at the Four Seasons resort — access to the shoreline is a much - disputed public right — we began our ascent in a 4 x 4 and watched the landscape change , first subtly to the grassy , temperate ranches where local cattle roam , then dramatically to the treeless moonscape of lava fields below Mauna Kea ’s peak .
Surrounded by the white domes of stellar observatories , we gazed out on a carpet of clouds below us , and once again the sun turned the sky crimson before disappearing , revealing the vast band of the Milky Way encircling us .
So much was left to do on the Big Island , but we had to depart — after all , what ’s a Hawaiian vacation without a little island - hopping ?
Thanks to an explosion of low - cost airlines , it ’s easy to bounce around cheaply :
Our round - trip tickets to Kauai on Go! cost $ 118 each , including a discount simply for joining the frequent - flier program .
That ’s not much for what amounts to a trip in a time machine — from the youngest of the main Hawaiian islands to the oldest .
Where the Big Island is vast and spacious , its lava fields flowing gently to the sea , five - million - year - old Kauai is knotty and lush , with eroded spires of volcanic rock shooting up from dense jungles of palms and pines , bamboo and guava groves .
Kauai was the setting for “ Jurassic Park , ” and in this prehistoric setting , it ’s not hard to imagine a couple of raptors sunning themselves at your side on one of the soft , sandy beaches that circle virtually the entire island .
A research team has for the first time ever discovered DNA from living bacteria that are more than half a million years old .
Never before has traces of still living organisms that old been found .
The exceptional discovery can lead to a better understanding of the aging of cells and might even cast light on the question of life on Mars .
The discovery was made by Professor Eske Willerslev from the University of Copenhagen and his international research team .
All cells decompose with time .
But some cells are better than others to postpone the decomposing and thus delay aging and eventually death .
And there are even organisms that are capable of regenerate and thereby repair damaged cells .
These cells -- their DNA -- are very interesting to the understanding of the process of how cells break down and age .
The research team , which consists of experts in , among other things , DNA traces in sediments and organisms , have found ancient bacteria that still contains active and living DNA .
So far , it is the oldest finding of organisms containing active DNA and thus life on this earth .
The discovery was made after excavations of layers of permafrost in the north - western Canada , the north - eastern Siberia and Antarctica .
The project is about examining how bacteria can live after having been frozen down for millions of years .
Other researchers has tried to uncover the life of the past and the following evolutionary development by focusing on cells that are in a state of dead - like lethargy .
" We , on the other hand , have found a method that makes is possible to extract and isolate DNA traces from cells that are still active .
It gives a more precise picture of the past life and the evolution towards the present because we are dealing with cells that still have a metabolistic function -- unlike " dead " cells where that function has ceased , " says Eske Wilerslev .
After the fieldwork and the isolation of the DNA , the researchers compared the DNA to DNA from a worldwide gene - bank in the US to identify the ancient material .
Much in the same way the police compares fingerprints from a crime , the researchers were able to place the DNA more precisely and to place it in a context .
There is a very long way , of course , from our basic research towards understanding why some cells can become that old .
But it is interesting in this context to look at how cells break down and are restored and thus are kept over a very long period .
The researchers ' methods and results can be used to determine if there was ever life on Mars the way we perceive life on earth .
And then there is the grand perspective in relation to Darwin 's evolution theory .
It predicts that life never returns to the same genetic level .
" But our findings allows us to post the question : are we dealing with a circular evolution where development , so to speak , bites its own tail if and when ancient DNA are mixed with new ? " says Eske Willerslev .
The discovery is being published in the current issue of PNAS ( Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences ) .
The following is an excerpt from Kolko ’s 2002 Book Another Century of War , published by New Press .
Communism ’s virtual disappearance caused the geopolitical and strategic factors that produced alliances and coalitions after 1947 to decline and lose their justifications everywhere , but new ones have been more difficult to make .
The situation in the entire Islamic world is too unstable , the outcome of the changes that are occurring within it unknowable .
But America ’s war in Afghanistan further destabilized Pakistan and weakened the ruling family in Saudi Arabia , making the longer term consequences of the conflict there pale in importance .
Any upheavals in either of these two crucial nations are likely to bring to power men essentially sympathetic to one or another brand of Islamic fundamentalism .
To win the war militarily but lose it politically would be a disaster for the United States , one it is very likely going to have to confront soon .
There are a number of ways Pakistan could be shaken to its core , and Washington was aware of these dangers but it decided to play a very dangerous game with high risks , and now there is a strong chance it will see the worst case realized .
Some of these issues are very old , involving Pakistan ’s fundamental interests in seeing a friendly regime rule its northern neighbor , and will continue in the future regardless of whether or not General Pervez Musharraf continues to rule .
Until the fighting was resolved Pakistan had a great deal more leverage in dealing with the US , but the moment it ended it lost most of it .
Pakistani public sentiment was from the inception hostile to Musharraf ’s alliance with America .
In mid-October 2001 , public opinion was 87 percent opposed to the US attacks and nearly two - thirds were pro-Taliban .
Thousands of Pakistani men  Pashtuns  have gone to Afghanistan in recent years to fight for the Taliban .
Pakistan is and was a politically fragile partner of whatever the US chooses to label its relationship , and to base its strategy in the region on it was folly , for the worst of all worlds is to destabilize it , leading to Islamic fundamentalists taking power  for the nation to be " Talibanized , " as one former Pakistani senior official put it .
But no one could predict the sequence of events that brought India and Pakistan at the end of 2001 to the awesome brink of their fourth war since 1947 , yet now each possesses nuclear weapons .
In October 2001 Pakistan - supported Kashmiri terrorists assaulted the parliament in Indian - controlled Srinagar in Kashmir and killed thirty - eight people .
Then on December 13 they attacked India ’s parliament in Delhi itself , resulting in fourteen deaths .
Both India and Pakistan readied their nuclear bombs while intensive fighting with conventional weapons erupted along the cease - fire line in Kashmir , a line which was established in this largely Muslim province in 1948 and gives India about two - thirds of the disputed territory .
This unforeseen event was a windfall for India , which chose to attempt finally to resolve the principal dispute that has produced a guerrilla war which has caused at least 33,000 deaths and blighted relations between the two states for over a half - century .
Its military mobilization was the largest in its history and it showed no readiness to back away from war  politically , indeed , the Indian government could not do so easily without Pakistan making significant concessions .
The frightening Pakistan - India confrontation revealed that the US ’ actions have destabilized the entire precarious South Asian geopolitical balance , and this is of far greater consequence over the longer term than what happens in Afghanistan .
Pakistan has lost what it terms " strategic depth " in Afghanistan , leaving it more than ever vulnerable to Indian demands that Pakistan end its claims on Indian - controlled Kashmir and cease supporting guerrillas there .
Washington officials sought to court both Pakistan and India , and the Indians correctly pointed out that the Taliban regime and al - Qaeda trained many of the separatist guerrillas in Indian - held Kashmir ; over half of those killed there since 2000 are of foreign nationality  mainly Pakistanis but also Arabs , some of whom gained experience while fighting Soviet troops .
Pakistan became the principal source of support for these guerrillas after 1990 ; it calls them freedom fighters , but many are Islamic extremists recruited by pro-Taliban Islamic groups in Pakistan and now largely controlled by a branch of Pakistan ’s intelligence .
No one , Musharraf made it clear in his ostensible peace overture to India at the beginning of this year , would be handed over to foreign authorities , including those involved in the attack on India ’s parliament .
But he closed training camps for Kashmir guerrillas in Pakistan at the beginning of this year to placate India , outlawed five " extremist " organizations supporting them , detained over 1,400 people , and said he would impose controls over the Islamic schools which are the hotbed from which the Taliban emerged .
These organizations trained at least 5,000 men and they are likely to go underground , becoming potentially even more dangerous .
That they represent a relatively small minority is less consequential than their determination .
India is interested in deeds , not words , and certainly did not demobilize the vast armies it stationed on Pakistan ’s borders .
By breaking with Islamic extremists , as India and Washington demands he do as part of the war on terrorism , Musharraf also risks undermining his Kashmir policy and the support of the military .
Musharraf simply cannot afford to turn the Islamicists and their allies in the military against him , and in January of this year , even when on the brink of war with India over Kashmir , he stated he would not cut Pakistani aid to those indigenous Kashmiris fighting India ’s control of the disputed province .
He wished to prevent another war with India but he also vaguely declared that Pakistan was as committed to the Kashmir cause as ever .
Whether he has the power or will to end support to the Pakistan - based terrorists who are India ’s principal foes in Kashmir is still an open question .
There is an independent dynamic in Kashmir and too many unpredictable factors to assume that the contentious problems there will be settled soon .
These questions may be answered by time this book appears in print , but if not they will remain enduring and reemerge sooner or later .
Meanwhile there will be acute , frightening tension between two nations that have often fought each other .
What the crisis does confirm , regardless of any short - term settlements that may be reached , is that any dispute between nuclear powers can threaten the peace and stability of entire regions , and that as more nations acquire these weapons the world will become even more dangerous  and hence rational political solutions , compromises , and arms control become more imperative .
Whether or not this occurs is another matter entirely .
Pakistan was much more important than India to the US only as long as it fought in Afghanistan , but its tradition of coups  which is how General Musharraf came to power in October 1999  makes it all the more unstable and worrisome to the Bush Administration .
But it sought to reassure India , which rightly believed that the US had tilted to Pakistan .
The US now confronts a geopolitical dilemma in South Asia that it cannot solve .
Its relations with India and the Kashmir question are of primordial importance to Pakistan , and the control over its nuclear arsenal of twenty to fifty warheads and the missiles to deliver them is linked to it .
It also has a very great security interest in seeing a friendly Afghanistan on its long northern border  which means Pashtuns must control it .
The Northern Alliance has few Pashtuns in its ranks and its quick military triumph in the cities during the first weeks of the war was due wholly to the support of American air power , just as aviation was quickly effective only because the Alliance ’s troops forced the Taliban to concentrate their soldiers .
The Bush Administration was unwilling to send large numbers of soldiers or risk the casualties that fighting in cities entails , and so Pakistan ’s interests in having Pashtuns play an important role in the future were ignored .
Defense Secretary Rumsfeld has admitted that this " cooperative effort " was decisive and that the Alliance played the role of proxies for American ground forces ; in addition to air power they supplied the it with food , money to buy warlords ’ fealties , and munitions .
One byproduct was that a great many Taliban and al - Qaeda leaders  including bin Laden himself  were able to bargain or buy their escapes from their pragmatic Afghan opponents , thereby depriving the US of the total elimination of its enemies which was one of its principal war aims .
Much to the US ’ dismay , some captured senior Taliban military as well as civil officials were almost immediately allowed to go free .
The US did not want Alliance forces to enter Kabul , but it knew that there was not the slightest reason to assume that the warlords comprising it would obey America .
But the Alliance openly detests Pakistan , which created and backed the Taliban and allowed it to keep its embassy open long after the war began .
Among the first actions of the new regime in Kabul was to send its foreign minister to Delhi
Pakistan ’s security interests have now been imperiled and its enemies are again on its borders ; Afghanistan is very likely to be Pakistan ’s fractious , unstable neighbor .
Musharraf not only lost his gamble there , he lost it very badly .
" A strategic debacle , " a " quagmire , " is how senior Pakistanis described the situation at the end of last November even before the crisis with India erupted .
If the remnants of the Taliban or Pashtuns fight whatever government emerges in the north then Pakistan will be under great pressure to get involved in some way , ranging from opening its borders to supplying the regime ’s opponents .
It has done so in the past , often .
Pakistan ’s nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of Islamic extremists is a possibility , however remote , and it will exist as long a significant part of the military and intelligence  estimates run between 25 and 30 percent  are strong Islamicists .
This risk is also inherent in the proliferation of nuclear weapons , whatever the country , and while the Pakistanis assure everyone that they have firm control over their bombs they also briefly detained several of their leading nuclear scientists who are Islamic fundamentalists and friendly to the Taliban .
The situation in South Asia is much more dangerous than ever before , but that is the way the world has become in the 21st century .
Pakistan ’s instability is very much linked to the power its intelligence service ( ISI ) amassed while working as the CIA ’s conduit to the mujahedin in the 1980s .
Dismissing the head of the agency at the beginning of October 2001 was a gesture only ; most of its members are hostile to the US war because the political turmoil which followed the Soviet defeat there was the reason the Pashtun - based Taliban came to power in 1996 with the ISI ’s help .
Pakistan fears , with ample justification , that the Americans will abandon the region once they win militarily , as they did in 1989 , and that it will again have to confront a political vacuum and chaos to the north .
The Pashtuns  along with the three million Afghan refugees  are the most important ethnic group within Pakistan along the long border with Afghanistan , and this and ISI connivance explains not only why the Taliban received a considerable traffic of food and vital materials from Pakistan during October and November of 2001 but why Washington fears the ISI is helping al - Qaeda and Taliban fighters to escape now that the regime has been defeated .
Some estimates claim that as many as 2,000 of them crossed into Pakistan by the beginning of 2002 .
The entire region on both sides is essentially a Pashtun domain and some thousands of them  perhaps more  crossed the border to join the Taliban before they were defeated .
Now that the Taliban has lost , at least in the cities , Musharraf confronts opposition from these people , and it will add to his worries or even threaten his rule .
Musharraf may purge some Islamic hard - liners , and even attempt to establish relations with whatever powers exist in Afghanistan , but the basic geopolitical shift against Pakistan ’s historic interests since the fall of last year , first in Afghanistan but then in Kashmir and in its relations with India , is a reality that will haunt  and undermine  his government gravely .
Pakistan cannot militarily confront tension along both its northern and southern borders at the same time .
There are many in the intelligence service and military who regard the outcome of his policies as a disaster .
The ISI continues to be crucial in Pakistani politics and General Musharraf would not have come to power in a coup in October 1999 without the help of the ISI head , whom he fired in October 2001 .
And , more than ever , the crisis in relations with India means that he needs as wide a base of support as possible , including the Islamic groups as well as secular democrats .
Should Musharraf be replaced one way or another , then who or what will follow him is an open question , but it might include , in whole or part , the small but very militant Islamic fundamentalists .
That nuclear weapons would fall in their hands is speculation , but it is much more likely this way than any other  and that would greatly increase the dangers in South Asia .
But either way , should Musharraf be overthrown because he has been too close to the US then Pakistan would be far more hostile to America ’s role and interests in the region .
Unfortunately for Musharraf , the US was neither in a position or mood to help him install friends of Pakistan in Kabul when the war ended .
Musharraf and the ISI very much wanted the bombing to be of very short duration lest the Pakistani ’s population ’s sympathies with the Taliban continued to intensify with its suffering .
The US did not press Pakistan for the optimum use of its bases for fear of creating a potentially destabilizing public backlash , but it did get three bases in isolated Baluchistan from which several thousand of its special forces operate ; instead , it relied upon aircraft carriers as much as possible .
There were important protests but the regime could cope with them .
When the Northern Alliance ’s won in Afghanistan , Pashtuns received temporary and symbolic posts only  which means a very likely return of the instability that wracked the nation for over a decade .
The Alliance comprises a disparate , fractious united front of warlords from various ethnic minorities for whom , to quote Donald Rumsfeld , fighting " is a way of life . "
Some have switched sides  often  in return for money or promises .
Fighting between them began as soon as the Taliban was defeated in most of the country .
Without a durable political agreement that produces stability , Alliance military successes pose formidable risks that American officials are well aware of , and such an agreement has eluded the ethnically deeply divided nation for over a decade .
It was the chaos that the Alliance ’s factions produced after 1990 , especially in the cities , " which gave rise , " to quote Colin Powell , " to the Taliban . "
This is a major reason , once the war was largely won militarily , that Washington has sought to avoid any major role in resolving Afghanistan ’s internecine factional strife  " nation - building " as it is called .
It has assigned the United Nations complete responsibility for attempting to establish a coalition government .
Politically it knows the cause is likely to be lost  indeed , that Russia and Iran may become the key players in determining events there , even if Pakistan disapproves of ethnic groups hostile to it taking regional or national power .
Political disorder , even chaos , is more than likely to be the eventual outcome of its devastating bombing on behalf of the Northern Alliance ’s ground forces .
The other reason for its noninvolvement is that war there was wholly in response to the September 11 events  the US wanted to maintain its credibility , which required a war in which revenge was its principal goal .
Its political and military priorities remain elsewhere .
In a word , the US will be militarily successful but fail politically .
With good cause , the Pakistanis regard the Alliance as agents of Russia and Iran who will allow the return of anarchy and atrocities , as they did in the early 1990s .
The Northern Alliance , with equally valid reasons , considers the Taliban as a Pakistani creation , and the one thing that unites it is its hatred of Pakistan and its efforts to create a puppet regime on its border .
The US tried to do the best it could with what it has .
Politically it has made no progress in finding political or ethnic elements with whom Pakistan can live , and at the same time it badly needed the few bases the Pakistanis gave them and whatever intelligence the ISI provided .
The ISI gave far less information than the Pentagon desired or needed , and it was accused of being pro-Taliban .
Militarily the US greatly aided the Northern Alliance , over which it had very little , if any , control , because it did not find options to it , despite its intensive efforts to do so .
The US ’ unwillingness to put significant numbers of ground troops in the country before the Alliance ’s disparate components entered and took charge of the major cities strained America ’s relations with Pakistan as never before  perhaps to the breaking point .
Politically , the Alliance is anathema in most of the country , and likely to drive at least some Pashtuns who dislike the Taliban to make common cause with what is left of them .
" I think he ’s got one of the toughest jobs in the world right now , " Rumsfeld summed up Musharraf ‘s position in mid-November .
Musharraf could not or did not stop many Taliban and their Arab fighters from crossing to safety into Pakistan , and when the crisis with India began in mid-December he withdrew the 60,000 regular troops sent to the border region at the US ’ request to prevent their doing so  leaving only paramilitary forces .
But although his position at home was weakened , only time will tell if Pakistan has been destabilized fatally .
If it is , then America ’s problems will become far greater  and much more dangerous  and it may very well be preoccupied with the fragile region for much longer than it expected or intended .
What was a tactical victory in Afghanistan will then become a strategic debacle in South Asia .
In this context , Iran has begun to play a growing and opportunistic role as the game of nations is now being played for higher stakes .
It has given more arms to Shi’ite factions within the fractious Northern Alliance , as well as money to buy them from Russia  which is mixing politics and business .
Iran detested the Taliban Sunni fanaticism as an Islamic deviation , and came close to war with it in 1998 when the Taliban murdered ten Iranian diplomats , but it also greatly fears a pro-American government along its borders .
American officials accused it at the beginning of 2002 of aiding Alliance factions that are hostile to the US and aiding al - Qaeda fighters to escape its dragnet .
At the same time , Iran is seeking to exploit America ’s predicaments by getting Washington to lift sanctions it has imposed , including on constructing pipelines across it  the most logical , cheapest route .
How it plays out this heady , cynical game depends on many elements , not the least are Iran ’s real options and whether remnants of the Taliban survive the American onslaught .
Washington ’s precarious relations with Pakistan are matched by its problems with Saudi Arabia , which , as I explained in the preceding chapter , has become a much more unstable country due to various factors , of which America ’s role in the region is one of the most important .
Both nations are crucial , and were one , much less both , destabilized then the geopolitical and military problems confronting the US would be far greater .
Indeed , they very likely would be insurmountable , although the Bush Administration refused to admit that the US ’ earlier involvement in Afghanistan had created such grave risks .
The danger is that the US will improvise a response to crises in either nation that are in part or wholly of its own making , and the form its actions might take is quite unpredictable .
Bin Laden probably has a greater influence and financial contacts in Saudi Arabia than in any other country .
In part this is due to fact that the Saudis were so crucial in supplying money and men during the CIA - led war against the Soviets in Afghanistan , but instability in the internal political and social structure makes bin Laden ’s appeals resonate among younger , better educated men  precisely the kind who flew the planes on September 11 .
Many consider him a heroic figure and a dedicated Muslim .
The Saudis did not fully cooperate in 1996 in the US ’ attempt to catch the perpetrators of the bombing which killed nineteen American servicemen , they failed to help the FBI and CIA to the extent they asked regarding the nineteen men who hijacked planes on September 11 , all of whom had Saudi passports , and they have not clamped down on al - Qaeda ’s and bin Laden ’s extensive financial assets .
They have arrested some bin Laden supporters but none linked to the September 11 events .
Saudi Arabia ’s rulers have not staked their own futures on the US war in Afghanistan , which has led them to agree with some of the demands that American officials have presented but essentially they have been disingenuous with everyone and tried to keep both the Americans and irate Saudis at bay .
After prominent Muslim clerics in mid-October urged Muslims to wage a jihad against Americans within the kingdom , and came close to identifying the royal family as apostates , the regime declared its unequivocal opposition to spreading the war to any other Arab country , namely Iraq , and even declared it will side with them .
American officials claimed they were utilizing its ultramodern Saudi bases essentially as they desired , but other than using its command and coordination equipment , American planes have not flown from there to bomb Afghanistan .
The Saudis have also declared publicly they will not allow the bases to be used in a renewed full - scale war against Iraq , even in self - defense .
The exact facts will be known in due course , because it is quite possible that Saudi disclaimers are for their public ’s consumption only , but meanwhile Saudi public opinion , especially among the better - educated who dislike the regime for a variety of reasons , is very hostile to the war in Afghanistan and to the US in general .
One prominent Saudi political commentator in late October declared that the US " does n’t realize that if the government cooperates more they will jeopardize their own security . "
But Washington knows full well that its alliance with the Saudis will work only if Iraq invades the region again , which it certainly will not , but meantime it does not want to test already hostile Saudi public opinion .
At best , the Saudi regime is a reluctant , uncooperative ally , and Washington ’s repeated declarations that it is very satisfied with it masks a much more complex reality .
It is aware of the risks if the regime is replaced ; its war in Afghanistan has raised the geopolitical ante greatly , and its possible losses .
" Saudi Arabia is a pivotal country and our presence in the Gulf is strategically vital to us , " as one American official succinctly put it .
Afghanistan has made the position of the royal dynasty , already precarious , that much more unstable .
Can they weave through the incredibly complicated factors at home and abroad  in Israel especially  to survive ?
We shall see , and it is not a matter of months but of years , and the regime ’s future will be dependent on resolving or containing the accumulation of problems it faces  many of them are not of America ’s making but collectively they interact to create a highly inflammable mixture .
Were Saudi Arabia also destabilized then the US ’ would confront challenges of very great magnitude , both in the region and its petroleum supply .
It is a fact that the war in Afghanistan has weakened the regimes in both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia , perhaps fatally , and the longer the war and its politically unstable aftermath takes then the greater the risks  especially to Pakistan .
These potential dangers far exceed in strategic and economic importance the issues that were involved in finding bin Laden or removing the Taliban from power .

So , “ WhyTheHate ? , ” do you really want to know Why the Hate ?
Anonymously sending messages in favor of your own company under false pseudonyms is a form of deception ; the intentional manipulation of information , presumably for financial gain .
Why did you not just come right out and admit that you work for the company and can verify that the events are unique and legitimate … perhaps adding that your PR department decided to contact the media and spread the news ?
By taking the sleazy approach of withholding your true identity when making comments favorable to your company , the average reader can only assume that you also faked the “ pay it forward ” events … now , that ’s something that the media should pay attention to .
In a study published in Archives of Toxicology , the team compared the mutagenic effects of emissions produced by two different batches of straight rapeseed oil to the emissions produced by rapeseed methyl ester ( biodiesel ) , GTL diesel and a reference diesel fuel .
A German team of researchers has found that straight rapeseed vegetable oil used as a fuel in diesel engines shows a strong increase in the mutagenicity of emissions compared to a reference diesel fuel and other fuels .
The test engine was a heavy - duty diesel running the European Stationary Cycle .
Particulate matter was sampled onto filters and extracted .
Gas phase constituents were sampled as condensates .
The mutagenicity of the particle extracts and the condensates was tested using the Salmonella typhimurium / mammalian microsome assay with tester strains TA98 and TA100 .
Compared to DF [ diesel fuel ] the two RSO [ rapeseed oil ] qualities significantly increased the mutagenic effects of the particle extracts by factors of 9.7 up to 59 in tester strain TA98 and of 5.4 up to 22.3 in tester strain TA100 , respectively .
The condensates of the RSO fuels caused an up to factor 13.5 stronger mutagenicity than the reference fuel .
RME [ rapeseed methyl ester — biodiesel ] extracts had a moderate but significant higher mutagenic response in assays of TA98 with metabolic activation and TA100 without metabolic activation .
GTL [ gas - to - liquids ] samples did not differ significantly from DF .
In conclusion , the strong increase of mutagenicity using RSO as diesel fuel compared to the reference DF and other fuels causes deep concern on future usage of this biologic resource as a replacement of established diesel fuels .
Based on experimentation , the researchers concluded that the result does not result from the higher viscosity of straight vegetable oil compared to biodiesel and other fuels .
Whereas the legally limited emissions like carbon monoxide , hydrocarbons , particulate matter , and nitrogen oxides of RSO differed from the other fuels tested only in acceptable margins , the mutagenic effects were unexpectedly strong .
Compared to modern fossil fuels ( DF , GTL ) , biofuels can produce similarly low emissions of mutagenic compounds ( RME ) but may also have strong contrary effects ( RSO , mRSO ) .
In general , a systematic research concerning the influence of fuels on the exhaust composition of diesel ( and gasoline ) engines is urgently needed in order to develop fuels with lower emissions of hazardous substances .

One of the most wonderful things about my tiny apartment is that it is located right down the street from one of my favorite places in New York : The Rem Koolhaas - designed Prada flagship store in Soho , which , had it been around in the late 1950s , would probably have taken the place of Tiffany 's for the stylish , sad - sack Holly Golightly .
As much as I love to loiter outside , fantasizing about the fashions on display behind the store 's enormous picture windows , actually stepping foot inside unleashes my deepest sartorial insecurities :
Not only can I not exactly afford the silken turbans of yesterday and the orange fuzzy coats of today on display , but apparently this fact is something known - intuited , at least ?
- by the store 's severely - suited salespeople , who seem to regularly play retail Darwinism , casting disparaging glares at visitors who have " no reason " — meaning : no bank account — to justify being there .
So I decided to embark on what I decided to call the Pretty Woman experiment : visiting the store in different states of dress to find out whether I would be treated differently based on my appearance .

1. On August 11th , I dropped by dressed , essentially , in my pajamas : Leggings from Target , oversized red flannel shirt , glasses on , matted " morning hair " tied up in a knot and nary a lick of makeup .
Clad in this ensemble I did not garner negative attention , I immediately noticed , but no attention at all .
No one said hello as I pushed the heavy door open myself , took a quick turn around the floor , and then proceeded down the stairs to the footwear level .
Several salespeople mingled among the high - priced shoes :
It was a Saturday afternoon and the fall / winter styles had just arrived in stores , so it was prime shopping season .
I lingered for what seemed like forever before the display of the trend shoes of the season :
The ombre patent Havana - heeled pumps , the multi-hued colorblocked sandals .
I picked them up , examining their heels , their soles , their prices .
And still , nothing .
After a few minutes I gave up , headed back up the dizzying , seemingly floating blond wood stairs and headed on my merry way .
I thought I heard one of the security guards mumble , " Have a good afternoon " as I stepped out the main door and into the midday sunshine , but that could 've been wishful thinking .
2 . Two days later , I returned , this time dressed to the eights ( not nines : I was , uh , wearing Target flip - flops ) with a long , creamy Vivienne Westwood skirt belted over a black , v-neck tee .
I had on mascara , eyeliner , even blush :
No grooming detail had been overlooked , and as I approached the store , the door opened for me , almost magically .
I had hardly a moment to register the accompanying " good afternoon " when a sales clerk appeared and asked if there was anything she could help me with .
( Success !
Maybe I could leave ? ) .
I thanked her for asking and began strolling through the maze of clothing on the floor below , surrounded by knee socks and logo - stamped bags at every turn , taking my time ( I was a " lady of leisure " after all ! ) and at each different clothing rack , it seemed , found another sincere , smartly - outfitted shopgirl .
Eventually , I decided it was time to tackle footwear , and lo and behold , the second I stepped foot on the shiny , black floor of the department I heard a warm , welcoming voice , not unlike that of a fairy godmother .
I asked the saleslady if I could see the object (s ) of my desire :
The season 's new open - toed pink and black ombre Havana heels of earlier mention , with the thick elastic strap that sits across the front of the foot .
" Do you have them in a 39 ? " I asked .
Her face clouded with worry , " Ooh I 'm not sure .
Let me go check right away and see what I can do . "
She emerged moments later , looking practically crestfallen .
" We only have them in a 7 1 / 2 and a 9 1 / 2 .
Do you want to try either of those ?
Maybe the 7 1/2 will work ? "
I asked after the 9 1/2 and before I could even blink , she emerged with a shiny black box .
I slipped the shoes on : Magic .
Pure magic .
I walked , strutted , and skipped around the shoe floor .
Every once in a while , my guardian angel peeped around the corner to check on me .
" No rush !
No rush at all ! " she insisted , warmly .
I pranced some more .
And then the saleslady emerged again , informing me that she had just learned that these very shoes were 1 of 2 pairs ( the other being the 7 1/2 , naturally ) left of this style in the entire city of New York .

Needless to say , I capitulated , and , for the first time in my life , bought something Prada .
It was sick :
At the checkout registers on the main floor , I simultaneously giggled like a schoolgirl and almost teared up .
Hypnotized by the combination of shiny things and someone willing to give me the time of day , I had fallen under the luxury - market 's spell , dropping dollars faster than you can say " The devil wears ... "
But I guess one could look at it this way : someone 's gotta actually pay full price so Anna Wintour can continue to get her clothes for free , right ?
Was I duped ?
Possibly .
But better - heeled ?
Certainly .

Picture and article via The Village Voice :
Three weeks after 9/11 , when the roar of fighter jets still haunted the city 's skyline , the emir of gas - rich Qatar , Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifah al - Thani , toured Ground Zero .
Although a member of the emir's own royal family had harbored the man who would later be identified as the mastermind of the attack — a man named Khalid Sheikh Muhammad , often referred to in intelligence circles by his initials , KSM — al - Thani rushed to New York in its aftermath , offering to make a $ 3 million donation , principally to the families of its victims .
Rudy Giuliani , apparently unaware of what the FBI and CIA had long known about Qatari links to Al Qaeda , appeared on CNN with al - Thani that night and vouched for the emir when Larry King asked the mayor : " You are a friend of his , are you not ? "
Abdallah al - Thani remains a named defendant in the 9/11 lawsuits that are still proceeding in Manhattan federal court , but his Washington lawyers declined to address the charges that he shielded KSM , insisting only that he never " supported " any " terrorist acts . "
Asked if Abdallah al - Thani ever supported any terrorists rather than their acts , his lawyer David Nachman declined to comment further .
The Congressional Research Service report summarized the evidence against him : " According to the 9/11 Commission Report and former U.S. government officials , royal family member and current Qatari Interior Minister , Sheikh Abdullah ( Abdallah ) bin Khalid Al Thani , provided safe harbor and assistance to Al Qaeda leaders during the 1990s , " including KSM .
While numerous accounts have named Abdallah as the KSM tipster , the report simply says that " a high ranking member of the Qatari government " is believed to have " alerted " KSM " to the impending raid . "
In other words , as incredible as it might seem , Rudy Giuliani — whose presidential candidacy is steeped in 9/11 iconography — has been doing business with a government agency run by the very man who made the attacks on 9/11 possible .

German authorities exasperated at the antisocial behaviour of a 16 - year - old boy have sent him to a remote Siberian village for an " intensive educational experience " , it emerged today .
The unusual measure by youth welfare officers in the central state of Hesse raised fresh questions about how to deal with delinquents who have been blamed for a series of ugly crimes .
The boy , who has not been identified , was dispatched east after behaving violently in school and at home and attacking his mother .
He is being forced to fend for himself in boot camp - style conditions in the forlorn village of Sedelnikovo , several - hours drive from the city of Omsk , in the western Siberian interior .
He has had to cope by collecting and chopping firewood to make his own fires , digging his own toilet and pumping water supplies from a well .
He will stay there for nine months , separated from family and friends , the internet and television , under a programme designed specifically for him .
Under the supervision of a German assistant who speaks Russian , the boy is also attending school .
Once he returns to Germany , he will be monitored for a further two years .
" We deliberately sought a region that was particularly lacking in allure , " said Stefan Becker , the head of the youth and social department in Giessen , calling it " the ultima ratio " in the attempt to re-educate the boy , for whom all other measures had failed .
" [ The youth ] spends most of his time trying to cope with his day - to - day existence , living in conditions like we had 30 or 40 years ago , " he added .
" If he does n't chop the wood , his room is cold .
If he does n't fetch water , he can't wash himself . "
The Hesse authorities have defended the move as an " educational adventure " and say an inspector who recently visited the boy believed the " treatment " was working .
Hundreds of other youths have been sent on similar programmes in foreign countries as diverse as Greece and Kyrgyzstan .
The details have emerged in the midst of one of the most heated state election campaigns Germany has known for years , after the Christian Democratic state president of Hesse , Roland Koch , called for boot camps and " warning shot " arrests to be applied to young criminals , after a spate of violent crimes .
His election speeches have particularly focused on clamping down on immigrants , who are said to be responsible for half of all crimes committed by the under - 21s in Germany .
The chancellor , Angela Merkel , has repeatedly backed Koch 's campaign , saying that the discussion was long overdue .
But the decision to send the teenager to Siberia was a step too far for some , particularly as equally bleak regions are to be found in Germany .
One commentator called it " more akin to a reality TV show than a social welfare programme " .
Some have described it as a cost - cutting measure , which at  150 ( £ 111 ) a day is around a third of the price of a similar programme in Germany .
Mourners have been gathering at the Kenya Assemblies of God church
A mob set fire to the church in Eldoret where many people from President Mwai Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe were sheltering .
The Kenyan government has accused supporters of opposition leader Raila Odinga of carrying out " ethnic cleansing " against the Kikuyu .
Both President Kibaki and Mr Odinga have called for the killing to stop .
An estimated 250 people have died in the violence that erupted following the controversial re-election of President Kibaki , according to police and journalists across the country .
Raila Odinga 's supporters ... are engaging in ethnic cleansing ... attacking in military precision
Alfred Mutua
Kenyan government spokesman
President Kibaki , who was swiftly sworn in on Sunday amid opponents ' accusations that the poll was rigged , said political parties should meet immediately and publicly called for calm .
But Mr Odinga said he would only hold talks once the re-installed president " publicly owns up that he was not elected " .
EU observers said the poll " fell short of international standards " , and four Kenyan election commissioners have joined calls for an independent judicial body to re-examine the process .
The government has denied any irregularities .
Fresh killings
About 400 people were said to be taking refuge in the Kenya Assemblies of God church when the attack took place at about 1000 ( 0700 GMT ) .
A pastor from the church , Jackson Nyanga , told the BBC that many of the people were beaten before the building was set on fire .
" After torching the church , children died - around 25 in number - four elderly people .
And our men and our people who tried to confront them were injured , " he said .
Eldoret , in the Rift Valley , has witnessed some of the worst violence since last Sunday 's controversial poll and has a history of inter-ethnic tension .
Correspondents say that over the past few days hundreds of Kikuyus in the Eldoret area have been taking shelter in churches and around the town 's police station .
Eldoret resident Bernard Magamu told the BBC
News website that many houses and businesses have been torched , and that roads in and around the town are closed .

" People are still fearful .
It 's hard .
People are really scared , " said Mr Magamu , adding that local hospitals were struggling to cope with the high number of casualties .
The Kenyan Red Cross said that at least 70,000 people have been displaced in the Rift Valley area as a result of the unrest , describing it as " a national disaster " .
Alfred Mutua , spokesman for the Kenyan government , accused Mr Odinga 's supporters of a systematic campaign of ethnic violence .
" Raila Odinga 's supporters ... are engaging in ethnic cleansing and they are not doing it in a haphazard manner , they 're doing it in a very well organised , calculated manner ... attacking in military precision , " he told the BBC World Service .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has again urged Kenya 's political leaders to talk , and said : " The violence must be brought to an end . "
Doubts expressed
EU observers said the country 's election was flawed .
" They were marred by a lack of transparency in the processing and tallying of presidential results , which raises concerns about the accuracy of the final results , " the EU team said in a statement .

According to the EU , in at least two constituencies - Molo and Kieni - the results that were announced did not reflect the number of votes cast .
EU observers say they heard the voting figures being announced in Molo itself , but when the same results were announced again in Nairobi , the number of votes for Mr Kibaki was significantly higher - by 25,000 .
Four of the 22 Kenyan election commissioners have also expressed doubts about the veracity of the figures giving President Kibaki victory by 200,000 votes .
But Finance Minister Amos Kimunya denied his party , the ruling PNU , or the government had been involved in rigging the poll .
He told the BBC : " I have no evidence that they were rigged .
Anyone who has any information that they were rigged in one constituency or the other , or overall , let them subject it through the legal process . "
Mr Kibaki was declared the winner on Sunday after a controversial three - day counting process .
His challenger , Mr Odinga , said he was robbed of victory by alleged fraud .
Gore endorses gay marriage Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday January 23 , 2008

In a video quietly released on his Web site last week , former Vice President Al Gore came out strongly in favor of gay marriage .
" I think that gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and women , to make contracts , to have hospital visiting rights , to join together in marriage , " Gore said .
" And I dont understand why it is considered by some people to be a threat to heterosexual marriage to allow it by gays and lesbians .
Shouldnt we be promoting that kind of faithfulness and loyalty to ones partner regardless of sexual orientation ?
During his unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2000 , Gore said he supported domestic partner benefits for gays and lesbians but opposed " changing the institution of marriage as it is presently understood -- between a man and a woman . "
Gore hinted that he would come around to support same - sex marriage as early as 2006 , when speaking to a group of gay - rights activists , but his latest comments represent Gore 's first formal endorsement of equal marriage rights .
The video was posted with little commentary to Current 's Web site Jan. 17 .
It did n't receive much notice at the time , but Wednesday the video was picked up by Politico , Wonkette , The Huffington Post , DailyKos and others .
Plenty of supporters virtually begged Gore to enter the 2008 White House race , but the Nobel Prize , Emmy and Oscar - winning environmental activists demurred .
Gore had said he would endorse one of the Democratic contenders before the primary season is over , but some see chances of an endorsement fading .
Whether his latest video is simply an endorsement appetizer remains to be seen .
( CNN ) -- Military supporters descended on Berkeley early Tuesday , demanding the famously liberal California college town rescind its vote that says Marine recruiters are " not welcome in this city . "
Military supporters and anti-war demonstrators began gathering in Berkeley early Tuesday .

The pro-military demonstrators were met by anti-war protesters who had camped out overnight , setting the stage for a dramatic showdown late in the day when the City Council is to discuss whether to revoke its previous vote .
" Their treasonous action , especially at this time of war right now , is not acceptable , " said Mary Pearson , a spokeswoman for the group Move America Forward .
" It 's very , very important for everyone to stand united ... to give our Marines and all of our military the greatest respect and honor that they deserve . "
Before the sun was even up , about 300 demonstrators -- both pro-military and anti-war -- were already standing toe - to - toe in downtown .
Many traded jeers and sneers .
" Code Pink does n't stand for us , " one sign said , held by a man in military fatigues .
Signs held by anti-war activists read , " End the War " and " Bring the troops home now . "
The City Council is to meet at 7 p.m. PT on whether to take back its previous measure urging the Marine recruiters to leave town .
" If recruiters choose to stay , they do so as uninvited and unwelcome intruders , " the measure says .
It went on to say the council applauds residents and organizations that " volunteer to impede , passively or actively , by nonviolent means , the work of any military recruiting office located in the City of Berkeley . "
Ever since the council measure , protesters with the anti-war group Code Pink have camped outside the Marine recruiting office on Shattuck Avenue , singing peace songs and chanting slogans for an end to the Iraq war .

Republican lawmakers in Washington fired back last week , threatening to recall more than $ 2 million of federal funding to the city as well as money designated for the University of California - Berkeley , the campus that became a bastion of liberalism during the Vietnam War .
The Marine Corps has said it has no plans to move its office , which is located about a block from the college campus .
Whether the City Council reverses course remains to be seen .
Max Anderson , a Vietnam war veteran who serves on the council , said he fully supports the measure to get Marine recruiters out of town -- despite receiving more than 8,000 e-mails , most of them harsh in tone , on the matter .
" If the aim was to shut us down , get us to back up , get us to eat our words , get us to retreat from our position with the war , they can forget that , " he told CNN Monday .
He said he was recruited by Marines after he graduated from high school in 1963 and was promised that he and his friends would serve together .
But once they enlisted , he said , they were separated and shipped off to Vietnam .
" We 're not against the Marines per se , " he said .
" We 're against this war .
We 're against the mechanisms that support this war and send our young people over there . "
Kriss Worthington , a progressive Berkeley activist and council member for 11 years , believes the council overreached .
" The inflammatory language in the City Council item is really outrageous -- not just to right - wing people , but to mainstream liberal people and even to some peace activists who have said they 're insulted that the city would have such language , " Worthington said .
He said Berkeley owes an apology to the military and to the peace movement " for having such embarrassing language allegedly trying to promote peace . "
" When you make a colossal blunder , you can't just sort of ignore the mistake and go about your way .
You have to do something to fix it , " Worthington said .

Good for Jason Kidd .
This is what he wanted , to escape New Jersey , where , at this time of year , there is bad weather , a bad smell ( hey , you open those windows while driving on the New Jersey Turnpike ) and , most importantly , a bad team .
Now he is heading back to Dallas , with good weather , a good owner and a good team that certainly has a shot to win a championship .
( I 'm not really sure how Dallas smells , by the way , but I do sense a nice playoff run coming ) .
It took a lot longer than everyone expected -- we were originally breaking this down for fantasy , what , a week ago ? -- the Mavericks are sending five players , picks and cash to the Nets for the rights to the NBA 's No. 3 assist man , and nobody can fault them for it .
They are the latest in a line of top Western Conference teams making bold moves .
Only Devin Harris ( now that Jerry Stackhouse worked his way out of the trade ) was a key member of the team 's nightly rotation , but Kidd is No. 15 on the ESPN Player Rater , and rest assured , nobody going to the Nets is ranked anywhere close to that .
Fantasy owners expect Kidd to pile on the assists and rebound like a small forward , and he does that .
Things should n't change very much out West , although Kidd should be happier now .
He had two finishers , Richard Jefferson and Vince Carter , averaging more than 20 points per game in New Jersey , and the same will hold true with his new team .
Dirk Nowitzki and Josh Howard currently are the main scorers in Mark Cuban 's investment , and if anything , their production could rise a bit .
Harris was leading the team in assists with 5.3 per game , and Kidd could double that by himself .
Kidd is one of the top passers of this generation and gets the ball to the right places at the right times , and , of course , he can lead a fast break .
His presence could reinvigorate Nowitzki , who is having his worst statistical season in four years .
Just know that if you are thinking of dealing the farm for Kidd in your fantasy league , changing uniforms wo n't change his shot .
He is not a good shooter , in case you thought his .366 field goal percentage was a fluke .
It 's a bit low , even for him , but the best he has shot since 1999 is .414 .
So his percentage might increase a bit , but he 's not Amare Stoudemire .
Kidd contributes in 3s and ranks in the top 20 in steals , and for those who get extra points for triple - doubles , Kidd is your man .
Those numbers should n't change much in Dallas , either .
Really , it 's all good for the Mavericks .
Harris was the starting point guard ; Kidd replaces him .
Jason
Terry generally comes off the bench , and that should continue .
Lest you think Terry 's assists soon will drop , note that he was getting merely 3.3 per game .
He 's a shooter , and knows his role well .
Jose Juan Barea had been starting at point guard for Dallas with Harris out of the lineup with a left ankle bone bruise , and Brandon Bass has emerged as a productive frontcourt player .
Barea heads back to the bench now , and the Mavs could opt to start Terry or Eddie Jones at the two - spot .
Does n't much matter , as Terry will get his minutes , and whatever time Jones does get , it 's mainly irrelevant .
The players who are leaving Dallas should n't be missed too much .
DeSagana Diop was a shot - blocking presence , leaving the team with only Erick Dampier to handle those chores , but one does n't halt a trade like this over something like that .
Dampier simply will need to step up , especially when Shaquille O'Neal is a potential playoff opponent .
This might actually be a time to look at Dampier in fantasy , in those really deep leagues .
Nets fans should n't expect to see more than 20 minutes of Diop per night , especially with the recent revelations that Nenad Krstic is nearly ready to start playing major minutes .
The additions of Trenton Hassell and Maurice Ager should n't add to Nets ' season - ticket sales tomorrow .
I would n't call any Mavericks ( or Nets , for that matter ) must - pickups because of any opportunities provided by this deal .
Even Keith Van Horn .
God bless him for coming out of retirement to make this trade mercifully happen , but he is not someone you need to look at in fantasy .
Trust us .
In New Jersey , Jefferson and Carter are left behind for a 23 - 29 team that actually is the No. 7 seed in the Eastern Conference .
How proud the team must be .
Harris was drafted from Wisconsin as a point guard and could emerge as a better fantasy player with more minutes and more assists , but there 's no guarantee .
The Nets , even with distributor Kidd , were No. 28 in the league in scoring .
Dallas should get to the top 10 after this deal .
Harris ' 5.3 assists per game ( incidentally , easily a career best ) wo n't cut it in fantasy .
And it 's not like Harris suddenly will score 20 points per night , either , not with Jefferson and Carter demanding shots .
Harris ' first problem is to get healthy ; he is expected to be ready to play this week .
His second problem will be becoming more of a natural playmaker and piling on the assists .
Does he have it in him ?
Carter is averaging more than six assists per game , which could rise actually , and I do n't expect Harris to all of a sudden start getting eight or nine per night .
He 's just not that type of player , yet .
The Nets would also like to get a look at Marcus Williams , the second - year point from Connecticut who had 11 points and five assists in the team 's recent game sans Kidd , but he wo n't play over Harris .
He should see an increase in minutes , especially initially .
Do not assume Harris becomes a fantastic fantasy option because of this trade .
It 's likely his numbers wo n't change much .

Fox News ’ ratings take another slide
I ’ll admit it ; I have a special fondness for news about Fox News ’ declining ratings .
There ’s just something about the drop in numbers that helps restore my faith in the American political system .
Eric Boehlert has the latest , in a great piece on why the Republican network is poised to have a very rough year .
The point is that Fox News years ago made an obvious decision to appeal almost exclusively to Republican viewers .
The good news then for Fox News was that it succeeded .
The bad news now for Fox News is that it succeeded .
Meaning , when the GOP catches a cold , everybody at Fox News gets sick .
As blogger Logan Murphy put it at Crooks and Liars , “ Watching FOXNews getting their comeuppance has been fun to watch .
They made their bed , now they ’re having to lie in it and it ’s not too comfortable . ”
The most obvious signs of Fox News ’ downturn have been the cable ratings for the big primary and caucus votes this year , as well as the high - profile debates .
With this election season generating unprecedented voter and viewer interest , Fox News ’ rating bumps to date have remained underwhelming , to say the least .
In 2004 , on the night of the New Hampshire primary , for example , Fox News beat CNN by 200,000 viewers , despite the fact that there was no Republican contest at the time .
Four years later , CNN beat Fox News by 250,000 viewers , despite very competitive contests in both parties .
( On Saturday night , when results of the Dems ’ South Carolina primary were dominating the news , Fox News came in third , behind both CNN and MSNBC . )
It ’s been like this throughout the primary process , and Boehlert notes that the netroots - driven boycott has had a lot to do with it .
The problem for Fox News is that it ’s the Democratic race that ’s creating most of the excitement , yet Fox News has been forced to mostly watch the race from the sidelines .
That ’s because last winter , after Fox News tried to smear Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) for purportedly attending a radical Muslim school as a child , liberal bloggers launched an initiative to get Democratic candidates to boycott a debate co-sponsored by Fox News and the Nevada Democratic Party .
( The boycott , powered by Foxattacks.com , was later extended to any and all Fox News debates . )
The point of the online crusade was not to simply embarrass Fox News or rattle Nevada Democrats for being out of touch with the grassroots masses that distrusted and despised Fox News .
The point , instead , was to begin chipping away , in a serious , consistent method , at Fox News ’ reputation .
To spell out that Fox News was nothing more than a Republican mouthpiece and that Democrats need not engage with the News Corp. giant .
The lack of Democratic debates for Fox News has meant a huge setback for the news organization from a ratings perspective .
Just look at the grand slam CNN hit last week when , on January 21 , it broadcast the much - talked - about Democratic debate from South Carolina .
The CNN event not only creamed Fox News in the ratings , nearly tripling its audience that night , but the debate set a new cable news mark for the most viewers ever to watch a primary debate .
In fact , of the 10 most - watched debates this election season , Fox has aired just two , compared to CNN ’s five .
If I ’m not mistaken , this also suggests MSNBC has had three of the 10 most - watched debates , which is one more than Fox .
( Also , this is likely to continue , given that the debates scheduled for tonight and tomorrow night — the last two events before Feb. 5 — are both on CNN . )
CNN President Jonathan Klein , following its New Hampshire ratings win , said , “ There ’s a freshness and exuberance to our coverage that the others just are n’t matching … .
Fox almost seems downright despondent in their coverage . ”
It could n’t have happened to a more appropriate network .
Metered Internet access is a fact of life for many broadband users around the world , but has been largely a nonfactor when it comes to wired broadband in the US .
That may change , according to a memo leaked to the Broadband Reports forums .
If the memo is to be believed , Time Warner Cable will be rolling out what it calls " Consumption Based Billing " on a trial basis in the Beaumont , Texas area .
Under the proposed scheme , new customers will be able to choose from a couple of different plans with varying bandwidth caps .
They 'll be given online tools to monitor usage and will be able to upgrade to the next higher tier of service to avoid charges for exceeding their monthly bandwidth limit .
If the trial works well , Time Warner would then roll out bandwidth caps to current customers : " We will use the results of the trial to evaluate results for possible future nationwide rollouts , " reads the memo .
Bandwidth caps have been a sore subject for some users who have found themselves bumping into mysterious , undefined limits .
This past fall , a number of Comcast subscribers complained that their service was cut off after having reached Comcast 's bandwidth limit .
The problem is that Comcast ( and other ISPs ) do not publicize what limits they have in place .
Comcast 's Acceptable Use Policy , for instance , offers users only a vague warning against " generating levels of traffic sufficient to impede others ' ability to send or retrieve information . "
Absent hard , publicized bandwidth caps , broadband providers ' only alternatives are implementing the kinds of nebulous caps Comcast has been criticized for , engaging in traffic shaping to lighten the burden on the network , or making their networks robust enough to handle demand ( I 'll take door number three ) .
Both Comcast and Cox have been pilloried for using forged reset packets to thwart P2P transfers .
Cox defends the practice , saying that it 's necessary to " ensure the best possible online experience for customers . "
Putting caps in place as is apparently planned by Time Warner would remove the uncertainty for high - volume users , and would force the heaviest consumers of bandwidth to pay accordingly .
The downside is that companies with bandwidth caps could find themselves at a marketing disadvantage to ISPs without set limits .
Time Warner Cable did not immediately respond to a phone call requesting comment on whether the memo is legitimate and it is indeed planning to instituted tiered bandwidth caps .
Update
Although we have been unable to connect with a Time Warner spokesperson , the company has since confirmed the plans to Reuters .

Two - and - a- half weeks after her father 's kitchen was drenched in his blood Carla McIntyre realised she and her family were on their own .
No - one else was going to clean it for them .
Michael Mosey - a 57 - year - old widower , grandfather of five and former policeman - had been bludgeoned with his own baton .
He died in hospital 10 days after the attack .
But his family could not even begin to grieve .
The police and insurance company would not help , says Ms McIntyre .
The cost of having such a scene professionally cleaned was way beyond the family 's means .
This was n't just any blood .
This was my dad
Carla McIntyre
Crime clean up bill ' crazy '
" The blood was wall - to - wall , ceiling to floor , " Carla , now 29 , recalls .
" There was n't an inch of the wall that was n't covered in bloody handprints .
Horror movies do n't even come close .
There were flies buzzing around .
The smell was indescribable .
It would catch you at the back of the throat .
" When I went down to scrub the floor I was crying .
All that happened when I added water to the blood was that it diluted and spread .
We were covered from head to toe .
This was n't just any blood .
This was my dad .
" I had to shut down emotionally to get through it .
I became blank .
I did n't cry at the funeral .
It was a year before I could feel anything . "
Mr Mosey , who lived in Lanark , Lanarkshire , had been attacked in August 2006 by 33 - year - old John Mackie , who had just been released from prison .
Mackie was jailed for life for the murder , although his sentence was reduced on appeal .
Clear - up fund
The task of clearing up such a crime scene is chilling , but loopholes of accountability mean it could , in theory , happen to any family in the UK .
Michael Mosey died 10 days after the ferocious assault
The Scottish Liberal Democrats have launched a campaign to set up a fund to pay for cleaners so that those closest to victims do not have to take on such burdens themselves .
The party says 20 to 30 families a year have to pay to have their homes cleaned after a murder - or do it themselves .
Home Office guidelines do not require police forces to take responsibility for cleaning up crime scenes after evidence has been taken , a spokeswoman confirmed .
Most chief constables do so as a matter of course - but there is no legal requirement .
Sometimes an insurer will pick up the bill .
But in the case of Mr Mosey , his insurer declined , saying he had not taken out buildings and contents insurance .
The firm could not be convinced otherwise , even when two of its loss adjusters vomited after viewing the kitchen .
Seeping - up
However , months later , it accepted he had been insured and paid out £ 5,000 , says Ms McIntyre .
But by then the family had long ago been forced to tackle the bloodbath themselves .
But even then it came back to haunt them .
After new lino was laid in the kitchen , blood seeped through the floorboards , ruining the new surface .
Carla says the experience hit her and her family hard .
She was too traumatised to work for over a year after the killing .
She suffered a panic attack while shopping in her local supermarket when red dye seeped from a bag onto her hands .
Now , she hopes that other families will not have to go through the same experience as a result of the latest campaign .
" I read the other day that in Texas , killers have to meet the cost of clearing up the scenes of their crimes , " she says .
" That sounds fair to me .
That sounds like justice .
No - one should have to go through what my family did . "
The housing industry , caught in a maelstrom of sinking demand , rising foreclosures and bulging inventories , is in its worst slump in decades , a growing body of economic evidence shows .
Sales of new homes fell last year by 26 percent , the steepest drop since records began in 1963 , the Commerce Department said .
Last week , the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously owned single - family homes , a large portion of the overall housing market , dropped the most on an annual basis in 25 years .
And the median price of those homes fell for the first time in at least four decades .
Some economists predict the market may start to recover in the summer .
Others are less optimistic .
“ There is no sign of a bottom in any of these data , ” wrote Ian C. Shepherdson , a London - based economist at High Frequency Economics .
Last month alone , sales of new homes tumbled 4.7 percent , to a 604,000 annual rate , the smallest monthly sales figure since February 1995 .
An Anarchist at the Caucus
by Doug French by Doug French
DIGG THIS
Saturday was caucus day in Nevada for the first time ever , and despite not choosing to participate in this foolish sport , this anarchist could n’t resist a front row seat to watch democracy in action .
Republicans were to report to a government high school by 9 am sharp , and as it turned out , be off the premises by 10:30 to allow Democrats their turn .
Like most high schools in fast growing Las Vegas , this one in the southwest area of town is relatively new , built in 1993 , and almost prison - like in design with a center concrete yard surrounded by iron gates so that the facility can be " locked - down " easily .
No one knew what was going on as people streamed into the check - in area located in the lunchroom .
But after a little investigation we determined that we must look at a map to determine the number of our precinct and go to the classroom designated as the meeting place for those who lived in that area .
Twenty - three average looking folks assembled in a classroom whose day - to - day occupying teacher is not likely a Republican type .
Just a guess , but the large Amnesty USA and Ten Indian Commandments posters provided a clue .
It turned out that 21 of the 23 were registered Republican participants while two of us just observed .
There were no instructions in the room , which left the assembled , to chat amongst themselves while waiting to learn what to do .
The subject of Ron Paul was raised across the room , and the most vociferous of the caucusers said , " Ron Paul is a joke . "
" The Constitution was a fine document , " he went on , " but this is n’t 1776 .
The Constitution is n’t relevant anymore .
You ca n’t run the country based upon it anymore . "
The mouthy caucuser said that he had high hopes for Fred Thompson , but Thompson just " does n’t have the desire . "
When the conversation turned to illegal immigrants , the gravelly - voiced know - it - all said : “ I have no sympathy for homebuilders going through this crunch at all .
They had illegals working seven days a week for only $ 7 per hour during the boom .
These guys were roofing with no safety harnesses and just tennis shoes at 7:30 am on Sunday mornings next to my house . "
This thoughtful discussion was thankfully interrupted when directions arrived .
Unfortunately , these instructions were confusing enough that the Dudley Do-Right Mormon gentleman who reluctantly became precinct captain read them aloud at least three times trying to figure out what they meant .
The work that needed to be done was to select six delegates to the Clark County Republican convention from the 21 registered Republicans present .
Those who aspired to be delegates were to give a one - minute speech and if more than six wished to run for one of the six spots , there would be an election .
Mercifully , only six sought to be delegates , with another four wanting to be alternates .
The precinct captain proved that he has clearly fallen for the government - sponsored baloney explaining that he wanted to be a delegate because : " We are the government .
Politics runs our lives .
We must participate to have a voice . "
Another delegate ’s motivation is to " stop the Clinton machine . "
Another grew up in a political family and feels she must get involved , while another said she " wants to be a voice for my country . "
One of the delegates just got out of high school and mumbled that he " wanted to get involved . "
The group was unanimous in its praise for a young person that had the desire to participate in the process .
And finally a certain lawyer told the group she wished to be a delegate to make sure Republicans would be elected so employers would not be saddled with the job - killing employment policies that the Democrats were proposing .
After the speechifying was complete , the group of 21 unanimously approved the delegates and alternates .
Finally , the ballots arrived to provide for a presidential straw poll .
However , the delegates will do the real voting in March or April at the county convention and later at the state convention , and contrary to what most in the room thought , the elected delegates are not required to vote at the convention the way their particular precinct voted .
When the votes were counted , Romney came away with 15 , Ron Paul tallied 3 votes , while Fred Thompson , Duncan Hunter and Mike Huckabee each received a vote .
Of course , the lone vote for Hunter came from the Paul hater quoted above .
He must have been crushed when his man decided to throw in the towel by dinnertime that same day .
The countywide vote was similar to our precinct : Romney received approximately 70 % of the vote , 14 % went to Paul and 13 % for McCain .
But , what looks like a landslide for Romney may be deceiving .
Our just - out - of - high school delegate is a Ron Paul supporter ( if the Romney folks had known that , they might not have been as excited about his participation ) , as is that certain attorney delegate .
So , come county convention time , for this particular precinct , 33 per cent will casting votes for Ron Paul .
Across town at another caucus with 36 voters , the results were : Romney 17 , Paul 6 , Huckabee 6 , McCain 3 , Thompson 3 , and Giuliani 1 , according to my inside source .
But more importantly , of the nine delegates , five were Romney supporters , three were for Paul and one was for Thompson .
The results in a precinct near downtown were even better : Ron Paul received 10 of 19 votes , and both delegates and two alternate delegates are all for Paul .
And these results are from Clark County , which might as well be a suburb of Los Angeles politically .
Paul won the straw vote in Nye County , and was very close to Romney in Esmeralda , Storey and Eureka counties .
Statewide , Romney received 51 % of the vote , while 14 % went to Paul and 13 % to McCain .
If not for the population centers of Clark and Washoe counties voting 70 % for Romney , the vote would have been much closer .
But the real voting begins at the county and state conventions , and the anecdotal evidence is that Ron Paul has much more delegate support than the caucus results reflect .

' Remarkable ' Drop in Arctic Sea Ice Raises Questions
Image right :
At the end of each summer , the sea ice cover reaches its minimum extent and the ice that remains is called the perennial ice cover , which consists mainly of thick multi- year ice floes .
The area of the perennial ice has been steadily decreasing since the satellite record began in 1979 , at a rate of about 10 % per decade .
But the 2007 minimum , reached around Sept. 14 , is far below the previous record made in 2005 and is about 38 % lower than the climatological average .

As this ice begins to melt , less sunlight gets reflected into space .
It is instead absorbed into the oceans and land , raising the overall temperature , and fueling further melting .
This results in a positive feedback loop called ice albedo feedback , which causes the loss of the sea ice to be self - compounding .
The more it disappears , the more likely it is to continue to disappear .

Stephen Cole
Goddard Space Flight Center
Melting Arctic sea ice has shrunk to a 29 - year low , significantly below the minimum set in 2005 , according to preliminary figures from the National Snow and Ice Data Center , part of the University of Colorado at Boulder .
NASA scientists , who have been observing the declining Arctic sea ice cover since the earliest measurements in 1979 , are working to understand this sudden speed - up of sea ice decline and what it means for the future of Earth 's northern polar region .
"
The decline in the amount of thick ice that survives the summer melt season this year is quite remarkable , " said Josefino C. Comiso , senior scientist at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. " The extent of this ' perennial ' sea ice and the area it covers are both nearly 38 percent lower than average .
Compared to the record low in 2005 , the extent and area are 24 percent and nearly 26 percent lower this year , respectively . " " From what we know of how Arctic sea ice behaves after nearly 30 years of continuous satellite observations , this kind of drop in sea ice usually takes more than three years to happen .
The rapid trend of the perennial ice previously reported in 2002 appears now to be in an accelerated mode , " Comiso observed .
Because Arctic ice cover varies so much year to year , it can be dangerous to look at any one year and draw too much of a conclusion from it , " said Waleed Abdalati , head of Goddard 's Cryospheric Sciences Branch .
" But this year , the amount of ice is so far below that of previous years that it really is cause for concern .
The trend in decreasing ice cover seems to be getting stronger and stronger as time goes on .
" NASA developed the original capability to observe the extent and concentration of sea ice from space using passive microwave sensors .
More recently , NASA launched an advanced microwave instrument in 2002 -- the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer ( AMSR-E ) on the Aqua satellite -- that provides a view of sea ice dynamics in greater detail than has ever been seen before .
Researchers use this information to study polar bear habitats and the unique movements of sea ice from season to season .
AMSR -E is a joint project of NASA and the National Space Development Agency of Japan .
The accelerating decline in sea ice may be due to changes in climate brought on by the lack of sea ice itself , Comiso believes .
" When there is less sea ice in the summer , the Arctic Ocean receives more heat .
The warmer water makes it harder for the ice to recover in the winter , and , therefore , there is a higher likelihood that sea ice will retreat farther during the summer .
This process repeats itself year after year , " Comiso said .
"
The longer this process continues , the less likely recovery becomes , " Abdalati believes .
" The implications on global climate are not well known , but they have the potential to be quite large , since the Arctic ice cover exhibits a tremendous influence on our climate .
It really is imperative that we try to understand the interactions between the ice , ocean and atmosphere .
And satellites hold the key to developing this understanding .
" Current satellites , however , can map sea ice in two dimensions , but it is much more difficult to find out how the thickness of the ice contributes to the change in the total volume of the ice .
NASA 's ICESat spacecraft ( Ice , Cloud , and land Elevation Satellite ) , launched in 2003 , with the primary goal of determining how much ice sheets are contributing to sea - level rise .
ICESat is also collecting data that enables scientists to make estimates of sea ice thickness with unprecedented detail .
" What we need to truly understand the interaction of the ice , ocean and atmosphere in the Arctic is sea ice thickness information , " said Abdalati .
" The new capability we have with ICESat is expected to be extended into the next decade based on recent recommendations by the National Research Council for a follow - on mission .
Ultimately , like the 29 - year record we have now of sea ice cover , a long - term ice thickness record will help scientists understand these complex interactions and what the changes in the ice cover will mean to the ecology of the Arctic and to life on Earth . "
There is a stretch of the Garden State Parkway that used to feel like the tollbooth capital of America .
In a span of 100 miles — from Pascack Valley , in northern New Jersey , to Barnegat , along the coast — eight different toll plazas greeted drivers .
In much of the rest of the country , you would n’t find any tolls on a 100 - mile stretch .
I spent a good part of my childhood summers at the Jersey Shore , and the tollbooths on the parkway always seemed to be a cruel final obstacle between me and the beach .
Every 15 minutes or so , our car would have to stop yet again to drop a measly quarter in a bucket .
The ride is very different today , thanks mostly to the electronic toll system known as E - ZPass .
At four of the tolls along the Garden State , the system is so sophisticated that cars barely have to slow down .
A little box attached to the car ’s windshield sends a message to a computer reader looming over the road , and money is then deducted from an electronic account .
I imagine that some of the children being driven to the Jersey Shore today wo n’t even look away from their DVD players as they glide through a toll .
And I ’m quite certain that very , very few of them will remember , decades from now , how much the Garden State tolls cost back when they were young .
As a result of E - ZPass and its ilk , even many adults do n’t notice the cost of a toll .
The Clinton / Obama Non-Handshake Mega - Scandal

Perfect !
If the presidential elections devolve into some sick twisted version of Big Brother , I think it 's a sign there is something seriously wrong with the country .
As for George , I think he 's been a clipshow since season 1 of his term .
Posted by : Vergel E at January 29 , 2008 10:37 AM spot on ... i'm from Europe , but same shit happens over here .
nobody is discussing actual policy or serious issues , instead we all focus on the tiny trivialities because that 's something we can all relate to ( as said by random TV exec ) .
a handy side - effect for some people is of course the oblivion of regular Joe to the severe political crises we 've been experiencing for 8 years straight .
you see , the news has become reality tv as well , placing the " man bites dog " - news over hard facts , and because of this awful development it took the leaders of my country 6 months to form a government after the elections and they 're still not there yet .
( interim - leadership till Eastern ) IMHO , needless to say Posted by : Rubski at January 29 , 2008 10:46 AM
In Uganda and across Africa , politicians do not even bother to address or debate the issues , so the press does not bother to discuss the issues .
It is almost always about who has more money and who can draw more crowds , and whose crowds can make the most noise ... wait , are you guys taking cues from us now ?
Or have we always been taking cues from you ?
I 'm confused .
I might join you in Turkey .
Do they give better cues ?

I 'm really beginning to hate " - gate " used as a suffix for any political event , even if it is used jokingly .
I think we all know the effects of a 24 - hour news cycle and how they have to create stories that are less about signal and more about noise because that 's what will keep the majority of people interested as well as keep the news fresh .
You could 've just used Obama 's explanation and said , " Was he trying to shun her ?
No , he was talking to another Senator at the time , or so he claims , and he already said he waved to her going into the Senate chamber .
Would it matter anyway even if he did n't ?
No . "

Gotta love W. for being the fool that he is .
I kept hoping he'd refer to his posse on the right side as " The DogPound " ala Arsenio .
But , I was disappointed .
Was n't even aware that the " handshake " was an issue .
I mean , who the hell cares .
Hill and Bill are beating up on Obama so bad , ca n't blame him , if he did dogg her out .
You ever gonna tell us who you 're voting for ?
Oh , and welcome back !

Tony : Obama had n't given an explanation yet when I made the video .. and if you look around at the reaction to this story , especially from a lot of Clinton supporters ( did you look at the comment section on the page I linked ? ) , you 'll find that your understanding of the news cycle is far from universally shared .
Also the version of the video that you suggest would n't work because it would be boring and nobody would watch it or link to it . :)
Posted by : Jay Smooth at January 29 , 2008 3:43 PM
You 're right with all the points you make and I did read the comments you linked to in the article .
Personally , I am amused and interested to see what small gestures or actions have a ripple effect in politics and sometimes sway elections .
See : Kerry 's windsurfing photo , Al Gore being " boring " and claiming to have invented the Internet , or the debate between Kennedy and Nixon where Nixon 's five o' clock shadow made him seem devious compared to the fresh - faced Kennedy .
Radio listeners thought Nixon won the debate whereas people watching the televised version thought his performance was abysmal .
I just think this is the latest example in our history of personality - driven politics .
It 's more than fair to be frustrated by it , but it is fascinating to see what small actions spark the emotions of voters .
You just have to hope at the end of the day they push it aside and vote with their brain , and yes , sometimes their heart .
P.S. The smiley was used to try and soften the perception that I was trying to be an asshole .
I realize now smileys amplify the asshole meter .
* cough * Sorry .

Very few people mature past the Jr. High / High School level thus Hillary refusing to be in Vogue for fear of seeming too feminine but the act of her shedding tears ( or trying / starting / leaking ) is thought to have endeared her to voters who thought she was a robot .
Those people need to check out what David Levy has to say about the future of human - robot relationships here :

then see if her being a droid is really all the important .
Hopefully I 'll be in Japan next year .
The policies this administration has put through is gonna mess this place up for a very long time .
Taihen da !
( Japanese = What a mess ! )

I do n't know if it is reassuring or disheartening to that it is not just America that has reduced the political process to a soap opera or episode of Saved by the Bell .
Keep 'em coming
Jay the posts always seem to be the right subject at the right time .

Great vid , Smooth .
I think it 's a combination of two old , tired ideas : 1 ) ignorance about the importance of what the election means and 2 ) the feeling that " one vote " does n't count .
Any who 's been at least relatively sober for the past 7 years ( * I raise my hand with cautious - optimism * ) should realize of the fallacy of these ideas by now !
I 'll admit , that as someone born during Watergate , raised under Reagan , class of ' 92 , survived the Clinton years , I completely understand the excuses .
The whole Republican - Democrat , Liberal - Conservative dichotomy does n't seem to make much sense when you 're desperately searching for someone with integrity .
For crying - out - loud , I voted for Nadar !
But the Bush - Cheney years have rendered these excuses completely invalid .
I feel like Bill Murray at the end of Scrooged !
" I see !
I understand now ! "
And I do .
We 've been given the Francis - Xavier - Cross treatment .
It 's time we step up ... like Bill Murray .

How did it happen ?
Ms Bhutto was attacked as she was leaving a rally of her Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) supporters in the garrison town of Rawalpindi .
Ms Bhutto was a deeply controversial politician
Seconds later , a bomb was set off at the scene which left some 20 other people dead .
The exact cause of Ms Bhutto 's death is disputed .
A report by the UK's Scotland Yard says she was killed as a result of the explosion .
Ms Bhutto's party has insisted it was the gunshots that killed her .
They say they saw bullet wounds on her head while preparing her body for burial .
The British police report released on 8 February said the impact of the explosion forced Ms Bhutto's head to collide violently against the side of the escape hatch .
The report also said the attack was the work of one person , who first fired at Ms Bhutto 's vehicle and then set off a suicide bomb .
Video footage of the attack aired on TV had led to speculation that Ms Bhutto had been targeted by two people , working in a team .
The British police said its work had been complicated by failures to conduct an autopsy on Ms Bhutto 's body and preserve evidence from the crime scene .
However , the team said , " the evidence that is available is sufficient for reliable conclusions to be drawn " .
The British police investigated the assassination of Ms Bhutto at the request of Pakistan 's government .
Their report appears to support the government 's view , announced days after the attack on Ms Bhutto , that she died as a result of head injuries rather than gunshot wounds .
At the time , the PPP described the government 's verdict as " dangerous nonsense " .
What was the impact of Ms Bhutto 's death ?
Ms Bhutto was the dominant figure among Pakistan 's various secular and religious political parties .
She had twice served as prime minister and was hoping that the PPP would emerge as a major player in forthcoming elections , the first to be held since President Musharraf resigned as head of the army and became a civilian leader .
Ms Bhutto was unhurt after an attempt on her life in October
Western - educated and charismatic , she presented herself as a moderate , democratic force .
She was widely courted in the West , where it was hoped she could restore popular legitimacy to President Musharraf 's faltering campaign against Islamist militants .
For the time being , her death has left a political vacuum .
However , the wave of popular sympathy triggered by her assassination could strengthen the PPP 's showing in the 18 February elections .
Her only son , 19 - year - old Bilawal , has been named as the PPP 's new president , but is expected to remain a figurehead while he finishes his education .
In the meantime , the party is being led by Ms Bhutto 's husband , Asif Ali Zardari , and PPP stalwart Makhdoom Amin Fahim .
Ms Bhutto and Mr Musharraf had been working on a power - sharing agreement .
The talks failed , leaving Ms Bhutto as a major rival to President Musharraf , rather than an ally .
Who could have targeted her in this way ?
The government has blamed the attack on Baitullah Mehsud , a pro-Taleban tribal leader in South Waziristan region , abutting the Afghan border .
The CIA supports this view .
But a spokesman for Mr Mehsud has denied any involvement , calling the accusation " government propaganda " .
Nevertheless , pro-Taleban and al - Qaeda militants who have taken control of Pakistan 's tribal areas along the Afghan border have been linked by many analysts to the attack .
They made no secret of their determination to kill Ms Bhutto after her return to the country in October following years of self - imposed exile .
However , elements within Ms Bhutto's party believe her killing could not have taken place without the collusion of senior figures in the military and political establishment .
They have cited a letter Ms Bhutto released before her death in which she said she would hold President Musharraf 's government responsible for any attempt on her life .
How did President Musharraf react ?
Mr Musharraf appealed for calm immediately after the assassination , as disturbances broke out in various parts of the country .
He also postponed the parliamentary elections that were due to have been held on 8 January .
President Musharraf has spent his working life in the military
Mr Musharraf 's popularity took a hammering during 2007 , partly because of an intermittent military campaign against Islamist militants that alienated many but has yet to achieve clear results .
Only weeks before Ms Bhutto's assassination , he ended a six - week period of emergency rule , during which he sidelined leading judges who were set to rule on whether he was entitled to stay on as president .
He recently stepped down as army chief and appointed a colleague , Gen Ashfaq Kayani , to carry on the fight against the militants .
Mr Musharraf hopes parties loyal to him will fare well at the polls , thereby shoring up his credentials as a civilian president .
What is at stake for the region and the rest of the world ?
The future of Pakistan is one of the keys to global security .
Pro-Taleban militants and their al - Qaeda allies have become a state within a state in recent years .
Militants fighting Western forces in Afghanistan and the government there of Hamid Karzai have been able to operate from within Pakistan .
Many major terror attacks on the West - including the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US and the 7 July 2005 attacks on London - have been traced to militants in Pakistan .
Pakistan 's military also has several nuclear weapons and there are fears these could pass into the hands of Islamist sympathisers if President Musharraf 's grip is weakened further .
Pakistan 's nuclear rival to the east , India , is watching the developments with concern .
Romance and marriage proposals are in the air on Valentine 's Day .
Unfortunately , cupid is n’t the only matchmaker hard at work this season .
An increasing number of low - income women find themselves pushed to the altar -- by the federal government .
Romance and marriage proposals are in the air on Valentine 's Day .
Unfortunately , cupid is n’t the only matchmaker hard at work this season .
An increasing number of low - income women find themselves pushed to the altar — not by their relations or suitors , but by the federal government .
“ The Department of Health and Human Services is not going to run a dating service , ” declared Wade Horn in the early days of the George W. Bush administration .
But Horn , a leader of the rightist “ fatherhood movement ” during the 1990s , introduced policies promoting marriage as a cure for poverty while running HHS ’ Administration for Children and Families from 2001 to 2007 .
Despite his “ dating service ” denial , Horn saw to it that government grants powered a multimillion - dollar marriage industry made up of secular and faith - based groups which encourage low - income women — especially welfare recipients — to marry and bring a father into their families .
Needless to say , the administration applies only the most narrow and traditional definition of “ family . ”
Grants made to marriage promotion programs have ballooned while at the same time federal benefits have been cut for all low - income families and those unable to meet their own needs .
The scale of government funding for this inane and completely unproven bit of social experimentation is alarming .
The 2005 Deficit Reduction
Act allocated $ 100 million annually for marriage promotion programs and $ 50 million for fatherhood programs over fiscal years 2006 – 2010 , or a total of $ 750 million .
The administration ’s Charitable Choice Fund — which in 2004 had a budget of $ 2 billion — also makes grants to promote marriage , as does its $ 30 million Compassion Capital Fund .
Many of these millions serve to fuel the expansion of conservative evangelical organizations .

Why is HHS in the marriage business ?
The conservatives who run administration policy falsely imply that welfare recipients are young African American women of loose sexual morals , who can be saved from their poverty and sin only through the restoration of the traditional father - headed nuclear family .
Given the inaccurate and offensive stereotypes that undergird these policies , it should perhaps come as no surprise that there is no solid evidence from the social sciences that marriage results in a higher income for poor women .
Indeed , contrary to the administration ’s assumptions , marriage is not a magic bullet that will raise a low - income woman and her children out of poverty .
Given the individual circumstances of their lives , marriage may actually be an unwise choice for many poor women .
That is why most of the programs funded by government grants fail to produce the desired results ; they are based on ideology rather than sound social policy .
When it comes to Bush marriage promotion programs , reducing poverty is just a smokescreen for constructing conservative — and anti-feminist — family structures .
The administration has worked hard to eliminate those few anti-poverty programs that remain standing after the conservative revolution that began with Ronald Reagan .
Proven methods , such as subsidized housing , education stipends , health care , day care , and job training programs , have all been cut under the Bush administration .
Even the federal implementation of the Violence Against Women
Act would be cut by $ 120 million under President George W. Bush ’s 2009 budget proposal .
Marriage is a highly personal decision , not the business of government .
Would middle class women and men tolerate this kind of government interference in their personal lives ?
Not for a minute .
Do you solemnly swear to resist this illegitimate intrusion into the intimate lives of our fellow citizens ?
I do .

The Turkish parliament yesterday gave its government the green light for cross - border attacks into Iraq to destroy Kurdish rebel bases , defying US calls for restraint .
The prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , quickly pointed out that the vote did not signify an operation was imminent .
But it does represent a blank cheque for military action at any time within the next year .
The authorisation was passed by 507 votes to 19 , with only a small Kurdish party opposing it .
It came just as George Bush was telling journalists in Washington : " We are making it very clear to Turkey that we do n't think it is in their interest to send troops into Iraq . "
The president added : " Actually they have troops already stationed in Iraq , and they 've had troops stationed there for quite a while .
We do n't think it 's in their interest to send more troops in . "
Turkish TV quoted Mr Erdogan as saying : " What 's important is the parliament 's decision , not what people say . "
The raids would be aimed at the Kurdistan Workers ' party ( PKK ) , which has stepped up attacks inside eastern Turkey in recent months .
A senior PKK leader told the Guardian : " If Turkey conducts any attack or operation against Iraqi Kurdistan or Kurds anywhere we are prepared to defend ourselves and we have prepared well for such an occasion .
We do not want a military confrontation but we will spread resistance throughout Turkey and Kurdish areas in Iraq , Iran and Syria . "
Last night Iraqi leaders sought to prevent an attack .
Hours before the vote the prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , called Mr Erdogan to ask for more time to curb rebel activities in Iraq .
" Let 's do whatever is necessary together , " Mr Maliki said , according to the Anatolian news agency .
After the vote the Iraqi president , Jalal Talabani , an ethnic Kurd , called on both sides for restraint .
" We consider activities of PKK against the interests of the Kurdish people first , and then against the interests of Turkey , " he said in Paris .
" We have asked the PKK to stop fighting , to end the so - called military activity . "
However , there were divisions between Kurdish politicians and the Maliki government on how to respond to any incursion .
Sami al - Askari , a senior Maliki adviser , said it was up to the Kurdish fighters ( peshmerga ) and US - led coalition troops to stop the Turks .
" The Kurdistan regional government should not allow PKK fighters to infiltrate in to Turkey from northern Iraq , " he said .
" The Iraqi government will not use its army and police to stand in front of the Turkish army because security in that region is the responsibility of the multinational forces and the peshmerga . "
But a Kurdish MP in Baghdad , Mahmoud Othman , said any invasion by a foreign power should be treated as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty , adding : " It is the constitutional duty of all Iraqi forces to protect the borders . "
US influence on Turkey has been hit by the Iraq war , a perceived lack of US support for Turkey 's counter - insurgency against the PKK , and a US bill declaring the mass killing of Armenians during the first world war to be " genocide " .
The congressional resolution was losing momentum yesterday after Democrats withdrew their support following calls not to endanger the alliance with Turkey .
A growing percentage of the work most people do these days is necessary only to produce , market , sell , consume and dispose of products and services that are increasingly superfluous .
Compare this to the ever lesser amount of work people do to produce those products and services that are of basic or fundamental importance and that meet basic needs .
Now ask yourself this :
If ( somehow ) , anyone who wanted to , could join with others of like mind , to work only as much as it took to efficiently and cooperatively produce basic goods and services , and take their fair share , then no one who wanted just these basic things -- housing , food staples , utilities , education , basic health care -- would have to work more than 20 hours a week , 8 - 9 months a year in order to get these basics .
Obviously most people would , to one extent or another , want more than these basics , and to the extent they did , they could of course work at other jobs to get the money to buy what they wanted .
The point is that no one would any longer be forced to work full time , 11 months of the year , in the production of the environmentally damaging superfluous , in order to get all their basic needs met ( including health care ) in some adequate way .
As several surveys have shown , most people ( Caucasians at least ) were happier in the 50s and early 60s ( when average consumption and incomes were much less ) than they are today .
So , has all this increased personal consumption benefitted us as much as we think it has ?
And at what cost to us and the environment has it been provided ?
=====================
If the main contention in my first three paragraph is true , i.e. that people granted the opportunity to work exclusively , cooperatively and efficiently on the production of basics . . could today produce all they needed by working an average of only 20 hours / week , then on what rational basis do we deny decent housing ( i.e. houses of average size and quality ) , decent health care , and other basics . . to artists , activists and other leisure - time lovers if they are perfectly willing and able to work 20 hours a week , 8 - 9 months a year ( on the efficient and well - organized production of just these basic goods and services ) ?
Is n't this monumentally unfair to both them and our environment ?
The crux of the matter is this :
For how much longer can our planet 's human - friendly environment survive a hyperproductive - hyperconsumptive economic system in which no one is allowed to have decent housing , health care , education etc. unless they are willing to get on , and stay on , the hyperproduction - hyperconsumption treadmill ?
-- which means working 40 - 50 hours a week , 11 months of the year , at some highly productive and probably highly polluting company or corporation that is willing to pay its employees a large enough salary for them to afford the steep prices of a relatively nice home , a college education for their kids , good health care , and their share of all modern luxuries ?
In short , would n’t both we and ‘ the planet ’ be better off if most of us worked less , consumed less , wasted less and polluted less ?
=============
One related problem to consider :
As regards the purchase of basics like homes , health care , automobiles and college education , the real buying power provided by most jobs is falling ( and has been falling ) since about 1970 .
To wit :
In terms of the number of hours that must now be worked in order to pay for it ,
the cost of college keeps going up , thereby excluding growing numbers of would - be college students .
houses that once allowed a single middle - class worker to own them , now require at least two such workers , man and wife .
ever more people cannot afford basic health care .
There are not enough hours in the day .
A second problem : Suburban sprawl is one of the most wasteful and polluting developments in history .
People who do n't use automobiles , and who live in high - rise buildings or large multistory apartment complexes , close to their jobs , are responsible for far far less pollution and waste than are those who drive a car , by themselves , for 60 to 100 miles or more every day , just to get to work and back .
Then , with all their money -- from jobs at companies which , for the most part , produce superfluous products and services that must be heavily advertized just to sell – these suburban ‘ consumaholics ’ drive to the mall to buy a lot of that same stuff , just for the addictive ( but short - lived ) thrill of it .
Eventually they rent storage lockers to store much of it , after their spacious suburban homes and garages become too crowded with this very same stuff .
But consider all the labor that 's wasted in the production , distribution , marketing , sale , storage and finally disposal of all this stuff .
Then think of how much less we'd all have to work if the vast majority of us , by some miracle , became low - consumption ‘ Buddhists ’ or whatever , and were also given an opportunity to work efficiently and in a well - organized and cooperative way , on the production of basics , and had to work only as much as necessary , to produce just the basics that we wanted and needed .
So , rather then be consumaholics whose ever increasing numbers are going to destroy the environment , why not learn to better appreciate literature , philosophy , politics , art , music , crafts , hobbies , conversation and the art of friendship & love ?
Are n’t these things more important than gluttony and self indulgence at the mall ?
The ‘ planet , ’ too , would be so much better off if most of us could make this transition .
But the truth is that most of us will never make this transition unless we have the kind of organizational opportunities outlined in my opening paragraphs .
So what would be our main societal incentive for installing a government that would provide such opportunities ?
By way of an answer , just realize how much less pollution there would be , and also how many fewer tons of greenhouse gas ( primarily carbon dioxide ) we would be dumping into the atmosphere each year if such opportunities were somehow arranged .
Realize that even if we had only followed Jimmy Carter ’s conservation program laid out in 1979 www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/filmmore/ps_crisis.html , America never would have had to invade Iraq to gain control of its oil , because we would have never again needed any Mideast oil .
And think of how much wasted labor and resources – not to mention lives -- will be squandered on this $ 2 trillion war before we are finished .
http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1681119,00.html .
Plus , think of how many fewer tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses we could have prevented from getting into the atmosphere just by avoiding this war !

Considering the many kinds of information Google aggregates and the individual tools it has built to visualize all that data , one could easily argue that its primary and decidedly bare - bones search portal got long in the tooth some time ago .
As search competitors like Yahoo and Ask.com have introduced new ways for users to display and organize search results , Google only showed the first official signs of improving its search results UI in May 2007 .
Now , finally , Google has unveiled some opt - in experimental search features that allow users to find and reorganize more kinds of search results .
The days of being limited to simple lists of ten blue links may soon be behind us .
At Google 's new experimental search features page , a total of five projects are available for users to try : Alternate view for search results , Keyword suggestions , Keyboard shortcuts , Left - hand search navigation , and Right - hand contextual search navigation .
Users can only elect to use one experimental feature at a time , and the only reason that explains this choice is Google 's focus on simplicity .
After all , its main portal of entry has been a calculatedly simple search box and a link or three since the company 's inception .
It is n't about to suddenly offload a dump truck of new features on a user base that , by the latest numbers , largely still prefers its services to the competition .
Alternative views for search results
Google 's first search experiment , plainly named " Alternative views for search results , " could perhaps be the most appealing to users who want to view more kinds of search results inline with the standard list of text links .
This Timeline View , for example , will visualize search results on a timeline , highlighting specific periods that contain links relevant to your query .
You can allow Google to pick a range in history with the most relevant results , or you can specify a specific month and year , or a range of years to hone the scope of the timeline .
The Alternative views for search results experiment also offers an " Info View " and a " Map View , " both accessible under the search box on either side of the Timeline View .
These two views will present extra information filters and maps , respectively , to the right of search results .
The Info View above , for example , allows you to filter text search results with dates , measurements , and location information , as well as specifying images instead of text for results .
These filters are a good start at offering a GUI to many of Google 's search features that have existed for some time , and it will be good to see more filters added to this particular tool .
The Map View of the Alternative views for search results experiment more or less mashes the functionality of Google Maps to the rest of Google 's index .
Users are able to view basic map data relevant to their search results , but many of Google Maps ' other and more recent features , such as saving and organizing locations in My Maps or simply getting directions , are missing .
Keyword suggestions
Keyword suggestions is a simple , though handy assistant that matches what Yahoo and other engines have done for some time .
Begin typing into Google 's search box , and a list of additional terms will help you to fine - tune your query .
This is especially useful if you are n't that sure about the topic or what terminology you 're using .
While the accompanying list of the number of results on the right may initially seem useless large when querying with basic terms , adding keywords to your query will quickly whittle down the number of results to a more telling number .
Keyboard shortcuts
Perhaps most appealing to keyboard junkies , the " Keyboard shortcuts " experiment simply adds Gmail - like keyboard shortcuts to the standard Google search results .
Keys like J/K will select the next / previous search results ( with the marker highlighted in the image above ) , pressing O / Enter opens a result , and the standard " / " to bring typing focus to the search box still applies .
Aside from the general benefit for some users who can work faster with a keyboard , we did notice that you can scroll through to another page of search results by scrolling past the bottom of the current page with the J key .
If you 've ever needed to quickly scan through multiple pages of Google results to find the perfect one on page 5 , this could be the fastest way to do it .
Otherwise , this experiment , though handy , will probably be a sleeper feature to Google 's UI if it makes it at all .
Left - hand search navigation and Right - hand search navigation
Th Left - hand search navigation UI is more like bringing the advantages of the Keyword suggestions experiment along to your search results browsing in real time .
The first section of this GUI allows you to query a particular Google section like Video or Shopping .
The bottom portion offers keywords in real time whether you refine your original search , click through to other results pages , or click on a keyword to hone your search further .
This is a great way to help users better understand the topic they 're searching for and to find other topical avenues with a real - time , unobtrusive UI assistant .
The Right - hand search navigation experiment is just like its left - handed brother , aside from obviously being positioned at the top right of search results .
It also offers fewer related searches and keywords , probably to prevent it from cutting too much into Google 's coveted Sponsored Links sidebar .
Altogether , these experiments are all successes in their own right , and we do n't see much of a reason not to include them all in a future update .
A good case could perhaps be made for not enabling every one by default , but these are all great tools that could easily gain wide enough appeal to justify their inclusion in Google 's primary portal .
The search giant 's features have needed an upgrade for a while , and these are the perfect tools to help users traverse the mountains of data in Google 's index .
In The Matrix , hero Neo wins his battles when time slows in the simulated world .
In the real world , accident victims often report a similar slowing as they slide unavoidably into disaster .
But can humans really experience events in slow motion ?
Apparently not , said researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , who studied how volunteers experience time when they free - fall 100 feet into a net below .
Even though participants remembered their own falls as having taken one - third longer than those of the other study participants , they were not able to see more events in time .
Instead , the longer duration was a trick of their memory , not an actual slow - motion experience .
The study appears online today in the journal Public Library of Science One .
" People commonly report that time seemed to move in slow motion during a car accident , " said Dr. David Eagleman , assistant professor of neuroscience and psychiatry and behavioral sciences at BCM .
" Does the experience of slow motion really happen , or does it only seem to have happened in retrospect ?
The answer is critical for understanding how time is represented in the brain . "
When roller coasters and other scary amusement park rides did not cause enough fear to make " time slow down , " Eagleman and his graduate students Chess Stetson and Matthew Fiesta sought out something even more frightening .
They hit upon Suspended Catch Air Device diving , a controlled free - fall system in which " divers " are dropped backwards off a platform 150 feet up and land safely in a net .
Divers are not attached to ropes and reach 70 miles per hour during the three - second fall .
" It 's the scariest thing I have ever done , " said Eagleman .
" I knew it was perfectly safe , and I also knew that it would be the perfect way to make people feel as though an event took much longer than it actually did . "
The experiment consisted of two parts .
In one , the researchers asked participants to reproduce with a stopwatch how long it took someone else to fall , and then how long their own fall seemed to have lasted .
In general , people estimated that their own fall appeared 36 percent longer than that of their compatriots .
However , to determine whether that distortion meant they could actually see more events happening in time - like a camera in slow motion - Eagleman and his students developed a special device called the perceptual chronometer that was strapped to the volunteers ' wrists .
Numbers flickered on the screen of the watch - like unit .
The scientists adjusted the speed at which the numbers flickered until it was too fast for the divers to see .
They theorized that if time perception really slowed , the flickering numbers would appear slow enough for the divers to easily read while in free - fall .
They found that while the subjects were able to read numbers presented at normal speeds during the free - fall , they could not read them at faster - than - normal speeds .
" We discovered that people are not like Neo in The Matrix , dodging bullets in slow - mo .
The paradox is that it seemed to participants as though their fall took a long time .
The answer to the paradox is that time estimation and memory are intertwined : the volunteers merely thought the fall took a longer time in retrospect , " he said .
During a frightening event , a brain area called the amygdala becomes more active , laying down a secondary set of memories that go along with those normally taken care of by other parts of the brain .
" In this way , frightening events are associated with richer and denser memories .
And the more memory you have of an event , the longer you believe it took , " Eagleman explained .
The study allowed them to deduce that a person 's perception of time is not a single phenomenon that speeds or slows .
" Your brain is not like a video camera , " said Eagleman .
Eagleman and his team have been able to verify this conclusion in the laboratory .
In an experiment that appeared in a recent issue of PLoS One , Eagleman and graduate student Vani Pariyadath used ' oddballs ' in a sequence to bring about a similar duration distortion .
For example , when they flashed on the computer screen a shoe , a shoe , a shoe , a flower and a shoe , viewers believed the flower stayed on the screen longer , even though it remained there the same amount of time as the shoes .
Pariyadath and Eagleman showed that even though durations are distorted during the oddball , other aspects of time - such as flickering lights or accompanying sounds - do not change .
The conclusion from both studies was the same .
" It can seem as though an event has taken an unusually long time , but it does n't mean your immediate experience of time actually expands .
It simply means that when you look back on it , you believe it to have taken longer , " Eagleman said .
" This is related to the phenomenon that time seems to speed up as you grow older .
When you 're a child , you lay down rich memories for all your experiences ; when your older , you 've seen it all before and lay down fewer memories .
Therefore , when a child looks back at the end of a summer , it seems to have lasted forever ; adults think it zoomed by . "

BEIJING ( Reuters ) -
An almost complete human skull fossil that could date back 100,000 years has been unearthed in China , state media said on Wednesday , hailing it as the greatest discovery since Peking Man .
Last month ’s find in Xuchang , in the central province of Henan , was made after two years of excavation just as two archaeologists were leaving for the Lunar New Year break , the China Daily said .
“ We expect more discoveries of importance , ” Li Zhanyang , archaeologist with the Henan Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Institute , was quoted as saying .
The fossil consists of 16 pieces of the skull with protruding eyebrows and a small forehead .
“ More astonishing than the completeness of the skull is that it still has a fossilized membrane on the inner side , so scientists can track the nerves of the Paleolithic ancestors , ” Li was quoted as saying .
Besides the skull , more than 30,000 animal fossils , and stone and bone artifacts were found .
“ The pieces of the human skull showed up just when archaeologists were going home for the Spring Festival , ” the newspaper said , referring to the New Year holiday which officially begins next month .
Peking Man was discovered in the 1920s near Beijing and dates back roughly to between 250,000 and 400,000 years .
Max Roach , a founder of modern jazz who rewrote the rules of drumming in the 1940s and spent the rest of his career breaking musical barriers and defying listeners ’ expectations , died early yesterday in Manhattan .
He was 83 .
His death , at an undisclosed hospital , was announced by a spokesman for Blue Note Records , Mr. Roach ’s last label .
No cause was given .
Mr. Roach , who had lived on the Upper West Side for many years , had been known to be in poor health for some time .
Mr. Roach ’s death closes a chapter in American musical history .
He was the last surviving member of a small circle of adventurous musicians — among them Charlie Parker , Dizzy Gillespie , Thelonious Monk and a handful of others — whose innovations brought about wholesale changes in jazz during World War II and immediately afterward .
Their music , which came to be known as bebop , had its roots in the jazz tradition , but it was different enough to scandalize many listeners and even many of their fellow musicians .
Its rhythms were more jagged and unpredictable ; its harmonies were more advanced , at times dissonant ; its technical demands could be daunting .
Despite the skepticism and hostility they initially inspired , the beboppers established the template for how jazz was played for decades to come .
The ME sensor stack design consists of seven layers of materials positioned between insulating gaps and magnetic shields .
The two ferromagnet electrodes produce a response voltage induced by a media field .

Magnetic recording is a multi-billion dollar industry and growing , as consumers store more and more data on PCs , laptops , and portable devices .
Researchers continue to find new ways to improve the technology , where the current recording density has reached 150 Gb in - 2 in commercial products , and 300 Gb in - 2 in the newest prototypes .
Most of today ’s magnetic recording systems use read heads — sensors that read and write data by hovering over the disk surface — that are based on magneto - resistance effects .
When a magnetic field is applied to some materials , they can increase or decrease their electrical resistance .
Data can then be stored in the form of electrical signals .
Recently , researchers Marian Vopsaroiu , John Blackburn , and Markys Cain from the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington , UK have proposed a different approach , and discovered some notable improvements .
The scientists based their read head design on the magneto - electric ( ME ) effect instead of the magneto - resistance ( MR ) effect .
This is the first time such a device has been proposed publicly .
ME is often displayed in multiferroic materials — a special class of materials exhibiting multiple ferroic properties ( such as ferroelectricity , ferromagnetism , or ferroelasticity ) .
In ME , the electric and magnetic fields are coupled , which facilitates the conversion between energies stored in magnetic and electric fields .
This phenomenon is considered to hold promise for a variety of new applications .
“ I first had the idea for this application after reading a paper [ Shuxiang Dong , Jie-Fang Li , D. Viehland , Appl. Phys. Lett. 83 ( 2003 ) 2265 ] demonstrating experimental results for a laminated tri-layer multiferroic , ” Vopsaroiu told PhysOrg.com .
He explained that the multiferroic was sensitive enough to detect low ( 6 x 10 - 7 Oe ) AC magnetic fields at room temperature .
" Knowing that media fields in a recording medium could be as high as 100 Oe , I realized that if you scale down the size of the sensor and apply the same principle , this could function as a read head detector , " Vopsaroiu continued .
" Initial estimations showed a range of a few microvolts response signal , but more detailed calculations performed with John Blackburn 's help revealed better amplitudes close to the millivolts range . "
In the read head device , the scientists took advantage of the magnetically induced ME effect , and applied both ac and dc magnetic fields to initiate a change in the electric polarization of the multiferroic material .
The actual read head consists of seven layers of materials ( compared with 15 in a typical MR head ) , with a total thickness of about 40 nanometers .
The researchers explain that , as the head moves across the bits on the disk surface , the bits apply the required ac excitation field on the sensor , inducing a response voltage following the same pattern of the bits .
The required dc field is more complex , inducing “ magnetostriction , ” or causing the multiferroic materials in the sensor to change shape under the magnetic field , thus converting magnetic energy into kinetic energy .
“ In the ME design , data is stored magnetically on small - magnetized regions known as magnetic memory bits , just as in the case of any recording disk , ” Vopsaroiu explained .
“ The read process is still performed as an electrical signal ( i.e. wave function ) in a similar way to the operation of the magneto - resistive read heads , but the electrical response is generated in a different way when using an ME read head . ”
In ME heads , data is read back directly as induced voltage , whereas MR heads normally require a constant dc test current to measure the change in resistance .
This difference gives ME heads the advantage of better thermal performance and reduced power consumption .
Another improvement is the elimination of the need for a horizontal bias field with permanent magnets .
Together , these improvements could reduce the cost and time of production by eliminating at least 100 processes from the production line .
Perhaps most significantly , the smaller size of ME heads offers the possibility of increased recording density : the scientists estimate the 40 - nm ME heads to achieve a density of 200 Gb in - 2 , with a resonance frequency of 5.2 GHz .
They also predict that the fundamental limits for an ME recording head could enable a thickness down to 5 nm , which could handle recording densities of 1 Tb in - 2 and beyond .
Vopsariou said that the group has initiated contact with a magnetic recording head manufacturer on the new reader design and hopes to work on a short feasibility study together .
The study would include addressing some of the most controversial issues related to the design , defining limitations , and choosing the best materials .

Date : 22 January 2008
Subject : Shell Energy Scenarios
Dear Colleagues
In this letter , I 'd like to share reflections about how we see the energy future , and our preferred route to meeting the world 's energy needs .
Industry , governments and energy users - that is , all of us - will face the twin challenge of more energy and less CO2 .
This letter is based on a text I 've written for publication in several newspapers in the coming weeks .
You can use it in your communications externally .
There will be more information about energy scenarios inthe months ahead .
By the year 2100 , the world 's energy system will be radically different from today's .
Renewable energy like solar , wind , hydroelectricity and biofuels will make up a large share of the energy mix , and nuclear energy too will have a place .
Mankind will have found ways of dealing with air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions .
New technologies will have reduced the amount of energy needed to power buildings and vehicles .
Indeed , the distant future looks bright , but getting there will be an adventure .
At Shell , we think the world will take one of two possible routes .
The first , a scenario we call Scramble , resembles a race through a mountainous desert .
Like an off - road rally , it promises excitement and fierce competition .
However , the unintended consequence of " more haste " will often be " less speed " and many will crash along the way .
The alternative scenario , called Blueprints , has some false starts and develops like a cautious ride on a road that is still under construction .
Whether we arrive safely at our destination depends on the discipline of the drivers and the ingenuity of all those involved in the construction effort .
Technical innovation provides for excitement .
Regardless of which route we choose , the world 's current predicament limits our maneuvering room .
We are experiencing a step - change in the growth rate of energy demand due to population growth and economic development , and Shell estimates that after 2015 supplies of easy - to - access oil and gas will no longer keep up with demand .
As a result , society has no choice but to add other sources of energy - renewables , yes , but also more nuclear power and unconventional fossil fuels such as oil sands .
Using more energy inevitably means emitting more CO2 at a time when climate change has become a critical global issue .
In the Scramble scenario , nations rush to secure energy resources for themselves , fearing that energy security is a zero- sum game , with clear winners and losers .
The use of local coal and homegrown biofuels increases fast .
Taking the path of least resistance , policymakers pay little attention to curbing energy consumption - until supplies run short .
Likewise , despite much rhetoric , greenhouse gas emissions are not seriously addressed until major shocks trigger political reactions .
Since these responses are overdue , they are severe and lead to energy price spikes and volatility .
The other route to the future is less painful , even if the start is more disorderly .
This Blueprints scenario sees numerous coalitions emerging to take on the challenges of economic development , energy security and environmental pollution through cross -border cooperation .
Much innovation occurs at the local level , as major cities develop links with industry to reduce local emissions .
National governments introduce efficiency standards , taxes and other policy instruments to improve the environmental performance of buildings , vehicles and transport fuels .
As calls for harmonization increase , policies converge across the globe .
Cap - and - trade mechanisms that put a cost on industrial CO 2 emissions gain international acceptance .
Rising CO2 prices accelerate innovation , spawning breakthroughs .
A growing number of cars are powered by electricity and hydrogen , while industrial facilities are fitted with technology to capture CO 2 and store it underground .
Against the backdrop of these two equally plausible scenarios , we will only know in a few years whether December 's Bali declaration on climate change was just rhetoric or the beginning of a global effort to counter it .
Much will depend on how attitudes evolve in Beijing , Brussels , New Delhi and Washington .
Shell traditionally uses its scenarios to prepare for the future without expressing a preference for one over another .
But , faced with the need to manage climate risk for our investors and our grandchildren , we believe the Blueprints outcomes provide the best balance between economy , energy and environment .
For a second opinion , we appealed to climate change calculations made at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
These calculations indicate that a Blueprints world with CO2 capture and storage results in the least amount of climate change , provided emissions of other major manmade greenhouse gases are similarly reduced .
The sobering reality is that the Blueprints scenario will only come to pass if policymakers agree a global approach to emissions trading and actively promote energy efficiency and new technology in four sectors : heat and power generation , industry , mobility and buildings .
It will be hard work and there is little time .
For instance , Blueprints assumes CO2 is captured at 90 % of all coal - and gas - fired power plants in developed countries in 2050 , plus at least 50 % of those in non-OECD countries .
Today , there are none .
Since CO2 capture and storage adds cost and brings no revenues , government support is needed to make it happen quickly on a scale large enough to affect global emissions .
At the very least , companies should earn carbon credits for the CO2 they capture and store .
Blueprints will not be easy .
But it offers the world the best chance of reaching a sustainable energy future unscathed , so we should explore this route with the same ingenuity and persistence that put humans on the moon and created the digital age .
The world faces a long voyage before it reaches a low - carbon energy system .
Companies can suggest possible routes to get there , but governments are in the driving seat .
And governments will determine whether we should prepare for a bitter competition or a true team effort .
That is the article , and how I see our challenges and opportunities .
I look forward to hearing how you see the situation ( please be concise ) .
Regards

Protesters have vowed to disrupt the DSEI event
Arms trade critics , shouting " murderers " at exhibitors , were quickly overwhelmed by police after breaking through the initial security cordon .
The Metropolitan Police say between 15 and 20 people were arrested for a suspected breach of the peace .
Further disruption is expected later when pressure group Campaign Against Arms Trade holds a demonstration .
Held every two years , the Defence Systems & Equipment International show attracts more than 1,350 exhibitors and military delegations from 56 countries .
The DSEI event is a showcase for weapons systems , ranging from logistics software to tanks and rocket launchers .
Soldiers and exhibitors come not just from the UK , Germany , the US and other Nato countries , but from countries such as Libya , Russia , Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Pakistan and India .
However , as in previous years , the organisers have ordered exhibitors not to show any equipment that might be considered too offensive - such as torture devices and cluster bombs - neither as an exhibit , nor in pictures or literature .
As well as the Campaign against Arms Trade protest , other campaigners have threatened to try to disrupt the event using " direct action " .
For sale
Public pressure has persuaded the company organising the show , Reed Elsevier , to sell the business by the end of the year .
Security around the London venue is tight
DSEI spokesman Al Lockwood said the sale was on track and that bids for the show were currently being assessed .
He added DSEI had a " bright future " and would be held again in September 2009 at the same venue .
" We are well aware that DSEI has its critics , " Mr Lockwood said , adding that organisers had designated an area where demonstrators could protest and would be visible to visitors arriving at the exhibition .
There had been doubts about the future of the exhibition , after Prime Minister Gordon Brown decided to abolish the government 's Defence Export Services Organisation ( DESO ) , which helps to organise the show and hosts all foreign military organisations .
In another snub to the industry , the UK 's defence secretary has broken with tradition and will not open this year 's event .
However , the promotion of arms exports as such has not ended , with DESO 's function to be moved to UK Trade and Investment department by the end of the year .

With just a couple of days to go before the culmination of the Ashuraa observances on Saturday , the holy city of Karbala is already packed with Shi’ite pilgrims , and even more are expected to arrive .
Increased Iraqi troops were ordered to the area for security purposes , while curfews are in effect elsewhere .
Unsurprisingly though , attacks against Shi’ite Muslims have increased this week , particularly in Diyala province .
Overall , 41 Iraqis were killed and 40 were wounded in the latest attacks .
A explosives - laden suicide bomber killed 11 people and wounded another 15 at a Shi’ite mosque in Baquba .
A car bomb outside a Mosul church wounded a policeman and a woman .
A policeman was gunned down in a separate incident .
Downtown , a civilian was also killed ; he was a member of a human rights group .
Also , an empty primary school was bombed , but no casualties were reported .
During clashed in Shurqat , two policemen and two gunmen were killed .
In Baghdad , three unidentified bodies were recovered .
A lack of news stories from the capital is likely due to curfews and other security measures .
In Sulaiman Bek , a gunman rigging a car bomb managed to only kill himself with it .
One policeman and four civilians were wounded during a bombing in Tikrit .
Meanwhile , gunmen killed a police officer and wounded two bodyguards in a separate incident .
In Bishkan , Awakening Council members and gunmen clashed , leaving six dead gunmen and another 13 wounded .
Iraqi authorities fired 173 Basra policemen because of crime allegations .
Also , a sheikh escaped an assassination attempt .
South of town , one policeman was killed and another was wounded during a shooting near the Ibn al - Jawzi shrine .
A policeman was killed during clashes in an unspecified location in Salah ad Din province .
U.S. forces , including ground and air troops , killed three suspects during a raid in Jalawla .
When troops entered the building they found two dead and two injured women .
Nearby , a man who ignored orders was killed as he exited a building .
U.S. forces killed three suspects in Muqdadiyah and detained nine across central and northern Iraq .
A kidnapping trio was arrested in Kut .
Two suspects were killed in Bi’aj .
Also , the Iraqi Army took over security of the main highway between Baghdad and Baquba .
This stretch of road has been the scene of numerous attacks .

" How many legs does a dog have , if you call a tail a leg ?
Four .
Calling a tail a leg does n't make it a leg . "
-- Abraham Lincoln
So I was at this conference .
Where one of the topics was legal rights for human - level Artificial Intelligence .
And personally , I do n't think this is going to be the major problem , but these are the kinds of conferences I go to .
Anyway .
Brad Templeton , chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , was present ; and he said :
" The legal status of AIs is ultimately a legislative question , and in the American system of democracy , legislative questions are decided by the Supreme Court . "
Much laughter followed .
We all knew it was true .
( And Brad has taken a case or two to the Supreme Court , so he was speaking from experience . )
I 'm not criticizing the Supreme Court .
They do n't always agree with me on every issue - that is not a politician 's job - but reasoned cooperative discourse , compact outputs , and sheer professionalism all make the Supreme Court a far more competent legislative body than Congress .
Try to say aloud the color - not the meaning , the color - of the following letters :
RED
Now say aloud the meaning of the letters , not their color :
PURPLE
Which task felt more difficult ?
It 's actually easier to pay attention to the labels of things than their substances .
But if you 're going to be faced with several repetitions of the first task , there 's a way to make it easier - just blur your eyes a little , so that you can see the color a moment before you 're distracted by the meaning .
Try it - defocus your eyes slightly , and then say the following colors aloud :
BLUE ORANGE YELLOW
If you want to know what the Supreme Court really does , you should blur your eyes so that you can't see the words " Supreme " or " Court " , or all the giant signs reading " judge " , " Honorable " , or " judicial branch of government " .
Then how can you tell what they do ?
Well , you could follow these nine people around for a few days and observe them at work .
You 'll see that they dress in funny outfits and go to a building where they hear some people arguing with each other .
Then they 'll talk it over for a while , and issue one or two short written documents , some of which tell other people what they are or are n't allowed to do .
If you were a Martian anthropologist and you had absolutely no idea that these people were supposed to be doing this or that or something else , you would probably conclude they were ( among other things ) making laws .
Do Representatives and Senators make laws ?
Well , I 've met one or two Congresspeople , and I did n't see them writing any documents that tell people what to do .
Maybe they do it when no one is looking ?
I 've heard their days are pretty heavily scheduled , though .
Some laws are made by Congressional staff , but the vast majority of legislation is written by professional bureaucrats , who - if you refocus your eyes and read their labels - are part of the " executive " branch .
What if you 've got a problem with a bureaucrat getting in your hair ?
You wo n't have much luck talking to the White House .
But if you contact your Representative or Senator 's constituent service office , they 'll be happy to help you if they can .
If you did n't know how the system works apart from a high school civics class , you might end up very frustrated - the people who help you deal with the executive branch of government have signs reading " legislative branch " .
Your Congressperson would much rather help a little old lady deal with a lost Social Security check , than make potentially controversial laws about immigration or intellectual property .
That sort of thing may please some of your constituents , but it gets others very angry at you , and voters are faster to forget a favor than a disservice .
Keep making laws and you might just get yourself unelected .
If you know everyone is going to cheer you for a law , go ahead and pass it ; but otherwise it 's safer to leave legislation like e.g. school desegregation to the Supreme Court .
What Congresspeople prefer to do is write elaborate budgets that exert detailed control over how the government spends money , so they can send more of it to their districts .
That , and help their constituents with the bureaucracy , which makes friends without getting anyone mad at them .
The executive branch has no time for such matters , it 's busy declaring wars .
So , bearing in mind that nothing works the way it 's written down on paper , let 's defocus our eyes and ask about the role of the voters .
If we blur out the label over your head and look at what you do , then you go to a certain building and touch one of several names written on a computer screen .
You do n't choose which names will be on the screen - no , you do n't .
Forget the labels , remember your actual experiences .
You walked into the building , you did choose which rectangle to touch , and you did not choose which little names you would see on the computer screen .
When Stephen Colbert wanted to register for a presidential run in South Carolina , the executive council of the South Carolina Democratic Party voted 13 - 3 to keep him off the ballot : " He clearly does n't meet the requirements .
It 's a distraction and takes away from the seriousness of our primary here and takes attention from the serious candidates : Clinton , Edwards , Barack Obama and the rest . "
Hey , South Carolina Democratic
Party executive council , you know who ELSE might be interested in determining whether someone is , or is n't , a " serious candidate " ?
HOW ABOUT THE %#<!ing VOTERS ?
Ahem .
But the psychology of this response is quite revealing .
" They want to prevent wasted votes " would be a polite way of putting it .
It does n't even seem to have occurred to them that a voter might attach their own meaning to a vote for Stephen Colbert - that a voter might have their own thoughts about whether a vote for Stephen Colbert was " wasted " or not .
Nor that the voters might have a sense of ownership of their own votes , a wish to determine their use .
In the psychology of politicians , politicians own voters , voters do not own politicians .
South Carolina Democratic voters are a resource of the South Carolina Democratic Party , not the other way around .
They do n't want you to waste their votes .
( Am I the only one on the planet to whom it occurred that the South Carolina voters could decide the meaning of a vote for Stephen Colbert ?
Because I seriously do n't remember anyone else pointing that out , at the time . )
How much power does touching a name in a rectangle give you ?
Well , let me put it this way :
When I blur my eyes and look at the American system of democracy , I see that the three branches of government are the executive , the legislative , the judicial , the bureaucracy , the party structure , and the media .
In the next tier down are second - ranked powers , such as " the rich " so often demonized by the foolish - the upper - upper class can exert influence , but they have little in the way of direct political control .
Similarly with NGOs ( non-governmental organizations ) such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation , think tanks , traditional special interest groups , " big corporations " , lobbyists , the voters , foreign powers with a carrot or stick to offer the US , and so on .
Which is to say that political powers do make an attempt to court the voters , but not to a noticeably greater degree than they court , say , the agricultural industry .
The voters ' position on the issues is not without influence , but it is a degree of influence readily comparable to the collective influence of think tanks , and probably less than the collective influence of K Street lobbyists .
In practice , that 's how it seems to work out .
The voters do have two special powers , but both of them only manifest in cases of great emotional arousal , like a comic - book superhero who can't power up until angry .
The first power is the ability to swap control of Congress ( and in years divisible by 4 , the Presidency ) between political parties .
To the extent that the two allowed political parties are similar , this will not accomplish anything .
Also it 's a rather crude threat , not like the fine - grained advice offered by think tanks or lobbyists .
There 's a difference between the power to write detailed instructions on a sheet of paper , and the power to grunt and throw a big rock .
Possibly due to a coordination problem among individual politicians , the party currently in power rarely acts scared of the voters ' threat .
Maybe individual politicians have an incentive to pursue their goals while the pursuing is good , since a shift in parties will not necessarily deprive them of their own seats in secure districts ?
Thus , we regularly see the party in power acting arrogantly until the voters get angry and the vote swings back .
Then the minority - turned - majority party stops trying so hard to please the voters , and begins drinking the wine of power .
That 's my best guess for why the balance of voters tends to be actively restored around a 50/50 ratio .
The voters ' second hidden superpower can only be used if the voters get really , really , really angry , like a comic - book hero who 's just seen one of their friends killed .
This is the power to overthrow the existing political structure entirely by placing a new party in charge .
There are barriers to entry that keep out third parties , which prevents the ordinary turnover visible in the history of US politics before the 1850s .
But these barriers would n't stop the voters if they got really , really mad .
Even tampering with electronic voting machines wo n't work if the vote is 90 % lopsided .
And this never - used power of the voters , strangely enough , may be the most beneficial factor in democracy - because it means that although the voters are ordinarily small potatoes in the power structure , no one dares make the voters really , really , really angry .
How much of the benefit of living in a democracy is in the small influences that voters occasionally manage to exert on the political process ?
And how much of that benefit is from power - wielders being too scared to act like historical kings and slaughter you on a whim ?
Arguably , the chief historical improvements in living conditions have not been from voters having the influence to pass legislation which ( they think ) will benefit them , but , rather , from power - wielders becoming scared of doing anything too horrible to voters .
Maybe one retrodiction ( I have n't checked ) would be that if you looked at the history of England , you would find a smooth improvement in living conditions corresponding to a gradually more plausible threat of revolution , rather than a sharp jump following the introduction of an elected legislature .
You 'll notice that my first post , on the Two - Party Swindle , worried about the tendency of voters to lose themselves in emotion and identify with " their " professional politicians .
If you think the chief benefit of living in a democracy is the hope of getting Your - Favorite - Legislation passed , then you might abandon yourself in adulation of a professional politician who wears the colors of Your - Favorite - Legislation .
Is n't that the only way you can get Your - Favorite - Legislation , the most important thing in the world , passed ?
But what if the real benefit of living in a democracy , for voters , comes from their first and second superpowers ?
Then by identifying with politicians , the voters become less likely to remove the politician from office .
By identifying with parties , voters become less likely to swap the party out of power , or cast it from government entirely .
Both identifications interfere with the plausible threat .
The power - wielders can get away with doing more and worse things before you turn on them .
The feature of democracies , of allowing heated color wars between voters on particular policy issues , is not likely to account , on average , for the benefits of living in a democracy .
Even if one option is genuinely better than the other , the existence of a color war implies that large efforts are being spent on tugging in either direction .
So if voters get wrapped up in color wars , identifying emotionally with " their " professional politicians and issues that put them at odds with other voters - at the expense of being less likely to get upset with " their " politician and " their " party - then should n't we expect the end result , on average , to be harmful to voters in general ?
Coming tomorrow : My shocking , counterintuitive suggestion for a pragmatic voting policy !
( Well ... maybe not so counterintuitive as all that ...)
As you may have noticed by now , I ’ve decided to rename the site once again .
While the New Name ( “ Worse Than Failure ” ) seemed like a good fit at the time , and the New , New Name ( “ The Daily Worse Than Failure ” ) seemed like an even better fit , it turns out that there was one name that was still better : the New , New , New Name , or “ The Daily WTF . ”
While I understand that the New , New , New Name may seem completely and entirely identical to the Original Name , there are a few key feature changes here .
But instead of detailing those , I think it ’s much more valuable to do a quick Site Renaming post - mortem .
This will allow us to explore the lessons learned and answer one key question : why did the deployment of the Older Newer Names not work ?
It Was My Predecessor ’s Fault
Yes , I realize that I ’ve been the editor here at WTF since day one .
However , the Alex of Early 2007 was a completely different person than me ( the Alex of Late 2007 ) .
Having significantly more experience and a vast breadth of wisdom under my belt , it ’s now obvious that Alex of Early 2007 was wrong for the job .
I can assure all of you that appropriate actions have been taken – for starters , Alex of Early 2007 does not work here anymore – and the reins have changed hands .
While the damage that was done by Alex of Early 2007 cannot be undone , I , Alex of Late 2007 , will lead things in the right direction .
Poor Requirements
As they say , a Site Renaming is only as good as the Requirements , and in this case , the Requirements fell shy .
Assumptions were made , liberties were taken , and in the end , the Site Renaming fell short of what was actually needed .
Deficient Tools
One ca n’t do something right unless he has the right tools , and in this case , we had deficient tools .
Without the latest and greatest tools and technologies in Site Renaming , it ’s virtually to implement such an undertaking in today ’s competitive market .
Not Enough QA / Testing
Do n’t get me wrong , both New Name and the New , New Name were extensively tested before going into production .
It passed local testing ( everyone here seemed to not hate it ) and QA testing .
Unfortunately , all aspects of the production environment were not taken into consideration .
Lacking Training and Transitioning
While both the New Name and the New , New Name technically worked to spec when going into production , the Name ’s users had grown accustomed to the specific features and functionality of the original name .
Had an effort been placed in developing a Transitional Name , it ’s entirely possible that both the New Name , and the New , New Name would have been received better .
Conclusion : The Real Problem Was A Faulty Process
While it ’s easy to point fingers and assign blame to any single person , the real culprit here was The Process .
This poorly monitored Site Renaming process allowed issues to fall through the cracks in all areas , from requirements to implementation to testing .
The good news is that the process of process improvement has been started , which will allow future Site Renaming to go much smoother .
I think we have all learned some valuable lessons from this post - mortem , and I hope that the New , New , New Name ( “ The Daily WTF ” ) will meet all necessary requirements .
That said , I look forward to future Name enhancements and support .
STOCKHOLM ( Reuters ) - A Swedish state - owned firm has found a cheap , eco-friendly source of energy to warm one of its offices : body heat from a quarter million commuters steaming through Stockholm ’s central train station .
Body heat already warms the station itself but the surplus , currently let out in thin air , will be redirected to provide as much as 15 percent of the heating in a planned 4,000 square meter office building , real estate firm Jernhusen said .
“ We had a look at it and thought ‘ We might actually be able to use this ’ , ” said Karl Sundholm , project leader at Jernhusen , which also owns the station .
“ This feels good .
Instead of just airing the leftover heat out we try to make use of it . ”
Jernhusen markets the building as “ environment smart ” and aims for its energy consumption to be half of what a corresponding building usually is .
The bodily warmth from the central station will be redirected to heat up water .
The investment will be around 200,000 Swedish crowns ( $ 31,200 ) , Sundholm said .
“ The ventilator aggregates are already there , and even some of the pipes .
All we need to do is complement with a few pumps and pipes . ”
" Hizbullah lost its most important operative in the organization in recent years , " a reservist Military Intelligence officer told Ynet on Wednesday in reference to the killing of senior Hizbullah military commander Imad Mugniyah in an explosion in Damascus .
" He was an expert in carrying out terrorist attacks and at the same time , he was an expert in maintaining a low profile and knowing , for 20 years , how to evade the many that tried to get him , " the reservist officer added .
Hambullah ?
Hamas adopts Hizbullah tactics Hanan Greenberg ( Video ) Palestinians implement Lebanon war lessons : IDF troops operating in northern Gaza Strip Thursday uncover remote - controlled rocket launching positions concealed underground ; new tactic enables terrorists to evade IDF counterattacks Hamas adopts Hizbullah tactics
Senior IDF officers that served in Military Intelligence had a hard time hiding their satisfaction about the news that came in from Damascus – Mugniyah is not longer walking this earth .
All were quick to point out that they were not familiar with the incident itself and that they were not inferring that Israel was responsible .
" He was wanted in many countries for many years so many people were trying to kill him , " one of the officers said .
" After every significant incident with Hizbullah , his name came up as the person that planned it or the creative head ( behind the incident ) .
" There is no doubt that he was a significant force behind actions against Israel and his name was mentioned many times – also during the Second Lebanon War – primarily connected to the kidnapping of the two reservist soldiers , " the officer added .
Scene of blast in Damascus ( Photo : AFP )
Military Intelligence and other national security organizations do not hide the fact that various attempts were made to track Mugniyah 's path .
However , it appears that the arch - terrorist was well aware of his " popularity " in Israel and succeeded in using the strict compartmentalization of information among his associates to maintain a low profile .
' As important as Nasrallah '
Yoram Schweitzer , a senior research fellow at Israel 's Institute for National Security Studies ( INSS ) , believes that Mugniyah 's significance within Hizbullah was close to that of Secretary - General Hassan Nasrallah's .
" Although Nasrallah is the leadership figure , political and very capable , and even though Mugniyah was an operational figure , he led tens of special missions and we should n't underestimate his position , " Schweitzer said in a conversation with Ynet .
According to Schweitzer , Mugniyah appointed successors to take his pace in the future and thus his disappearance from the world wo n't leave his spot open for long .
However , Schweitzer was quick to point out that the terrorist mastermind was a central Hizbullah figure responsible for a long list of terrorist attacks and his elimination was a major accomplishment .
MK Danny Yatom ( Labor ) , who served as Mossad chief in the 90s , said that " Mugniyah was one of the most dangerous terrorist ever .
He operated in complete secrecy and concealed his every action .
He made sure that there was a high degree of compartmentalization around him .
" This was also the reason that it was hard to locate him …Mugniyah operated with full cooperation with Iranian intelligence .
He was a very clever man , " Yatom said .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran blamed its arch foe Israel on Wednesday for the killing of Hezbollah leader Imad Moughniyah in Damascus and condemned it as an act of “ state terrorism ” , the official IRNA news agency said .
Israel has denied any involvement in the killing , seen as a major setback to Syrian and Iranian - backed Hezbollah that fought a 34 - day war with Israel in 2006 .
Moughniyah , 45 , was killed late on Tuesday .
He had been on a list of foreigners Israel wanted to kill or apprehend and the United States had offered a $ 5 million reward for his capture .
“ This measure is the result and another prominent example of organized state terrorism by the Zionist regime ( Israel ) , ” IRNA quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini as saying .
Hezbollah , backed by Shi’ite Muslim Iran , also accused Israel of assassinating Moughniyah , who was head of the Hezbollah security network during Lebanon ’s 1975 - 90 civil war , by planting a bomb in his car .
Hosseini called on the international community to condemn the killing and prevent Israel from “ undertaking similar measures which are in direct contravention of international rules and regulations ” , IRNA said .
He praised Moughniyah , saying his life would constitute “ a golden page in the popular struggle against Zionist aggressors and occupiers ” .
Turns out there are some things worth being afraid of .
An Attorney General of the United States who does n't know whether simulating the drowing of a person is torture is one such thing .
I mean , who has n't heard of Chinese water torture ?
It 's true that one can kill in self - defense or in defense of another and it's also true torture is less definitive than death , but torture can't be considered a " lesser included defense , " especially since there 's absolutely no evidence that it contributes to a successful defense .
If anything , the time and energy expended on forcibly extracting information is a total waste .
Never mind what it does to the psyches of the people who are tasked with this endeavor .
Being ordered to participate in torture must be a devastating experience for all but the most committed sadists .
Chris Dodd 's concern about the Judge 's inability to assert , without equivocation , that the POTUS , as an agent of government , is subject to the limitations of the Constitution and enabling legislation , is equally valid .
How many more times does the Supreme Court have to rule that the executive is acting illegitimately before the message sinks in ?
For that matter , how much longer do we have to wait before the Congress recognizes its obligation to remove an incompetent , if not treasonous , executive ?
Chris Dodd has said he does n't think impeachment is appropriate .
I hope he reconsiders .
If we were to stop taking criminals to trial because some trials are poorly prepared or without merit , our legal system would be a shambles .
CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) - NASA will miss a precious opportunity to fly a probe to Mars due to a conflict of interest in picking a contractor , delaying the mission by more than two years , officials said on Friday .
A handout picture taken by Mars Express , released September 27 shows a general view of the Mars and a marked area north of Valles Marineris September 28 , 2004 .
The images show the Ophir Chasma , a parallel valley to the north of the Valles Marineris .
The sedimentations and morphological shapes in the Valles Marineris offer scientists valuable clues about the origins of the valley systems , which are still obscure .

Berlin
The unspecified conflict has forced the U.S. space agency to disband the panel convened to pick a contractor for the $ 475 - million , five - year mission .
The launch will be delayed from 2011 to 2013 because the most efficient path to Mars from Earth is present only once every 26 months , when the planets ’ orbits bring them into closer - than - usual alignment .
The probe is intended to measure how quickly Mars is losing its atmosphere .
Details of the conflict , which involved either Texas - based Southwest Research Institute or the University of Colorado , were not released to protect proprietary information , Lisa May , the program executive at NASA headquarters , wrote in an e-mail to Reuters .
“ The government has done nothing incorrect or questionable , ” Mars Exploration program director Doug McCuistion said in a conference call with reporters .
He declined to say which proposal generated the conflict .
Resolving the conflict , McCuistion said , “ required disbanding the review panel and reforming a new review panel , all new members under a new contractor . ”
To allow enough time for a full review would have left the winning team squeezed to get its spacecraft ready in time for launch .
RENEWING EXPLORATION
“ We did n’t want to start one of these missions and select them and have them in a less - than - favorable circumstance going into the mission development , so we moved the launch to 2013 , ” McCuistion said .
NASA has been hotly pursuing information about the red planet since the 1990s , when it renewed robotic exploration of Mars after a 20 - year hiatus .
Since then , it has dispatched one or more spacecraft to Mars at every launch opportunity .
Scientists are trying to determine if life ever evolved on Mars .
The atmospheric monitoring probe is intended to provide information about what the planet ’s atmosphere was like long ago .
The planet currently has no magnetic field to protect its thin atmosphere from being blasted away by solar winds .
By measuring the escape rates of various gases , scientists can backtrack to determine if and when the planet ’s protective blanket was ever suitable to sustain life .
In addition to delaying science data , missing the 2011 launch window will cost NASA an extra $ 40 million or so to keep the winning contractor team funded during the two - year delay , McCuistion said .
“ It ’s unfortunate , ” said Ray Arvidson , with Washington University in St. Louis , who serves as the lead scientist for the upcoming Mars lander mission Phoenix .
“ It will delay our understanding of Mars as a system . ”
Several studies of individual universities have determined that freshmen taught by many part - timers were more likely to drop out .
“ Having an adjunct in a course is not necessarily bad for you , but having too many adjuncts might be , ” said Eric P. Bettinger , an economics professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland .
Students say they can often tell when a professor is part - time .
Mike Brennan , a sophomore at the University of Michigan , Dearborn , said the courses taught by adjuncts tend to be more basic and the exams less challenging .
“ They have so many classes that they give tests that are easier to grade , ” Mr. Brennan said .
Carly Matkovich , a senior at the university , said she had bonded more with her part - time teachers , in part because they have more practical experience .
But it is usually hard to find time to talk with them outside class .
“ They ’re never around , ” Ms. Matkovich said .
“ It does make me feel kind of cheated . ”
At some departments the proportion of faculty who are tenured is startlingly low .
The psychology department at Florida International University in Miami has 2,400 undergraduate majors but only 19 tenured or tenure - track professors who teach , according to a department self - assessment .
It is possible for a psychology major to graduate without taking a course with a full - time faculty member .
“ We ’re at a point where it is extreme , ” said Suzanna Rose , a psychology professor who said she stepped down as department head in August , primarily because she could not hire as many tenure - track professors as she thought the department needed .
“ I ’m just very concerned about the quality . ”
Ronald Berkman , the provost at Florida International , disputed her numbers , saying the psychology department has 23 professors who are tenured or tenure track and 5 full - time teachers on contracts .
The department is conducting a search for three more tenure - track professors , Dr. Berkman said .
The third post -1945 invasion was just as momentous , yet official and media silence about it is usually deafening .
Since 1947 , there have been US military bases in the UK : something that would have been unthinkable before 1939 .
Schoolchildren in the United States are still taught that London 's decision to keep 10,000 troops in the colonies after 1763 was one of the precipitants of the American revolution .
Yet , according to the available statistics , over 10,500 US military personnel were stationed in the UK as late as 2005 , a higher total than in any other European state , barring Germany and Italy , both defeated in the second world war .
In all , well over 1.3 million US personnel have been stationed here since 1950 , without - so far as I know - any consultation of the electorate .
It is not the exact number of these troops , however , but what they represent that is significant - namely London 's postwar position of considerable clientage to Washington in terms of foreign policy and much else .
To refer to these subjects is to invite accusations of anti-Americanism .
But I am not anti-American .
I have worked in the US for 20 years .
My point is not American power , but rather the double standard that characterises so much British political discourse .
Sections of the media and members of both major parties have been all too eager to bang the autonomy drum when it comes to Europe .
But there is a marked unwillingness to analyse the challenges to British independence from US influence ; and those touching on the subject are swiftly denounced .
The usual rationalisation for this double standard is that the EU threatens Britain 's internal way of life , while its relationship with the US does not .
This is palpably absurd .
Even leaving aside its military bases , America 's influence on the domestic ordering of British life has been enormous , though sometimes unrecognised .
The central place of deposit for Britain 's historic archives at Kew , for instance , used to be called the Public Record Office , but is now re-named the National Archives .
Why ?
Presumably because this is what the US styles its central place of archival deposit in Washington .
American influence has had far more portentous consequences .
As Timothy Garton
Ash recently remarked on these pages , people in Britain are subject to some of the most extensive official surveillance in the world .
One excuse for this is the threat from terrorism .
Would this threat be as great without our participation in the Iraq war ?
And would Britain have participated in that war had it not been so accustomed to following Washington 's foreign - policy lead ?
Why are large sections of Britain 's political class seemingly at once so enamoured of America , yet so nervous of Brussels ?
The argument that this reflects traditional ties between English - speaking peoples wo n't do .
As historians like Kathleen Burk and Paul Kennedy have documented , before 1914 ( and even after in some cases ) members of Britain 's political elite were more likely to be pro-German than steadfastly pro-American .
Even in the 1920s , Winston Churchill was adamant that " we do not wish to put ourselves in the power of the United States " .
So when David Miliband feels obliged to argue that Europe can aspire only to be a regional power , not a great power ( which might conflict with US interests ) , this reflects less a long tradition of transatlantic amity than a degree of British diffidence in the face of Washington that has arisen since 1945 .
The obvious reason for this has been the extent both of America 's postwar power and Britain 's postwar decline .
Postcolonial critics are , I suspect , wrong when they argue that the mass of British people still mourn the loss of empire .
But Britain 's politicians - and its Foreign Office - have found it hard to adjust to the loss , not so much of onetime colonies , as of the global clout the colonies once afforded .
" Poor loves " , the novelist John Le Carré has one of his characters declare from Oxford ( alma mater of both Tony Blair and David Cameron ) : " Trained to empire , trained to rule the waves .
All gone .
All taken away .
Bye - bye world . "
Shadowing Washington allows official Britons who still hunger for the big stage some continued admission , even if it is only as supporting players .
And there is a further consideration that underlines how closely foreign policy has been bound up with postwar British anxieties .
Conservative and Labour governments have arguably championed British rights in Brussels so ostentatiously in order to deflect public attention away from their deference to Washington .
But British official suspicion of Europe also stems from the challenge it undoubtedly represents to the union .
Scottish and Welsh nationalists , like the Irish Republic before them , favour much closer involvement in the EU precisely because they believe this will lessen their countries ' dependence on Westminster .
Indeed one of the problems with current debates about " Britishness " is that they focus too exclusively on domestic identities and values .
Addressing the question of what Britain is , and of how far it can plausibly function as an independent and united polity , requires a far more informed and even - handed public discussion than exists at present about our relations with both America and the rest of Europe .
Such a discussion might be uncomfortable for more than just the politicians .
Since 1945 , Britain - like much of Europe - has been tacitly involved in a massive bargain .
The US has bankrolled large sectors of our defences , and thus allowed our governments to plough money into various social programmes instead .
The EU - and Miliband was right on this - is itself not remotely close to possessing the kind of firepower that would underpin the vast ambitions of its more ardent supporters .
To this degree , dependence on the US is inescapable , and is likely to be so for some time .
There has been a reluctance to spell this out , and even more of a reluctance to address what might happen if US power recedes in the future to the degree that some American commentators are now predicting .
Would English , Welsh , Scottish and Northern Irish taxpayers be willing to pay more for defence if this meant being less entangled with US priorities and pressures ?
As is true of our foreign relations generally , public debate on this issue has barely begun .

Check out this collection of stories from around the web .
First , there ’s a crushing ABC News story about Hillary Clinton ’s inaction during her tenure with Wal - Mart .
In six years as a member of the Wal - Mart board of directors , between 1986 and 1992 , Hillary Clinton remained silent as the world ’s largest retailer waged a major campaign against labor unions seeking to represent store workers … .
“ I ’m always proud of Wal - Mart and what we do and the way we do it better than anybody else , ” she said at a June 1990 stockholders meeting .
The story reports that video of Wal - Mart ’s many private board meetings never shows Clinton reacting to the other board member ’s vicious anti-union statements .
The story also reports that Clinton ’s main effort on the board , improving conditions for female workers , accomplished little .
Further , the story says that Clinton will keep $ 20,000 in donations from Wal - Mart executives , and that former President Bill Clinton has regular private meetings with Wal - Mart ’s current CEO .
Then there is David Broder who writes in the Washington Post that Barack Obama is the Democratic frontrunner , despite Hillary Clinton ’s polling leads in many February 5 states .
Broder points to establishment Democratic opinion trending toward BHO .
The advantage has shifted back to Barack Obama — thanks to a growing but largely unremarked - upon tendency among Democratic leaders to reject Hillary Clinton and her husband , the former president .
The New York senator could still emerge from the “ Tsunami Tuesday ” voting with the overall lead in delegates , but she is unlikely to come close to clinching the nomination …
That establishment that is heading Obama ’s way ?
That ’s the one the Clintons have owned for nearly two decades .
Think we ’re done ?
Oh , no .
More after the jump .
In the Wall Street Journal , Michael Zeldin compares the questionable but ultimately insubstantial legal work Clinton did for Jim McDougal in Arkansas that was later investigated by Kenneth Starr to the legal work Obama did for “ slumlord ” Tony Rezko that Clinton is now using as an attack line her stump speeches .
After discussing the truly insignificant nature of the Rezko situation , Zeldin writes :
No one who has ever practiced law , let alone Mrs. Clinton , could argue , with a clear conscience , that these five hours on behalf of a church group that partnered with a man who at a later point in time would be alleged to be a scoundrel equated to knowingly representing a Chicago slumlord .
Yet she could not resist leveling the accusation .
I suggest that this provides a window into Mrs. Clinton ’s character because notwithstanding the enormous suffering she had to endure when accused of wrongful conduct in her representation of Madison Guaranty — a representation that appears to have been no more than a routine business transaction — she is willing to behave no differently than did her Whitewater accusers if she can gain politically .
And heavens , we ’re still not finished .
The New York Times reports that Bill Clinton went to the Kazakhstani president and vouched for a Canadian businessman named Giustra seeking inroads into Kazakhstan ’s uranium mining business .
In a simple quid pro quo , Giustra later made a massive donation to Clinton ’s charitable foundation .
The monster deal [ that Giustra signed with Kazakhstan ] stunned the mining industry , turning an unknown shell company into one of the world ’s largest uranium producers in a transaction ultimately worth tens of millions of dollars to Mr. Giustra , analysts said .
Just months after the Kazakh pact was finalized , Mr. Clinton ’s charitable foundation received its own windfall : a $ 31.3 million donation from Mr. Giustra that had remained a secret until he acknowledged it last month .

Before you read the article , make sure you start with a completely solved Rubik 's cube .
Read the whole article , and learn the basic concepts , and make sure you learn the move sequences that are at the end of the article ( " Basic Move Sequences " ) before you mix up the cube .
It 's much easier to see what each move sequence does when you start with a solved cube .
You can do a move sequence , and then see what it does by looking at what happened to the cube .
Note that if you do n't have a solved Rubik 's cube , you can always take the cube apart to fix it manually .
To do this , start by prying out an edge piece ( edges are the pieces that have 2 visible sides to them ) out .
Corner pieces ( corners are the pieces that have 3 visible sides to them ) .
The center pieces ( only 1 visible side ) for each side of the cube cannot be removed .
Once you have the first piece out , you can carefully remove the other pieces and manually reassemble all the pieces to the solved condition .
This article will not attempt to make you a speed cuber .
World class speed cubers can solve a given cube in about 15 seconds .
When you first start trying to solve the cube it will likely take you several minutes , or even more .
However , you can greatly reduce your time by learning how to recognize patterns on the cube , which will tell you what move sequence to do at what times , and then learning to simply execute those move sequences faster .
Of course , you need a quality cube as well -- one where the sides move freely and easily .
Once you have gotten to a place where you can solve the cube , there are many published methods for speed solving the Rubik 's cube .
Some of these include :
There is plenty of information available on the web about these methods , and other methods as well .
However , before you worry about speed cubing , you need to worry about learning the basics .
This is what we are going to try and cover here .
If you have never solved a Rubik 's cube before , and want to get a roadmap to what you need to learn , this is it .

Lastly , a warning .
Learning to solve the cube reliably will take lots of experimentation and practice .
It 's not simple , and there are lots of things to learn .
So be patient ( and stubborn ) and your chances of developing the necessary skills will be much improved .
The Basic Process - Stage 1
The first thing you need to do is subdivide the problem .
You are not going to simply twist the cube a few times and find it solved ( unless it was almost solved already ) .
The way I originally learned to do this was by solving the top layer first .
The following pictures will show you one example of this ( the pictures show the exact same cube from 2 different vantage points ) :
Note that solving a top layer should be pretty easy , even for a beginner .
Solve the edges first , and then the corners .
Here are some routines you can use to help you solve the top layer :
If you are trying to solve the top layer first , the first thing you need to do is to decide what color you are going to have on top .
When first starting out , it 's easier to always have one particular color on top .
This will make pattern recognition easier for you .
The first thing you need to do is to get the edges into place .
In other words , I usually get the white - orange edge , the white - green edge , the white - red edge , and the white - yellow edge in place .
This is very simple to do .
Getting the edges in place can be done with very simple manipulations of the cube .
Which move you are using depends on the situation you have .
The first two examples below are quite simple .
The third example is made a little more complex because we want to put the red - white edge piece in the right place , but we already have all the other edge pieces in place , so we need to get the red - white edge piece in place without upsetting the others .
When you are done , make sure that you have all the edges in the exact right place and rotation .
Then you can work on the corners .
In all of the example sequences below , you have certain pieces on the top surface , the white one , which are already solved , and you are trying to get the corner pieces into the right place .
Here are some examples of moves to use to get the corners in place , once the edges are all set .
There are more variants of these moves that you can learn with practice .
Just a Bit More on the Other Methods
For purposes of perspective , we will take a brief look at the general technique used by the other approaches to solving the cube .
You can skip this section for now , if you are tunnel vision focused on learning how to reliably solve the cube .
Once you have more experience , it will be valuable to see the alternative forms of thinking that people use .
In the Petrus method , you solve a 2 x 3 cylinder first , and the cube looks like this ( again the pictures are the same cube from 2 different vantage points ) :
We are not going to try to teach the Petrus Method here , but simply include these pictures , and the following ones of the Roux Method , to provide some perspective with regard to different approaches .
In the Roux method , you solve 2/3 of 2 opposing sides first .
Here is how the Roux Method looks at this stage shown from 2 different vantage points :
Notice that 2 of the 3 layers of the red side are solved ( shown in the first picture above ) , and 2 of the 3 layers of the orange side are solved ( shown in the 2nd picture above ) .
The Basic Process - Stage 2
Once you solve the first stage , regardless of the method you use , you then advance to the second stage .
In the old fashioned layer by layer method , you solve the second layer , and will end up with a cube that looks something like this ( same cube shown from 2 views ) :
The Petrus Method has this in common , where he solves the complete 2nd layer before moving to deal with the bottom layer .
The Roux method is quite different , and leaves the cube in the following state ( same cube shown from 2 views ) :
Notice in the first picture that on the side with the red center all the orange pieces are correctly oriented , and on the side with the yellow center all the green pieces are correctly oriented , including the green - white edge .
Notice in the second picture that on the side with the orange center all the red pieces are correctly oriented , and on the side with the green center all the yellow pieces are correctly oriented , including the yellow - white edge .
If you study this carefully , you will see that there are only 6 edges out of place , as well as four of the center pieces .
A bit of a peculiar shape , I agree , but this is the path that the Roux Method will take you down .
With that in mind , let 's keep things a bit simpler to think about for the rest of this article .
We 'll continue now with our strategy of solving the cube a layer at a time .
Having solved the first layer , let 's discuss techniques for solving the second layer .
Simple Techniques for Solving a 2nd Layer
There are two moves that I am likely to use in solving the middle layer .
They are the Right Handed Edge Mover and the Left Handed Edge Mover .
To demo these moves , we will flip the cube , so our solved top layer is going to become the bottom layer .
Then , these moves as shown here will help you move edges off the top layer into the middle layer in the correct orientation .
Here they are : Right Handed Edge Mover Basic
Use the mouse to grab the cube and rotate it .
Three edge pieces have changed locations .
Make sure you find them all .
In the first animation , the pieces that have moved are the yellow - white edge , the red - white edge , and the yellow - orange edge piece .
Notice how two edges from the top layer have moved , and one from the middle layer ( the yellow - orange one ) has moved .
Of particular interest is that the yellow - white piece moved from the top layer to the middle layer .
Taking advantage of this will be quite helpful in solving the middle layer .
Left Handed Edge Mover Basic
As with the Right Handed Edge Mover , 3 edge pieces have moved .
Once again , use your mouse to rotate the cube and find them all .
Using your real cube , make sure you do each of the above Basic Move Sequences 3 times in a row to see what it does .
Done correctly , this should return you to a solved cube .
To get a feeling about how to use this we will provide an example of one of the edge movers ( we will use the reverse of the left handed edge mover ) in action .
Notice that the piece that we are moving into place is on the back side , and it is the red - green edge piece .
Also , we have moved the completed layer to the bottom to fit in with the demonstration .
Finishing the cube
Now you want to work on the final stage of this effort .
The first time you read this article , make sure you read through this section to get perspective on what the steps are .
Once you have a flavor for how it works , go through it again with a cube in hand .
Try each of the moves out on a solved cube to see what they do .
You should go through each of the moves multiple times to develop a deeper understanding of the impact of each .
The first thing you need to accept is that you will temporarily upset the work that you have done , but the move sequence will then repair the damage by the time you are done with the sequence .
Do not lose track of where you are during these sequences , because you may end up having to start over .
The easiest way to keep track of where you are is to always hold the cube in your hand with the the same surface facing you and the same surface on top .
Rotate sides of the cube for sure , but never rotate the cube itself in your hands .
You are just asking for trouble if you do !
Former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Greenspan in Washington March 13 , 2007 .
A big overhang of property will bring U.S. house prices down further , but it is too early to say if the economy will plunge into recession , Greenspan said on Friday .
REUTERS / Jim Young
VIENNA ( Reuters ) - A big overhang of property will bring U.S. house prices down further , but it is too early to say if the economy will plunge into recession , former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan was quoted as saying on Friday .
Greenspan said in an interview with Austrian magazine Format that low interest rates in the past 15 years were to blame for the house price bubble , but that central banks were powerless when they tried to bring it under control .
“ It ’s a difficult situation , there is an enormous overhang on the real estate market , ” Greenspan was quoted as saying .
“ Many buildings which just have been finished can’t be sold ... ”
“ So far , prices have dropped only slightly .
But it was enough to cause alarm around the world , ” he said .
“ Prices are going to fall much lower yet . ”
“ However , it is too early to answer the question about a recession .
We simply do n’t know yet .
It depends on how flexibly the economy can react , ” he said .
Greenspan said deregulation and the introduction of market economies in the former Communist bloc after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 had caused a global boom and a worldwide reduction of interest rates , which both helped fuel the property bubble .
“ There is no doubt about the fact that low interest rates for long - term government bonds have caused the real estate bubble in the United States , ” he said .
“ The Federal Reserve began a series of interest rate increases in 2004 .
We were hoping to bring the speculative excesses in the real estate sector under control .
We failed .
We tried it again in 2005 .
Failure , ” he said .
“ Nobody could do anything about it , neither us nor the European Central Bank .
We were powerless , ” he said .

Why are we here ?
Colleges ignore life 's biggest questions , and we all pay the price
In the past few weeks , tens of thousands of young men and women have begun their college careers .
They have worked hard to get there .
A letter of admission to one of the country 's selective colleges or universities has become the most sought - after prize in America .
The students who have won this prize are about to enter an academic environment richer than any they have known .
They will find courses devoted to every question under the sun .
But there is one question for which most of them will search their catalogs in vain :
The question of the meaning of life , of what one should care about and why , of what living is for .
In a shift of historic importance , America 's colleges and universities have largely abandoned the idea that life 's most important question is an appropriate subject for the classroom .
In doing so , they have betrayed their students by depriving them of the chance to explore it in an organized way , before they are caught up in their careers and preoccupied with the urgent business of living itself .
This abandonment has also helped create a society in which deeper questions of values are left in the hands of those motivated by religious conviction - a disturbing and dangerous development .
Over the past century and a half , our top universities have embraced a research - driven ideal that has squeezed the question of life 's meaning from the college curriculum , limiting the range of questions teachers feel they have the right and authority to teach .
And in the process it has badly weakened the humanities , the disciplines with the oldest and deepest connection to this question , leaving them directionless and vulnerable to being hijacked for political ends .
But the encouraging news is that there is , today , a growing hunger among students to explore these topics .
As questions of spiritual urgency - abortion , creationism , the destruction of the environment - move to the center of debate in our society , America 's colleges and universities have a real opportunity to give students the tools to discuss them at a meaningful level .
What our society now desperately needs is what it once had :
An alternative approach to a college education that takes these matters seriously without pretending to answer them in a doctrinaire way .
For this to happen , teachers of the humanities must reconsider the nature and value of their work , and confront the ways in which the modern research ideal has deformed it .
That will require real boldness on their part .
But the stakes are high .
The question of life 's meaning is a worry of the spirit .
Our colleges and universities need to reclaim their authority to speak to the subject , in a conversation broader than any church alone can conduct .
The beneficiaries , in the end , will be both their students and the culture they will inherit .
Before the Civil War , America 's colleges were small institutions with religious roots , training students for the higher professions of medicine , teaching , ministry , and law .
Only a fraction of Americans attended college , and the education they received was based on beliefs whose truth was taken for granted .
The Puritan divines who founded Harvard College in 1636 understood their task to be the education of Christian gentlemen , schooled in the classics and devoted to God .
They knew the answer to the question of what living is for , and saw that their students learned it .
In the years after the Civil War , however , American higher education underwent a fundamental transformation .
Thousands of American educators had gone to Germany earlier in the century to pursue advanced study in their fields , and they returned with a new conception of what institutions of higher learning were for .
The German university of the 19th century was based on a novel assumption with no precedent in the history of education .
This was that universities exist primarily to sponsor research - that their first responsibility is to provide the space , books , and other resources that scholars need to produce new knowledge .
In the 1860s and '70s , a handful of older American colleges , including Harvard , began transforming themselves into research universities , and a number of new schools , such as Cornell and Johns Hopkins , were established to promote research .
The research ideal began to gain influence in every area of study and teaching .
Faculty divided into departments , and then into more specialized units of work .
Departments of philosophy appeared for the first time , followed by departments of English .
In 1893 , the department of biology at the University of Chicago was reorganized into five departments of zoology , botany , anatomy , neurology , and physiology .
At the same time , the religious premises of antebellum education were called into question , in part as a result of the new scientific spirit encouraged by the research ideal .
Increasingly , our colleges and universities , especially the most elite , became secular and specialized institutions .
In the process , the world of higher education assumed the shape it has today .
Graduate schools were created ; scholarly journals were established to publish research .
Centralized control of funds for research became increasingly important .
College teachers were expected to have some specialized knowledge of a particular discipline .
And students were expected to specialize too , by " majoring " in a particular subject .
In the sciences , the adoption of the research ideal has produced astounding results .
Our knowledge of the natural and social worlds , and ability to control them , is a direct result of the modern system of academic research .
In the humanities , however , the legacy of the research ideal has been mixed .
We know vastly more today than we did even 50 years ago about the order of Plato 's dialogues , the accuracy of Gibbon 's citations , and how Benjamin Franklin spent his time in Paris .
But the research ideal has excluded the question of life 's meaning from serious academic concern as a question too large , too unformed , too personal , to be a subject of specialized research .
A tenure - minded junior professor studying Shakespeare or Freud or Spinoza might re-inspect every scrap of his subject 's work with the hope of making some small but novel discovery - but would be either very brave or very foolish to write a book about Spinoza 's suggestion that a free man thinks only of life , never of death ; or about Freud 's appealing , if enigmatic , statement that the meaning of life is to be found in work and love .
As this new vision of higher education took hold in America , faculty members ceased to think of themselves as shapers of souls .
Today 's students are thus denied the opportunity to explore the question of life 's meaning in an organized way , under the guidance of teachers who seek to acquaint their students with the answers contained in the rich tradition whose transmission was once the special duty of the humanities .
It has also put the humanities in the shadow of the natural and social sciences .
Judged by the standards of these latter disciplines , research in the humanities is bound to seem less conclusive , less accretive , less quantifiable .
In philosophy , one can reasonably claim that there has been no meaningful progress since Plato .
For a physicist to say the same thing about Newton would be absurd .
Teachers of the humanities who judge their work strictly from the standpoint of the research ideal condemn themselves to an inferior position in the hierarchy of academic authority and prestige .
Conservatives who bemoan our schools ' disengagement from spiritual questions often point a finger at political correctness , a stifling culture of moral and political uniformity based on progressive ideals .
But to blame political correctness reverses the order of causation .
The culture of political correctness is only a symptom , a discouraging response to a larger sense of directionlessness in the humanities .
Multiculturalism , anti-colonialism , and insistence on race and gender as organizing principles of study are an expression of the anxious search for a new and morally honorable role for the humanities once their older role as guides to the meaning of life lost its credibility .
It is that older role we now need to recover .
Can the meaning of life be studied independent of religion ?
There are many who doubt that it can .
They say that any program of this sort must rest on religious beliefs , which have lost their status as a source of authority in higher education .
But that is a mistake .
For even after the rise of the research university , with its secular and scientific culture , there were humanists who believed that the question of life 's meaning can be studied in a disciplined but nonreligious way .
Their approach gives us a model to follow today .
One of the most forceful proponents of this view was Alexander Meiklejohn , a distinguished professor of government and constitutional law , and the president of Amherst College from 1912 to 1924 .
Meiklejohn insisted that undergraduate education be more than a preparation for a career .
He thought it vital that students also explore what he called " the art of living , " the spiritual question of how they ought to live their lives .
He defended the idea of spiritual seriousness in a nonreligious age , and thought it could be studied without dogmatic commitments .
In the first half of the 20th century , many colleges and universities had programs that sought to implement Meiklejohn 's ideal .
Most have disappeared , though some survive today .
At Reed College in Oregon , freshmen are required to take a yearlong humanities course , for which they prepare by reading Homer 's " Iliad " the summer before .
Columbia University has a core curriculum consisting of four courses devoted to the masterpieces of Western literature , philosophy , music , and art .
At Yale , where I teach , incoming freshmen can apply to the Directed Studies program , which begins in the fall with Herodotus , Homer , and Plato , and concludes in the spring with Wittgenstein , T. S. Eliot , and Hannah Arendt .
These programs differ in many ways , and inevitably reflect the culture of their schools ; some are mandatory and others , like Yale 's Directed Studies , are elective .
But despite their differences , all rest on a set of common assumptions , which together define a shared conception of humane education .
The first is that there is more than one good answer to the question of what living is for .
A second is that the number of such answers is limited , making it possible to study them in an organized way .
A third is that the answers are irreconcilably different , necessitating a choice among them .
A fourth is that the best way to explore these answers is to study the great works of philosophy , literature , and art in which they are presented with lasting beauty and strength .
And a fifth is that their study should introduce students to the great conversation in which these works are engaged - Augustine warily admiring Plato , Hobbes reworking Aristotle , Paine condemning Burke , Eliot recalling Dante , recalling Virgil , recalling Homer - and help students find their own authentic voice as participants in the conversation .
These are challenging works .
But they are accessible too , and an 18 - year - old with some curiosity about life will find much that is inspiring in them : the great battle scenes of " War and Peace , " and Tolstoy 's meditations on the insignificance of the individual in history ; Descartes ' invitation to his readers to doubt everything they think they know , at least once in their lives ; Arendt 's account of Eichmann on trial , and her chilling description of the " banality of evil " ; Virgil 's Aeneas and Jane Austin 's Emma , both in love , but with more on their minds .
Though critics have attacked " great books " programs as a kind of indoctrination into a European - dominated intellectual canon , the students in my Directed Studies class respond in the opposite way .
They become rambunctiously independent .
For they learn that the greatest minds in the world are on their side - or are n't , and feel entitled to quarrel with them .
A college freshman who has read Descartes , and who crafts her own reasons to reject his invitation to doubt , is on her way to an independence of spirit that is surely one of the conditions to living a meaningful life .
For our humanities departments to make room for this kind of study again , they need not repudiate the research ideal .
Much would be lost if they did .
But they can insist that teachers in these fields equip themselves to guide their students in an exploration of life 's meaning , which can be done with confidence and honor only if the research ideal is acknowledged to have limits .
There are hopeful signs this will happen .
The tide of political correctness is receding on our campuses .
There is an increasing demand among undergraduates for courses that address the big questions of life , in all their sprawling grandeur , without reticence or embarrassment .
At Harvard , Michael Sandel 's famous course on justice , which explores the meaning of the concept from Aristotle to Mill and beyond , draws hundreds of students each year .
Ten percent of the freshmen at Yale now apply to Directed Studies - more than can be admitted .
Most importantly , perhaps , the great upsurge of religious fundamentalism outside our colleges and universities is a sign of the growing appetite for spiritual direction .
These movements can be a source of danger and division , and intellectuals may mock and despise them , but teachers also ought to see in them the energy that will drive the restoration of the question of life 's meaning - and , with that , of the humanities themselves - to a central place in our colleges and universities .
The fundamentalists have the wrong answers , but they 've got the right questions .
We need to learn to ask them again in school .
Our culture may be spiritually impoverished , but what it needs is not more religion .
What it needs is an alternative to religion , for colleges and universities to become again the places they once were - spiritually serious but nondogmatic , concerned with the soul but agnostic about God .
Much depends on this .
America 's entire leadership class now goes to college - something that was not true a century ago .
Infusing higher education with a new and vibrant humanism will produce benefits not only for the future leaders of government and business , but for society at large : A richer and more open debate about ultimate values ; an electorate less likely to be cowed into thinking that only the faithful have the right to invoke them ; a humbler regard for the mystery of life in a world increasingly dominated by technocratic reason .
The most immediate beneficiaries of any such revival , however , would be the young men and women in school today .
Instead of offering a disorganized reprieve between the hard work of high school and the challenges of a career , their college education will endow them with priceless materials for a lifetime of struggle with the most important question anyone ever asks .
When this happens , a place in fall 's freshman class will be the prize it ought to be .

BEIJING – Police clamped down in far - flung towns and villages Wednesday seeking to restore control in the Tibetan areas of western China as sporadic demonstrations against Chinese rule in Tibet flared up .
A top Beijing Olympics official vowed the unrest would not disrupt plans for the torch relay preceding this summer ’s Olympics in Beijing .
One leg of the relay is to pass through Tibet , taking the flame to the peak of Mount Everest sometime in May .
The official Xinhua News Agency said late Wednesday that 170 people had surrendered for their role in last week ’s riots in Tibet ’s capital , Lhasa .
The violence injured 325 people , and China says 16 people were killed , denying claims by Tibetan exile groups that 80 died .
Despite an expanding police crackdown , Tibetans have continued to take to the streets to call for Tibet ’s independence and the return of the Dalai Lama , their exiled spiritual leader .
Hundreds of protesters , some on horseback and others on foot , stormed a government compound in the town of Hezuo in Gansu province Tuesday crying “ Free Tibet . ”
Whirling lassos and shaking fists , they burned the Chinese flag and hoisted the emblem of an independent Tibet .

No , this is all I am .

I 'm hot , but I also know about car engines because Michael Bay thinks that the best way to give a character a personality is to have them know something technical .

God , the movie is so cheesy it almost seems like Michael Bay is satirizing his own style .
Eventually , BARRICADE is destroyed , though not enough to prevent it from showing up later in the movie .
Also , BUMBLEBEE converts itself into a modern CAMARO .
SHIA LABEOUF
Wait , transformers can just turn into a completely different machines whenever they want ?
That completely invalidates the premise .
Why does Bumblebee retain aspects of the Camaro when in robot mode if he could just shapeshift into any kind of robot he wants at will ?

Genentech said Tuesday that a new clinical trial had shown that its best - selling drug Avastin was effective in treating breast cancer , a finding that could increase the chances that the product will be approved for that use .
The company said in an announcement after the close of trading that the trial showed that Avastin lengthened the time before the cancer worsened .
Genentech ’s shares rose 2.4 percent , to $ 71.60 , in after - hours trading .
The Food and Drug Administration is scheduled to decide by Feb. 23 whether to approve Avastin for use in treating breast cancer .
The decision is being closely watched as a barometer of the agency ’s standards toward approving new cancer drugs or expanding uses of current medications .
It is possible the F.D.A. will delay the decision past February so it can consider the new data .
Avastin , also known as bevacizumab , is already approved in the United States as a treatment for colorectal and lung cancers .
Genentech sold $ 2.3 billion worth of Avastin in 2007 , all in the United States .
An agency advisory committee voted 5 to 4 in December that Avastin should not be approved for breast cancer .
Conservatives are grieving .
If they had to identify what they are grieving over , many would probably say either the death of the Republican Party or the end of conservative influence .
I am grieving the end of the " specialness " that has been the United States .
Professionals tell us the five stages of grief are :
Denial
Anger
Bargaining
Depression
Acceptance .
I 'm almost out of my depression and arriving at acceptance .
What do I accept ?
That the U.S. is just another European country now .
We are all welfare states if not outright socialist ones and our political choices are between center - left and left - left .
Time to get used to it .
Moving to France wo n't make much difference , whether you are Alec Baldwin or Chuck Norris .
Denial
If you deny this , look at the facts .
Government in the US spent 37 % of GDP in 2006 .
The European countries of Ireland , Switzerland and Slovakia all spent smaller fractions , as did Australia and South Korea .
The OECD total was just a tad more , at 41 % .
The extreme welfare states have tended to regress to the mean .
Sweden , for example , cut government spending from 72 % of GDP to 56 % between 1993 and 2006 .
The US is in the same mix , as we all converge to 40 % territory .
When we all used to believe in God , a tithe was suggested - 10 % .
Now the suggested donation is 40 % .
Except it 's not a donation ; it 's not a mere suggestion ; and it is not rendered to God .
The US is still doing pretty well income - wise as measured by GDP per capita , but the gaps are closing there as well .
In 2004 it was $ 39,732 .
Luxembourg ( $ 60,188 ) and Norway ( $ 40,568 ) were actually richer .
The OECD average was only 72 % of ours , but catching up were Ireland ( 91 % ) , Switzerland ( 87 % ) and others .
In economic freedom , the US is still doing pretty well , but it is not tops .
It scored 80.6 in 2008 as scored by the Heritage Foundation , putting it in fifth place behind Hong Kong , Singapore , Ireland and Australia .
But countries right on our tail , scoring above 75 , were New Zealand , Canada , Chile , Switzerland , the United Kingdom , Denmark , Estonia , the Netherlands , Iceland and Luxembourg .
It seems clear that in economic matters the US has become just another European country .
How are we different ?
While we do n't yet have universal health care , our government spends more on health care than most countries that do .
We pay the lion 's share of defending those countries listed above .
While they spend about 1 % to 2.5 % of their GDP on defense , we spend over 4 % .
We have more lawyers .
According to a sourced wiki site , the US has 70 % of the world 's lawyers but only 5 % of its population .
The US has one lawyer for every 300 people whereas France has only one for every 1,400 .
Our children are less well - educated .
In 2006 they ranked below 28 other countries in science literacy , for example , just below Croatia and Latvia .
I do n't think these differences are what we had in mind when considering the US " special " .
Anger
Conservatives , of course , have recognized this creeping socialism and have been angry about it for some time now .
To be more precise , the anger peaked shortly after election day 1992 .
By 1994 , pundits were analyzing the electoral influence of the " angry white male " .
And conservatives channeled that anger with some effect .
They took control of both houses of Congress in 1994 .
They ended welfare .
They cut federal spending and capital gains tax rates while running budget surpluses .
They impeached President Clinton .
They put President George H. W. Bush 's son ( he born with " a silver foot in his mouth " ) in the Presidency and gave him both houses of Congress in 2000 , and again in 2002 after Jumpin ' Jim Jeffords beat McCain to the Independent punch .
But what they ended up with for their efforts was " compassionate conservatism " .
President George W. Bush increased federal spending from Clinton 's 18.4 % of GDP ( lowest since 1966 ) to over 20 % .
Surpluses became deficits .
Campaign financing was " reformed " .
Clinton 's Americorps was expanded .
No child was left without Ted Kennedy holding one hand and the National Education Association holding the other .
Normal light bulbs were outlawed .
Bono wants aid for Africa ?
Have him visit our Treasury Secretary or the Pentagon and double African AIDS funding .
Barack Obama suggests a $ 120B economic stimulus package ?
Send the Senate a $ 150B one .
Time to bargain .
Bargaining
Just as conservatives realized in horror what an all - Republican government did with its first chance at total governance in 48 years , an opportunity to fix things appeared : the 2008 elections .
Our bargaining would take place in the greatest political bazaar of all - the U.S. presidential primaries .
The menagerie of candidates ranged from the bizarre Ron Paul and the perennial Alan Keyes to the pro-choice Rudy Giuliani , the effervescent Fred Thompson , the Mormon Mitt Romney and the Reverend Mike Huckabee .
After all the give and take of democratic debate and real voting , the last man standing was John McCain -- the 71 - year - old who has spent the last 26 years in Congress and who gave us McCain - Feingold , McCain - Kennedy and McCain - Lieberman .
So much for bargaining .
Depression
According to the Mayo Clinic , the following are signs of depression .
Loss of interest in normal daily activities .
Depressed mood .
Sleep disturbances .
Impaired thinking or concentration .
Changes in weight .
Agitation .
Fatigue or slowing of body movements .
Low self - esteem or guilt .
Less interest in sex .
Thoughts of death .
Sound familiar ?
Well , not that sex one of course .
But what about the others ?
Examples of " depressed mood " , " impaired thinking " or " agitation " , can be found among the comment posts on conservative web sites like Lucianne or Free Republic .
For " sleep disturbances " look at the times of day they were posted .
For " low self - esteem " or " guilt " , look at the blame being thrown on fellow Republicans or conservatives .
For " thoughts of death " , hear what people say about the Republican Party .
My friends ( as John McCain might say ) , there is only one step left in our grieving .
Acceptance
Look at it this way .
You 've been stranded on an island inhabited by people who look like you but who have strange beliefs .
They think you get more jobs by raising costs on people who provide them .
They think you get less poverty by paying people to prove they are poor .
They think you move toward a color blind society by requiring people to check a box for " race " on official forms .
They think a jury is better informed if evidence is withheld from it .
They think war is best avoided by not preparing for one .
They think voter choice is improved by outlawing ads paid for by citizens ( with exceptions given to the candidates themselves and newspaper editors ) .
They 're not quite sacrificing virgins to the volcano , but they are willing to sacrifice large fractions of the economy because the temperature increased one degree over the last one hundred years and their computer - driven oracles tell them it 's your fault .
And they are a bit touchy .
Of a population around 6 billion , they killed upwards of 170 million of each other in the last century , not counting garden - variety murders .
Draw the wrong cartoon and you might be next .
It 's the democracy , stupid .
There 's not much you can do about it .
Try to get along .
Hang out with the friendlier ones .
Do n't tell them you think their beliefs are strange ; it will upset them .
Talk about baseball or something .
( But not the weather ! )
That shining city on the hill you thought you saw ?
A mirage .
An atmospheric or historic anomaly .
Move on .
You are stuck on this island .
Accept it .
Make the best of it .
At least that 's what I keep telling myself .
Then again , there 's maybe Ireland .
Efforts to Place Op - Ed on Issue Blocked by Leading Papers
Faced with an obstructionist leadership in the House , and a mainstream media that have forsaken their role as a Fourth Estate monitor of government abuse , three Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee are calling on the public to demand that the Congress initiate impeachment hearings immediately against Vice President Dick Cheney .
Speaking at a telephone press conference Friday organized by Democrats.com , Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) said that following a bi-partisan vote Nov. 7 by the full House to send Rep. Dennis Kucinich 's Cheney impeachment bill ( H Res 799 , formerly H Res 333 ) to the Judiciary Committee , it was time for those hearings to " immediately " get underway .
Scoffing at the argument that has been made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others in the Democratic leadership that impeachment might hurt Democratic chances in the November '08 elections , or that it could deter Democrats from their Congressional agenda , Wexler says , " I believe that there is a constitutional obligation for the Congress to hold this administration accountable , and it should not depend on what people think the impact might be on an election .
The only question should be : Did Vice President Cheney abuse his powers ? "
He adds , " If the American people believe that the democrats are holding a legitimate inquiry into serious issues of constitutional importance , they will not hold it against them .
And besides , initial polling would indicate that this is not some off - the - reservation idea . "
The Florida legislator , who had not been among the 22 co-sponsors of the impeachment bill submitted last April 24 by Rep.
Kucinich , says that by beginning impeachment hearings in the House , " We would create our own fate , and we should n't be afraid of that fate . "
Noting that the Democratic congressional leadership has been opposing impeachment by saying that they were sent to Washington " to act on issues like insuring children and ending the war , " Wexler says , " We have followed that strategy for a year now , and what we have been met with is a president who will not sign any of these measures and a Senate mired in filibusters .
We have nothing to lose by starting impeachment . "
A major problem in challenging the Democratic leadership , however , has arisen in the form of a national media that simply ignores the growing national impeachment movement and the growing calls for impeachment within the Congress .
Wexler reports that an opinion article ( available at www.wexlerwantshearings.com) penned by himself and two Judiciary Committee colleagues , Reps. Luis Gutierrez ( D - IL ) and Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , which was sent to a number of leading newspapers , including the Miami Herald , the Washington Post and the New York Times , was rejected for publication -- an astonishing act of censorship for a document authored by three members of congress on an issue of such significance as impeachment of the vice president .
In that article , Wexler , Gutierrez and Baldwin write :
The issues at hand are too serious to ignore , including credible allegations of abuse of power that if proven may well constitute high crimes and misdemeanors under our constitution .
The charges against Vice President Cheney relate to his deceptive actions leading up to the Iraq war , the revelation of the identity of a covert agent for political retaliation , and the illegal wiretapping of American citizens .
Now that former White House press secretary Scott McClellan has indicated that the Vice President and his staff purposefully gave him false information about the outing of Valerie Plame Wilson as a covert agent to report to the American people , it is even more important for Congress to investigate what may have been an intentional obstruction of justice .
Congress should call Mr. McClellan to testify about what he described as being asked to " unknowingly [ pass ] along false information . "
In addition , recent revelations have shown that the Administration including Vice President Cheney may have again manipulated and exaggerated evidence about weapons of mass destruction -- this time about Iran 's nuclear capabilities .
Asked why he thought leading publications had refused to publish the op - ed piece calling for an immediate start to impeachment hearings , Wexler says , " I think the mainstream media , at least thus far , have bought the notion that impeachment hearings are outside the bounds of what Congress ought to be doing . "
He adds that there may be a fear , on the part of corporate media executives and editors , and on the part of Democratic Party congressional leaders , of having been " complicit " in many of the administration 's constitutional crimes .
" There may be some significant conflicts of interest , " he says , that could make them feel uncomfortable about the idea of impeachment hearings .
To push back against this unseemly resistance Rep. Wexler and his two House colleagues have decided to go public with their message .
Wexler has set up a website , called WexlerWantsHearings.com .
He is urging Americans from across the country to go to the sign and sign on to his call for an immediate start to hearings .
" I want to be able to go to my colleagues in the house and say I have 55,000 people calling for hearings , " he says .
People should also be contacting their local and national media outlets -- and especially the New York Times , Washington Post and Miami Herald - - demanding that they report openly and honestly on the growing impeachment movement , and that they publish the Wexler , Gutierrez Baldwin op -ed .
While he does not say where he thinks House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) stands at this point on the subject of starting hearings on the long - stalled Kucinich impeachment bill , which has languished in a subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee for over half a year , Rep .
Wexler said he has spoken with Conyers about the matter .
" I have a lot of confidence in John , " he says .
Wexler's , Gutierrez 's and Baldwin 's new push on impeachment comes just as Kucinich , a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination , has announced that he is preparing to file a major bill of impeachment against President Bush .
Kucinich is reportedly working on a sweeping 50 - page impeachment bill containing over 20 counts of high crimes and misdemeanors against the president .
Asked about this , and whether it would alter his push for early hearings on Cheney 's impeachable crimes , Wexler says no .
While pointedly agreeing that the president is likely guilty of the same abuses of power that are being alleged against Cheney , " and probably others in addition , " he says it makes sense to focus first on the vice president .
" Strategically , I think we are on stronger ground pursuing the vice president . "

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - A two - time Mexico City “ policeman of the year ” has been arrested on suspicion of extorting money from illegal “ car- watchers ” who demand tips for curbside parking .
Police said Alejandro Garnino , who was awarded Mexico City ’s highest police honor in 2005 and 2006 , is suspected of charging up to 1,000 pesos ( $ 94 ) to allow dozens of car - watchers to operate outside one of Mexico ’s largest stadiums .
“ It is a shock to all of us .
His conduct was such a shining example , ” an official at Mexico City ’s police force said on Wednesday .
He said Garnino turned himself in on Monday night .
Corruption plagues Mexico ’s underpaid police forces , where officers regularly take bribes to turn a blind eye to offenses from traffic violations to kidnapping and drug dealing .
In Mexico ’s most violent drug hotspots near the U.S. border , President Felipe Calderon has sent the army to clean up police , but army generals say corruption is so deep that cleansing the forces could take years .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Troops in Iraq have found a medical facility next to the torture complex discovered last week near the Diyala province city of Muqdadiya , according to the top U.S. general in Iraq .
These bodies were found last week in a mass grave at the complex where an insurgent medical facility was found .

Gen .
David Petraeus told CNN that the facility was part of a larger complex belonging to al Qaeda in Iraq and that a large weapons cache was also found .
The general cited a similar complex found in Baquba last June and said the complexes typically have torture rooms , courthouses , weapons and food warehouses , and medical facilities .
Last week , coalition forces found 26 bodies buried in mass graves , a bloodstained torture complex with chains hanging from walls and ceilings , and a bed connected to an electrical system .
The complex was in an area thought to be an al Qaeda in Iraq haven and operating base , the military said .
Iraqis had tipped off Task Force Iron members about the site during an earlier operation .
Elsewhere in the province , a bomber blew himself up in the middle of a funeral procession , killing nine people and wounding 20 , a Baquba police official said .
Casualties included members of an Awakening Council -- a grass - roots anti-al - Qaeda movement .
Among the dead was Hajj Farhan al - Baharzawi , the local head of the Brigades of 20th Revolution , a former Sunni insurgent group -- now an ally of the U.S. military .
According to police , the funeral was for Auday Mohammed Hassan , another Awakening Council member who was mistakenly killed by the U.S. military in Baquba hours earlier .
The attack was one of two suicide attacks ; another , in the northern city of Baiji , killed at least 25 people and wounded 80 as people were picking up cylinders of cooking gas .
Watch the scene of the attack »
A number of people were killed by exploding gas cylinders , a police official said .
Baiji Police Chief Saad Nufoos was fired after the attack , an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said .
Other developments
Two U.S. soldiers were killed and three were wounded Wednesday by small - arms fire in northern Iraq 's Nineveh province , the U.S. military said .
This brings the number of U.S. military deaths in the war to 3,893 and the number in December to 19 ; seven U.S. military contractors also have died in the war .
The U.S. military announced the killing of Abu Abdullah , a high - level al Qaeda in Iraq leader , near Samarra on November 8 , and of four insurgents in operations on Wednesday in central Iraq .
About 73,000 Iraqis have joined groups opposing al Qaeda in Iraq , according to Maj. Gen. Kevin Bergner , Multi-National Force - Iraq spokesman -- and Phil Reeker , counselor for public affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad .

The decade of 1998 - 2007 is the warmest on record , according to data sources obtained by the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) .
The global mean surface temperature for 2007 is currently estimated at 0.41°C/0.74 °F above the 1961-1990 annual average of 14.00 °C /57.20 °F .
The University of East Anglia and the Met Office 's Hadley Centre have released preliminary global temperature figures for 2007 , which show the top 11 warmest years all occurring in the last 13 years .
The provisional global figure for 2007 using data from January to November , currently places the year as the seventh warmest on records dating back to 1850 .
Other remarkable global climatic events recorded so far in 2007 include record - low Arctic sea ice extent , which led to first recorded opening of the Canadian Northwest Passage ; the relatively small Antarctic Ozone Hole ; development of La Niña in the central and eastern Equatorial Pacific ; and devastating floods , drought and storms in many places around the world .
The preliminary information for 2007 is based on climate data up to the end of November from networks of land - based weather stations , ships and buoys , as well as satellites .
The data are continually collected and disseminated by the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services ( NMHS ) of WMO ’s 188 Members and several collaborating research institutions .
Final updates and figures for 2007 will be published in March 2008 in the annual WMO brochure for the Statement on the Status of the Global Climate .
WMO ’s global temperature analyses are based on two different sources .
One is the combined dataset maintained by both the Hadley Centre of the UK Meteorological Office , and the Climatic Research Unit , University of East Anglia , UK , which at this stage ranked 2007 as the seventh warmest on record .
The other dataset is maintained by the US Department of Commerce ’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , which indicated that 2007 is likely to be the fifth warmest on record .
Since the start of the 20th century , the global average surface temperature has risen by 0.74°C .
But this rise has not been continuous .
The linear warming trend over the last 50 years ( 0.13 °C per decade ) is nearly twice that for the last 100 years .

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ’s 4th Assessment ( Synthesis ) Report , 2007 , “ warming of the climate system is unequivocal , as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures , widespread melting of snow and ice , and rising global average sea level . ”
2007 global temperatures have been averaged separately for both hemispheres .
Surface temperatures for the northern hemisphere are likely to be the second warmest on record , at 0.63 °C above the 30 - year mean ( 1961-90 ) of 14.6°C/58.3 °F .
The southern hemisphere temperature is 0.20 °C higher than the 30 - year average of 13.4°C / 56.1 °F , making it the ninth warmest in the instrumental record since 1850 .
January 2007 was the warmest January in the global average temperature record at 12.7°C / 54.9 °F , compared to the 1961- 1990 January long - term average of 12.1 °C / 53.8 °F .
Regional temperature anomalies
2007 started with record breaking temperature anomalies throughout the world .
In parts of Europe , winter and spring ranked amongst the warmest ever recorded , with anomalies of more than 4 °C above the long - term monthly averages for January and April .
advertisement
Extreme high temperatures occurred in much of Western Australia from early January to early March , with February temperatures more than 5 °C above average .
Two extreme heat waves affected south - eastern Europe in June and July , breaking previous records with daily maximum temperatures exceeding 40 °C / 104°F in some locations , including up to 45 °C / 113 °F in Bulgaria .
Dozens of people died and fire - fighters battled blazes devastating thousands of hectares of land .
A severe heat wave occurred across the southern United States of America during much of August with more than 50 deaths attributed to excessive heat .
August to September 2007 was extremely warm in parts of Japan , setting a new national record of absolute maximum temperature of 40.9°/105.6 °F on 16 August .
In contrast , Australia recorded its coldest ever June with the mean temperature dropping to 1.5 °C below normal .
South America experienced an unusually cold winter ( June - August ) , bringing winds , blizzards and rare snowfall to various provinces with temperatures falling to - 22°C /- 7.6 °F in Argentina and - 18°C /- 0.4 °F in Chile in early July .
Prolonged drought
Across North America , severe to extreme drought was present across large parts of the western U.S. and Upper Midwest , including southern Ontario / Canada , for much of 2007 .
More than three - quarters of the Southeast U.S. was in drought from mid-summer into December , but heavy rainfall led to an end of drought in the southern Plains .
In Australia , while conditions were not as severely dry as in 2006 , long term drought meant water resources remained extremely low in many areas .
Below average rainfall over the densely populated and agricultural regions resulted in significant crop and stock losses , as well as water restrictions in most major cities .
China experienced its worst drought in a decade , affecting nearly 40 million hectares of farmland .
Tens of millions of people suffered from water restrictions .
Flooding and intense storms
Flooding affected many African countries in 2007 .
In February , Mozambique experienced its worst flooding in six years , killing dozens , destroying thousands of homes and flooding 80,000 hectares of crops in the Zambezi valley .
In Sudan , torrential rains caused flash floods in many areas in June / July , affecting over 410,000 people , including 200,000 left homeless .
The strong southwesterly monsoon resulted in one of the heaviest July - September rainfall periods , triggering widespread flash floods affecting several countries in West Africa , Central Africa and parts of the Greater Horn of Africa .
Some 1.5 million people were affected and hundreds of thousands homes destroyed .
In Bolivia , flooding in January - February affected nearly 200,000 people and 70,000 hectares of cropland .
Strong storms brought heavy rain that caused extreme flooding in the littoral region of Argentina in late March / early April .
In early May , Uruguay was hit by its worst flooding since 1959 , with heavy rain producing floods that affected more than 110,000 people and severely damaged crops and buildings .
Triggered by storms , massive flooding in Mexico in early November destroyed the homes of half a million people and seriously affected the country ’s oil industry .
In Indonesia , massive flooding on Java in early February killed dozens and covered half of the city of Jakarta by up to 3.7 metres of water .
Heavy rains in June ravaged areas across southern China , with flooding and landslides affecting over 13.5 million people and killing more than 120 .
Monsoon - related extreme rainfall events caused the worst flooding in years in parts of South Asia .
About 25 million people were affected in the region , especially in India , Pakistan , Bangladesh and Nepal .
Thousands lost their lives .
However , rainfall during the Indian summer monsoon season ( June - September ) for India was , generally , near normal ( 105 % of the long - term average ) , but with marked differences in the distribution of rainfall in space and time .
A powerful storm system , Kyrill , affected much of northern Europe during 17 - 18 January 2007 with torrential rains and winds gusting up to 170 km / h .
There were at least 47 deaths across the region , with disruptions in electric supply affecting tens of thousands during the storm .
England and Wales recorded its wettest May - July period since records began in 1766 , receiving 406 mm of rain compared to the previous record of 349 mm in 1789 .
Extensive flooding in the region killed nine and caused more than US $ 6 billion in damages .
Development of La Niña
The brief El Niño event of late 2006 quickly dissipated in January 2007 , and La Niña conditions became well established across the central and eastern Equatorial Pacific in the latter half of 2007 .
In addition to La Niña , unusual sea surface temperature patterns with cooler than normal values across the north of Australia to the Indian Ocean , and warmer than normal values in the Western Indian Ocean , were recorded .
These are believed to have modified the usual La Niña impacts in certain regions around the world .
The current La Niña is expected to continue into the first quarter of 2008 at least .
Devastating tropical cyclones
Twenty - four named tropical storms developed in the North - West Pacific during 2007 , below the annual average of 27 .
Fourteen storms were classified as typhoons , equalling the annual average .
Tropical cyclones affected millions in south - east Asia , with typhoons Pabuk , Krosa , Lekima and tropical storms like Peipah among the severest .
During the 2007 Atlantic Hurricane season , 14 named storms occurred , compared to the annual average of 12 , with 6 being classified as hurricanes , equalling the average .
For the first time since 1886 , two category 5 hurricanes ( Dean and Felix ) made landfall in the same season .
In February , due to tropical cyclone Gamède , a new worldwide rainfall record was set in French La Reunion with 3,929 mm measured within three days .
In June , cyclone Gonu made landfall in Oman , affecting more than 20,000 people and killing 50 , before reaching the Islamic Republic of Iran .
There is no record of a tropical cyclone hitting Iran since 1945 .
On 15 November , tropical cyclone Sidr made landfall in Bangladesh , generating winds of up to 240 km/h and torrential rains .
More than 8.5 million people were affected and over 3,000 died .
Nearly 1.5 million houses were damaged or destroyed .
Often hit by cyclones , Bangladesh has developed a network of cyclone shelters and a storm early - warning system , which significantly reduced casualties .
Australia ’s 2006 /2007 tropical season was unusually quiet , with only five tropical cyclones recorded , equalling the lowest number observed since at least 1943 - 44 .
Relatively small Antarctic ozone hole
The 2007 Antarctic ozone hole was relatively small due to mild stratosphere winter temperatures .
Since 1998 , only the 2002 and 2004 ozone holes were smaller .
In 2007 , the ozone hole reached a maximum of 25 million square kms in mid-September , compared to 29 million square kms in the record years of 2000 and 2006 .
The ozone mass deficit reached 28 megatonnes on 23 September , compared to more than 40 megatonnes in the record year of 2006 .
Record - low Arctic sea ice extent opened the Northwest Passage
Following the Arctic sea ice melt season , which ends annually in September at the end of the northern summer , the average “ sea ice extent ” was 4.28 million square kms , the lowest on record .
The “ sea ice extent ” at September 2007 was 39 % below the long - term 1979 - 2000 average , and 23 % below the previous record set just two years ago in September 2005 .
For the first time in recorded history , the disappearance of ice across parts of the Arctic opened the Canadian Northwest Passage for about five weeks starting 11 August .
Nearly 100 voyages in normally ice - blocked waters sailed without the threat of ice .
The September rate of sea ice decline since 1979 is now approximately 10 % per decade , or 72,000 square kms per year .
Sea level rise continues
The sea level continued to rise at rates substantially above the average for the 20th century of about 1.7 mm per year .
Measurements show that the 2007 global averaged sea level is about 20 cm higher than the 1870 estimate .
Modern satellite measurements show that since 1993 global averaged sea level has been rising at about 3 mm per year .

The process was started in late 2002 , Dr. Venter said , and undoubtedly cost millions of dollars .
That led some scientists to question why someone would want to synthesize an entire organism .
Scientists can already make useful organisms  including some that are now starting to be make biofuels  by modifying existing ones using genetic engineering .
“ It ’s not entirely clear to me what the immediate purpose of doing something like this is , ” said Jeremy Minshull , chief executive of DNA 2.0 , a company that supplied some of the DNA stretches to the Venter team .
“ To some extent , it ’s something that was driven by ‘ I want to be the first person to do it . ’ ”
Right now , Mr. Minshull said , scientists do not know enough about how living things work to design an entire genome : “ Now our synthetic capability way outpaces our understanding of what we want to do . ”
For now , that is the case , Dr. Venter concedes .
He has a company , Synthetic Genomics , that is using genetic engineering to produce biofuels .
It is using organisms other than Mycoplasma genitalium , which was chosen for the synthetic genome project because its genome is tiny , one - tenth the size of the genomes of some other bacteria .
But Mycoplasma is not suited to industrial production .
Still , Dr. Venter and some other scientists say that DNA synthesis is following the path of computer chips , with capability rising rapidly and cost  now about $ 1 per base  falling swiftly .
At some point , they say , it will become faster and cheaper for scientists to design and synthesize an organism from scratch rather than cut and paste genes from one organism to another , just as it is sometimes easier for a writer to type a fresh draft rather than edit an existing one .
The ability to synthesize genomes would allow for more scientific experimentation .
Dr. Venter said he would now be able to create organisms missing dozens of genes to answer the initial question that sparked the research ten years ago :
What is the minimum set of genes needed for life ?
Dr. Venter , who runs the nonprofit J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville , Md. , has been a pioneer in genomics .
He is best known for sequencing the human genome in a race with the publicly funded Human Genome Project .
The method his team used was novel at the time , but is now widely accepted .
It turned out that the genome his team sequenced was his own , making Dr. Venter the first person to have his complete DNA sequence published .
The value of the dollar fell after the Fed cut US interest rates last week
Figures showed that US consumer confidence has fallen to a near two - year low , while house prices have seen the sharpest drop in 16 years .
Analysts said the data boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates still further .
In early trading on Wednesday , the euro hit a high of $ 1.4162 , before pulling back to $ 1.4131 by 2230 GMT .
' Anti-dollar momentum '
The Fed cut US interest rates to 4.75 % from 5.25 % last week , in a move aimed at restoring confidence in both the housing and financial markets .
It was the first US rate cut in four years .
" Momentum to sell the dollar remains strong , " said Hideaki Inoue , foreign exchange manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking in Tokyo .
In further bad news for the US economy on Wednesday , orders for durable goods , which include everything from washing machines to commercial jets , fell by a bigger - than - expected 4.9 % .
The high value of the euro has caused concern among European exporters , as it makes their products more expensive in the US .
Planemaker Airbus has already warned that jobs could be affected if the euro remains so strong .
Bishop Cappio collapsed on Wednesday
Dom Luiz Flavio Cappio " decided to interrupt the fasting , but not the fight " , his assistant said .
The bishop wants to halt a project to divert waters from South America 's fourth largest river , saying it will cause lasting environmental damage .
But President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Thursday : " There is no way the government will give in . "
The government says more than 12 million people in Brazil 's arid north - east will benefit from the project on the Sao Francisco river .
The project had been halted after a lower court had suspended work over alleged irregularities in the approval of the $ 2bn ( £ 1 bn ) project .
But on Wednesday the Supreme Court overturned that ruling by a margin of six votes to three .
President Lula , a keen proponent of the scheme , said : " The project will go ahead . "
However , the Supreme Court has to make a further ruling , which could yet halt the plan .
Safety factor
Bishop Cappio , 61 , had began his hunger strike on 27 November .
He was taken to hospital in the city of Petrolina on Wednesday after losing consciousness , prompting increasing worries over his health .
The bishop 's chapel is in Sobradinho on the banks of the Sao Francisco
On Thursday , local indigenous groups came to the clinic where Bishop Cappio was being treated to sing and dance in a show of support for him .
Both the Vatican and the Brazilian Council of Bishops had been in negotiations with the bishop in an attempt to end his protest , citing his own safety as a factor .
The bishop 's decision to call off his hunger strike was announced in a letter read out at an emotional mass in the village of Sobradinho , not far from the river at the centre of the controversy .
Bishop Cappio , who had just been released from hospital , did not speak but sat on a chair placed by the altar at the outdoor mass , the BBC's Gary Duffy reports from Petrolina .
A letter read out on his behalf said he accepted the concerns of his friends and all those involved in the protest and the most important thing was to keep fighting against the river diversion project .
The announcement was greeted with prolonged applause .
The irrigation project would bring water through 700 km ( 435 miles ) of canals to people and farmers in the north - eastern region of the country .
Environmental activists say the project would badly affect biodiversity and possibly the navigability of the river .
In its ruling , the Supreme Court disagreed and said the project could proceed .
But the court did not rule on the alleged irregularities in the project 's approval process , and work on the dam can only go ahead until the court decides on the merits of the case at a later date .
If the court decides against the plan , it could be shelved for a second time .
US President George W Bush has given his first interview to the BBC in almost seven years .
Here is the full transcript of his conversation with BBC World News America presenter Matt Frei :
Matt Frei : Mr President , thanks for joining us .
You 're famous for saying that you do n't believe in opinion polls .
President George W Bush : Yeah !
Frei :
Do you have any idea how you rate in the countries that you 're going to be visiting in Africa ?
Mr Bush : No , sir .
I do n't .
Frei :
But , I 've got news for you and it 's good news .
Mr Bush :
All right .
Frei :
You rate pretty well .
It 's sort of - you know , in the average 80 s ...
Is that one of the reasons why you 're going there ?
This is one the parts of the world where you 're still very popular ?

Mr Bush : I - I go where needed .
And - no , I 'm going there because I 've got a firm , heartfelt commitment to the continent of Africa and have ever since I became president .
General interest - national interest that we have people who are suffering from disease and hunger and hopelessness .
The only way a radical can recruit is to find somebody who 's hopeless .
I mean , their vision is , like , really dark and dim .
Plus -
I believe without to whom much is given , much is required .
And - America 's been given a lot .
And it 's required of us to help those that suffer .
So ... mine is a mission of mercy and a mission of the cold realism of the world in which we live - based upon the realism of the world in which we live .
Frei : Your administration has given $ 15 bn to treat Aids in Africa ?
Mr Bush : Yeah .
Frei :
Which is an unprecedented amount of money , and you want to double that amount yet again ?
Mr Bush : Yeah .
Frei :
This is a huge commitment .
And , yet , the administration and you , personally , do n't seem to be getting a lot of credit for it .
Mr Bush : Yeah - you know , this is kind of tied to your first question about polls .
Polls are nothing more than just , like , a puff of air .
What matters is results .
And , ultimately , people will be able to make , you know , an objective judgment of a president and his administration and , in this case , a country 's commitment .
And so I care really about is the results of the programmes .
I hope by now people have learned that I 'm not one of these guys that - really gives a darn about elite opinion .
What I really care about is , are we saving lives ?
And in this case , we are .
As I mentioned in my speech that you kindly listened to - when I first went to Sub - Saharan Africa , 50,000 were receiving antiretrovirals .
Today , 1.3 million .
And that 's a lot in a very quick period of time .
But , there 's so much more suffering .
And that 's why I 've called for a doubling of aid .
The good news is , it 's not just America .
As I mentioned in my speech , the G8 nations also are supporting this very important initiative .
And , you know , it 's ... like an effort of mercy .
Frei :
But , it has made a huge difference , has n't it ?
So ...
Mr Bush : Yeah .
Frei :
Why not take some credit for it ?
Mr Bush : Because it 's just not my nature , you know ?
You just gotta understand about me , I 'm more interested in seeing results and sharing the credit with the American people .
I mean , this is not a George Bush effort .
I just happened to be the leader of a nation that 's willing to fund this kind of money .
And so , I praised Congress in my speech .
I praised the American [ people ] in my speech .
After all , they 're the ones who funded the effort .
Frei :
You were very tough in your speech about Darfur .
And , yet again , you called what 's happening there genocide ?
Mr Bush : Yeah .
Frei :
Is enough being done by your administration to stop that ?
PRESIDENT BUSH'S ITINERARY Benin - Cotonou : arrival ceremony , meets president Tanzania - Dar-es - Salaam : meets president , tours hospital ; Arusha : tours hospital , textile mill and girls ' school Rwanda - Kigali : meets president , visits genocide memorial Ghana - Accra : meets president , state dinner Liberia - Monrovia : meets president , visits university
Rice to visit Kenya
Mr Bush : I think we are .
Yeah .
You know , I had to make a seminal decision .
And that is whether or not I would commit US troops into Darfur .
And I was pretty well backed off of it by - you know , a lot of folks - here in America that care deeply about the issue .
And so , once you make that decision , then you have to rely upon an international organisation like the United Nations to provide the oomph - necessary manpower ...
You know , I read - did call it ( SOUND GLITCH ) genocide , and I think we 're the only nation that has done so .
Secondly , I did remind people that we 're sanctioning leaders .
That we have targeted [ Sudanese ] companies and individuals , including a rebel leader , who have yet to be constructive in the peace process .
We [ are ] beginning to get a sense of these things as they 're affecting behaviour .
We 're trying to ask others , by the way , to do the same thing .
Some of who are reluctant ; some who are n't .
And then , finally , I pledged that we 'll help move troops in .
And yeah , and as I also said you might remind your listeners , that I 'm frustrated by the pace .
Frei : I 'll get on to that in a minute .
But , I mean , genocide is just a loaded - it 's such an important word .
And you have committed troops - American troops around the world in other cases throughout ...
Afghanistan .
Why not in this case ?
Mr Bush :
Well , that 's a good question .
I mean , we 're committing equipment , you know ?
Training , help , movement .
I think a lot of the folks who are concerned about America into another Muslim country .
Some of the relief groups here just did n't think the strategy would be as effective as it was .
I mean , actually , believe it or not , listen to people 's opinions .
And chose to make this decision .
It 's a decision that I 'm now living with .
And it 's a decision that requires us to continue to rally the conscience of the world and get people to focus on the issue .
You know , you 're right .
I mean , we sent marines into Liberia , for example , to help stabilise the country there .
And Liberia 's on my itinerary where I 'll meet with the first woman , you know , elected president in Africa - history .
And - but , I just made the decision I made .
Frei : Yesterday , Steven Spielberg - the Hollywood director - pulled out of the Beijing Olympics over Darfur .
He said the Chinese are n't doing enough to stop the killing in Darfur .
Do you applaud his move ?
Mr Bush :
That 's up to him .
I 'm going to the Olympics .
I view the Olympics as a sporting event .
On the other hand , I have a little different platform than Steven Spielberg so , I get to talk to President Hu Jintao .
And I do remind him that he can do more to relieve the suffering in Darfur .
There 's a lot of issues that I suspect people are gonna , you know , opine , about during the Olympics .
I mean , you got the Dali Lama crowd .
You 've got global warming folks .
You 've got , you know , Darfur and ...
I am not gonna you know , go and use the Olympics as an opportunity to express my opinions to the Chinese people in a public way ' cause I do it all the time with the president .
I mean .
So , people are gonna be able to choose - pick and choose how they view the Olympics .
Frei :
The Chinese government has been saying - part in response to this that - " America is [ slipping back into ] Cold War thinking . "
Mr Bush : Yeah .
Well , you know , they 're ...
I think that 's just a brush back pitch , as we say in baseball .
It 's ...
America is trapped in this notion that we care about human life .
We respect human dignity .
And that 's not a trap .
That 's a belief .
And that many of [ us ] in this country recognise that the human condition matters to our own national security .
See , I happen to believe we 're in an ideological struggle .
And , those who murder the innocent to achieve political objectives are evil people .
But , they have an ideology .
And the only way you can recruit for that ideology is to find hopeless folks .
I mean , who wants to join an ideology say women do n't have rights ?
You can't express yourself freely .
Religious beliefs are ... you know , the only religious belief you can hold is the one we tell you .
And , oh , by the way , it 's great .
You can be a suicider .
Well , hopeless people are the ones who get attracted by that point of view .
And , therefore , it's in the world 's interest from a national security perspective to deal with hopelessness .
And it has to be in our moral interest .
I repeat to you ...
I believe to whom much is given , much is required .
It happens to be a religious notion .
But , it should be a universal notion as well .
And ... I believe America 's soul is enriched , our spirit is enhanced when we help people who suffer .
Frei :
I mention the genocide thing also because your predecessor , President Clinton , says that the one thing - one of the key things that keeps him up at night is that he did n't do enough over at Rwanda to stop the killing there .
Is it possible that Darfur might become your Rwanda ?
Mr Bush : I do n't think so .
I certainly hope not .
I mean , Rwanda was , you know , I think 900,000 people in a very quick period of time of just wholesale slaughter .
And I , you know , I appreciate President Clinton 's compassion and concern .
And , you know , I 'm comfortable with making ' a decision that I think is the best decision .
And comfortable with the notion that once that decision is made we 're keeping the world 's focus as best as we can on that amongst other issues .
Frei : ... [ Zimbabwe is an issue ] that certainly Britain and the United States care deeply about .
Again , this has been going on for years .
What can be done to stop the crisis in Zimbabwe ?
Mr Bush : Yeah ... it's to speak to the conscience of the world and remind people of the facts ...
I mean , Zimbabwe was the breadbasket of southern Africa .
Today , it 's in line for food aid .
Zimbabwe was - is now a place where people are repressed ' cause of their beliefs .
And you 're right .
There is not a lot of outcry ....
Look , not everything is perfect in this world .
And it just requires constant focus .
And one way to do it is for the American president to speak out or ... the British prime minister to speak out .
As you know , I mentioned South Africa .
I have great respect for the people of South Africa .
I just happen to believe their government could do more - to enhance - you know , a free society in their region .
And yeah , there 's a lot of frustrations in this world .
And there 's a lot of hope in this world as well .
Frei :
You 're nearing the end of your second term .
And , I guess , what you call this legacy time .
Now , whatever you do and say about Africa , there 's only one country , really , that the wider world will associate with you .
And that equation is Bush equals Iraq .
Mr Bush : Yeah ... yeah .
Frei :
Are you happy about that ?
Mr Bush :
Well , I mean ... that 's what the current , you know , elite would like everybody to think about .
And that 's ... fine .
I think ... when history marches on , there will be a little more objective look about the totality of this administration .
Of course ... the change in the way we ... to date in Africa is substantial and different , and lives will have been saved .
You know , dealing with liberating 25 million in Afghanistan is part of what I hope people think of when they look at my presidency .
Being the first president to propose a two - state solution on Israel and Palestine .
I mean , there 's a lot of other issues .
And I 'm happy with Iraq .
The ... decision to move Saddam Hussein was right .
And this democracy is now taking root .
And I 'm confident that if America does not become isolationist - you know , and allow the terrorists to take back over - Iraq will succeed .
Frei :
But , do you regret , rather , I should say that you did n't listen to your - some of your commanders earlier , to send more troops to Iraq to achieve the kind of results that we 're seeing now ?
Mr Bush :
You know , my commanders did n't tell me that early .
My commanders said , " We got the right level of troops . "
You know , war is - you know , it 's easy to second get [ sic ] ... the tactical decisions of war .
And I fully understand .
And expect that to happen .
All I can do is base decisions on the considered judgment of the experts .
And I did .
And - I take full responsibility for every military decision that 's been made in Iraq .
But , I 'm pleased with what 's happening now .
And the world is beginning to recognise that the decision to send more troops was a pretty tough decision at the time .
It 's providing enough security for the politics to take place .
This morning - you 're the first reporter that I 've been able to describe these conversations to .
But , I did speak to the prime minister , the speaker and two deputy speakers to congratulate them on a series of substantial legislative achievements - that are beginning to say to the world , and more importantly the Iraqi people , reconciliation is happening and the legislative body is beginning to function , which is good news .
Frei : The Senate yesterday passed a bill outlawing water - boarding .
You , I believe , have said that you will veto that bill .
Mr Bush :
That 's not -
Frei :
Does that not send the wrong signal ...
Mr Bush : No , look ... that 's not the reason I 'm vetoing the bill .
The reason I 'm vetoing the bill - first of all , we have said that whatever we do ... will be legal .
Secondly , they are imposing a set of standards on our intelligence communities in terms of interrogating prisoners that our people will think will be ineffective .
And , you know , to the critics , I ask them this : when we , within the law , interrogate and get information that protects ourselves and possibly others in other nations to prevent attacks , which attack would they have hoped that we would n't have prevented ?
And so , the United States will act within the law .
We 'll make sure professionals have the tools necessary to do their job within the law .
Now , I recognise some say that these - terrorists - really are n't that big a threat to the United States anymore .
I fully disagree .
And I think the president must give his professionals within the law the necessary tools to protect us .
So , we 're not having a debate not only how you interrogate people .
We 're having a debate in America on whether or not we ought to be listening ' to terrorists making ' phone calls in the United States .
And the answer is darn right we ought to be .
Frei : But , given Guantanamo Bay , given also Abu Ghraib , given renditions , does this not send the wrong signal to the world ?
Mr Bush :
It should send a signal that America is going to respect law .
But , it 's gonna take actions necessary to protect ourselves and find information that may protect others .
Unless , of course , people say , " Well , there 's no threat .
They 're just making up the threat .
These people are n't problematic . "
But , I do n't see how you can say that in Great Britain after people came and , you know , blew up bombs in subways .
I suspect the families of those victims are - understand the nature of killers .
And , so , what people gotta understand is that we 'll make decisions based upon law .
We 're a nation of law .
Take Guantanamo .
Look , I 'd like it to be empty .
On the other hand , there 's some people there that need to be tried .
And there will be a trial .
And they 'll have their day in court .
Unlike what they did to other people .
Now , there 's great concern about , you know , and I can understand this .
That these people be given rights .
The - what - they 're not willing ' to grant the same rights to others .
They 'll murder .
But , you gotta understand , they 're getting rights .
And I 'm comfortable with the decisions we 've made .
And I 'm comfortable with recognising this is still a dangerous world .
Frei :
Can you honestly say , Mr President , that today America still occupies the moral high ground ?
Mr Bush : Absolutely - absolutely .
We believe in human rights and human dignity .
We believe in the human condition .
We believe in freedom .
And we 're willing to take the lead .
We 're willing to ask nations to do hard things .
We 're willing to accept responsibilities .
And - yeah , no question in my mind .
It 's a nation that 's a force for good .
And history will judge - the decisions made during this period of time as necessary decisions .
And I [ firmly ] believe that we are laying the foundation for peace .
People have written off the Middle East .
It 's impossible to change the conditions there .
Let 's just ignore it .
Or let 's promote stability , which was part of the foreign policy of the past .
I chose a different course .
Stability did n't work .
Stability created the conditions that were right for these terrorists to emerge and recruit .
I happen to believe free societies provide hope .
And I would hope that people in Europe , for example , understand that freedom has led to peace , and ought to be supporting the freedom movements and not shy away from the responsibility of the comfortable to help those who long for freedom .
And it 's hard work .
It 's really hard work .
And it does n't happen instantly .
You know , we live in a world like - and all due respect - the 24 hour news .
We live in a world where everything 's , like , instant .
But , the work we 're doing ... it takes patience .
But , most importantly , it takes faith in the universality of freedom that exists in every heart .

Drunkenly dancing on tables or collapsing in the street used to be a source of acute embarrassment for young women the morning after the night before .
Today , they are more likely to boast about it - to the world , with pictures - on social networking sites .

More than 150,000 girls have signed up to Facebook 's online forum " 30 Reasons Girls Should Call It A Night " , where they openly discuss the various states of inebriation - and undress - they have found themselves in .
Among those included in nearly 5,000 images which have been posted on the website is young blonde Jennifer Rentfrow , who was caught kneeling over a toilet after a night out .
Other images show friends Claire Munday and Zoe Bates sleeping on a dancefloor , while Ashley Spellmeyer is shown sleeping in the bath .
Other young women can be seen being sick on themselves , falling into bushes , answering a call of nature in public or inadvertently exposing themselves .
The site is named after 30 tell - tale signs that it is time to go home .

These include having no idea where your friends are , slurring your words so badly no one can understand what you are saying , having make - up " smeared all over your face " and passing out .
A topic group on the website entitled " Funniest / Stupidest s*** you did while drunk " allows members to post details of their binge - drinking antics .
Katie O'Connor , from Manchester , wrote : " A few days ago on a birthday night out I was absolutely ratted - and upon entering an 80's club , offered to flash the DJ my left b*** if he 'd play ' Never gonna give you up ' . "
Lindsay Gordon , a student at Canterbury Christ Church University , wrote : " Pole dancing on lamp posts is always a good laugh . "
A recent Government - commissioned study found one in five 15 - year - olds now drinks the equivalent of almost a bottle of wine a week .

Figures from the Office for National Statistics last month revealed twice as many young women are dying from alcohol abuse as 15 years ago .
An increasing number of young people are now being diagnosed with life - threatening conditions such as cirrhosis of the liver .
Experts fear the toll will continue to rise following Labour 's introduction of round - the - clock drinking .
Alcohol Concern yesterday warned the Facebook site was " symptomatic of the culture of acceptability around drunkenness " .

Spokesman Frank Soodeen added : " There are the obvious mishaps young people get into but this does n't act as a disincentive because it provides excellent material for anecdotes .
" People are perfectly happy to post these sorts of pictures because they recognise that alcohol - related embarrassment will actually improve their social standing . "

Washington is fundamentally broken .
It cannot deliver what the public demands : health care coverage for all , energy independence , good schools .
And we ’re not going to change Washington by handing more power to the same - old people already there .
Hillary Clinton says she has experience , but that ’s not what the voters want .
They want someone who can bring real change to the nation ’s capital .
Is that Barack Obama campaigning in New Hampshire ?
No , it ’s Mitt Romney .
At an “ Ask Mitt Anything ” meeting on Saturday morning in Derry , Romney was channeling the Democratic victor in Iowa .
After finishing second in Iowa , where he had invested so much political and actual capital , Romney , good businessman that he is , took stock of the results and saw that the political market is demanding not experience but change .
So he has recalibrated his sales campaign .
“ The message I read into ” the Iowa results , he told the assembled in Derry , is that Hillary Clinton and John McCain were “ handily rejected by people with messages of change . ”
In that category he included Mike Huckabee , the GOP winner of Iowa , Obama , the Democratic winner , and …himself .
Though Romney had finished 9 points behind Huckabee , he was claiming he had not been spurned by the voters and was a fellow rider of that change wave .
This is rather imaginative bookkeeping .
But you ca n’t blame a CEO for trying .
And Romney appears to be in a tight ( and bitter ) race with McCain in New Hampshire .
So he ’s attempting to hijack the Obama magic and discredit McCain as just another do - nothing Washingtonian .
At the Derry event , Romney stood near a giant sign proclaiming “ Washington Is Broken ” and unveiled a to - do list for the U.S. government .
It included almost every idea that any candidate has proposed during this campaign : protect America , end illegal immigration , reduce taxes , cut pork , provide health insurance for everyone , end dependence on foreign oil , grow the economy , fix Social Security , put people ahead of “ selfish interest . ”
He was covering all the bases .
And he discussed each as if he were conducting a PowerPoint presentation .
Romney also noted that much of this would not be possible unless “ we get the lobbyists off the shoulders ” of the legislators .
With this remark , not only was he swiping Obama ’s message , he was also shoplifting McCain ’s and John Edwards ’ .
Talk about a hostile takeover .
What was the difference , then , between him and Obama ?
It ’s not the Iraq war — though he supports it , and Obama has called for ending it .
Romney hardly referred to the war at all .
He devoted much more time to praising his record in the private sector ( and he had brought the founding CEO of Staples along to attest to Romney ’s business acumen ) .
Romney argued that Obama has “ never done it ” — when it comes to “ change ” — and that he ( Romney ) has , as both a venture capitalist and as a governor .
If you want a true agent of change , Romney was saying , I ’m your executive .
The crowd at the event — respectable but not overwhelming in size — was somewhat enthusiastic about the fellow who used to be governor next door in Massachusetts .
But Romney came across as only a so - so candidate .
When a woman in the audience mentioned that her brother had suffered a serious injury playing rugby and asked about stem cell research , Romney said nothing to acknowledge her family ’s tragedy .
He launched into a canned response about relying on adult stem cells for medical research .
This reply caused one of his fans in the conservative media to cringe .
When it comes to presenting a Washington - stinks / we - need - change message , Romney can get away with intellectual property theft .
But he does not inspire or arouse as Obama does .
He can alter the packaging , not the product .
A few miles down the road , Mike Huckabee appeared before a jam - packed auditorium of several hundred people at the Londonderry Middle School .
Supposedly , he ’s not in the hunt in New Hampshire , due to the state ’s lack of evangelicals .
But his supporters expressed far more enthusiasm than Romney’s .
And his backers are a curious lot .
I found people in the room who said they had voted for Howard Dean in 2004 and now we ’re hot for Huckabee .
Some said they were deciding between Huckabee and Obama .
Several were died - in - the - wool social conservatives who explained they were supporting Huckabee because of “ faith . ”
Given that he ’s not part of the death - cage - match transpiring between Romney and McCain — who each desperately need a win in the Granite State and sit atop the polls here —
Huckabee was free to mount a rather unusual event , which was first organized as a fundraiser for local charities .
After a high school band played R&Bish jazz tunes , Huckabee delivered a short speech , full of one - liners , about the “ greatness ” of America : that is , neighbors helping neighbors .
Millions of Americans go to bed each night hungry , he said .
These people should be assisted by their fellow citizens .
And if Americans would meet this challenge , then there would be no need for government intervention .
He went on about the wonders of the Declaration of Independence and New Hampshire ’s “ Live Free or Die ” motto .
It was a sermon .
He said nothing about his campaign , nothing about his win in Iowa , nothing about the election to come in New Hampshire .
He asked no one to vote for him or to help his campaign .
Then actor Chuck Norris , his No. 1 celebrity backer , spoke for about as long as Huckabee had .
Unlike Huckabee , Norris discussed the Iraq
War at length , though mostly he described his own trips to Iraq to visit with soldiers .
“ They tell me we ’re going to win this war , ” Norris said , prompting applause .
Then Huckabee and Norris donated a box of soccer balls to a local group that sends supplies to U.S. soldiers in Iraq .
( The soccer balls will be handed out by American soldiers to Iraqi kids to earn good will for the Americans . )
Huckabee next told a long story about an Arkansas school teacher who once removed all the desks from her classroom .
She asked her students what they had to do to earn their desks .
Get good grades ?
the students said .
No , the teacher replied .
Behave well ?
No — and there would be no desks until they came up with the right answer .
Well , her students sat on the floor for the entire day .
And shortly before school was to let out — and by now television news camera crews were on site — she opened the door to the classroom and in walked 27 veterans , each carrying a desk .
The teacher told her students , you do n’t have to earn your desk because these guys already have earned that desk for you .
The folks in front of Huckabee hung on each word as he recounted this tale .
Afterward , he and Norris unfurled a long banner thanking two older veterans who were in the room .
The crowd applauded loudly .
No policy , no politics .
Huckabee had served up faith , family , and patriotism .
Would this win over the undecided voters in the room ?
There was no way of knowing .
But he sure went over well .
After the event finished , I heard several people saying how “ nice ” Huckabee seemed .
And he looked rather friendly in that red sweater .
Back to the mudwrestle .
An hour ’s drive away , in Peterborough , McCain was holding a town hall meeting , where he again cited his experience on national security matters and claimed progress was under way in Iraq .
After working a crowd covered with red , white and blue confetti , McCain took questions from reporters ( which Romney and Huckabee would not ) , and I asked him what he thought about Romney comparing him to Hillary Clinton .
“ I ca n’t respond to that , ” he said .
But McCain also tried to wave the change flag .
“ I ’m responsible for the biggest change that has saved American lives , ” he said , referring to his criticism of the Bush administration ’s handling of the Iraq war .
In McCain ’s view , his criticism led to the surge , and the surge is succeeding and saving the lives of U.S. soldiers .
“ I ’m an agent of change , ” he declared .
That ’s what they all are saying these days : Clinton , Romney , McCain .
Obama - ism is catching on .
But that ’s probably better news for the source than for the copycats .
New Hampshire primary foreshadows protracted contest for US presidential nominations
By Patrick Martin
9 January 2008
The results of Tuesday ’s New Hampshire primary suggest there will be no quick resolution to the contest for the presidential nomination in either the Democratic or Republican parties .
The narrow victory by Senator Hillary Clinton over Senator Barack Obama , by a margin of 39 to 36 percent , appears to make the Democratic contest a two - candidate race .
Both Obama , who won the Iowa caucuses last Thursday , and Clinton have huge campaign war chests that will take them through February 5 , when 20 states hold primary votes .
The result upended the pre-election polls , which had predicted a comfortable Obama victory by a margin of at least 10 percentage points .
Former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina trailed with 17 percent , New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson received 5 percent , and Congressman Dennis Kucinich 2 percent .
The primary victory by Senator John McCain of Arizona leaves a splintered Republican field .
McCain defeated former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney by 37 to 32 percent .
Romney , by far the best - financed Republican candidate , was the runner - up for the second consecutive contest .
He also won poorly attended Republican caucuses in Wyoming .
The winner of the January 3 Iowa caucuses , former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee , finished well back in third place , with 11 percent .
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani , once the frontrunner in national polls among Republicans , finished a poor fourth with 9 percent , while Congressman Ron Paul received 8 percent .
Former Senator Fred Thompson trailed with only 1 percent .
According to exit polls Tuesday , McCain owed his victory largely to voters who were registered independents .
Registered Republicans split their votes nearly evenly between McCain and Romney .
The defeat was a serious blow to the viability of the Romney campaign , whose strategy was based on winning in Iowa and New Hampshire , the two earliest contests .
The former governor of neighboring Massachusetts had been leading in opinion polls until a few weeks ago .
As he did in Iowa , Romney spent more on television advertising in New Hampshire than all his rivals combined .
Romney ’s focus now is on the January 15 Michigan primary , where his main rival will be McCain , who won the contest in 2000 .
There was little comfort in Tuesday ’s results for any of the other Republican candidates .
Giuliani had been leading in state opinion polls last spring and summer , but he plummeted as McCain rose and ended up virtually conceding the primary .
He spent much of the New Hampshire campaign at events in Florida , whose primary is January 29 .
Huckabee left New Hampshire for South Carolina , where Republicans vote January 19 , hoping that a large turnout of evangelicals and Christian fundamentalists will produce a victory over McCain , likely his closest rival there .
Thompson is expected to pull out of the race if he does as poorly in South Carolina as he has in Iowa and New Hampshire .
This means that at least four Republican candidates — McCain , Romney , Huckabee and Giuliani — are expected to contest the 20 state primaries to be held on February 5 .
The outcome of the Democratic primary suggests that Clinton benefited from a growing concern among working class voters over the state of the US economy .
Clinton was the only candidate to raise the growing danger of recession in Saturday ’s televised debate , and exit polls showed that the economy was the number one issue of those who turned out to vote , whether they cast a Democratic or a Republican ballot .
A staggering 98 percent of those who voted in the Democratic primary said they were “ very ” or “ somewhat ” worried about the economy .
Clinton ran ahead of Obama in the working class industrial city of Manchester , New Hampshire ’s largest , and there were significant class and economic distinctions between their voters .
Clinton led Obama by sizeable margins among those with family incomes less than $ 100,000 a year , among union members , among those without college degrees , among those who felt that the state of the US economy is poor , and among those with children in the home .
Her largest margin was among single working women .
Perhaps the most striking distinction between Clinton and Obama voters concerned feelings about their family ’s economic futures .
Those who said their families were “ getting ahead ” backed Obama by 48 to 31 percent .
Those who said their families were “ falling behind ” — a much larger group — voted for Clinton by 43 to 33 percent .
There was a significant age difference in the nearly evenly divided vote .
Clinton ’s entire margin of victory came among voters aged 65 or over .
Among those aged 18 to 64 , the two candidates were virtually tied .
There were fewer younger voters as a proportion of those voting — 18 percent were under 30 , compared to 22 percent in Iowa .
But the proportion of the elderly was down even more : they comprised 13 percent of the Democratic voters , compared to 22 percent in Iowa .
This in part reflects the difference between a primary , where working - age voters can more easily get to the polls , and a caucus , which involves a greater commitment of time .
The exit polls suggested that voters did not make much of a distinction among the principal Democratic candidates on the issue of the war in Iraq .
Despite Obama ’s frequent claims of early opposition to the war , voters who favored the quickest possible withdrawal of US forces in Iraq backed Clinton by 41 to 34 percent .
In her victory speech , Clinton reiterated the economic appeal adopted by her campaign in the last several days .
She referred to meeting “ people who ’ve lost their homes to foreclosures , people who work but ca n’t pay their bills , young people who ca n’t afford to go to college . ”
Embracing a populist appeal she had avoided in Iowa , Clinton went on to declare , “ The oil companies , the drug companies , the health insurance companies , the predatory student loan companies have had for seven years a president who stands up for them .
It ’s time you had a president who stands up for you . ”
In demagogic fashion , she pledged , “ There will be no more invisible Americans , ” adding that she advocated , “ Government of the people , for the people , by the people , not just for the privileged few . ”
The effectiveness of such appeals as an electoral tactic does not obviate the fact that this kind of rhetoric is completely bogus and cynical .
Clinton , like all of her fellow Democratic and Republican candidates , is a representative of the class of millionaires and multi-millionaires who dominate US political and social life .
The Democratic Party has been for many decades the favored instrument of the ruling elite in times of widespread economic distress , employing populist demagogy to one degree or another to focus public anger on particular companies or industries , diverting the working class from any broader struggle against the profit system as a whole .
It is notable in the 2008 campaign that Obama , while constantly invoking the theme of “ change , ” has largely downplayed the economic populism embraced by Edwards in Iowa and now taken up by Clinton in New Hampshire .
In his concession speech Tuesday night , in a typically vague formulation , he declared , “ We ’re ready to take this country in a fundamentally new direction , ” without ever specifying what that direction was .
He said little about the economic issues that are increasingly overshadowing the presidential campaign .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
When a large group of eminent U.S. foreign policy experts was asked this summer to name the country most likely to transfer nuclear technology to terrorists in the next three to five years , Pakistan was the top choice .
A whopping 74 percent of the experts , from across the political spectrum , opted for Pakistan .
Iran came a distant fourth .
Asked which country they thought most likely to become al Qaeda ’s next stronghold , the experts also put Pakistan at the top of their list .
Iran rated no mention .
Pakistan ’s nuclear arsenal is estimated at between 30 and 80 bombs and missiles .
Osama bin Laden is thought to hide out in Pakistan ’s northwestern mountains , a base of operations for the Taliban and al Qaeda .
“ A Perfect Nightmare , ” said the headline in Foreign Policy magazine which had teamed up with the Center for American Progress , a Washington think tank , to survey 108 foreign policy professionals , including two former secretaries of state and a national security adviser , on threats to the United States .
That nightmare may become reality .
Pakistan looks dangerously unstable after President Pervez Musharraf imposed emergency rule and jailed hundreds of judges , lawyers , human rights activists , and pro-democracy politicians .
Protests continue despite the harsh measures .
What next ?
Washington has limited options , despite the $ 11 billion in U.S. aid Pakistan has received since it became an ally in the U.S. “ war on terror ” after the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington .
While President George W. Bush said Musharraf should hold elections , he also praised him as “ a strong fighter against extremists and radicals , ” a remark that signalled aid would continue .
So much for Washington ’s declared aim of spreading democracy around the world .
PERVERSE PRIORITIES
What is happening in Pakistan not only shows the limits of U.S. influence , it also highlights foreign policy priorities whose logic at times seems perverse .
Take Pakistan ’s next - door neighbour , Iran .
Much more than Pakistan , Iran has been an object of concern , the subject of heated public debate , and lately a major issue in the U.S. presidential race .
That followed months of increasingly strident rhetoric from the Bush administration portraying Iran as a huge threat to the United States and to Europe that needed to be dealt with now .
Eerily reminiscent of the arguments that preceded the 2003 invasion of Iraq , the refrain was that Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was a latter - day Hitler and must be stopped from acquiring weapons of mass destruction ; i.e. nuclear bombs .
Ahmadinejad is all that remains of the Axis of Evil , Bush ’s catchy 2002 State of the Union label for Iraq , Iran and North Korea , the countries he then identified as sponsors of terrorism and seekers of weapons of mass destruction .
Saddam is dead .
North Korea is off the list because it started dismantling its nuclear programme this week , supervised by a team of U.S. experts , in exchange for economic aid .
No such deal is in sight with Iran , which insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes , scoffs at unilateral economic sanctions imposed on it by the United States , and shows no sign of being intimidated by Washington .
MILITARY STRIKE BACKED
But the stop - Iran - now campaign has made an impact on Bush ’s home audience .
Roughly half the Americans questioned in recent polls would support a military strike against Iran to prevent it from building a nuclear weapon .
The poll results are remarkable , given that the beating of war drums echoes the Bush administration ’s arguments in the run-up to the war in Iraq , where they proved false .
One might have expected reluctance to add a third war to the two the U.S. is already fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq .
There are divided views over how far Iran has progressed in a nuclear programme which began under the late Shah of Iran , a close U.S. ally , with a research reactor provided by the U.S .
Over the years , Iran drew on equipment and expertise from Germany , China and Russia -- as well as the international black market in nuclear weapons material run by A.Q. Khan , the father of Pakistan ’s nuclear bomb .
Khan confessed in 2004 and was promptly pardoned by Musharraf .
Mohammed ElBaradei , the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , says that while there are suspicions over Iran ’s nuclear activities , his agency had no evidence of a weapons programme .
According to ElBaradei , Iran is between three and eight years away from making a nuclear bomb .
“ I want to get people away from the idea that Iran will be a threat from tomorrow and that we are faced right now with the issue of whether Iran should be bombed or allowed to have the bomb , ” he said in an interview published in October .
Worth remembering : ElBaradei , who won the Nobel peace prize two years ago , had it right on Iraq .
The U.S. had it wrong .
" A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant , is unfit to be the ruler of a free people . "

I 've always enjoyed the Fourth of July .
It 's summer , it 's a festive holiday about celebration -- not mourning or remembrance -- and , as a military Veteran , it has been a time to feel good about whatever miniscule role I 've played in maintaining our country 's strength and freedom .
But I 'm going to skip the barbeques and just go to work today .
I do this because the state of my country under the reign of George W. Bush , Dick Cheney and their entire cabal of crooks and non-patriots , leaves me with a feeling so hollow and barren that I simply cannot use drinking a beer , eating a hot dog or watching fireworks as a soothing balm .
With Bush 's effective pardon of Scooter Libby on Monday , he has once again acted on behalf of the American people with no regard for what the people actually .
Poll after poll has shown that Americans still cling to a belief in equal justice under the law and that letting Libby off the hook on perjury and obstruction of justice charges in the outing of a covert CIA agent is horribly wrong .
But that does n’t stop Bush from doing whatever he damn well pleases to help his cronies and appease his political benefactors .
The overwhelming majority of the country now also knows the truth of the Iraq occupation and made clear in the last election what is expected of our leaders in ending that disaster .
The American people know that the White House cooked the intelligence books to make a bogus case for war against a country that posed no threat whatsoever to the United States and by far most Americans want us out of Iraq as soon as possible .
It is the same thing with the way most of us feel about the promise held in the science of stem cell research and the huge nationwide support for raising the federal minimum wage , which have both been fought tooth and nail by Bush and the Republican party .
No matter how we the people want to be governed or how we decide we want our country to look , Bush sticks stubbornly to whatwants , to whatmandates and whatdecides in his delusional world of absolute power and authority over all he surveys .
It 's a bitter irony that what we celebrate today is deliverance from just such an absolute power and authority in the form of King George III , about whom the Founding Fathers railed in the majority of the Declaration of Independence and from whom they declared our freedom .
We broke away from the colonial rule of a tyrant and , in the preamble to this sacred document , we stated that our leaders are ultimately governed by those for which government is created and that those elected president get " their just powers from the consent of the governed .
"
We declared our break from a monarch , an absolute ruler , in 1776 when the 13 colonies risked it all to repudiate that form of government and to say that the leader of what would become the new United States of America should listen to the will of the people and not the other way around .
One has to wonder what Jefferson , Adams , Franklin , Hancock and the other Founding Fathers would think of where we 're at , 231 years later , if they could see the vision of Democracy they cherished so soiled and the 43rd president known not at all for his wisdom and entirely for his outrageous abuse of power .
George W. Bush has taken our country and made us despised throughout the world , ruined our global reputation in a way that may take a generation to salvage and made us far less safe in a dangerous world .
Indeed , he has used our nation 's wealth and power tothe world a more dangerous place .
His administration has also found a way to diminish a great holiday like our Independence Day , to make us feel less like proudly waving our flag and to even cause many like me , who have worn our country 's uniform , to wonder what the hell it was for .
And , for that , every American who voted for Bush , should take time this July Fourth to perform a truly patriotic act and be profoundly ashamed .

Boehner : Republicans need to make sacrifices
White Sulphur Springs , W. Va. — House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) challenged House Republicans to make a few sacrifices in the next year that will help the GOP sell their agenda to voters in the fall elections .
The Republican leader is scheduled to lead his members in a broad , potentially rancorous debate over lawmaker - requested projects Friday during their annual retreat here .
The reform proposals include a one - year moratorium on earmarks for all Republicans , the creation of a special panel to review the process , including the abuses that have occurred , and a litany of smaller guidelines to curtail wasteful earmarks or member - requested projects that benefit campaign contributors or other private entities .
“ We 're here today to ask ourselves : Are Republicans the party that can fix Washington ? "
Boehner asked his members Friday morning , according to excerpts of his speech .
" If so , what sacrifices are we willing to make to PROVE we are that party ?
We cannot do this without being bold and putting forth fresh solutions . ”
For more excerpts , click on the link below .
“ The American people believe Washington is broken .
Middle class families see the cost of living rising .
They see more and more of their hard earned dollars being eaten up by college costs , health care costs , housing costs , food costs . ”
“ With all this happening in their daily lives , they 're watching the news — and they see politicians in Washington WASTING their money .
While families are struggling to make ends meet , they look up and see politicians using taxpayer money to build monuments to themselves ... funding hippie museums ... letting entitlement spending spiral out of control . ”
“ Our mission is simple , if we choose to accept it : show the American people we 're different .
Americans believe Washington is broken .
They 're right .
We need to show them we 're ready to fix it .
The mission is simple — but that does n't mean the mission is EASY . ”
“ We 're here today to ask ourselves : Are Republicans the party that can fix Washington ?
If so , what sacrifices are we willing to make to PROVE we are that party ?
We cannot do this without being bold and putting forth fresh solutions . ”
“ In 1994 we made sacrifices .
We gave up perks .
We gave up privileges .
We took risks .
We thought big .
We rolled dice .
We need to go through this process today and tomorrow with the same mentality . "
“ If we woke up suddenly tomorrow and found ourselves in the majority , would we be any different ?
How would we be different from the Republicans of the past AND the Democrats of the present ?
If we can't answer these questions for Americans over the course of the next year , we will stay in the minority . ”
“ If we 're going to pick up seats in 2008 , we have to strike a chord in the hearts of the American people — our base , and Republican - leaning independents alike .
We cannot win by singing the same old tune .
Washington is broken .
We need to give the American people reasons to believe we 'll fix it . ”
“ We 're not starting from scratch .
We had a good year last year .
In 2006 we warned the American people a Democratic Congress would be like this : a majority devoted to higher taxes , bigger government , and retreat .
In 2007 we gave the American people reasons to believe we were right .
We showed that the Democrats are exactly who we thought they 'd be .
This is something we can build on .
Our challenge in 2008 is to give Americans reasons to believe we 'll be different . ”
“ Our goal is to walk out of here Saturday with a sense of unity on the BIG reforms we 're going to drive together in 2008 ... our common agenda ... our " reasons to believe . "
We need an agenda worthy of us — an agenda that takes the best of what we have to offer , and pushes it forward .
We need an agenda that gives Americans reasons to believe Republicans will fix Washington .
We need an agenda that gives Americans a reason to believe we 're different from the Republicans of the past , and the Democrats of the present .
It all starts here ... now . ”
Under the civil contempt resolution , Conyers is “ authorized to initiate or intervene in judicial proceedings ” against Bolten and Miers .
House readies for key contempt vote
After more than six months of delay , the House will vote Thursday to authorize criminal and civil contempt proceedings against White House chief of staff Josh Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers for failing to comply with Judiciary Committee subpoenas .
The House vote could set up a constitutional showdown between Congress and the White House over the limits of executive privilege — particularly on the question of whether President Bush or any president can prevent senior aides from testifying before congressional committees .

The House Rules Committee approved separate resolutions Wednesday afternoon approving criminal as well as civil contempt proceedings against Bolten and Miers for failing to comply with the subpoenas , which were issued by the Judiciary Committee as part of its investigation into the 2006 firings of nine U.S. attorneys .
Bush , citing executive privilege , refused to allow Bolten and Miers to testify or turn over internal White House documents related to the firings .
Bolten and former White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove also declined to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to subpoenas issued in its own probe of the firings .
Under the civil contempt resolution , Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . ) is “ authorized to initiate or intervene in judicial proceedings ” against Bolten and Miers .
The House General Counsel ’s office is ordered to represent the House in any legal action , and Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) is directed to “ consult ” with the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group in the issue .
That group , comprising top Democrats and Republicans , handles legal issues affecting the integrity and privileges of the House .
It is unclear how a criminal case against Bolten and Miers , even if authorized by the House , would move forward .
The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia would normally handle such a case , but Justice Department representatives , including Attorney General Michael Mukasey , have said that the U.S. attorney is not authorized to bring a criminal contempt case against an administration official in a situation involving an executive privilege claim .
White House counsel Fred Fielding has offered to allow senior Bush administration aides to testify behind closed doors , but with no transcript kept and no possibility that these staffers could be subpoenaed again .
Both the House and Senate Judiciary committees rejected that offer as inadequate .
“ The American people will find it baffling that on a day that House leaders are trying to put off passing critical legislation to keep us safer from the threat of foreign terrorists overseas , they are spending scarce time to become the first Congress in history to bring contempt charges against a president ’s chief of staff and lawyer , ” White House spokeswoman Dana Perino wrote in an e-mail .
“ If the House had nothing better to do , this futile partisan act would be a waste of time , ” she said .
“ Unbelievably , it is being considered in place of legislation to make us safer , address concerns in the housing market , improve health care conditions for our veterans , reauthorize No Child Left Behind or open new overseas markets for U.S. goods and services , among other bills .
The ' people ’s House ' should reflect the priorities of the American people , not the fantasies of left - wing bloggers . ”
Although the House Judiciary Committee approved its contempt resolutions more than six months ago , Pelosi and other Democratic leaders have repeatedly postponed a floor vote until now , citing a variety of reasons for doing so .
Some top Democrats , including Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel , do n’t want the House to press the issue , fearing that Congress ’ authority could be eroded if the courts support Bush ’s position .
Other Democrats , including some conservative Blue Dogs , fear that seeking this legal fight is needlessly inflammatory , especially since former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales — on whose watch the firing occurred — has left office .
But Pelosi said Wednesday that the Democratic leadership must preserve the right of Congress to investigate the White House and insist that congressional subpoenas be honored .
“ [ Conyers ] has tried over and over again , I think 13 times , to find some kind of accommodation , ” Pelosi said .
“ We have to move forward . ”
Conyers told the Rules Committee that he moved forward with the contempt resolution “ with great reluctance . ”
“ Unfortunately , it is a step that is clearly necessary to preserve the role and constitutional prerogatives of Congress as an institution , in addition to getting to the bottom of the U.S. attorney controversy , ” Conyers said .
“ If the executive branch can disregard congressional subpoenas in this way , we no longer have a system of checks and balances .
That is the cornerstone of our democracy , and it is our bipartisan responsibility to protect it . ”

New $ 15 utility from Ambrosia Software , lets you add ringtones to your iPhone via a simple drag - and - drop application .
It ’s that easy — no other hacking required .
I wonder , though , whether Apple plans to add custom ringtone support to iTunes in a near - future update .
I love the credit in the footer : “ Site concept and CSS by SimpleBits.com ” .
True , if by “ by ” he means “ ripped off from ” .
It ’s The New York Post , so take it with an appropriate grain of salt .
If true , though , it ’s great news for Ambrosia — why pay a buck ( or whatever ) for each ringtone when you can spend $ 15 and convert any non-DRM - protected song you already own into one ?
This whole “ ringtones are something different than songs and you have to pay for them ” thing is a racket , and everyone knows it .

Apple today announced that it will not be selling NBC television shows for the upcoming television season on its online iTunes Store .
The move follows NBC ’s decision to not renew its agreement with iTunes after Apple declined to pay more than double the wholesale price for each NBC TV episode , which would have resulted in the retail price to consumers increasing to $ 4.99 per episode from the current $ 1.99 .
ABC , CBS , FOX and The CW , along with more than 50 cable networks , are signed up to sell TV shows from their upcoming season on iTunes at $ 1.99 per episode .
So NBC and Apple could n’t agree to terms to sell NBC TV shows for the upcoming fall season .
Apple issued a point - blank press release explaining why :

Craig Hockenberry explains the fundamentals of iPhone - optimized web development in this week ’s issue of A List Apart .
There ’s plenty about markup and CSS , but the heart of the book consists of general design strategies for mobile platforms — and why you should care in the first place about the experience mobile users get when visiting your site .
New from Cameron Moll : Mobile Web Design , a $ 19 PDF e- book regarding the mobile web and using web standards to develop for it .
I read it last week and can recommend it wholeheartedly .
Well - researched , well - written , and filled with real - world examples and very practical advice .
Guy serves five months in prison for uploading a copy of Revenge of the Sith to a torrent site ; as a condition of his parole , he ’s required to install monitoring software on his computer .
He can choose whatever OS he wants as long as it ’s Windows , since that ’s the only OS the monitoring software works on .
How ’s this for a sign of the iPod ’s continuing market dominance ?
A contest for second place .
Business aspects aside , the main issue I see as a traditional developer is that iPhone web app development is still very limited .
Outside of some viewport settings , a couple special link types ( really only the “ tel : ” link is new ) , and some new “ - webkit ” style attributes , there is little about making iPhone - specific web apps that differs from generic web apps .
And that ’s possibly the most disappointing aspect of all from my standpoint .
Apple ’s announcement states that “ developers can create Web 2.0 applications which look and behave just like the applications built into iPhone ” , but that ’s not the case .
I still say the most telling thing about the man is that Bush ’s nickname for him is “ Fredo ” .

i Movie ’08 is perhaps the most polarizing product Apple has released in years .
Mathematicians do n’t answer questions by working them out on paper the way schoolchildren are taught to .

The iPhoneSIMfree.com team called us up to prove their claim that they cracked Apple ’s iPhone SIM lock system , and prove it they did .
( No , we do n’t have a copy of the unlock software , so do n’t even ask us , ok ? )
The six - man team has been working non -stop since launch day , and they ’re officially the first to break Apple ’s SIM locks on the iPhone with software .
It ’s done .
Seriously .
They would n’t tell us when and how they would release it to the public , but you can certainly bet that they ’ll try to make a buck on their solution ( and rightly so ) .
It ’s high noon , Apple and AT&T — we really hate to break it to you , but the jig is up .
Last night the impossible was made possible : right in front of our very eyes we witnessed a full SIM unlock of our iPhone with a small piece of software .
It ’s all over , guys .
I like Jonathan Schwartz a lot , but I think that unless some drastic changes are made to Java , the move to JAVA as Sun ’s ticker symbol is going to be as relevant as changing it to COBOL .

Apparently they could n’t find a four - character symbol that stood for “ shuffling the deck chairs on the Titanic ” .
( SDCT ? )
It ’s just the stock symbol , but it strikes me as so wrong , almost defeatist , to make any sort of branding statement that suggests that you believe one of your products is bigger than the company itself .
It ’d be like if Apple had changed its symbol to “ MAC ” or “ IPOD ” .
Foolish .

Obviously , anything that requires soldering is only going to appeal to a minuscule niche , so this is n’t really huge news .
But there ’s something admirable about a kid willing to put that amount of time into an obsessive project like this .

Engadget to Palm :
Here ’s a long list of the many ways you suck and have completely squandered your lead in the mobile market .
“ We ’ve learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make a decent phone , ” he said .
“ PC guys are not going to just figure this out .
They ’re not going to just walk in . ”
Colligan laughed off the idea that any company — including the wildly popular Apple Computer — could easily win customers in the finicky smart - phone sector .
Speaking of Palm CEO Ed Colligan , now ’s a good time to recall his comments from last November , regarding the prospects of Apple ’s then - only - rumored entry into the mobile phone market :

The bad news is that the high - def versions are not available together in boxed sets — you ’ve got to order each film individually .
$ 20 each , though , so it ’s hard to complain .
The only reason for anyone not to pre-order the new DVD boxed set of Kubrick films is if you ’re waiting for high - def versions .
The good news is that all five movies — 2001 , A Clockwork Orange , The Shining , Full Metal Jacket , and Eyes Wide Shut — are going to be released simultaneously in both Blu-ray and HD - DVD formats .
( Those are both make - me - rich links to Amazon . )
Bruno Fernandes goes long on the differences between Mac OS X and Windows anti-aliasing , and why George Ou is a jackass .
Update : A joint Coudal Partners / Daring Fireball investigative committee has raised some troubling questions regarding the packaging of these discs .

And worse , what the fuck is up with the type treatment on the A Clockwork Orange sleeve ?
Digitally remastered and presented in their original theatrical release aspect ratios .
Includes : 2001 : A Space Odyssey , A Clockwork Orange , The Shining , Full Metal Jacket , and Eyes Wide Shut .
Each comes with new commentary tracks .
Hot diggity damn .
Hard to tell from the marketing blurb whether these are new film - to - video transfers or just “ remasterings ” of the existing transfers .
I hope they ’re new transfers ; I fear they are n’t .
They might as well have just gone ahead and pantsed them while they were at it .
The pixelated heads in the orgy scene in the R-rated American release are just embarrassing — I do n’t know why they ’re even including that version on the disc .

For one thing , Apple has not decided to “ close iPhone to 3rd- party applications ” .
The iPhone is closed now ; Apple has announced nothing regarding whether they intend to keep it so .
As for developer enthusiasm , I see more development going on for the officially closed iPhone than for any Linux mobile phone platform I ’m aware of .
I ’m not exactly looking for Linux mobile apps , of course , but still , it seems 180 degrees wrong to say that the iPhone is pushing developers to mobile Linux .
Linux developers have been dying for a phone of their own ever since Sharp killed the Zaurus Linux - based PDA .
Apple ’s decision to close iPhone to 3rd - party applications gave the green light to Linux phones and mobile devices .
LinuxWorld Expo 2007 basked in Apple ’s unwitting generosity , with one booth after another featuring fledgling mobile Linux projects prospecting for funding , direction , and developers .

“ God , yes , ” says Tony .
“ Sometimes late into the night .
I was always trying to persuade him to turn away from them .

“ Is this the kind of thing you and Kubrick used to discuss ? ” I ask .
“ It ’s Futura Extra Bold , ” explains Tony .
“ It was Stanley ’s favourite typeface .
It ’s sans serif .
He liked Helvetica and Univers , too .
Clean and elegant . ”

You know , just like with iPods and Macs .
That may be part of it , but it seems likely that a lot of people are just unimpressed with the expensive new phone .
You can now save $ 100 on an iPhone by snapping up a refurbished one on the company ’s website .
So far iPhone sales have fallen well short of expectations , and there are two possible explanations for the refurbished models .
It ’s possible that they were returned by speculators who were hoping to resell them on eBay but were disappointed when Apple had enough stock .

It ’s certainly true that feed subscribers are harder to measure , but , I think this is shortsighted .
Subscribers are readers who , by the act of subscribing to the feed , show themselves to be regular readers .
I think that ’s a valuable audience — and so far , sponsors of the Daring Fireball feed think so too .
But the Times and its advertisers are n’t crazy about this option .
( Nor are they alone , apparently . )
Why ?
This is the fundamental point : many advertisers do not value feed readers as much as they value site readers , since they believe that feed readers are far harder to measure and track .
Actually , it pleased me greatly to read this , given that I ’m thinking about and working through the exact same issues regarding offering full feeds here on DF .
What happened is that the Freakonomics weblog used to offer full feeds , but since starting their partnership with The Times , now only has an excerpt feed .
Regarding why they do n’t just offer a full content feed with ads :

There ’s an enormous difference between “ built - for - IE4 ” and “ built - for - iPhone ” web sites , and Gilbertson himself points it out : the techniques for developing web sites optimized for the iPhone are based on standards .
Optimizing for iPhone is , in a way , an accessibility issue .
In suggesting that developers use the web to build iPhone applications , what Apple has done ( perhaps inadvertently , perhaps not ) is force the creation of a subset of the mobile web that only works with the iPhone ’s unique features — namely the touch - screen interface .
And the more I ’ve been thinking about that argument , the more I realize that it ’s exactly how Microsoft spun the proprietary , non-standard HTML features in IE 4 .

This would have been a great direction to steer the panel discussion .
Today , thanks to the many - to - many communications that are possible in this Web 2.0 world of blogs and social networking , it ’s very easy for schlock marketing — and as such , the products it pushes — to gain an air of legitimacy .
How ?
Easy : Just start a discussion .
By engaging in the debate on a particular subject , both sides in the debate implicitly acknowledge that the subject is worthy of debate ; and when one side of a controversy is the side that might ordinarily live on the fringes , the debate works to the advantage of that side regardless of the outcome .
That ’s because all of a sudden , the fringe side of the debate — the voices and positions that had once rightly been relegated to the periphery — gain mainstream recognition .
Great piece from Rich Siegel , forking off from an early subject in the C4 [ 1 ] panel discussion :

I suspect many would argue about just how easy Microsoft has made it to read and write the new Office XML file formats , but the point holds .
File compatibility leads to competition , and competition leads to better software .
What Apple has done with Keynote , Pages and Numbers is exactly this .
Allowing anyone to read and write your file format is a bold move because it says in essence , “ We do n’t need a locked down file format to compete .
The format can be available for everyone , and we ’ll compete on the ease of use and efficiency of our applications .
We have what we think is the best interface for reading , creating and managing Office documents , but if someone has what they think is a better way to build Office documents , wonderful , we welcome it ! ”

Update :
Here ’s an editor ’s note from The North Denver News claiming the piece was intended as “ satirical social commentary ” .
There was a story going around last week , originating in The North Denver News , that a man had had cosmetic surgery on his fat thumbs to slim them down to better enable using them with his iPhone .
Unsurprisingly , the story was a complete hoax .
“ If a company that is controlling a Webcast is cutting out bits of our performance — not based on laws , but on their own preferences and interpretations — fans have little choice but to watch the censored version , ” Pearl Jam said in a prepared statement .
“ What happened to us this weekend was a wake up call , and it ’s about something much bigger than the censorship of a rock band . ”
The battle for web standards goes mainstream ; BusinessWeek certainly gets it .
Even better , Apple has finally released an official SDK for iPhoto plugins ; up until now , FlickrExport had to rely on undocumented APIs .

New York Times Magazine feature by Joshua Yaffa on the typography and design of highway signage , particular regarding Clearview , the new typeface designed to replace Highway Gothic as the standard for signage in the U.S .
Um , Universal wo n’t sell DRM - free music through iTunes because they do n’t like Apple ’s DRM ?
WTF ?
Am I even supposed to pretend this makes sense ?
But Apple ’s proprietary D.R.M. does not work with most rivals ’ devices or software — meaning that music sold by competing services cannot play on Apple ’s popular iPod .
Some record executives say they believe that the stalemate has capped the growth of digital music sales , which the industry is relying on more heavily as sales of plastic CDs slide .
But the music will not be offered D.R.M. - free through Apple ’s iTunes , the leading music service .
The use of copy protection software has become a major bone of contention in the digital music business , where iTunes accounts for the vast majority of download sales .
The record labels generally have required that retailers place electronic locks to limit copying of music files .
So Universal is going to sell DRM - free music through Amazon , Wal - Mart , RealNetworks , and others , but not through iTunes .
Why ?
This is why Apple does not compete in the enterprise market in the traditional sense .
This is why no other company created the iPhone .
This is why most desktop PCs are pieces of crap .
When you do n’t focus on the user , the user gets shafted .
Still holding that thought about the Intel stickers ?
Listen again to Steve ’s final words on the subject .
“ We put ourselves in the customer ’s shoes and say , what do we want ? ”
“ A really fast dictionary ” , lives up to its slogan in my use .
Definitions and content powered by Wiktionary .
To ask such a question is simply to display one ’s ignorance of Apple and Steve Jobs .
The only stickers that you ’ll find on Apple products are those clear ones that protect them on their magical journey to your doorstep .
Joy of Tech nailed it back in 2005 , when Apple ’s switch to Intel chips was first announced .
That is a good question .
And I would bet a large sum of money that Apple ’s contract with Intel is like no other PC maker ’s contract with Intel .
But that ’s not the question Keefe asked .
To the Apple faithful , sure , it was dumb .
But a PR event is not for the faithful ( that ’s Macworld ) , it ’s for the rest of the world .
And to the world at large , it ’s not a dumb question at all .
Why does Apple get a pass when every other PC manufacturer has those awful logos all over their products ?
More on Stickergate from Derek Powazek , who offers the best defense of Bob Keefe I ’ve seen so far :
My thanks to Griffin Technology — makers of fine iPod and iPhone peripherals , and the industry ’s leading pulsing - blue - light gadgetry — for sponsoring the free RSS feed this week .
And if it were n’t for their wonderful iMate , I would n’t still be able to use my beloved Apple Extended Keyboard II .
The wired keyboard now has up to F19 , and no dedicated volume controls .
Instead , it moves the volume controls to special functions on F10 , F11 and F12 .
You might remember those as two Expose keys and the Dashboard key .
Well , not anymore .
In fact , F9 , the other default Expose key , is now fast - forward / next track .
And the eject key , which is nearly always been the last key in the upper right of the keyboard is next to F12 .
Not on the end in the wired version .
But it gets even stranger .
Garrett Murray on the new default F - key mappings on the new Apple keyboard :
This is funnier than finding out who it actually was .
It ’s bad news , though , for everyone who did like and use the old iMovie .
So unlike all the other iLife apps , iMovie ’08 does n’t replace iMovie ’06 .
If you already have ’06 installed , it ’s still there , and if you do n’t , you can download it from Apple .
i Movie ’08 is n’t just a re-write , it ’s a re-imagining of everything it does , how it works , and who ’s intended to use it .
Me , personally , I think it ’s great news .
iMovie always felt like too much work , so most of my video is sitting around on dozens of tapes , unedited .
iMovie ’08 looks like it ’ll prompt me to digitize everything and make quick movies .
On newsstands now : I wrote the back - page column in the September issue of Macworld .
Look for the one with the iPhone on the cover .
Jobs mentioned at Tuesday ’s event that Apple has 1.7 million .
Mac customers .
But they ’re selling around 1.7 million Macs per quarter now .
Clearly this number could be a lot higher , and most Mac users do n’t see it as worthwhile .
Exactly the sort of guy for whom iMovie ’06 is still available .
Well - considered overview of everything Apple released on Tuesday .
Glad I did n’t write something like this , because Snell covers everything I ’d have wanted to say .
I hereby nominate Dan Moren for a Pulitzer prize .
You must listen to the audio — Jobs really handled the question with aplomb , after taking a few seconds to get his bearings .
The special functions screened onto the F - keys are laid out on both new keyboards to compliment right - handed mouse use .
This is clearly a design that will not be as functional to someone using the pointing device in their left hand , to the left of the keyboard , but it ’s a purposeful and thoughtful change nonetheless .
Not really Netflix ’s fault — they ca n’t force the studios to let them deliver video without DRM , and they ca n’t force Apple to let them use FairPlay — but this still stinks , nonetheless .
( Thanks to Nat Irons . )
A key issue for delivering movies online is that the studios require use of DRM ( Digital Rights Management ) to protect titles .
And that ’s our holdup for the Mac — there ’s not yet a studio - sanctioned , publicly - available Mac DRM solution ( Apple does n’t license theirs ) .
I can promise you that , when an approved solution becomes available for the Mac , we ’ll be there .
I ’ll also say that Silverlight 1.1 looks like a promising candidate — but that its DRM is n’t likely to be fully available until 2008 .
i Photo ’08 uses iTunes 7 - style blue scroll bars .
Alas , its implementation craps out if you ’re using the “ both at both ends ” option .
It works , but it draws visual turds .
iTunes 7 does n’t actually support this option , either — it looks OK but only draws the arrows at the bottom .
( The rest of the iLife ’08 apps use standard Aqua scroll bars . )
The Appearance panel in System Preference has two options for the arrow buttons at the end of scroll bars : putting up at the top and down at the bottom , or putting both of them at the bottom .
But at least since 10.1 , Mac OS X has supported a third option via a defaults setting : putting both arrows at both the top and bottom .
Interesting move by The Times ; they ’re steadily growing their team of online - only writers .
( Yes , the Freakonomics guys write a column for the Times Magazine , but their weblog entries wo n’t appear in the paper . )
Apple has really put a lot of work into the iWork support materials .
Watching these movies is a great way to see what ’s new and how it works .
The new keyboard — a keyboard ! — gets a top - level directory on Apple.com .
Interesting that the Bluetooth version is so drastically different than the corded version .
I ’m just happy they added the word “ command ” .
I ’ve lost track how many times over the years I ’ve been asked , “ What ’s the ‘ Command ’ key ? ”
“ There are too many Apples on the screen !
It ’s ridiculous !
We ’re taking the Apple logo in vain !
We ’ve got to stop doing that ! ”
At one point during development of the original Mac , the Command key symbol was an Apple logo — both on the keyboard and on - screen , for menu key shortcuts .
According to Andy Hertzfeld it was nixed by Steve Jobs in 1983 :
Love that the opening song was The Stones’ “ Satisfaction ” .
Weird watching Jobs in such a small venue , though — sort of like watching a superband like The Stones or U2 play in a bar .

And , now , finally , Numbers : “ the spreadsheet for the rest of us ” .
“ But there ’s some stuff in our industry that we would n’t be proud to ship .
And we just ca n’t do it .
We ca n’t ship junk .
There are thresholds we can’t cross because of who we are . ”
Also , a great quote from Jobs , regarding why Apple does n’t go after low - end market share in the PC market :
Jobs offers a rare chance for a public Q&A and someone asks why they do n’t booger up their computers with horrid stickers ?
Will someone please tell me who asked this question so I can name him jackass of the week ?
“ We like our own stickers better , ” Jobs said .
“ Do n’t get me wrong .
We love working with Intel .
We ’re proud to ship Intel products in Macs .
They ’re screamers , and combined with our OS , we ’ve tuned them well .
It ’s just that everyone knows we use Intel processors .
We ’d rather not tell them about the product that ’s inside the box . ”
One question that came from the audience wondered why Apple does n’t participate in the “ Intel Inside ” program , in which PC manufacturers affix the well - known labels to their computers .
Look at the “ Intelligent Tables ” features .
What Numbers really is is a way for people to create their own table - based software .
Numbers might be as much a new Hypercard as it is a new Excel .
This is a total ground - up re-imagining of what a “ spreadsheet ” app is .
The fundamental element is not the spreadsheet ; it ’s a canvas on which you can place elements , which elements can be tables ( which are spreadsheets ) , charts , and graphics .
As for why Jobs hates it , think about his comments during the event making fun of Dell machines because of the all the cables you need to hook them up to displays and webcams .
That all applies equally to the Mini .
Jobs hates the Mini , so it got neither a mention during the event ( until the Q&A ) nor a press release , but Apple did refresh it today .
1.83 or 2.0 GHz Core 2
Duo processor , still starting at $ 599 .
Update :
The downside for me and my PowerBook — although unsurprising — is that iMovie ’08 requires a G5 or Intel processor ; G4s need not apply .
Totally reasonable .
i Movie ’08 looks like it alone is worth the price of admission to iLife ’08 .
I totally believe Jobs ’s story that it ’s a complete re-write .
The old iMovie was a good app , as a sort of stripped - down consumer - level Final Cut — but it still was n’t any good for just putting clips together in a few minutes .
The new iMovie looks like something that will make dealing with video as easy and quick — or nearly so — as dealing with photos .

It ’s all Greek to me because I ’m still rocking it with a PowerBook G4 , but several friends who ’ve tried both tell me VMware Fusion has it all over Parallels Desktop — VMware ’s “ Unity ” supports truly interleaved Windows and Mac application windows , for example , whereas Parallels ’s “ Coherence ” fakes it by grouping all your Windows windows in a single layer with a transparent background .

It does n’t affect your physical keyboard at all ; it just makes noise when you type .

Why does it make me a better typist on my MacBook ?
It ’s because the noise it makes , though little more than a faintly detectable pop each time I press a key , tells me almost subliminally that I have pressed a key .

It ’ll be interesting to see what happens to the weblog now that Lyons is no longer anonymous .
My hope is that it just keeps going , unchanged .
But did his editors at Forbes know about this ?
Do they care now ?
Mr. Lyons writes and edits technology articles for Forbes and is the author of two works of fiction , most recently a 1998 novel , “ Dog Days . ”
In October , Da Capo Press will publish his satirical novel written in the voice of the Fake Steve character , “ Options : The Secret Life of Steve Jobs , a Parody . ”
“ I ’m stunned that it ’s taken this long , ” said Mr. Lyons , 46 , when a reporter interrupted his vacation in Maine on Sunday to ask him about Fake Steve .
“ I have not been that good at keeping it a secret .
I ’ve been sort of waiting for this call for months . ”
Meanwhile , on the other side of the country , Daniel Lyons , a senior editor at Forbes magazine who lives near Boston , has been quietly enjoying the attention .
Weblog by Daniel Lyons , author of The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs .
Number of times he ’s mentioned “ fake steve ” : zero .

“ Advanced common sense ” approach to creating a simple , manageable system for dealing with large amounts of email .
One of several clever observations , which certainly applies to me , is that those of us who started using email in the early 1990s ( or earlier ) developed habits and conceptions — based on the then - available email clients and very different number of messages received in a typical day — that no longer apply today .

Joe Kissell :
What I do care very much about , though , as someone who uses words for a living , is the language Microsoft chose to use in the press release they sent out announcing this delay .
It is , truly , a delay : a difference of ( depending on how you interpreted “ second half of 2007 ″ ) anywhere from two weeks to six months and two weeks .
And most of the news sites that reported on the delay described it as such .
But Microsoft themselves did not use the word “ delay . ”
They did n’t mention that they ’d previously announced an earlier date .
They did n’t say they were sorry .
Instead , they used standard weaselly marketing language to make it sound like they were announcing a virtual non-event , and perhaps even to subtly suggest that anyone who wanted to think about it differently does n’t care about quality .
Weaselly indeed .
Why do we use the suffix - aholic to make up words implying addiction ( chocoholic , workaholic ) , when the “ ahol ” originates specifically from alcoholic , where the suffix is simply - ic ?
Again , speakers tend to make novel utterances predictable , not necessarily logical .
It ’s correlation , not causation , that produces meaning .

It takes more than a “ moment ” for your computer to write this hibernation file to disk and go to sleep .
The length of time it takes is proportional to the amount of RAM you have installed .
On my new MacBook Pro with 4 GB of RAM , it takes 49 seconds for the computer to sleep when Safe Sleep is active ; with Safe Sleep turned off , it takes only 4 seconds .
That ’s an enormous , and enormously annoying , difference .
Kissell really nails this one .
But it ’s even worse than the annoyance of having to wait nearly a minute for sleep to kick in , and that you lose as much disk space as you have RAM .
My wife ’s MacBook was suffering from a problem where , once or twice a week , the machine would just shut down completely when she put it to sleep .
She ’d close the lid , and a few seconds later , the machine would just turn off or restart .
The solution ?

Dec. 22 , 2007  --
The lawyer for California teen Nataline Sarkisyan charged today that the only reason Cigna Health Care officials changed their minds and approved a liver transplant for the desperate girl was they knew it was too late and they would n't have to pay for it .
Sarkisyan , 17 , died Thursday just hours after Cigna reversed its decision and approved the procedure it had previously described as " too experimental … and unproven . "
Now the Sarkisyan family hopes manslaughter or murder charges will be pressed .
Their lawyer , Mark Geragos , says he will refer the case to prosecutors for possible criminal charges against the insurer , Cigna HealthCare .
" All of the doctors there unanimously agreed that she needed and should have that liver transplant .
And the only entity , if you will , who said no to that in the middle of that medical decision , was some piece of garbage who decided that making a couple of dollars , or saving them a couple of dollars , was worth more than the 65 % chance over six months that she would survive , " said Geragos .
" The only reason they approved it is because we had organized a protest in front of Cigna 's corporate headquarters … and in the face of public pressure , they did it , " he said .
By the time the approval came through Nataline had been on the liver transplant list for two weeks and her condition had deteriorated so badly that it was too late to have the procedure .
" I believe , the corporation knew , powers that be knew , that at that point approving the liver transplant was a ' gimme ' because her condition deteriorated to the point where she could n't receive the liver … she did n't have any chance of either , one , getting a liver or , number two , actually being able to receive it , " he says .
Nataline , who was fighting leukemia , developed liver failure after complications from a bone marrow transplant she received from her brother last month .
Despite her already fragile health , Geragos says , " all of the doctors at the University of California Medical Center unanimously agreed that she needed and should have that liver transplant . "
More than 6,000 liver transplants are performed in the United States every year , making it one of the most common organ transplants , according to the United Network for Organ Sharing .
It confuses some people that I can be an environmentalist and a Republican .
It 's confusing because Democrats are handed a checklist of " coalition of the oppressed " platforms they have to believe in , so they do n't understand picking and choosing positions based on logic and common sense .
Republicans do n't much care if you are for ice - picking fetus skulls or paying high taxes , as long as you have an oil well in your backyard and all of your TV channels parent - blocked except Fox News .
Republicans have a pretty big umbrella that way , mostly because rich white guys can only buy so many votes and thus they have to broaden their appeal .
IPOD solar style - clunky , but effective .
So people are confused that I can think Al Gore is an opportunistic shill mobilizing the left with deceit and still care about good old Mama Earth .
Well , I do , but instead of asking someone to nationalize Exxon or fly airplanes all over the world telling people they should ride bicycles , I do practical things .
Small differences add up to big effects .
And I can show you how to make a difference too .
Everyone likes to talk about making a difference but no one is really sure what works .
Carbon credits ?
Scam .
Carbon offsets ?
Scam , only liable to make you rich , so worthy of consideration .
But while you get rich selling carbon offsets to suckers on Craigs List , how can you legitimately lower your carbon footprint yet maintain the decadent western lifestyle you 've come to enjoy ?
The answer is simple , my fellow environmentalists : fruit power .
Electricity , you see , does n't have to be generated using smoke - belching coal - fired plants .
It can also be generated using nuclear power , a key reason why the French picked CO2 to be the global warming culprit instead of methane , which they generate in substantial quantity , or using wind power and even ocean waves .
The French solution to air pollution
Electricity can also be generated chemically , like in batteries .
But ordinary batteries use things like sulfuric acid and even in diluted quantities it can melt your skin and make you sterile so it 's probably better not to mess with it .
The answer to generating delicious electricity while enjoying Mother Nature 's awesome goodness is the magic of electrolytes .
An electrolyte is basically something with some free ions hanging around that can conduct electricity , like an acid or a base .
Sulfuric acid is really , really acidic which is why it 's in batteries but lots of ordinary foods have enough acid to do what we want if they are properly motivated , including many fruits .
One of the best fruits to use is a lemon , because it is high in acidity .
Because it is high in acidity it can react quite well with an active metal , like zinc , and that reaction can produce electricity for you .
If you ever built something like this from a science kit , they talk in mumbo jumbo about ' zinc electrodes ' and ' copper electrodes ' and what not .
I do n't have ' zinc electrodes ' around the house .
I do n't even have any lemons .
What I did have was a few pennies , some aluminum foil , a battery powered stopwatch and apples .
Make electrical juice from your apple juice
It 's easier than you think .
For this LCD stopwatch I used :
4 pennies
2 apples
4 wires with alligator clips - okay , I did have those and you might not but any copper wire will do .
4 squares of aluminum foil , each the size of the face of an apple .
1 ) Cut the apples in half .
Put each half face down on the aluminum foil .
2 ) Insert a penny in the top of each apple section .
3 ) Run a piece of wire from the penny of the apple on your far left to the + terminal inside the stopwatch .
4 ) Run a piece of wire from the aluminum foil on the apple piece of your far right to the - terminal inside the stopwatch .
Astute conservatives will note the mid-May National Review magazine used to hold this baby .
That 's right , Republicans care about the environment too .
5 ) Run a wire from the aluminum foil of that first apple to the to the penny on the next one and repeat those connections until they are all connected to each other .
If you have n't messed this up , your stopwatch will be lit .
If you have messed this up , you probably should n't be allowed around a campfire singing " Kumbaya " ( Democrats ) or around firearms ( Republicans ) .
So now I am generating electricity with no carbon footprint at all .
The problem is doing anything requiring more than 1.5 volts is going to take a lot of apples wired in series , so as you can see in the picture of my new menu below , I have had to make some dietary changes .
It 's just one of the many sacrifices I have to make to cure global warming .
The officer 's wife said she secretly drugged his meatballs
Anthony Chiofalo , of New York Police Department ( NYPD ) , has asked Manhattan Supreme Court to challenge his firing .
He was suspended in 2005 after 22 years of service , for failing a random test .
His wife told investigators she had secretly drugged his meatballs hoping a failed test would force him to retire .
NYPD said the story was " not credible " .
Both Mr Chiofalo and his wife Catherine have passed lie detector tests about how the marijuana entered the police officer 's system .
Back pain
Mrs Chiofalo told investigators she had put enough marijuana for six cigarettes in her meatball recipe in July 2005 , according to court papers .
She testified at a hearing that she just wanted her husband " not to die of a heart attack or get killed " while still in service , the Associated Press news agency quotes the court papers as saying .
" I wanted him to be around to help raise my son , " she said .
She had reportedly expected him to retire in 2004 after 20 years in the force .
Mr Chiofalo said his wife had marijuana in the house because she used it to alleviate suffering caused by chronic back pain .
An administrative judge recommended that Mr Chiofalo be reinstated to the Joint Terrorism Task Force but Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly rejected that opinion and fired him .
Mr Chiofalo hopes the court will rule his dismissal unconstitutional and force the NYPD to re-hire him .

Bill Gates was wildly optimistic when he said in 2004 that the problem of spam would be " solved " by 2006 .
The volume of junk e-mail transmitted worldwide is still enormous .
But a remarkable trend is underfoot , according to Brad Taylor , a staff software engineer at Google :
The number of spam attempts – that is , the number of junk messages sent out by spammers – is flat , and may even be declining for the first time in years .
Google wo n't disclose numbers , but the company says that spam attempts , as a percentage of e-mail that 's transmitted through its Gmail system , have waned over the last year .
That could indicate that some spammers have gotten discouraged and have stopped trying to get through Google ’s spam filters .
Google data suggests that incoming spam ( the red line ) has flattened or declined for the first time in years .
( The blue line represents the percent of spam that is missed by Gmail filters and reported by users as arriving in their inboxes . )
Image : GoogleOther experts disagree with Google , pointing out that overall spam attempts continue to rise .
By most estimates , tens of billions of spam messages are sent daily .
Yet for most users , the amount of spam arriving in their inboxes has remained relatively flat , thanks to improved filtering .
Brad Taylor is on the front lines of the war on spam .
He has served as the chief watchdog of Google ’s spam filter since 2004 , when Gmail first launched .
His history with spam goes back much further , though :
He 's been fascinated with it since 1994 , when he received his first spam e-mail at a work account .
Before he joined Google , he worked at an anti-spam startup .
Taylor denies he 's obsessed with junk mail , but his actions speak otherwise :
For his own amusement , he Googles the gobbledygook at the bottom of spam messages to see where the text comes from .
( Some are from Harry Potter books , he says .
He also found one that was an English translation of a Russian science - fiction novel ) .
" It 's fun , " he says of catching spammers .
" Sometimes I think , ' Oh , wow , that guy 's really clever . ' "
The chase may be exciting , but Taylor 's real dream is to return e-mail to the " pristine experience it used to be . "
Chenxi Wang , an analyst at Forrester Research , scoffs at the idea that spam attempts could be on the decline .
" I 'm seeing that the overall trend is up , " Wang says .
" We 're not seeing a drastic increase , though .
And we 're also seeing an increase of targeted spam instead of blanket spam that hits everybody in a large population .
Today , for instance , you see spam messages on saving ( on ) prescription drugs targeted to seniors . "
For its part , Yahoo , too , says the overall amount of spam transmitted is on the rise , but the percentage of spam that reaches its users ’ inboxes is down .
( Yahoo would not disclose specific numbers . )
Regardless of the overall spam attempts , David Daniels , vice president of Jupiter Research , predicts the number of spam messages that actually reach a typical inbox will remain roughly flat over the next three years .
And for most people , that 's what really matters .
" We 're forecasting that the number of spam messages that annually reach the average inbox will hit 4,351 in 2007 .
For 2010 , we think that number will essentially be flat at 4,403 .
The growth will be very , very small , " Daniels says .
There are a couple of reasons for the lack of growth in spam deliveries .
For one , e-mail providers like Google , Yahoo , AOL and Microsoft 's Hotmail use sophisticated filtering algorithms that are constantly updated based on spam reports from individual users .
Google says it can delete all instances of a single spam message across the Gmail network in seconds .
New anti-spam technologies are also always under development , and there are already countless anti-spam services and technologies available to consumers , including disposable e-mail addresses .
It 's by no means a perfect system , though .
And spammers are , if nothing else , persistent .
In a bizarre twist , Daniels thinks that instead of receiving spam offers from penny - stock pushers , mailboxes will increasingly be filled with marketing messages that we choose to receive , such as promotional e-mails from a favorite clothing store or a bank .
He thinks the average number of messages from marketers that individuals receive annually will grow from 2,715 in 2007 to 3,335 in 2010 .
" We expect people to spend as much time on e-mail as they have , but we think people will receive more e-mail from legitimate marketers .
So there will be more competition to get consumers ’ attention in the inbox , but it will be more like competition between The Gap and J.C. Penney as opposed to The Gap and a Viagra salesman . "
After the president ’s rationale (s ) for the war in Iraq fell apart , the White House crafted a post - hoc rationalization for the invasion — the United States was committed , above all else , to spreading democracies and toppling dictators across the globe .
For Bush , this met our idealistic goals ( spreading freedom ) , and our practical goals ( more democracy means better security ) .
It was always a dubious proposition , more politically convenient than ideologically heartfelt .
Indeed , for all of the president ’s talk about democracy being “ God ’s gift to humanity , ” there ’s no evidence Bush takes his own principles seriously at all .
After Pervez Musharraf ’s recent crackdown , which including arrest Supreme Court justices and shutting down independent media , Bush praised Musharraf as “ truly is somebody who believes in democracy . ”
He did not appear to be kidding .
As Newsweek ’s Michael Hirsh explained , the president ’s trip to the Middle East this week hammered this point home .
A day after George W. Bush gave his big democracy speech and declared the opening of “ a great new era … founded on the equality of all people ” — a line he delivered at the astonishingly opulent Emirates Palace hotel , where most of the $ 2,450 - a- night suites are reserved for visiting royals — the president flew to Saudi Arabia on Monday .
There he planned to spend a day with King Abdullah at his ranch , where the monarch keeps 150 Arabian stallions for his pleasure , and thousands of goats and sheep “ bred to feed the guests at the King ’s royal banquets , ” as the White House put it in the “ press kit ” it handed out to reporters on the eve of the president ’s eight - day Mideast tour .
Bush was also expected to take time out to meet with a group of “ Saudi entrepreneurs . ”
What could not be found on Bush ’s schedule was one Saudi dissident or political activist , much less a democrat .
What a surprise .
Protesters accuse Capitol police of ' pink profiling ' Nick Juliano

At pretty much any contentious Capitol Hill event nowadays , one can expect to see a gaggle of brightly garbed women filling seats along with the usual cadre of buttoned - down staffers , straight - laced lobbyists and disheveled journalists .
The members of Code Pink -- mostly feisty middle - aged women -- have changed the dynamics on the Hill , and their stature has risen to the point where President Bush called out the group in a recent speech .
The group has a habit of disrupting the proceedings when administration figures appear before Congress , although its members have recently set its sights on Democrats , who they say have been ineffectual in ending the war .
" It is nt just for the hell of it we go to Congress and insert ourselves , " Gael Murphy , a Washington , D.C. , resident and CODEPINK co-founder told Roll Call for a Tuesday article .
" Five years into the war we have extreme frustration because the Democrats are being so accommodating . "
All the shouting and sign waving has also drawn the attention of the Capitol Police , who Code Pink accuses of trying to silence its protests through " pink profiling , " which includes asking members about court orders keeping them away from the Hill , kicking Code Pink members out of hearings without provocation and levying harsher charges against those protesters who come into contact with police .
The Capitol Police deny charges that they treat Code Pink members differently than any other visitors to the Capitol .
" We apply the applicable laws , and our officers act with discretion , " Capitol Police Chief Phillip Morse told the newspaper .
The Senate 's Sergeant - At - Arms , Terrance Gainer , said he had n't seen protesters mistreated as long as everyone understands " ground rules " governing " where signs and being vocal are permitted , and where they 're not . "
The Code Pink protesters say those ground rules are difficult to decipher , and sometimes just wearing a pink shirt is enough to draw warnings from the Capitol Police .
 In more than 20 years of practice , I have never seen a long - term systematic campaign of this sort ,  Mark Goldstone , a lawyer who represents many CODEPINK members , told Roll Call .
 This is really new , and because of it the ground rules are shifting and enforceability is shifting .
At a press conference last month , RAW STORY observed just how interested Capitol Hill police can become when Code Pink begins to gather .
As 20 or so Code Pinkers gathered outside a Hill office where Rep. Dennis Kucincih ( D - OH ) , a de-facto ally of the group , was to speak about his resolution aimed at impeaching Vice President Dick Cheney .
The protesters were not disruptive -- indeed , they were there to praise Kucinich not criticize him -- and none apparently were arrested , but even Kucinich 's aides could not explain the heavy police presence .
As Roll Call notes , some lawmakers have intervened when they perceived police as going too far against the protesters .
" In March , House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) went so far as to pay the $ 35 fine after Capitol Police arrested CODEPINK member and retired Army Col .
Ann Wright after she left the hearing room , " report Anna Palmer and Elizabeth Brotherton .
" Conyers gaveled for Wright to be excused from the hearing , not arrested . "
The group also has subpoenaed Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Lantos , after two Code Pink members were arrested at an appearance by Condoleeza Rice , who was accosted by another Code Pink protesters whose hands were covered in fake blood .
Code Pink founder Medea Benjamin apparently was arrested for flashing a peace sign , so she subpoenaed Lantos to explain the committee 's rules .
Prosecutors then dropped the charges against her .
 The whole issue has been dropped ,  said Bob King , Lantos chief of staff .
FAQ about CouchDB and it's new IBM overlords
Q. What does IBM 's involvement mean for CouchDB and the community ?
A . The main consequences of IBM 's involvement are :
- The code is now being apache licensed , instead of GPL .
- Damien is going to be contributing much more time !
Q. What about all the people who worked on the project ?
Are they still going to contribute , or has this become an IBM only club ?
A . No one is being being replaced or pushed aside , and I 'm hoping the people who are currently contributing keep contributing , because they are passionate and their work is fantastic .
Q. IBM sucks !
They are going to ruin everything because they 're a bunch of ruiners !
Blah Blah Blah !
A . Ok , that was n't really an question , but I 'll respond anyway .
Yes IBM does suck .
But they also rule .
And they are just " Ok " .
They say you can't be all things to all people , but when you have 350,000 employees and a presence in every nearly every niche of the computer industry , you can come close .
IBM is gigantic and diverse .
So say what you want about IBM , but CouchDB will be a part that does not suck .
When it comes to CouchDB and control , I 've made sure not to get myself into a situation where I could lose my rights to keep working on CouchDB .
Praise the power of open source !
Now do n't get me wrong , I will tend to see things IBMs way a little more often , seeing things through big blue tinted glasses .
It 's just unrealistic to think any other way about it .
But they do n't own me , and they sure do n't own CouchDB .
I 've made sure of it .
If there is bad quarter and a corporate reshuffle and suddenly I 'm working with vapid bureaucrats , then we 'll have to part ways .
Same as any other job .
Except CouchDB has been kept free and open and I , like anyone else , can continue the work on my own , forking the code base if I wish .
It 's the beauty and freedom of open source , and IBM has shown time and time again they are visionary enough to be a part of it and share in the rewards .
Q. So is CouchDB now going to written in Java ?
A. Erlang is a great fit for CouchDB and I have absolutely no plans to move the project off it 's Erlang base .
IBM / Apache 's only concerns are we remove license incompatible 3rd party source code bundled with the project , a fundamental requirement for any Apache project .
So some things may have to replaced in the source code ( possibly Mozilla Spidermonkey ) , but the core Erlang code stays .
An important goal is to keep interfaces in CouchDB simple enough that creating compatible implementations on other platforms is feasible .
CouchDB has already inspired the database projects RDDB and Basura .
Like SQL databases , I think CouchDB needs competition and a ecosystem to be viable long term .
So Java or C++ versions might be created and I would be delighted to see them , but it likely wo n't be me who does it .
Q. What is CouchDB 's relationship to Lotus Notes / Domino ?
A . There is no relationship at all .
I 've not talked about CouchDB with anyone in the Lotus group .
CouchDB is in IBM 's Information Management group .
As far as I know , there are currently no plans for CouchDB to be in any way integrated with anything from Lotus .
But that may change at anytime .
Posted January 6 , 2008 11:28 AM
It is one of Paris 's most celebrated monuments , a neoclassical masterpiece that has cast its shadow across the city for more than two centuries .
But it is unlikely that the Panthéon , or any other building in France 's capital , will have played host to a more bizarre sequence of events than those revealed in a court last week .
Four members of an underground " cultural guerrilla " movement known as the Untergunther , whose purpose is to restore France 's cultural heritage , were cleared on Friday of breaking into the 18th - century monument in a plot worthy of Dan Brown or Umberto Eco .
For a year from September 2005 , under the nose of the Panthéon 's unsuspecting security officials , a group of intrepid " illegal restorers " set up a secret workshop and lounge in a cavity under the building 's famous dome .
Under the supervision of group member Jean - Baptiste Viot , a professional clockmaker , they pieced apart and repaired the antique clock that had been left to rust in the building since the 1960s .
Only when their clandestine revamp of the elaborate timepiece had been completed did they reveal themselves .
" When we had finished the repairs , we had a big debate on whether we should let the Panthéon 's officials know or not , " said Lazar Klausmann , a spokesperson for the Untergunther .
" We decided to tell them in the end so that they would know to wind the clock up so it would still work .
" The Panthéon 's administrator thought it was a hoax at first , but when we showed him the clock , and then took him up to our workshop , he had to take a deep breath and sit down . "
The Centre of National Monuments , embarrassed by the way the group entered the building so easily , did not take to the news kindly , taking legal action and replacing the administrator .
Getting into the building was the easiest part , according to Klausmann .
The squad allowed themselves to be locked into the Panthéon one night , and then identified a side entrance near some stairs leading up to their future hiding place .
" Opening a lock is the easiest thing for a clockmaker , " said Klausmann .
From then on , they sneaked in day or night under the unsuspecting noses of the Panthéon 's officials .
" I 've been working here for years , " said a ticket officer at the Panthéon who wished to remain anonymous .
" I know every corner of the building .
And I never noticed anything . "
The hardest part of the scheme was carrying up the planks used to make chairs and tables to furnish the Untergunther 's cosy squat cum workshop , which has sweeping views over Paris .
The group managed to connect the hideaway to the electricity grid and install a computer connected to the net .
Klausmann and his crew are connaisseurs of the Parisian underworld .
Since the 1990s they have restored crypts , staged readings and plays in monuments at night , and organised rock concerts in quarries .
The network was unknown to the authorities until 2004 , when the police discovered an underground cinema , complete with bar and restaurant , under the Seine .
They have tried to track them down ever since .
But the UX , the name of Untergunther 's parent organisation , is a finely tuned organisation .
It has around 150 members and is divided into separate groups , which specialise in different activities ranging from getting into buildings after dark to setting up cultural events .
Untergunther is the restoration cell of the network .
Members know Paris intimately .
Many of them were students in the Latin Quarter in the 80s and 90s , when it was popular to have secret parties in Paris 's network of tunnels .
They have now grown up and become nurses or lawyers , but still have a taste for the capital 's underworld , and they now have more than just partying on their mind .
" We would like to be able to replace the state in the areas it is incompetent , " said Klausmann .
" But our means are limited and we can only do a fraction of what needs to be done .
There 's so much to do in Paris that we wo n't manage in our lifetime . "
The Untergunther are already busy working on another restoration mission Paris .
The location is top secret , of course .
But the Panthéon clock remains one of its proudest feats .
" The Latin Quarter is where the concept of human rights came from , it 's the centre of everything .
The Panthéon clock is in the middle of it .
So it 's a bit like the clock at the centre of the world . "
In the late 1990s he was assigned as a special attorney in Boston leading an inquiry into allegations that F.B.I. agents and police officers had been compromised by mobsters .
In taking over the inquiry , Mr. Durham is expected to be able to move ahead without a long delay because his team will include Justice Department prosecutors who have already been working on the case .
But at least in the beginning , it is likely to proceed more slowly than parallel investigations on Capitol Hill that are already well under way .
Investigators from the House Intelligence Committee last month reviewed C.I.A. documents related to the destruction of the tapes , and the committee has called government witnesses to testify at a hearing scheduled for Jan. 16 .
Mr. Mukasey pointedly did not designate Mr. Durham as a special counsel , in effect refusing to bow to pressure from Congressional Democrats to appoint an independent prosecutor with the same broad legal powers that were given to Patrick J. Fitzgerald , the special counsel who was appointed in 2003 to lead the investigation into the disclosure of a C.I.A. officer ’s identity .
That inquiry resulted in the perjury and obstruction prosecution of I. Lewis Libby Jr. , formerly Mr. Cheney ’s chief of staff .
After Mr. Libby ’s conviction , President Bush commuted his sentence .
Mr. Fitzgerald was appointed after the attorney general at the time , John Ashcroft , determined that his own relationship with officials under possible scrutiny in the leak case forced him to recuse himself from the investigation .
As special counsel , Mr. Fitzgerald had the authority of the attorney general for the matters under investigation .
Mr. Durham will report to the deputy attorney general , an office being held temporarily by Craig S. Morford .
Mr. Durham will have the powers of the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia , a jurisdiction that includes C.I.A. headquarters .
If a grand jury is convened as expected , it will meet in Alexandria , Va. , where the prosecutor ’s office is located .
Mr. Mukasey said “ in an abundance of caution ” the office of United States attorney for the district , Chuck Rosenberg , had been recused from the case and would not take part in the inquiry .
Mr. Rosenberg ’s office has investigated cases of detainee abuse by C.I.A. employees and contractors and has worked closely with the C.I.A. on counterterrorism and espionage cases .
Mr. Mukasey said the decision was made “ to avoid any possible appearance of a conflict with other matters handled by that office . ”
Appointments like Mr. Durham ’s are sometimes made in cases in which prosecutors like Mr. Rosenberg have recused themselves .

The Eleventh Day of Every Month
This week the Bush State Department is devoting its full diplomatic efforts toward bringing a two - state resolution to the Israel - Palestine conflict .
Over the past few months , they have put on a full - court press to gather a broad representation of Arab world leaders to join Israeli and Palestinian negotiators for a historic meeting in Annapolis , Maryland .
Now , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas have agreed to a program of sustained and focused negotiations throughout 2008 .
With these cautious but hopeful beginnings , over 80 evangelical leaders have signed a statement indicating their belief " that the way forward is for the Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate a fair , two - state solution . "
These leaders including Christian college and seminary presidents , denominational heads , and other ministry leaders pledge their " ongoing support for the security of Israel , " and state that " unless the situation between Israel and Palestine ...

After completing an initial inquiry , tthe Justice Department has decided to open a full criminal investigation into the 2005 destruction of CIA tapes showing the interrogation of two Al Qaeda suspects .
The finding of a basis for possible criminal charges is not itself surprising — there are at least six such offenses that were obvious from the outset .
Attorney General Mukasey has appointed a U.S. Attorney General to handle the investigation — a disappointing decision not to appoint someone outside the Administration .
We now know that White House officials and Justice Department officials were aware of this plan to destroy evidence .
According to sources , at least four top
White House lawyers discussed the issue between 2003 and 2005 .
This would put the discussions at a date shortly before Gonzales took over as Attorney General .
It would also show that he knew of the destruction plan as Attorney General despite the demand for such evidence by Congress and the courts .
It would also mean that Gonzales was involved in another alleged criminal act .
He was previously involved in pushing the unlawful electronic surveillance program , even appearing at the hospital bed of John Ashcroft to override objections within the Justice Department .
He was also the author to the infamous torture memo and now appears to have be a party to a plan to destroy evidence of such torture .
It also appears that he did not reveal this involvement to Congress in his confirmation hearings .
Reportedly also involved were David Addington , counsel to Vice President Dick Cheney and is now his chief of staff ; John Bellinger III , then senior lawyer at the National Security Council ; and Harriet Miers , who succeeded Gonzales as White House counsel .
Addington is particularly interesting given his appearance in virtually every scandal these days .
He is known as an enabler for both Bush and Cheney , arguing for extreme assertions of executive privilege and supporting such things as waterboarding .
While other officials deny it , the Times reported that one officials noted that there had been “ vigorous sentiment ” among some top White House officials to destroy the tapes .
The disclosure puts the scandal literally next door to the President and , on the crime of torturing suspects , leads directly to his desk .
Yet , the Justice Department insists that it can see no conflict in investigating its own chief executive and staff .
Of course , Attorney General Mukasey swore implausibly that he did not know what waterboarding is and , even when told , refused to acknowledge the various courts decisions defining it as torture .
Since his confirmation , he has refused demands that he answer that question for the obvious reason that it would confirm that President Bush ordered criminal acts .
Sen .
Feingold has led this worthy but thus far fruitless effort .
Mukasey will now head an investigation involving the very subject of waterboarding .
The Justice Department is the very party accused of contempt and obstruction .
It is the institution that told judges like Judge Brinkema in Virginia that no such tapes existed when they did .
More importantly , in a contempt circumstance , it is the duty of the court to make an independent inquiry .
If this were a private party , it would be odd for the court to say that it wants the accused party to first investigate itself .
Instead , a court issues a show cause order that tells the party that it wants to know why it should not be held in contempt .
The party is then given time to muster its facts and filings .
This would have been the better course for the court .
Instead , the court is practically leaving a judicial matter ( contempt ) in the hands executive branch , which is investigating itself .
In June 2005 , Judge Kennedy handed down an order for the Administration to preserve “ all evidence and information regarding the torture , mistreatment , and abuse of detainees now at the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay . ” Five months later , the CIA destroyed the interrogation videos and the Administration is relying on a technicality — the two suspects tortured in the videos were not in Cuba .
However , such preservation orders are supposed to be given liberal interpretation .
Moreover , the government knew that the tapes have been sought by Congress and other courts .
Finally , it knew that the tapes would likely be sought in this and other cases , including in the inevitable filings of Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri .
In addition to obstruction , false statements , conspiracy , and perjury , there is spoliation .
This crime occurs when there is the intentional or negligent destruction or loss of tangible and relevant evidence which impairs a party ’s ability to prove or defend a claim .
This applies to “ pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation . ”
It has been defined “ the destruction or significant alteration of evidence , or the failure to preserve crucial items as evidence in pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation . ”
With the advent of a formal investigation , Congress should demand an independent investigation , an entirely independent counsel is warranted .
It is one thing for the Justice Department to claim the right to determine ( the rather obvious ) basis for investigating crimes .
However , that preliminary investigation now shows that the highest ranking members of the Administration were involved as were Justice officials .
The conflict of interest is open and obvious .
There remain many in Washington who are hoping that the voters will forget the scandal and particularly the torture program .
The advantage of having the Justice Department control the investigation is that it would move as a glacial pace and probably be narrowed to avoid the torture crime and other related offenses — focusing entirely on obstruction which is subject to technical defenses .
John Durham , the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut , is not viewed as political but he remains within the Justice Department and under Mukasey ’s supervision .
Many of us are concerned due to the less than impressive performance of Patrick Fitzgerald in the Scooter Libby matter .
Fitzgerald ’s investigation later showed significant holes and seemed to struggle to give possible targets like Karl Rove endless opportunities to get his sworn testimony right in repeated appearances before the grand jury .
It appears that they intend to prosecute any crimes out of the Eastern District of Virginia according to Mukasey ’s statement below .
“ Following a preliminary inquiry into the destruction by CIA personnel
of videotapes of detainee interrogations , the Department ’s National
Security Division has recommended , and I have concluded , that there is a
basis for initiating a criminal investigation of this matter , and I have
taken steps to begin that investigation as outlined below .
“ This preliminary inquiry was conducted jointly by the Department ’s
National Security Division and the CIA ’s Office of Inspector General .
It
was opened on December 8 , 2007 , following disclosure by CIA Director
Michael Hayden on December 6 , 2007 , that the tapes had been destroyed .
A
preliminary inquiry is a procedure the Department of Justice uses regularly
to gather the initial facts needed to determine whether there is sufficient
predication to warrant a criminal investigation of a potential felony or
misdemeanor violation .
The opening of an investigation does not mean that
criminal charges will necessarily follow .
“ An investigation of this kind , relating to the CIA , would ordinarily
be conducted under the supervision of the United States Attorney for the
Eastern District of Virginia , the District in which the CIA headquarters
are located .
However , in an abundance of caution and on the request of the
United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia , in accordance
with Department of Justice policy , his office has been recused from the
investigation of this matter , in order to avoid any possible appearance of
a conflict with other matters handled by that office .
“ As a result , I have asked John Durham , the First Assistant United
States Attorney in the United States Attorney ’s Office for the District of
Connecticut , to serve as Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern
District of Virginia for purposes of this matter .
Mr. Durham is a widely
respected and experienced career prosecutor who has supervised a wide range
of complex investigations in the past , and I am grateful to him for his
willingness to serve in this capacity .
As the Acting United States Attorney
for purposes of this investigation , Mr. Durham will report to the Deputy
Attorney General , as do all United States Attorneys in the ordinary course .
I have also directed the FBI to conduct the investigation under Mr .
Durham ’s supervision .
“ Earlier today , the Department provided notice of these developments to
Director Hayden and the leadership of the Judiciary and Intelligence
Committees of the Congress . ”

Mr Bush said the US needed help but was still strong
Bush statement
He said the growth package would have to be big enough to make a difference to the " large and dynamic " US economy .
Mr Bush said it had to include tax incentives for US business and direct tax relief for the American people .
The package should total at least 1 % of gross domestic product , or about $ 145 bn ( £ 74bn ) , the White House said .
' Shot in arm '
President Bush said the package should be " a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy " .
" To keep our economy going and creating jobs , Congress and our administration need to work together to enact an economic growth package as soon as possible , " he said .
The president said he expected the economy to continue to grow , but at a slower rate than in previous years .
While I am confident in the long term , the short - term risks are to the downside
Henry Paulson
US Treasury Secretary
Bush feels political heat Send us your comments
A US housing market slump and problems in the financial markets have raised fears of a severe economic downturn , with some economists talking about the risk of recession .
The Bush administration has already announced measures to help homeowners struggling to make repayments on their mortgages .
Tax incentives for businesses would help them make new investments and create new jobs , while " letting Americans keep more of their money should increase consumer spending , " President Bush said .
Tax relief
Some lawmakers and officials are pressing for a tax rebate of at least $ 300 per taxpayer , with some lawmakers seeking as much as $ 800 for per person and $ 1,600 for families .
At first blush it appears the news is a little less dramatic than people were hoping for

Speaking after the president , US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the risks of not taking action to stimulate the economy were too high .
" While I am confident in the long term , the short - term risks are to the downside , " he said .
Mr Paulson declined to give specific details about the emergency package before talking to Congressional leaders but said a " significant part " would be for ordinary consumers .
" We 've done a lot of work .
There 's strong bipartisan support , " he said .
Mr Paulson said the stimulus package could create an extra half a million jobs this year .
Disappointment
US shares turned sharply lower following the announcement , with some market participants saying that Mr Bush 's plan did not go far enough .
Economists fear a housing market slump will lead to a recession
Global stock indexes had earlier risen on optimism that the plan would help revive growth in the world 's largest economy .
" At first blush it appears the news is a little less dramatic than people were hoping for , " said Peter Kenny , managing director at Knight Equity Markets .
The BBC's Mark Gregory says the impact of the stimulus package would be more political than economic .
A stimulus package worth perhaps $ 140 bn dollars will have little real impact on a total US economy worth a gargantuan $ 14,000bn a year , our correspondent says .
If nothing else it'll make the politicians feel they are doing something and cheer up the voters - and who knows it may even do some good , he says .
Saw a couple of high school friends over the weekend , went to a few hometown bars where we hoped we would n't run into anyone else we knew from the dark old days .
As we took the first sips of a fourth round of pints , one of us mentioned how none of us ever drank in high school .
" What was wrong with us ? "
" What did we do then ? "
But we knew .
Unlike normal , decent kids who got wasted at some house whenever someone else 's parents were in Aspen or Acapulco , we were out causing real trouble : trespassing , jumping from rooftop to rooftop downtown , violating any number of other local ordinances .
I spent nights in police stations .
I was frisked more than once .
" Remember that time you jumped out of Steve 's jeep after he drove up that giant sand dune behind the Budweiser plant ? " I asked one friend .
" We chased you home with Steve shining that police spotlight on you the whole time . "
" You assholes said I looked like a Yeti . "
But more than anything else , back then we broke into abandoned buildings .
There was the ghost town out in the country , the abandoned tuberculosis asylum down by the cemetery , the vacant churches , the shuttered paper mills .
We 'd bring girls with us sometimes , and they 'd stay close , hide their eyes in our shoulders , their frightened breath on our necks .
When one of us could n't round up a girl , we'd go out ahead of time and wait alone for our friends to show up , ready to terrify them with stomping footsteps and rattling chains .
I remember the feeling of being alone in those damp , echoing places , the cold silence of the long - vacated morgue , its steel corpse drawers haphazardly opened and closed .
I remember the smell of ancient wine spilled from casks stored in the back of the old hotel , where there was an open door facing away from the road and where , terrified , we 'd burst out into air that smelled like the mint growing wild in the fields .
The ghost town had once boomed providing mint to William Wrigley .
The town had died , but we went there to feel alive .
Detroit , with its thousands of abandoned structures , is something of a mecca for kids and adults who still do this sort of thing .
There 's a whole community of them here , and people come from all over the country to " explore " the city 's ruins .
In the little I 've done since we moved here I have n't found that same adolescent thrill .
Maybe because I no longer need to terrify girls to get them to come close to me .
Or maybe the whole thing just seems so hackneyed because there are so many people doing it here .
My photographs of these buildings seem so clichéd , so easily sentimental .
There have been moments where I have been awed , like the eve of this past Thanksgiving , when I finally wandered into the darkness of the Michigan Central Station , a Beaux - Arts masterpiece designed by the same firm as New York 's Grand Central , but abandoned to the mercy of the elements , architectural scavengers , vandals , and graffiti taggers .
To visit and photograph this building again is something of a cliché in urban exploration , as it ranks high among the greatest modern ruins in the world .
It is our Parthenon , our Colosseum .
Yet in the stillness of the early evening , with rain dripping everywhere through its tattered roof , and darkness slowly swallowing the faded , almost - unfathomable grandiosity of the waiting room , it was not hard to get lost in the sublime .
I was alone in there ( as far as I knew ) , and the darkness and giant Doric columns allowed logic itself to bend .
I saw things I will not admit to you .
It was terrifying and highly satisfying .
But trespassing across the road , I experienced something else entirely .
Because of the response to the photos I put on flickr of the abandoned Detroit Public Schools Book Depository , I went back again to take some more with a better lens in HDR ( blending different exposures ) :
This is a building where our deeply - troubled public school system once stored its supplies , and then one day apparently walked away from it all , allowing everything to go to waste .
The interior has been ravaged by fires and the supplies that have n't burned have been subjected to 20 years of Michigan weather .
To walk around this building transcends the sort of typical ruin - fetishism and " sadness " some get from a beautiful abandoned building .
This city 's school district is so impoverished that students are not allowed to take their textbooks home to do homework , and many of its administrators are so corrupt that every few months the newspapers have a field day with their scandals , sweetheart - deals , and expensive trips made at the expense of a population of children who can no longer rely on a public education to help lift them from the cycle of violence and poverty that has made Detroit the most dangerous city in America .
To walk through this ruin , more than any other , I think , is to obliquely experience the real tragedy of this city ; not some sentimental tragedy of brick and plaster , but one of people :
Pallet after pallet of mid-1980s Houghton - Mifflin textbooks , still unwrapped in their original packaging , seem more telling of our failures than any vacant edifice .
The floor is littered with flash cards , workbooks , art paper , pencils , scissors , maps , deflated footballs and frozen tennis balls , reel - to - reel tapes .
Almost anything you can think of used in the education of a child during the 1980s is there , much of it charred or rotted beyond recognition .
Mushrooms thrive in the damp ashes of workbooks .
Ailanthus altissima , the " ghetto palm " grows in a soil made by thousands of books that have burned , and in the pulp of rotted English Textbooks .
Everything of any real value has been looted .
All that 's left is an overwhelming sense of knowledge unlearned and untapped potential .
It is almost impossible not to see all this and make some connection between the needless waste of all these educational supplies and the needless loss of so many lives in this city to poverty and violence , though the reality of why these supplies were never used is unclear .
*[ see update below ] *
In some breathtakingly - beautiful expression of hope , an anonymous graffiti artist has painted a phoenix - like book rising from the ashes of the third floor .
This building is not far at all from the Michigan Central Station .
Its exterior boasts no Corinthian columns , no real ornament to speak of .
Unlike the station , it is squat and quite unremarkable .
Suburban teens and even adults often ignore it as they regularly break into the station to leave their talentless tags , thrill at the decay , or just stand in awe of the colossal space inside .
Their grandparents might have first set foot in Detroit at that station , stepping off trains from back east or down south .
It was built with the sort of opulence that signified great promise for anyone who passed through it .
Peasants from Poland or Alabama would have been awed by it all , but could hardly have realized that their great - grandchildren would one day leave their names upon its crumbling columns , binding themselves in that way to those same stones as though it were a promise kept .
When I post pictures of Detroit , I am always struck by the way people respond in the comments with a sense of " sadness . "
The reactions we have to ruins is something that fascinates me , and I 'd love to hear more in the comments about how you feel looking at such buildings or even just seeing the photos I post on flickr .
Of course , I sometimes share a sense of sadness , but still I wonder : why is it " sad " for a building to be left to decay if there is no one willing to use it ?
Can decay be something more than sentimental ?
Can it ever be beautiful ?
Can it just be respected for what it is , and not further corrupted by our emotions ?
And what is it that draws us to ruination ?
Why do some of us find it so compelling ?
I 'd like to believe I am much more saddened by people whose lives fall apart than I am by crumbling stones or plaster .
Sadly , social decay is just so much more easy to ignore , and not as prettily exposed with the lens of a camera .
Unless , that is , you stumble upon a warehouse full of abandoned hope .
Walking back home from the book depository that day , I stopped to talk to the homeless men who live in Roosevelt Park .
They told me they see people like me going into the station every day .
I assumed by " like me " they meant bourgeois whites carrying tripods and DSLR cameras .
The next time I went , I saw a few dozen more homeless men and women receiving handouts from some mobile charity , directly in the shadow of the train station .
Some of them have made homes inside these ruins .
They carried bottles covered with paper bags .
They seemed almost giddy , happy just to eat something warm .
I thought of the lovers in Robert Browning 's poem .
I thought of the paintings I 'd seen earlier that week at the Detroit Institute of Arts , of medieval peasants frolicking amid the ruins of Ancient Rome .
Cows once grazed in the forum .
And rich men who are long dead once decorated their walls with scenes not so different from this .
[ * update * I have done some research about what actually happened at the book depository / Roosevelt Warehouse and post about it here ]

The secrete messages in Google 's 2008 logo revealed .
Google put silently two hidden messages in its 2008 logo .
Google is celebrating 25 years of TCP / IP and the New Year .
Following are the two messages , with its meaning .
The debate over whether Fox News is a legitimate news enterprise has seized many in the press and academia .
But the transparently partisan presentation in their reporting should make for a short and dull debate .
Now , an uncharacteristically honest depiction of Fox News can found in an unlikely place .
TV Guide publishes the industry ’s most widely read magazine of program listings and this is how they categorize news programming for their readers :
Note that according to the legend on the top right of the page , the purple highlighting designates a program as “ news ” .
Then , scanning down to the listings , you will see that TV Guide does not consider The O’Reilly Factor to be a news program .
However , glancing down a little further reveals that TV Guide does view Keith Olbermann ’s Countdown as news .
Dig even further than that and you ’ll see that the entire Fox News schedule is not designated as news with the exception of Studio B with Shepard Smith .
Even Special Report , the program anchored by Brit Hume , Fox News ’ managing editor and chief Washington correspondent , is apparently not really news .
On MSNBC , Countdown and MSNBC Live are the only programs tagged as news .
But CNN ’s entire broadcast day is identified as news except for Lou Dobbs and Larry King .
( Source : TV Guide September 17 - 23 , 2007 )
Now , on a cursory level , that may just appear to be an obvious and objective evaluation of the content on these networks .
CNN has always been a dedicated news programmer , just as Fox has always been a propaganda vehicle for the Republican National Committee .
But there may be something more to this than just the labeling of program content .
Gemstar - TV Guide International , Inc. , the publisher of TV Guide , is owned by … wait for it … Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corporation .
Murdoch sits on its Board of Directors along with News Corp. president and COO , Peter Chernin .
The Board is chaired by Anthea Disney , a News Corp executive VP .
So why would Murdoch ’s own publication seemingly disparage the cable network he is working so hard to establish as a source of reputable journalism by declining to identify it as news ?
Could it have something to do with the fact that news programming routinely under - performs entertainment programming and that intentionally mislabeling
Fox broadcasts could result in driving more viewers to their network ?
By extension , they could also be attempting to suppress viewers for their main competition , Countdown , by coloring it purple and diverting the broader interest entertainment viewers away from the program .
By owning both the networks and the publications covering them , News Corp. can circle the PR wagons around itself and effectively manipulate viewers , coverage , and potentially , ratings .
TV Guide presently has almost 3.3 million subscribers .
Although that is a 12 % decline from the previous measurement period , it is still a significant audience .
They also operate electronic TV Guides on cable , satellite , and the Internet , that expose them to another 82 million viewers .
That reach allows them to define the market in ways that accrue to their own benefit .
For example , look at how TV Guide describes the O’Reilly / Olbermann match - up :
The Factor :
The bestselling author mixes news , interviews and analyses , and some of his most passionate commentaries , not surprisingly , deal with liberals ( such as , to pick one name at random , Al Franken ) .
The conservative guru ’s ` No Spin Zone ’ has been the major factor in Fox News ’ climb ( past CNN ) to the top of the cable - news chart , with some three million viewers nightly .
Countdown :
The nightly news program ranks the day ’s top five stories by what will likely be the next morning ’s hottest topics for discussion .
` It ’s a hard - news broadcast produced and hosted by people who are uncontrollably silly , ’ quips the wry Olbermann , who also conducts newsmaker interviews .
In short , The Factor is the number one show hosted by a popular and passionate bestselling author , while Countdown is a hard - news broadcast that is also regarded as “ silly . ”
This state of affairs is just another reason for rolling back the consolidation that has occurred in the media since the abominably irresponsible Communications
Act of 1996 ( thanks Bill Clinton ) .
But in the short term , Murdoch and TV Guide need to be called to account for their abject dishonesty and their efforts to deceive the public .
The author of ATSC capture and edit tool has announced that he is attempting to revoke the licensing of his product under the GPL General Public License .
Unfortunately it appears that the GPL does not allow this particular action .
Of course in this heyday of lawyers and trigger happy litigators who can tell .
What successes have others had in trying to take something they once operated under the GPL and make it private ?
And the more pressing question , why ?

At Mobile Commons , we have to write a lot of code under time constraints .
We also work on a fairly distributed basis , which means that writing readable code is not a luxury , it ’s a necessity .
We ca n’t afford to be clever for clever ’s sake , but if a new idiom helps make our code easier for our colleagues to grasp in a hurry , we embrace it .
Here ’re some idioms we ’ve recently created : Ruby programmers are familiar with the two guarded assignment operatorsand .
The typical use for them is when you have a variable that might be nil .
For example : You are trimming the first name provided it is n’t nil , and you are assigning ‘ 612-777-9311 ’ to the phone if it is nil ( or false , but that is n’t important right now ) .
The other day we were discussing the guards and we agreed that we wished there was a guarded method invocation operator .
Here ’s an example of when you would use it : Meaning , search the location table for the first record matching some criteria , and if you find a location , get its phone .
If you do n’t , get nil .
( Groovy provides this exact functionality , although Groovy usesinstead of )
However , wo n’t work becauseis not a real Ruby operator .
So what do we write instead ?
How about : Note that we need a local variable to make it work without extending the Object class .
Note further that although we only need the local variable for one line of code , it is in method scope and we must be careful that we do n’t clobber an existingvariable .
And when reading this code , we now have to look and see whetheris used again to understand what this line does .
This is a scoping problem .
if you are going to use variables , you want to restrict their scope as much as possible .
It feels like half of what we do when programming is manage side effects like overwriting a variable you are using elsewhere , and the more you can restrict those side effects , the easier programming becomes .
Java supports block scoping natively , and languages like Scheme solve this by providing a block scope macro , .
And you can roll your own in languages like Javascript that provide anonymous functions .
But this seems to get the natural left - to - right order wrong :
Well , we are tinkerers and toolsmiths .
So let ’s roll our own .
We ca n’t usewithout rewriting the Ruby parser , and that seems drastic .
So let ’s use “ andand ” in the hope that our non-English - speaking colleagues will forgive us .
We want to write :
And get the same effect as .
This would be bloody trivial if we have a macro facility , but “ If wishes were horses then beggars would ride . ”
Instead , we need to write a method that does some conditional evaluation for us .
If the receiver ( in this case the result of ) is truthy , like an ActiveRecord model , we wantto return it so we can use it .
But if it is falsy , we wantto somehow return something that takes any message you send it and returns itself without doing anything .
In other words , we want a mock object of sorts .
So that ’s what we ’ll do :
Note that because you accept any method using Ruby ’s method invocation syntax , you can accept methods with parameters and / or blocks :
Some of the other solutions to this problem that usechange Ruby ’s syntax .
This solution emphasizes syntactic regularity : the goal was to make an “ &&. ” operation that worked like &&= .
&&= looks just like normal assignment , you can use any expression on the RHS , only the semantics are different .
The andand method also works just like a normal method invocation , only the semantics are modified .
( Formerly called Object#me ) Ruby 1.9 includes Object#tap Ruby On Rails includes a similar feature , the returning idiom : Both return the location , not whatever happens inside the block .
This is very useful , especially when chaining methods in a pipeline .
Sometimes you want to do something for side effects , but continue on with the chain .
For example : There are going to be times that using a method instead of a function makes the code more consistent .
So let ’s imagine what that would look like :
This is much nicer when you are “ injecting ” some extra code into the middle of an expression , such as when adding some poor - man ’s - debugging puts statements .
Would we ever want to go beyond a block and writeinstead of ?
Of course we would !
Quite often , we want to send several methods to the same receiver .
In Smalltalk , the semicolon does this explicitly .
In Ruby , we have to be very careful to make sure our methods return self to enable chaining .
For example : But if a method does n’t return the receiver , chaining does n’t work .
That ’s why we had to use “ returning ” in the array example above :
That ’s because , not .
So instead , we write :
When you examine the source , you ’ll see that tap looks a lot like andand .
No surprise , we are doing similar things with slightly different semantics .
This implementation of Object#tap has two advantages over the implementation in Ruby 1.9 : first , it works in Ruby 1.8 .
Second , it adds the ability to call another method ( like ) and not have to include a block .
andand and tap both provide the same two benefits :
First , they either eliminate ( in the case of a method call ) or limit in scope ( in the case of a block ) a local variable .
Second , they let you maintain a natural left - to - right order when writing pipelined expressions .
They are simple and obvious enough that I feel any unfamiliarity for the reader will be more than outweighed by the cleaner , easier - to - digest code that results from their liberal use .
My suggestion is that these two benefits make it worth your while to add these methods to the Object class and use them regularly in your code ..
For the source and more information , http://andand.rubyforge.org postscript : Inline RescuesI have now seen two people asking about using an inline rescue instead of andand :
Also , one of the alternate solutions seems to use this technique .
Obviously , it works for many of the cases you want to try , and you do n’t need to add a new method to Object .
However , it is — to paraphrase Chalain — “ Sneaking up on the Interpreter .
” It achieves what we want almost by accident , namely that it rescues , which by coïncidence gives us the result we want .
However , it does not communicate our intent .
It says that we want to transmute all exceptions into a value of .
When someone glances at the code , will they think of ?
Or will they assume that we are trying to handle exceptions that themethod might throw ?
And what ifactually throws something serious ?
In Rails , what happens if a migration is screwed up and there is no phone column ?
I think we actually want ain that case .
The rescue clause will accidentally swallow the exceptions we are trying to catch .
I think if you are absolutely certain that you do not care about other exceptions and also if your team uses this idiom extensively so that it does not miscommunicate its intent , you can live a long and happy life using it .
However , I would be hesitant to recommend it as a general - purpose solution .
andand and some of the other solutions obviously require the code reader to learn a new method name , but after that they offer the exact functionality we need and clearly communicate their intent .

SpaceShipTwo is pictured slung beneath its carrier , White Knight Two
Animation of the Virgin Galactic spaceliner in flight
It is based on the X - Prize - winning SpaceShipOne concept - a rocket ship that is lifted initially by a carrier plane before blasting skywards .
The Virgin system is essentially a refinement , but has been increased in size to take eight people at a time on a sub-orbital trip , starting in 2010 .
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson said the space business had huge potential .
" I think it 's very important that we make a genuine commercial success of this project , " he told a news conference in New York .
" If we do , I believe we 'll unlock a wall of private sector money into both space launch systems and space technology .
" This could rival the scale of investment in the mobile phone and internet technologies after they were unlocked from their military origins and thrown open to the private sector . "
The ' experience '
Virgin Galactic has contracted the innovative aerospace designer Burt Rutan to build its spaceliners .
The carrier - White Knight Two ( WK2 ) - is said to be very nearly complete and is expected to begin flight - testing later this year .
SpaceShipTwo under construction in California
Both vehicles are being constructed at Mr Rutan 's Scaled Composites factory in California .
The rocket spaceliner will carry two pilot astronauts and six ticketed passengers .
They will fly initially from a new facility called Spaceport America in the New Mexico desert .
The journeys will last about two - and - a - half hours from beginning to end .
Eight individuals will be aboard each flight
Enlarge Image
Seats cost $ 200,000 .
Virgin Galactic says more than 200 individuals have booked , and another 85,000 have registered an interest to fly .
Tens of millions of dollars in deposits have already been taken , the company adds .
Satellite potential
Sir Richard said the launch system would also be made available to industrial and research groups .
" The fact that this system will have the capability to launch small payloads and satellites at low cost is hugely important , " he told the launch event at the American Museum of Natural History .
" As far as science is concerned , this system offers tremendous potential to researchers who will be able to fly experiments much more often than before , helping to answer key questions about Earth 's climate and the mysteries of the Universe . "
Others , such as EADS Astrium , have competing concepts
The most obvious difference is the scale .
At 18.3 m ( 60 ft ) in length , SS2 is twice as big as its predecessor .
Virgin Galactic said in a statement : " It incorporates both the lessons learned from the SpaceShipOne programme and the market research conducted by Virgin Galactic into the requirements future astronauts have for their space flight experience .
" It also has built - in flexibility to encompass future requirements for other scientific and commercial applications . "
An SS2 simulator is now available to train the pilots .
WK2 is 23.7 m - long ( 78ft ) .
Its wingspan is unchanged at 42.7 m ( 140 ft ) , but it will now sport four Pratt and Whitney PW308 engines .
Virgin Galactic is one of several companies hoping shortly to offer space trips .
Amazon.com entrepreneur Jeff Bezos has his own scheme , as does the Paypal founder , Elon Musk .
Even Europe 's EADS Astrium , the company that coordinates the manufacture of the Ariane 5 rocket , is developing a commercial suborbital ship .
Currently , the only way to buy a trip into space is to pay for a seat on the Russian Soyuz launcher .
Tickets purchased through Space Adventures cost a reported $ 20 m and take the recipient to the International Space Station for a short holiday .

Why I never shot anyone in school .
Friends - locked this essay for now .
I think I should clean it up a bit and see about publishing it in places more important than my live journal .
I would like to believe I am not the monster but I would be lying if I said I never thought about killing people who hurt me .
Ugly though it may be , thoughts like this have both kept me from committing suicide and committing murder far more than any noble notion of right and wrong or morality .
Who knows .
If it works for me , it might work for some other would - be sociopath out there too .
Input would be appreciated .
Watched a program on the Virginia Tech shooting and I feel like I need to address all the kids considering this kind of action .
If you 've never considered going on a killing spree , feel free to ignore the rest of this .
For everyone else : Okay look .
Here 's the cold hard fact :
You 're fucking stupid , pathetic and worthless .
No wait .
Hear me out .
This is n't the whinging of some asshole that does n't understand .
Believe me .
I FULLY understand .
I know the people you 're surrounded by are a bunch of ignorant assholes .
They 're mean little shitbags that think they own the fucking world and need to be taught a lesson .
By in large they 're empty vapid pieces of shit who do n't give a fuck who they hurt to make themselves look cool and popular .
It would be SWEET to teach them a lesson .
Just imagine the look of terror on their arrogant faces as they shit themselves while begging for their life on their knees in front of you and you listen to them beg and you think about all the shit things this fucker has done to you and others like you and how he 's never had to face the real fucking world before , and after you 've watched him wake up .
* BANG * and he falls back , dazed and confused , a gaping hole right between his eyes , not knowing he 's already dead and the last thing he sees is your face and his last thoughts are of all the shit he 's done and all the shit he took for granted that he 's not going to do .
Oh yeah .
I know .
I 've dreamt about it .
I 've played out a million times how I 'd do it so I could wipe out as many of them as possible before I had to off myself ...
And THAT is why I can tell you that you 're fucking stupid .
Because here 's the bottom fucking line : YOU CAN'T KILL ENOUGH OF THOSE FUCKERS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE .
All you 're going to do is make them martyrs .
All you 're going to accomplish is give them MORE love and MORE attention and MORE tools to tease and harass people JUST LIKE me and you .
You can't even fucking fantasize about killing these assholes any more .
Write down one story , tell one friend a fantasy about it and there 's a chance someone is going to run screaming to the school / police / whatever and then YOUR WHOLE LIFE IS FUCKED .
They win .
They can pick on us and tease us and beat us up and their asshole friends will lie for them and they 'll all smile smugly and you can't do anything about it .
So look .
Here 's the deal .
I do n't care jack shit about those assholes and if I did know them , odds are I 'd agree with you .
Kill the pigfuckers and watch them scream and cry and beg .
But I 'm NOT you .
I 'm old enough to know that there are roughly SIX BILLION total assholes on the planet and unless I can find some way to kill every last motherfucking one of them I 'm not going to accomplish a damn thing beyond making the life of people like you and me MORE fucking miserable .
So thanks you ignorant selfish little shit .
I really appreciate that you 've made my life that little bit worse .
You FINALLY made yourself fit in , did n't you .
Go on a killing spree and YOU are just as big of a selfish arrogant fucker as they are .
Want a better path ?
You 've got a brain .
Beat these unimaginative dicks .
It 's not that hard .
I 'll even tell you the secret .
Do n't waste your time on the individual assholes .
It 's a waste of time .
They are n't worth it .
Even if you wiped out your whole school , there 's thousands of other schools with millions of other assholes .
Even nukes would n't kill em all and some of them would undoubtedly survive even the nastiest virus .
You can't even just off yourself because you know a bunch of them will beat their meat over your corpse and crow about what a whuss you were and that 's why you did it and other will sniffle and snivel and cry , claiming they were you friend and milk it for all the fucking sympathy and attention they can get .
So ..
Here 's the thing .
To beat these assholes , you have to become something better than they are .
Find something you like .
Even if you 're not good at it .
Just figure out what you want to do and then DO IT .
It does n't matter how bad you are at it or whether or not those assholes laugh .
Fuck em .
It took me a long time to figure this out but the only reason they keep ' winning ' is because we 're playing by their rules .
FUCK EM ALL .
Quit being a freak .
Start being a super fucking gigantic screaming freak !
Play the guitar .
Write poetry .
Paint yourself green .
Do whatever the fuck makes you happy .
I know , I know .
Everyone says you 'll get locked up in a mental hospital if you do that and maybe if you live deep in the heart of Dumbfuckistan that might even happen .
Big fucking deal .
At least you'd be away from those assholes and when you come back NO ONE will DARE fuck with you .
But PROBABLY what will happen is a psychologist will talk to you for a while and say , " No you ignorant assholes .
It 's perfectly healthy to vent this shit .
Leave him the fuck alone .
" Second possibility :
That trite bullshit about ' Do n't try to be cool , just be yourself . '
It 's a load .
It 's crap people feed you to sugar coat the fact that the world is full of assholes but it 's also true .
You do n't like all these pigfuckers who are trying to be ' cool ' do you ?
Fuck .
Look at like Marylin Manson or Trent Reznor or those crazy fuckers in GWAR .
They 're total fucking freaks AND they 've got millions of fans , money , and fame .
Five years out of highschool , only the used car lot remembers the name of the highschool quarter back and that 's only because he works there .
Sure .
You can go on a shooting spree and get your 15 minutes of fame , but like I said before .
The survivors get to milk it for the rest of their fucking lives .
You want that ?
Truth is , the second you stop trying to be normal and just do whatever the fuck makes you happy , you become something else .
Something better than the rest of them and they notice .
Not right away .
It takes a while , maybe even a couple years but then one day you wake up and you realize that instead of being surrounded by ignorant assholes you want to kill , you 're surrounded by ignorant fans that you want to kill .
( Uh okay .
That 's not really better but at least fans buy you stuff )
Last possibility :
The assholes kill you .
Yeah .
That 's a risk .
Not going to deny it .
They might even get away with it .
Cops like to try to pretend not to notice if some white assholes kill a black man or some christian assholes kill a queer for Christ .
It 's a risk BUT things are getting better .
DNA and crime scene evidence is getting really damn good and they 'll PROBABLY end up getting anally raped in prison for years , maybe executed .
BUT consider this .
THEY LOSE .
Sure .
You 're dead but so fucking what .
You were willing to kill yourself after taking out a few of them so what 's that matter .
You got a free out .
BUT YOU are the martyr .
You still get your 15 minutes of fame but instead of all those assholes psychologists and people you know saying you were sick , mentally ill , and all the other bullshit they spew because they do n't want to see their precious fucking special little babies for the wastes they are .
They have to .
They have to take a long hard look at Mr Wrestling Team and Mr Football Player and they have to admit that the truth about this fuckers and instead of the sheep making the life of people like you and me worse , they have to eat their own .
WE win .
They lose .
So there it is .
No sunshine .
No bullshit .
No happy fucking ' It 'll be alright ' .
No fucking ' I love you ' or ' Everyone deserves to live . ' bullshit .
Just a simple request : Killing the sheep would be so fucking easy ...
But you can't wipe them all out .
You could n't even take out a tiny fraction .
Kill them and you , me , and everyone else like us loses while the rest of the world shits rainbows for them .
What now ?
That ’s the talk among all Kucinich supporters today .
I never thought realistically he would win .
I believed he should win , so I supported him as much as I could in whichever way I could .
I did n't think he would drop out ever until primary season was over .
All I can say is that he must be really getting hammered in Cleveland .
He has four challengers backed by corporations who are doing everything they can to pollute the political climate in Cleveland and make him lose his seat in Congress .
Those four challengers have accumulated so much more money than he has since Kucinich had raised barely any while focusing on his run for the White House .
I ’d like to say he left because he knew he would never win but that ’s not how I think Dennis went out .
He did n’t leave to go pursue impeachment because he thought he ’d get better results for change in America through focusing on impeachment instead of a failing campaign for President of the United States of America .
He left because he wanted to remain a strong voice for Americans in Congress and must go defend himself in his district to the lies that are coming from corporations and even AIPAC .
( See how Dennis just called for more humanitarian aid to go to Gaza for Palestinians . )
So what now ?
I think this movement behind Kucinich that truly stood for progressive ideals unlike the movement for Edwards , Obama , or Clinton should keep up its energy .
We have a lot behind us if we remain unified .
Besides the fact that Dennis was the only person who passed the MLK test , we have proof from a “ nonprofit , nonpartisan , non-advocacy , independent journalism organization based in Washington , D.C ” called the Center for Public Integrity that Dennis Kucinich was right all along to put together an October 2002 analysis against the Iraq war authorization and rally House members to oppose it when Edwards , Clinton , and even Obama .
( Talk is cheap .
Actions speak louder than words and he did little to act and stop the war after it was authorized and initiated . )
That proof strengthens the impeachment movement , which Dennis Kucinich has led against Cheney and will begin to lead against George W. Bush when he introduces articles of impeachment for Bush on January 28th next week .
Dennis Kucinich also stood up to the media and corporations that were excluding and limiting the candidates we have to vote for by protesting outside of all the debates he was excluded from with everyday Americans like you and me .
He targeted GE for keeping him out for his views .
He sued the media corporations that kept him out .
Kucinich stood up for the democratic right to have unlimited debate of the issues on our airwaves which the corporations have hijacked .
As Tommy Smothers , who used to be part of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour said in Tom Brokaw ’s book on the Boom Generation , “ You can talk all you want about freedom of speech , but it is freedom of hearing that counts . ”
The public never was granted the freedom to hear Dennis Kucinich and I would venture to say 50 percent of America does n't even know he just ran for president and failed .
But back to what next ...
There are options out there that we can pursue individually but not as a Dennis Kucinich for President Group together .
They are : support the terrible campaign for the presidency of Mike Gravel who has not dropped out officially yet , support Ron Paul and accept his conservative domestic policy stances so that we can have a true change in foreign policy and a true change in how we treat the Constitution of the United States of America , or support the Green Party presidential candidate , which may be Cynthia McKinney , since the Green Party is now an established party in many states across America and are a serious alternative to the failing Democratic Party for progressives upset with the corporate DLC .
These options are fine for all Kucinich supporters because they allow us to not sacrifice our ideals or beliefs and vote our conscience ( except for maybe in the case of Ron Paul ) .
But , we will not all be able to agree on which option to choose and there is no time to debate it and settle on something .
Therefore , here is what the Dennis for President crew should do .
1 ) Become fervent relentless supporters of the impeachment movement for Bush and Cheney .
In your congressional districts , help form impeachment committees to pursue feverishly the idea of impeachment by constantly calling and meeting with your congressman in your district and telling him why impeachment is necessary .
Go to the People ’s Email Network and donate $ 5 dollars or more and get a free “ Impeach Cheney ? ” cap to wear around to promote conversation with other Americans on the subject .
Write letters to the editors all the time talking about impeachment and successes of the impeachment movement ( like this upcoming introduction of articles of impeachment for Bush ) .
In fact , within your group , have one different person submit a letter each day and alternate because if your paper is anything like mine , you can only have one letter to the editor published every 30 days .

1. Carol Ann Reyes Dumped From Hospital Into Skid Row
A homeless woman named Carol Ann Reyes was admitted to Kaiser Permanente Bellflower hospital because of a nasty fall she took .
She stayed for three days , at which point Kaiser called her a cab , and instructed the cab driver to dump her in the Los Angeles area known as Skid Row .
Reyes was wearing only a thin hospital gown , because , as the hospital later admitted , her clothing had been lost .
Carol was confused and suffering from dementia , but Kaiser put her on the streety anyway , and was only caught because of a videocamera running outside of a homeless shelter .

2. Hannah Devane ’s Insurance Company Wo n’t Pay For The One Thing She Can Eat
Hannah Devane has a horrible disease of the esophagus that makes it impossible for her to eat normal foods .
Hannah literally needs a special formula called Elecare to survive , if she did n’t drink the Elecare she would n’t get enough food to live .
Naturally her health insurance company refuses to cover Elecare , calling it a “ nutritional supplement . ”
The thing that she needs to live is a supplement to the insurance company .
Her only source of nutrition .
Hannah ’s father , a police officer , is now working two jobs so that he can afford the formula for Hannah .

3. 9/11 Workers Denied Health Care
A large portion of the 40,000 people who worked at Ground Zero in the days following 9/11 have come down with life changing respiratory illnesses .
The dust in the aftermath of the terrorist attack was filled with asbestos and tiny bits of glass .
This is a terrible fact , but one would assume that these people would have nothing to worry about .
Surely the government would n’t forget about the people who sacrificed their personal well being on that day .
Forty percent of 9/11 responders are without health care , either because they never had it , or because they have lost their jobs since becoming ill .
The government pledged a paltry $ 52 million to cover their health care costs , a figure that was deemed “ inadequate ” by the federal 9/11 health coordinator .
It has gotten so bad for 9/11 workers that they recently have been forced to sued the World Trade Center insurance fund so that their health care needs could be met .

4. Emanuel Wilson Denied Chemotherapy
In Wake Of Hurricane Katrina
Emanuel was a school bus driver in Louisiana before losing his job in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
The government met some of his needs after he was displaced – he received money and food stamps – but what he really needed was chemotherapy .
Wilson had intestinal cancer , and had been getting monthly chemo before the hurricane hit .
The government helped people with health care after Katrina , but only if they were completely destitute .
If you had health care and a job before the Hurricane , you were out of luck after if you lost that job and health care .
So essentially Wilson was punished for playing by the rules .
He was covered .
Until natural disaster .

5. Shirley Loewe Denied Medicaid Coverage For Breast Cancer Because Of Loophole Law
Shirley Loewe was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003 .
At the time of diagnosis she was uninsured and her $ 15,000 a year income as a hairdresser was too high for her to qualify for Medicaid in Texas .
However , there is a federal law that allows women diagnosed with breast cancer to receive Medicaid treatment even if they do n’t meet all of the normal criteria .
Loewe was denied again anyway .
At the time Texas was one of 20 states that only applied that law if a woman was diagnosed at a clinic that received federal funding .
Loewe was not diagnosed at such a clinic .
She was diagnosed at a medical center half a mile away from a qualifying clinic .
Loewe ended up cutting back her work hours so that she could qualify for charity care .
Loewe died in June of 2007 , after four years of stress dealing with money and bureaucracy .

6. Tonya Gullino Has Miscarriage , Blue Cross Deems
It “ Elective Abortion ”
Tonya suffered a miscarriage last August , and understandably had to make an emergency room visit .
About three weeks later Blue Cross & Blue Shield sent a statement denying the claim related to the miscarriage .
Tonya called to find out why and was told “ We do not cover ELECTIVE abortions .
If you chose to terminate your pregnancy for non-health threatening reasons , BCBS will not cover it . ”
Despite the emergency room visit occuring near midnight ( who gets an abortion at that time of night ? ) , Blue Cross still asked Tonya to fax over her records stating that she did not have an elective abortion .

7. Jim Dawson Hit With $ 1.2 Million Hospital Bill , Despite Having Health Insurance
Jim Dawson found himself in the hospital at the age of 61 fighting an infection .
It proved to be a lengthy battle , with Jim spending five months in the hospital , but it had a happy ending .
At the end of the five months he was pronounced healthy , and was able to go home to his wife Loretta .
That ’s when the phone calls from California Pacific Medical Center started , reminding him that he still owed $ 1.2 million in medical bills .
This happened despite Jim having health insurance , because his insurance caps lifetime benefits at $ 1.5 million , a cap Dawson hit two and a half months into his stay .
He also has debts totalling into five figures to scores of doctors who were involved with his case .
Tough luck you might be thinking , caps are there to protect health insurance companies from massive payments far beyond what you could reasonably expect right ?
Sure , maybe , but Jim would have never hit his insurance cap if his hospital was n’t doing things like charging him $ 791 for stockings ( to improve blood circulation ) that can be found online for $ 12 .
Or the $ 2,225 to $ 6,675 a night for an oxygen mask to help him sleep .
He also would n’t have hit his cap if doctors had correctly diagnosed his staph infection early enough to be easily cured .
Various doctors made the wrong call however , leaving Dawson with a medical bill he can’t hope to ever pay .
Finally , when a reporter from the Wall Street Journal began investigating the story , California Pacific decided to write off his entire bill .
Strange how that works .

8. Aetna Takes Eric Simpson ’s Prosthetic Arm
Eric Simpson lost his arm after being brutally attacked by a masked gunman who shot him seven times , all in the arm .
Luckily , he had insurance ( for which he paid $ 530 a month ) , and Aetna said he was fully covered to obtain a prosthetic arm .
Good thing because the prosthetic cost a whopping $ 37,000 .
Eric got the arm , and spent a week learning to use it when he took a call from his insurer telling him they were sending someone to collect his new arm .
They told him he should have known he only had $ 2,000 in coverage for artificial limbs .
Despite the earlier pre-approval .
Aetna followed through , and repo’d the arm , before realizing ( a week later ) they had made a mistake .
Eric had full coverage for prosthetics after all , and eventually got his arm back , but not before going through an incredibly stressful experience at an already unbelievably stressful time in his life .

9. Natalee Sarkisyan Dies Because Cigna Drags Their Feet
Natalee Sarkisyan was a 17 year old girl from Glendale , California .
She suffered from recurrent leukemia , but was lucky in that her brother was a marrow match .
She received a bone marrow transplant from her brother in November of 2007 , but the transplant led to multiple organ failure that affected her kidney and liver .
Natalee needed a liver transplant , and was covered through her parents health insurer , Cigna HealthCare .
Cigna denied the liver transplent .
Her family organized widespread protests and attracted a great deal of media coverage , causing Cigna to reverse their decision .
But it was too late , and Natalee died just a few hours after Cigna approved the procedure .

Introduction
The scenario is you are without Internet connectivity anywhere .
You have found either an open wireless access pointed or perhaps you 're staying in a hotel which permits rented Internet via services like
Spectrum Interactive ( previously known as UKExplorer ) .
You make the connection , whether its physically connecting the Ethernet cables , or instructing you 're wireless adapter to lock onto the radio signal .
You are prompted with some sort of authorisation page when you open a browser .
You do n't have access to it , so what do you do ?
Open a command prompt or terminal and ping an IP you know to be up , active and that you know to be not physically connected to the network you are jacking into .
Perhaps even just ping google.com
[ 16:03 ] kay@client.example.com :~$ ping google.com PING google.com ( 64.233.187.99 ) 56 ( 84 ) bytes of data .
64 bytes from 64.233.187.99 : icmp_seq=1 ttl=237 time=196 ms 64 bytes from 64.233.187.99 : icmp_seq=2 ttl=237 time=164 ms 64 bytes from 64.233.187.99 : icmp_seq=3 ttl=237 time=152 ms 64 bytes from 64.233.187.99 : icmp_seq=4 ttl=237 time=153 ms
Right , so we 're connected , and we can use ICMP ping requests .
We are now in a position to " steal Internet " .
Now I do not promote any sort of actual illegal activity , but since these networks are " open " to us and acting as a service provider freely with no warnings of what we 're doing could be considered unauthorized usage .
Since ICMP works we can only assume that we 're permitted to use it right ?
I do n't see why they would allow this if they considered it unauthorized without notifying us beforehand .
For those that do n't actually know what all this mention of ICMP is , I suggest you google it , or check out the Wikipedia article on ICMP
Building the tunnel
To set up the tunnel you need :
One up system with Internet connectivity that can receive ICMP traffic and make outbound TCP connections .
This system we will call the proxy.example.com .
You ( preferably ) hold root or administrator level access on the proxy system .

Do this on both the proxy system and your local system .
On windows there are some ported copies of PingTunnel which are unsupported by the original creator , but I have used them and can they worked fine for me .
You can find them here .
One of the packages I believe should be ready for compiling with Microsoft Visual C++ , the other is certainly ready for compiling with the windows gcc .
You will need the pcap library to compile PingTunnel .
For instructions on the libpcap installation see the appropriate manual .
If you do n't feel like going through all the trouble of compiling this , there should be an executable binary within one of the packages precompiled that you can just run .
Making a tunnel
On the proxy system , obtain administrator level privileges , and run PingTunnel as below
[ 16:16 ] root@proxy.example.com :~/PingTunnel$ ./ptunnel -f ping.log & [ 16:16 ] root@proxy.example.com :~/PingTunnel$
This will run ptunnel in proxy mode and will log it 's output to a file called ping.log rather than print it on stdout .
On the client system , obtain administrator level privileges again and run PingTunnel as below , lets assume we wanted to ssh to one of our servers , lets call it portal.example.com .
[ 16:16 ] root@client.example.com :~/PingTunnel$ ./ ptunnel -p proxy.example.com - lp 8765 - da portal.example.com - dp 22 & [ inf ] : Starting ptunnel v 0.60 . [ inf ] : ( c ) 2004 -2005 Daniel Stoedle , daniels@cs.uit.no [ inf ] : Relaying packets from incoming TCP streams . [ 1 ]
10858 [ 16:17 ] root@client.example.com :~/PingTunnel$
Traveling through the tunnel
We now have a tunnel set up .
So lets use it !
To tell programs to use our tunnel we simply tell them to connect to port 8765 on the localhost .
So for example
[ 16:16 ] kay@client.example.com : ~$ ssh localhost -p 8765 The authenticity of host ' localhost ( 127.0.0.1 ) ' can't be established .
RSA key fingerprint is b7:2b:f3:3d:08:86:20:55:1d:82:08:2b:d0:33 :fe:af .
Are you sure you want to continue connecting ( yes / no ) ?
yes Warning : Permanently added ' localhost ' ( RSA ) to the list of known hosts .
Linux portal.example.com 2.4.27-0.3um # 1 Thu Sep 2 11:39:16 GMT 2004 i686 root@portal.example.com :~#
Hurray , light at the end of the tunnel .
We 've used ICMP to make a proxied TCP connection to the outside world .
We can use the same principle for any TCP based service .
Tunnel authentication
Potential problem .
Our proxy end of the tunnel is available to be used by absolutely anyone .
It has no authentication mechanism to permit only us to use it for tunneling .
After all we do n't want to get busted for sending spam because some jerk used our tunnel for his own illegal activity .
So we need to secure it .
The PingTunnel program provides a simple authentication option that allows us to set a password for our tunnel .
Its not solid security but it 's enough to keep our the majority of people .
Especially since if we did a standard scan on our proxy we would n't see the ICMP daemon anyway .
To set a password , when you run the proxy end , use the -x switch like this .
[ 16:16 ] root@proxy.example.com :~/PingTunnel$ ./ ptunnel -x ubersecret -f ping.log & [ 16:16 ] root@proxy.example.com :~/PingTunnel$
Then when our client requests a tunnel we run it like so .
[ 16:16 ] root@client.example.com :~/PingTunnel$ ./ ptunnel -x ubersecret -p proxy.example.com - lp 8765 - da portal.example.com - dp 22 & [ inf ] : Starting ptunnel v 0.60 . [ inf ] : ( c ) 2004 -2005 Daniel Stoedle , daniels@cs.uit.no [ inf ] : Relaying packets from incoming TCP streams . [ 1 ]
10858 [ 16:17 ] root@client.example.com :~/PingTunnel$
There you have it .
Free Internet , no authentication needed with the service provider you are jacking into provided as they permit ICMP traffic .
Limitations .
There is some limitations however , the functionality of web browsers is limited due to having to make several connections to different places for a single page .
The HTML will not indicate it should be passed through localhost .
In HTTP 1.1 the Host header must be passed , most clients will pass the host of whatever domain they are currently connecting to , so you will have requests for host : localhost , which most probably wont exist on the web servers configuration and will just be rejected .
How it works
Enough of all this tutorial - like talk !
Let 's explain how it works .
First of its important to know that ICMP is part of the IP suite of protocols .
It 's also important to be aware that like UDP , ICMP works on a datagram basis with no sort of transmission control or insurance of delivery .
Finally its very important to note that TCP does have transmission control and mechanisms to ensure delivery or be alerted to a failure .
Lets take a look at the ICMP packet layout for echo requests and echo replies .
0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+ |
Type | Code | Checksum | +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Identifier | Sequence Number | +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+ | Data ... |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
The type field specifics what the packet is for , since ICMP is used for more than simple ping and ping replies there are many values , but for us we only need to be aware of two types .
Type 8 tells us the packet is an echo request .
Type 0 tells us its a echo reply .
The code field is for more information about the nature of the packet , but for both echo reply and echo request the code field will always be 0 .
If you want to know more about what the code field is used for see the ICMP RFC
The checksum is a 16 - bit one 's complement of the one 's complement sum of the ICMP message beginning with the ICMP type .
The identifier is used when the code field is 0 , for echo requests & replies .
Its used to help match requests & replies .
This is often some information about the session , perhaps a PID or similar .
The sequence number , like the identifier is used as a to track which reply matches up with which request by way of a numerical value .
This should be unique to all outstanding ICMP traffic .
The RFC does not explicitly specify this .
However if the ICMP implementation has a ambiguous identifier field and duplicate sequence numbers in outstanding , traffic could end up in confusion .
The data field of the request contains data to be copied into the replies data field .
This could be used to add yet another way to identify request session , but in the case of the PingTunnel , this is one of the most important fields .
This is where we put our ping tunnel protocol data into , which will include the TCP data .
For an overview of the sequence of packets during standard operations such as pinging hosts , or traceroutes this pdf document gives an excellent brief .
So thats the background knowledge .
The client will always be using type 8 request packets for all its traffic , the proxy will always use type 0 reply packets for all its traffic .
The reason for this is simple routing .
Say that the client was behind a router the router 's operating system may itself reply to the proxies echo requests without forwarding them to a host within its network that is involved in the ICMP tunnel session .
This also brings up an important point about the initial setup of the ICMP proxy host .
It must be able to receive echo requests itself .
This might make the host system a router or simply have all packets for the proxy IP routed directly to it .
The ping tunnel protocol is similar to TCP , stuffed ICMP data field with an extra field included .
The extra field is called by the creator of PingTunnel , the " magic number " in simple terms its just an identifier to separate the echo traffic from regular echo traffic .
Since the proxy host operating system should always reply with a regular echo reply to each request packet we send .
The internals of the ping tunnel protocol ( no byte scaling ) .
+----------------+------+--------+---------+-------------------+ | Magic Number | IP | Port | State | Acknowledgment | +---------+------+------+--+-----+------+--+-------------------+
| Length | Sequence No. | Reserved | Data ... | +---------+----------------+------------+----------------------+
The IP and port fields are purely used during the first echo request from the client to the proxy to setup where the proxy should forward received packets .
These are both 32 bits wide .
The state field is crucial in the TCP - like control of the protocol .
It shows what sort of semantics should be understood from the packet .
Such as starting a session ( state = 0 ) , ending it ( state = 3 ) , authentication ( state = 4 ) , data forwarding ( state = 1 ) , and the TCP - like acknowledge data ( state = 2 ) .
It also contains a flag indicating who send the packet , proxy or client .
This is used with the magic number to differentiate tunnel ICMP traffic from the redundant echo replies that the proxy will make - since the proxy reply will contain identical data to the request , this will tell the client to discard packets claiming to be from the client , but are actually from the proxy .
When the left most bit is set the proxy is sending the data , when the left most but one bit is set the client is sending the data .
The state field is 32 bit wide .
For example say state is 0x80000004 then we can see that the proxy is forward some received data back to the client .
The acknowledgment and sequence number fields are used to ensure delivery in the correct order and also to detect when a packet could get lost in the network cloud between the client and proxy .
These are very much like the TCP fields of the same name , except the sequence number here is a 16 bit number thats allowed to wrap around just before overflow .
The acknowledgment field is 32 bit wide , like it is in TCP .
As the conversation progresses the sequence number is incremented both client and proxy recording the last received sequence number acknowledge by the remote peer .
The acknowledgment timeout time used in ptunnel is 1500 milliseconds and after that time has elapsed without acknowledgment the packet is resent .
The length field is the number of bytes contained in the data field when the state field represents data forwarding ( state = 1 ) , and 0 otherwise .
This is also a 32 bit wide field .
The reserved field is just for padding and is 16 bits wide .
The data field is exactly the same as the TCP data field and contains the actual data the be transported by TCP once the packet is received at the proxy .
For illustrated purposes , here is a diagram of the entire packet to be included within IP .
0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+ |
Type | Code | Checksum | +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Identifier | Sequence Number | +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+ | Magic Number | +---------------------------------------------------------------+
| IP | +---------------------------------------------------------------+ |
Port |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+ | State |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Acknowledgment Number | +---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Length |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+ | Sequence Number | Reserved | +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+ | Data ... |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
As you can see the ptunnel protocol adds a lot of extra data to simple ICMP packets .
Ping tunnel also has some neat mechanisms for controlling multiple connections using the identifier field discussed earlier .
It also emulated TCP transmission " windows " where the two hosts take turns in sending data .
See the TCP RFC for more information about TCP transmission windows .
The authentication mechanism is simple and effective by sending a challenge for which the client should take the md5 hash of the password , appending to the challenge , and Finally taking another md5 hash of that .
The proxy when match up this simple authentication and will respond accordingly .
The light at the end
When using PingTunnel you will probably have to expect a bit of latency due to all the extra data going around , not to mention that you 're having to go through a proxy to get out onto the Internet !
I do wonder if two sequence numbers are absolutely necessary , but hey , it 's only 2 bytes wide anyway .
PingTunnel is an awesome utility and well worth having around , it could do with some development .
I 'm tempted to request to join the project because I want to work on building a proxy - like interface to the program , such that you set a program , such as a web browser to use a SOCKS or HTTP proxy on localhost at the user - defined port number .
This will overcome the program with web browsers and allow regular HTTP traffic to function perfectly .
Another idea and expansion I 'd love to bring to the project would be a TCP wrapper shell , such that once within the wrapper all TCP traffic is automatically caught and redirected through the tunnel on the fly , this is a big project and will lead to the possibility of simply being able to start up the system in the TCP wrapper shell and have the full Internet experience without even having to move a finger or mess about changing tunnel destinations and so forth .

HAVE we hastened the demise of the universe by looking at it ?
That 's the startling question posed by a pair of physicists , who suggest that we may have accidentally nudged the universe closer to its death by observing dark energy , which is thought to be speeding up cosmic expansion .
Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio , and colleague James Dent suggest that by making this observation in 1998 we may have caused the universe to revert to a state similar to early in its history , when it was more likely to end .
" Incredible as it seems , our detection of the dark energy may have reduced the life - expectancy of the universe , " says Krauss .
The researchers came to their conclusion by calculating how the energy state of our universe might have evolved .
Until recently , cosmologists thought that the big bang 13.7 billion years ago occurred after a bubble of weird high - energy " false vacuum " with repulsive gravity decayed into a zero-energy " ordinary " vacuum .
The energy released during this transition could have made matter and heated it to a ferocious temperature , which essentially created the massive explosion of the big bang .
The discovery of dark energy - and the realisation that the universe 's expansion is accelerating - reveals that the vacuum may not have decayed to zero energy , but to another false vacuum state .
In other words , some energy was retained in this vacuum , and this is accelerating the universe 's expansion .
Like the decay of a radioactive atom , such shifts in energy state happen at random .
" So it is entirely possible it could decay again , wiping the slate of our universe clean , " says Krauss .
If this transition did happen , everything in our universe would cease to exist .
The fact that we are still here means this can't have happened yet .
But cosmologists have long puzzled over why this should be , particularly as the probability of the false vacuum of our universe having survived decreases exponentially over time .
Building on a discovery made in the 1950s , Krauss 's calculations show that if the universe did happen to hold out past a certain threshold , its chance of staying stable are substantially increased .
In 1958 , Russian physicist L. Khalfin discovered that after an extremely long time , the probability of a quantum system having survived stops falling exponentially and switches to a slower rate of decline .
This means that if the false vacuum of the universe survives to the switching point between the two rates , it will effectively become eternal .
This is because the false vacuum is known to grow exponentially fast , and past the switching point it will be created faster than it can be eaten away by any decay , he says .
According to Krauss , the smaller the energy gap between the false vacuum and zero , the earlier the switching point between the two rates .
And - surprise , surprise - we live in a universe where the vacuum energy is just above zero , so we could be well past the crucial switching point .
At first glance , this seems like good news for us because it would mean our universe is on track to survive forever .
However , things may not be as good as they seem , Krauss says .
At the quantum level , whenever we observe or measure something , we reset its clock and stop it decaying - something known as the quantum Zeno effect .
Our measurement of the light from supernovae in 1998 , which provided evidence of dark energy , may have reset the false vacuum 's decay clock to zero - back to a point when the likelihood of its surviving was falling exponentially over time .
" In short , we may have snatched away the possibility of long - term survival for our universe and made it more likely it will decay , " says Krauss .
Krauss 's claim is controversial .
Max Tegmark of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology maintains that the quantum Zeno effect does not require humans to make observations of light .
" Galaxies have ' observed ' the dark energy long before we evolved , " he says , as they were affected by it and were encoding information about it .
" When we humans in turn observe the light from these galaxies , it changes nothing except our own knowledge . "

On Tuesday 's Countdown , Keith Olbermann talked with Newsweek 's Richard Wolffe about President Bush 's failed foreign policy and his awkward cameo appearance at today 's Middle East Peace Summit in Annapolis , Maryland .
Looking confused and distracted , the president butchered the names of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas * shock * and even needed guidance on where to stand with the two leaders for a photo op -- which was apparently the only reason he attended at all .
After all the hype and spin about how much President Bush cares about bringing peace to the Middle East , and how he 's worked the phones and listened in preparation , our Commander in Chief took off after spending less than three hours at the summit .
The Seminal has five questions about the Annapolis summit .
Biden : I do n't trust the Justice Department to investigate itself over destroyed CIA interrogation tapes Nick Langewis and David Edwards

This " I do n't have confidence in the President , I do n't have confidence in the Vice President , and I do n't have confidence in the Justice Department .
That 's as simple as I can put it . "
Senator , Foreign Relations Committee chairman and 2008 presidential hopeful Joseph Biden ( D - DE ) says to CNN 's Wolf Blitzer that special counsel is needed to oversee the investigation into the destruction of 2002 CIA interrogation tapes to avoid a conflict of interest .
The Bush Administration has said that , while they were ordered to safeguard evidence of torture and abuse of detainees at Guantanamo Bay , the recordings in question did n't fall under the rule , as the interrogations in question were performed at secret CIA prisons before the two suspects were transported to Guantanamo .
The very people that are accused of destroying the tapes should not be trusted to oversee themselves , says Biden .
He rejects the argument that independent counsel would compromise whatever internal investigation the Bush Administration , especially an Attorney General who refuses to clarify his position on the widely criticized interrogation practice known as " waterboarding , " is planning , as head of a heavily scandalized and politicized Justice Department .
The Senate Judiciary Committee has already been stonewalled by Attorney General Mukasey on the matter .
" This calls for a -- totally independent forum , which the law calls for , to find out what happened here , " says Biden , " because there are criminal charges that are likely to flow . "
No one knows how high up the chain the investigation could go , says the Senator .
Video of the exchange , as broadcast on CNN's Late Edition on December 16 , 2007 , is available to view below .
A pair of sociologists have produced a piece of research in which they claim that graduate engineers are statistically over - represented among jihadi terrorists .
They go on to suggest that engineers have a " terrorist mindset " making them likelier to turn jihadi than other kinds of people .
The lead author of the study is Diego Gambetta , professor of sociology at some kind of further - learning institution located in the picturesque old marmalade - making town of Oxford .
Gambetta , who describes himself ( Word doc ) as " more hedgehog than fox " , was assisted by Steffen Hertog of Durham University .
According to the two academics :
We find that graduates from subjects such as science , engineering , and medicine are strongly overrepresented among Islamist movements in the Muslim world , though not among the extremist Islamic groups which have emerged in Western countries more recently .
We also find that engineers alone are strongly over - represented among graduates in violent groups in both realms .
This is all the more puzzling for engineers are virtually absent from left - wing violent extremists and only present rather than over - represented among right - wing extremists .
This assertion based on some very fuzzy numbers indeed .
We compiled a list of 404 members of violent Islamist groups drawing from a variety of sources ...
Our sources include ... the press , governmental and nongovernmental organisations and websites ...
We searched in Lexis Nexis ... and in Google .
We also searched ...
Fox News ; CTV News ; Dutch News ...
The duo also cite Wikipedia .
( Honest , they really do - note 4 , page 4 . )
Based on this rigorous trawl , they decide that 196 of the 404 jihadis had " engaged in higher education at some point " .
Within the 196 possibly - educated terrorists , the two surfer - sociologists identify the subject of study in 178 cases .
The degree that came " first by far " among the 178 graduate jihadis , according to Gambetta and Hertog , was engineering - with 78 of their sample group supposedly so qualified .
They speculate that the type of mindset who tends to become an engineer - apparently , conservative and religious are two of the markers - will also tend to become involved in Islamic terrorism .
In fact , the pair have had to push their little data set quite hard to get that many into the " engineering " box .
The sociologists ' definition of engineering includes architects ( as distinct from civil engineers ) , all " computer related studies " , town planning , " other " ( which includes " rare subjects " ) and 36 terrorists where the type of " engineering " studied was unknown .
If you strike out all the architects , computer - studies guys and other random inclusions among the 42 cases where the precise subject is known , and apply the same ratio to the other 36 , you come out with just 44 real engineers among the 178 jihadi graduates .
That still leaves engineers 29 per cent more numerous than the next biggest of the sociologists ' arbitrarily - defined groups , the " Islamic Studies " grads .
However , the groups are pretty random .
If you rearranged them a bit , it would be easy to create one bigger than the engineers .
For instance , if one were to define a group consisting of literary , history , social services , philosophy , media , education , business , architecture , psychology and town - planning graduates - call it the " fuzzy studies " group , chuck in the sociologists too - it would come out at least 50 strong , probably outnumbering the engineers and hard sciences groups put together .
You could then conclude that there 's just something about students too idle to do much work at university which makes them turn into terrorists , or into sociologists perhaps .
But you 'd feel pretty silly making wild conclusions like that based on data as ropey as this .

Psychologists at Harvard University using neuroimaging say they have resolved the century - old debate over the existence of Extra - Sensory Perception ( ESP ) - and it does n't exist .
The research was led by Samuel Moulton , a graduate student in the department of psychology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University with Stephen Kosslyn , John Lindsley Professor of Psychology at Harvard and was published in the Jan. 2008 issue of the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience .
The scientists used brain scanning to test whether individuals have knowledge that cannot be explained through normal perceptual processing .
" If any ESP processes exist , then participants ' brains should respond differently to ESP and non-ESP stimuli , " explains Moulton .
“ Instead , results showed that participants ’ brains responded identically to ESP and non-ESP stimuli , despite reacting strongly to differences in how emotional the stimuli were and showing subtle , stimulus - related effects . ”
Nearly half of the adults in the United States believe in the existence of ESP , which includes telepathy ( direct knowledge of another person 's thoughts ) , clairvoyance ( direct knowledge of remote events ) , and precognition ( direct knowledge of the future ) .
People commonly report unexplained knowledge of a loved one 's death or a telephone caller 's identity , for example , and attribute this knowledge to paranormal mental processing .
The U.S. government lent credence to such claims when it revealed that it had spent millions of dollars recruiting and training psychic spies during the Cold War .
Furthermore , research studies have been reported that appear to support the existence of ESP , including an influential series of experiments analyzed by psychologist Daryl Bem of Cornell University .
These studies , however , gave little insight into the mechanisms -- normal or paranormal -- that produced the anomalous results .
Perhaps more telling , others failed to replicate these results .
To develop a better test of ESP , the authors decided to develop a new method , which directly addressed the presumed source of ESP : namely , the brain .
They argue that because the brain enables perception and stores information -- even events people do n't consciously perceive or information they can't consciously remember -- it can offer a much more comprehensive test for ESP than self - report or behavior .
" The brain shows a suppressed response to stimuli that a person has seen before , even when those stimuli were presented subliminally , so the person was n't consciously aware of having seen them ; furthermore , it shows an enhanced response to stimuli that a person is expecting , " says Moulton .
" Because knowledge and expectation bias brain activation , neuroimaging offers us a uniquely powerful test of subtle perceptual or cognitive processes . "
To study whether or not ESP exists , Moulton and Kosslyn presented participants with two types of visual stimuli : ESP stimuli and non-ESP stimuli .
These two types of stimuli were identical with one exception : ESP stimuli were not only presented visually , but also were presented telepathically , clairvoyantly , and precognitively to participants .
To present stimuli telepathically , the researchers showed the photographs to the participants ' identical twin , relative , romantic partner , or friend , who was seated in another room .
To present stimuli clairvoyantly , the researchers displayed the photographs on a distant computer screen .
And to present stimuli precognitively , the researchers showed participants the photographs again in the future .
Does this conclusively prove that ESP does not exist " " No , " says Moulton .
" You can not affirm the null hypothesis .
But at the same time , some null results are stronger than others .
This is the best evidence to date against the existence of ESP .
Perhaps most important , this study offers scientists a new way to study ESP that avoids the pitfalls of past approaches . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Workers who are legally prescribed marijuana to treat illness can still be fired from their jobs , following a ruling Thursday from the California Supreme Court .
Medical marijuana user Angel Raich , 41 , had her pot confiscated while her case was appealed .
The 5 - 2 decision upheld the job termination of Gary Ross , who flunked a company drug test shortly after being hired at a telecommunications firm .
A state referendum that allows people to use medical marijuana with a physician 's recommendation are immune from some state criminal drug possession charges .
But the state high court said such legal protection only goes so far .
" Nothing in the text or history of the Compassionate Use Act suggests the voters intended the measure to address the respective rights and duties of employers and employees , " wrote Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar .
" Under California law , an employer may require pre-employment drug tests , and take illegal drug use into consideration in making employment decisions . "
The court agreed with RagingWire Telecommunications ' contention it had a right to fire Ross because any marijuana use is illegal under separate U.S. law .
The company said its work across state borders could put it in legal jeopardy from federal labor standards involving the conduct and production of its work force .
The U.S. Supreme Court has said the Bush administration can prohibit the backyard cultivation of pot for personal use , because such use has broader social and financial implications .
A federal appeals court last March said medical marijuana users can be subject to arrest and confiscation of the material , under federal anti-drug laws .
The issue is being closely watched because of the obvious conflict between state and federal laws over the use of medical marijuana .
Various courts have said the federal Controlled Substances
Act does not violate state autonomy .
The latest case involves Ross ' back problems stemming from injuries sustained when he served in the U.S. Air Force .
He received a physician 's recommendation to use pot in 1999 and presented a card certifying his use of the narcotic when he took the employment drug test in 2001 .
Ross said his condition does " not affect his ability to do the essential functions of the job " his former employer hired him to do , according to his original complaint .
The Sacramento - based company said its no -tolerance policy applies to all workers , since potential " abuse of drugs and alcohol " could lead to " increased absenteeism , diminished productivity , greater health costs , increased safety problems , and potential liability to third parties , " according to the company 's lawyers .
Ross ' job performance was not at issue in the case .
The state supreme court said the law allowing use of marijuana for some patients is " modest " in scope , limiting the rights of some patients .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2005 for the Bush administration giving it broad authority to crack down on illegal drug use was criticized by patient rights groups and the movement to legalize marijuana .
" Congress ' power to regulate purely activities that are part of an economic ' class of activities ' that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce is firmly established , " wrote Justice John Paul Stevens .
Under federal law , the Controlled Substances
Act prevents the cultivation and possession of marijuana , even by people who claim personal " medicinal " use .
The federal government has argued its overall anti-drug campaign would be undermined even by limited patient exceptions .
That high court case involved a separate lawsuit from a pot patient from Oakland , California , who has a variety of medical conditions , including a brain tumor .
Angel Raich had her pot confiscated and was not allowed to use it while her case was appealed .
The Drug Enforcement Administration began raids in 2001 against patients using the drug and their caregivers in California .
Along with California , 11 other states have passed laws permitting marijuana use by patients with a doctor 's approval : Alaska , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington .
Arizona also has a similar law , but no formal program in place to administer prescription marijuana .
California 's Compassionate Use
Act permits patients with a doctor 's approval to grow , smoke or acquire the drug for " medical needs . "
Users include television host Montel Williams , who has multiple sclerosis .

Muhammad Uproar Swedish Cartoonist Goes into Hiding
Swedish artist Lars Vilks is taking no chances .
After a cartoon he drew of the Prophet Muhammad was published , the cartoonist received death threats and has temporarily gone into hiding under police protection .
Note :
This is not a review of the film .
To read Josh 's review of Sicko here .
Long time readers of this site no doubt know that I live in Texas .
As everyone knows there ’s no more conservative state in the Union than here .
And I do n’t just live in Texas ; I live in the Dallas / Fort Worth metroplex .
Dallas is n’t some pocket of hippy - dippy behavior .
This is n’t Austin .
Dallas is the sort of place where guys in cowboy hats still drive around in giant SUV ’s with “ W ” stickers on the back windshield , global warming and Iraq be damned .
It ’s probably the only spot left in America where you stand a good chance of getting the crap kicked out of you for badmouthing the president .
So when I went to seefor a second time this afternoon , I was n’t sure what to expect from the audience .
I was n’t watching it downtown , where the city ’s few elitist liberals congregate and drink expensive lattes .
I went to a random mall in the mid-cities , where folks were likely to be just folks .
As I sat down , right behind me entered an obligatory , cowboy hat wearing redneck in his 50s .
He announced his presence by shouting across the theater in a thick Texas drawl to his already seated wife “ you owe me fer seein this ! ” started ; the stereotypical Texas guy sat down behind me and never stopped talking .
He talked through the entire movie… and I listened .
The first ten to twenty minutes of the film he spent badmouthing Moore to his wife and snorting in disgust whenever MM went into one of his trademark monologues .
But as the movie wore on his protestations became quieter , less enthusiastic .
Somewhere along the way , maybe at the half way point , right before my ears , changed this man ’s mind .
By the forty - five minute mark , he , along with the rest of the audience were breaking into spontaneous applause .
He stopped pooh - poohing the movie and started shouting out “ hell yeah ! ” at the screen .
It was as if the whole world had been flipped upside down .
This is Texas , where people support the president and voting democratic is something only done by the terrorists .
Michael Moore should be public enemy number one .
By the time the movie was over , public enemy number one had become George Washington , Abraham Lincoln , and John F. Kennedy all rolled together .
When the credits rolled the audience filed out and into the bathrooms .
At the urinals , my redneck friend could n’t stop talking about the film , and I kept listening .
He struck up a conversation with a random black man in his 40s standing next to him , and soon everyone was peeing and talking about just how fucked everything is .
I kept my distance , as we all finished and exited at the same time .
Outside the restroom doors … the theater was in chaos .
The entireaudience had somehow formed an impromptu town hall meeting in front of the ladies room .
I ’ve never seen anything like it .
This is Texas goddammit , not France or some liberal college campus .
But here these people were , complete strangers fromwalk of life talking excitedly about the movie .
It was as if they simply could n’t go home without doing something drastic about what they ’d just seen .
My redneck compadre and his new friend found their wives at the center of the group , while I lingered in the background waiting for my spouse to emerge .
The talk gradually centered around a core of 10 or 12 strangers in a cluster while the rest of us stood around them listening intently to this thing that seemed to be happening out of nowhere .
The black gentleman engaged by my redneck in the restroom shouted for everyone ’s attention .
The conversation stopped instantly as all eyes in this group of 30 or 40 people were now on him .
“ If we just see this and do nothing about it , ” he said , “ then what ’s the point ?
Something has to change . ”
There was silence , then the redneck ’s wife started calling for email addresses .
Suddenly everyone was scribbling down everyone else ’s email , promising to get together and do something … though no one seemed to know quite what .
It was as if I ’d just stepped into the world ’s most bizarre protest rally , except instead of hippies the group was comprised of men and women of every age , skin color , income , and walk of life coming together on something that had shaken them deeply , and to the core .
In all my thirty years on this earth , I have neverseen any movie have this kind of unifying effect on people .
It was like I was standing there , at the birth of a new political movement .
Even after 9/11 , there was never a reaction like this , at least not in Texas .
Iftruly has this sort of power , then Michael Moore has done something beyond amazing .
If it can change people , affect people like this in the conservative hotbed of Texas , thenis n’t just a great movie , seeing it may be one of the most important things you do all year .

Uh , yes , I am familiar with Smalltalk .
I ’m thinking that my opinion of my ability to make a joke far exceeds my actual ability : the phrase is meant as a pun on Edgar Rice Burroughs ’s Barsoomian Tales , featuring the Warlord John Carter .
But all that being said , regardless of how OO you want to get , I am not convinced that objects are responsible for every operation that can possibly be performed on them .
Expression - oriented programming ( also known as functional or side - effect - free programming , although the three things are related , not synonymous ) is a wonderful way to make calculations easier to understand and maintain .
However , sometimes deeply nested function calls or mixing function calls with method invocations can make an expression difficult to understand at a glance .
Here is a tip for refactoring your expressions so they are easier to read .
Expressions naturally form a tree , with values at the leaves and function calls or method invocations at each node .
In this post , I ’ll be talking about the simplest form of expression , a pipeline .
A pipeline is an expression that does not branch : a value ( or often collection of values ) is transformed by two or more function calls or method invocations in succession .
Here ’s a slightly obfuscated example of a pipeline working with collections from one of our Rails applications :
While the details do n’t make much sense out of context , the overall pattern ought to be familiar as an example of the MapReduce pattern ( without the distributed processing , of course ) .
Pipelines read from right - to - left , left - to - right , or both .
For example , this set of three nested function calls reads from right - to - left :
If I try to read it from left - to - right , it ’s sounds like a caricature of speech : “ The sum of the squares of the odd numbers from one to one hundred . ”
You ca n’t figure it out unless you build an abstract syntax tree in your head and then evaluate it with a stack machine .
Having to emulate a computer to figure out what something means is not a good sign .
it reads much easier from right - to - left : “ Take the numbers from one to one hundred .
Select the odd ones .
Square them .
And finally , take the sum .
” Popular languages like Ruby make it easy to write expressions that read from left - to - right directly : here ’s an example from Ruby 1.9 ( or with Symbol# to_proc ) :
Object orientation ’s emphasis on nouns at the expense of verbs has its issues .
But when a computation really is a step - wise transformation of data , I find that chaining methods makes code a lot easier to understand than nesting functions .
On the other hand , I prefer nesting functions when the expression has more of a tree form .
But whichever direction you prefer , I find it very difficult to read code that mixes directions in the same expression :
You go left - to - right to select odd members , then back left to square them , then right to sum them .
I find this much more confusing than either the nested functions or the chained method calls .
A little while ago , I saw John Carter define factorial in Ruby as a method in the Integer class :
My first reaction was to think that adding factorial as a method was an idea from another planet why should integers know how to answer their own factorials ?
This seemed like a classic case of a function that should not be an object method .
But nevertheless , having calculations be methods instead of functions lets you write a certain type of expression consistently from left - to - right ( ) instead of mixing directions ( ) .
All the same , there are good reasons why we do n’t overload numeric classes with every possible calculation and formula .
So what can we do ?
How about : Now , snarfing Charles Duan ’s code , we can write :
Which lets us write : I read this as “ Start with five , get its successor , put that into the factorial proc , take the result ’s successor , and answer whether it is odd . ”
The whole thing reads in one consistent style , you are n’t mixing left - to - right method chaining with right - to - left nesting functions .
I would n’t go crazy with Object # into in a program , but if you have an expression that is predominately chaining methods , Object # into can make it consistent and improve its readability .
There is more than one way to skin a cat .
Ifis too constricting , we can compose functions instead of nesting them .
So we can write : This allows us to write , which puts almost everything in left - to - right order .
Hey , remember Object #into ?
Why do n’t we try it ?
That saves us from writingif we find three instances of “ into ” a little noisy .
Composing functions usinglets us maintain right - to - left order and composing functions withlets us create left - to - right order when we are making a “ pipeline ” of expressions .
In the end , this is a very trivial idea :
When an expression can be written so that it reads consistently from left - to - right or consistently from right - to - left , do so .
The code will be easier to read .
Part 1 | Part 2
Regular expressions are very useful .
If you have to deal with text at all , you will find them indispensable .
In programming , they can be used to verify user input ( e.g check an email is valid ) , sanitize input ( make sure the user only used allowed characters ) , remove sections of the string ( remove all non-alpha - numeric characters ) .
And not just for programming !
You can use regular expressions in many text editors to edit the current file .
You can use them in the grep command to find very specific lines , or in the sed " stream editor " to edit out bits of a file ..
As you can tell from the previous paragraph , they are very versatile .
Most implementations are more or less compatible with the Perl regex syntax , so this is what the guide is about
Ohno , scary line - noise
Regular Expressions ( regex for short ) are really very simple ..
They may look horrendous , but they are essentially variations of the following :
[ set of characters ] {number of characters to match}
For example , [ a - z ] {2 } will match two letters , from a-z .
In the previous [ a - z ] is the characters to look for , { 2} is how many characters to match .
.. that 's it !
Regular expressions have a really basic syntax , they just look like the result of someone kicking their keyboard for a while .
Matching letters
Character sets
Now , lets say you would to match more than just a -z .
Maybe upper case , numbers , and a question - mark ..
Easy :
[ a - zA - Z0 - 9 ? ] {
2}
You can add different ranges or characters to the [ ] character - class .
But .. say you want to match the ] symbol too !
If you have any experience programming , you could probably guess - you escape the symbol with a backslash :
[ a - z ] {2}
The symbols you will almost always have to escape ( as they have other meanings in regexs ) are : . + * [ ] ( ) ^ $ and possibly a space .
Strings
Something I should defiantly point out - you do n't have to use character classes to match letters - you can match a normal string of letters very easily :
some thing [ !]
{ 1,5}
That will match " some thing " followed by one to five exclamation marks .
Just remember to escape anything like [ ] * etc
Shortcuts
Instead of typing every possible range of letters and symbols , the decimal - point can refer to " any single character " .
For example , to match any 5 characters :
. {5}
There are also other " shortcuts " you can use inside [ ] sets , such as :
A is the same as [ a - zA - Z ]
is the same as [ a - zA - Z ]
S will match white - space ( spaces and tabs )
will match white - space ( spaces and tabs ) w matches alpha-numeric ( a - zA - Z0 - 9 plus underscore )
matches alpha-numeric ( a - zA - Z0 - 9 plus underscore ) Upper - case W matches non-word characters ( opposite of above )
matches non-word characters ( opposite of above ) d matches numbers
matches numbers D matches non-numbers
There are plenty more , but those are the most useful I find .
To see the complete list , the best place is probably the Perl Regex doc-page , as many languages implement " Perl - compatible regex " ( PHP , Ruby and Python all do )
These can be combined into character classes .
Say you want to match spaces and tabs , and question marks :
[ S? ] {1,10}
You just shove them in with the other characters and ranges .
I generally find I use the dot " any characters " , and character classes most often .
Number of characters
Now I 've covered character sets ( the things enclosed in [ ] , remember ? ) , the next important bit is the number of characters to match .
For these examples , I will just match lower - case a-z .
There are a few different wildcard matchers , mainly ?
* and +
? matches one or zero characters .
The ?
quantifier is often useful for matching a " optional character " , like a trailing slash , or a trailing " s " :
some thing [s ] ?
That will match both " some thing " and " some things "
And the two most useful :
To match one or more of a symbol :
[ a - z ] +
And match zero or more :
[ a-z ] *
Say I wanted to match any exclamation marks in a string , and if any are found , remove them :
[ ! ]*
You would use your languages Regex substitute function to replace any matches with " "
But , say I want to check if the user has used any exclamation marks in their post , and if it matches , we yell at them to not :
[ ! ] +
Unlike using * , it wo n't match if there are no !s
Groups
Groups are very very useful for extracting bits of a string .
Basically you enclose a section of the regex in brackets .
Then , depending on how the language deals with them , you can get the contents of these groups as variables .
Say I have a string " Viewing : | Some title| " .
I want to grab the title , without the " Viewing : || " bit :
Viewing : |( [a -zA - Z ] * ) |
I just wrote that , and already it 's hard for me to read ..
But I know it will work !
Regular expressions are far easier to write than they are to read ..
But , basically I typed in the string " Viewing : " , escaping the two |'s
Viewing : ||
next , I matched zero or more [ a - zA - Z ] , inside the two | symbols .
Viewing : | [ a - zA - Z ]* |
And finally , so I can grab the title , I put the [ a - zA - Z ]* inside a group
Viewing : | ( [ a - zA - Z ]* ) |
( Note : Spaces added to improve readability , if you want to have spaces in the regex , your best bet is to escape them using backslashes )
That 's about it
Using the above ( if you can make sense of it ) , you can do a lot with regular expressions .

HOW TO TALK TO A SCIENTOLOGIST How to talk to a Scientologist Essay Copyright 2003 , Michael Leonard Tilse , All rights reserved .

2 August 2003 Copyright 2003 , Michael Leonard Tilse HOW TO TALK TO A SCIENTOLOGIST .
I think people are interested in why a Scientologist stays one and why some leave , so I thought I would talk to you about it .
I was a Scientologist for 27 years .
I gave them over two hundred thousand dollars of my own money .
In fact , until earlier this year I still considered myself a Scientologist .
There is a lot of information that Scientology is destructive .
Scientology has had to pay out millions of dollars to people they have harmed .
Yet , as you may know , it is almost impossible to talk about these things with a dedicated Scientologist .
I hope to give you some clues .
You might wonder how I decided to leave .
After all , my parents tried to talk me out of it .
My sister tried to talk me out of it .
My friends tried to talk me out of it .
None succeeded .
I would n’t listen to anyone who tried to dissuade me from Scientology .
I kept myself from reading critical news articles or viewing television shows .
I never read critical books .
I thought it was all lies anyway .
I would have defended Scientology to the death .
So there are a few things you do n’t want to do when taking to a Scientologist .
Do n’t talk to them about the weird stuff .
Most Scientologists do n’t know about it and are trained in the idea that finding out about it too soon will kill them .
So just leave that entirely alone .
It may freak you out and you may want to share it , but they will think it is a personal attack .
Do n’t tell them it is not a religion .
A Scientologist will instantly tune you out the moment you say that .
After all they have subjective experience that is to them completely spiritual and religious in nature .
To assert it is n’t is to be calling them a liar and denying their own experience .
Scientologists invest a lot of their life and almost all their money in pursuit of the Scientology total freedom .
I want you to understand that .
Take myself as an example .
Almost all my friends were Scientologists .
Almost all my money went to Scientology .
Up to 20 hours a week were spent at the church studying or getting counseling , even when I had a full time job .
My whole life centered around Scientology and I was n’t even a staff member .
For a staff member it becomes all consuming .
I felt that Scientology had saved my life .
That I would otherwise have destroyed myself with drugs or suicide .
I felt I had experienced personal insight into the nature of my own being through Scientology .
It explained everything to me .
To tell me it is n’t a religion runs counter to my belief , but more importantly , it runs counter to my investment .
If it is not a religion , then what did I do with my two hundred thousand dollars and my 27 years of association and all those hours of study and counseling ?
I would have to admit that waste and I ’m not going to do that just because you state , " It ’s not a religion . "
Do n’t tell them Hubbard was a con-man and a fraud and a bigamist and that almost nothing he said about himself was true .
A Scientologist can’t believe that because he has been told that such statements are all lies .
That the documents that show these things are fabrications by a shadowy conspiracy to destroy L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology and thus deny people the total freedom Scientology offers .
You ’re in a he - said she - said situation .
In fact , without careful research you might be presenting false information that the church has put on the ‘ net just so they can show their members how false it all is .
So a Scientologist will be sure you are now a tool of the conspiracy , out to destroy Scientology .
And they will not listen .
Do n’t tell them Scientology does n’t work .
For a Scientologist , it does work .
They know it .
They will be able to point out one or many times where they had a success or it helped them through something or they felt better about themselves .
They may have past life memories that convince them of their spiritual nature .
They can have experienced wonderful things .
In fact , I still feel that some things in Scientology help .
It is one of the hardest things to get over and understand and I am still coping with it .
Because a lot of the writing that Hubbard did appeals to one ’s better nature , to the idea of helping people , of attaining one ’s dreams .
It is very seductive and if you have any success at it , you will attribute it to Scientology .
But I ’ve been doing some research .
And one book is a book called " Hypnotism " written by G.H. Estabrooks in 1943 .
In chapter three he says : " There is a rule in Hypnotism that everything we get in a trance can also be obtained by means of the posthypnotic suggestion .
Also that anything we find in either can be found in autosuggestion ... "
So I am coming to believe that almost everything that occurs in Scientology that a Scientologist experiences and believes in comes about as the self - suggested result of a kind of auto - hypnosis .
Everything that seems to work or be positive is attributed to Scientology , and everything negative is assigned to personal failure or lack of understanding of Scientology .
After which there is a long bout of study to correct the matter , which again is a kind of auto - hypnosis .
And any outside challenge to that carefully maintained trance will result in greater and greater resistance .
So how Do you talk to a Scientologist ?
First , you have to care .
You have to care for them .
Regardless of what you think about what they believe or do , you have to care .
Throw out any bigotry or intolerance you might have and be a caring person .
Listen to them .
Assure them you only want good things for them .
Give them a safe place to visit or come to .
Many times Scientologists wo n’t leave the church even though they want to , if they have no safe place or people of unconditional trust to go to .
It is a huge personal event to leave Scientology .
You have to somehow come to the decision you were wrong and all that money and time and investment is lost .
You have to be willing to lose your friends , maybe even a husband or wife or children .
Few people can do that when others are telling them they were wrong .
And really , what a person has hypnotized himself into can only be undone by himself .
Tell them that if they want to come and see you , just call and you ’ll pay their way .
Do n’t say " leave the church " , say " come and see me . "
If they call , send them an airplane ticket or go pick them up .
And when they show up on your door step , do n’t be surprised , be supportive .
Do n’t eagerly use their leaving to present them with stacks of information critical of Scientology .
You can ask them about it , but they have a lot to think about .
It can take some time .
Give them space .
Let them ask for information or let them use the internet to find out for themselves .
If they want to talk , get them talking about it .
Have them tell you their experiences , good and bad .
Talking helps , especially when the person listening is nonjudgmental .
It is the internal conflicts I experienced within Scientology that broke the spell for me .
So if I were now talking to a Scientologist , I would talk to them about these things :
Get them to explain about the powers of an operating thetan , the higher levels in Scientology .
And then ask them if they knew of people on those levels getting sick or getting cancer or dying or just leaving the church .
Get them to think how the reality they observe differs from what is promised .
Even for people who have been in Scientology for years .
Tell them you are confused ; if these magnificent powers existed , how then could critics of the church continue to write or even to exist ?
Could n’t a top level Scientologist just wish them away ?
Get them to describe the ideals of Scientology ethics and justice and how Scientologists are supposed to be honest and straightforward .
Find out if they know any Scientologists who wo n’t pay back loans , who have trouble with paying their rent , who have done a lot of Scientology but still seem shady or involved in schemes .
If they have been around awhile , they will know some or will have heard of many such things .
Get them to explain " having to have before you can do " and have them tell you about what Scientologists are told they need to do to before management releases the next " O.T. " levels .
Then wonder , if it is so important that these levels be done to ensure the hope of the future , why are there things that have to be done first ?
Find out if they experienced the misapplication of Scientology justice themselves .
Get them to talk about it .
Find out what they think about Hubbard ’s writings being revised over 15 years after his death .
Does it make sense to them ?
See if they will talk about their feelings that it is " just them " having trouble , but that Scientology really is good .
It is very common for people to go for decades wondering privately why they are not getting the promised gains from Scientology while outwardly defending it to the death .
These kinds of questions and getting them to think about what they experienced and observed as compared to what they are taught and led to believe are a key to breaking the kind of spell they are under .
So , I think that you should talk with a Scientologist completely nonjudgmentally .
Get them to talk about what they have observed themselves in fellow Scientologists , organizations , management and activities as compared to what they are given to believe from Hubbard ’s writings and the promises of management .
This way you open the door far enough that they will begin to read and compare the stories and experiences of ex-Scientologists with their own .
Once that happens , you can help them .
But do n’t push it on them .
And then by reading actual documents such as Hubbard ’s death certificate and the coroner ’s report and toxic screen , the depositions in court testimony , police reports in the Lisa McPherson case , etc. , they can begin to form a picture of what they were prevented from knowing .
And choose .
So how do you talk to a Scientologist ?
With care and understanding .
They found a reason to be in it .
Give them the space and time and resources to find a reason to be out of it .

Hmmm ...
I did n't mean it as a cheap shot ; I think the majority of that
article is quite relevant today .
The fact that a bunch of new stuff
has been tacked on to TCL , and that more efficient implementations
exist , cannot cure fundamental flaws in the language .
You do n't make
an octopus by nailing extra legs onto a dog .
TCL 's author readily admits the language is flawed , " Some of the
flaws , like the lack of a compiler and the lack of module support ,
will get fixed over time .
Others , like the substitution - oriented
parser , are inherent in the language .
Is it possible to design a
language that keeps TCL 's advantages , such as simplicity , easy glue ,
and easy embedding , but eliminates some of its disadvantages ? "
The
answer to this last question is a resounding YES !!
It has been done
many times over since Ousterhout wrote those words .
Without even getting into TCL 's technical issues , lets look at the
flaming hoops TCL makes you jump through for even simple operations :
proc fib {n} {
if {$n < 2} {
return 1
}
return [ expr {[ fib [ expr { $ n - 2} ] ] + [ fib [ expr { $ n - 1} ] ] } ]
}
The expression in that second return statement is just absurd .
And
this example is * trivial * .
What happens when the task at hand becomes
more complicated ?
Obfuscated C does n't look so bad anymore .
And it
* does * get more complicated ; one of Stallman 's primary points is that
regardless of your intentions , the scripting language * will * be asked
to do more than you originally planned .
Here 's Lua , Ruby and Python versions of the same code :
function fib ( n )
if n < 2 then
return 1
end
return fib( n - 2 ) + fib ( n - 1 )
end
def fib(n ) :
if ( n < 2 ) :
return (1 )
return ( fib ( n - 2 ) + fib ( n - 1 ) )
def fib(n )
if n < 2 then
1
end
fib ( n - 2 ) + fib( n - 1 )
end
Neat , clean , and to the point .
I recommended Lua because it happens to
have a small implementation and is fast .
Unfortunately for me , I 'm stuck with TCL .
I 'm work on a network test
tool .
The primary author chose TCL as the scripting language because
( a ) other network test tools use it , so the testers were likely to
already know it , and ( b ) TCL was only to be used for configuration and
very light scripting , with all the heavy lifting done in C ++.
It
did n't work out that way .
We now have a large parts of our regression
suite written in TCL .
Some of it is horrendous ( through no fault of
the testers ) .
Stallman 's words could not have been more true .
IMO , TCL is perpetuated by the momentum of its large user - base , and
not by the technical merits of the language .
So why continue to foist
TCL on unsuspecting newcomers , especially when better alternatives
exists ?
It 's a dirty trick , and people will only resent you for it
later . ;)
Cheers ,
Eric

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The banking industry is proposing to members of the U.S. Congress and the White House that some of the risk of troubled mortgages should be shifted to the federal government , according to a report in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday .
One proposal has been advanced by officials at Credit Suisse Group CSGN.VX and would let the U.S. Federal Housing Administration guarantee mortgage refinancings by some delinquent borrowers , said the report .
The Credit Suisse plan would open the way for nearly 600,000 sub prime borrowers , many of whom are delinquent on their mortgages , to refinance into loans backed by the FHA , said the Journal , which cited a Credit Suisse spokeswoman .
The Journal said officials from JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM.N are also pulling together their own proposal to expand the number of homeowners who could refinance into FHA - backed loans .
Spokespeople for Credit Suisse and JPMorgan were not immediately available .

WASHINGTON ( Hollywood Reporter ) -
The nation ’s top TV regulator said it would be difficult for the Federal Communications Commission to take action against ABC stations that aired “ Good Morning America ” on Tuesday when actress Diane Keaton used the f-word .
Diane Keaton arrives to attends the premiere of the film " Mad Money " in Los Angeles January 9 , 2008 .

Last year ’s court decision that threw out the FCC ’s policy on “ fleeting references ” complicates any action the commission might want to take against the stations or the network , chairman Kevin Martin told reporters .
When asked whether the FCC would take action , Martin appeared flummoxed by the court ’s decision and the most recent incident of celebrity potty mouth .
“ Obviously the commission ’s pending litigation has impacted a whole host of issues , but I do n’t know enough about the details of this to see how it would be impacted , ” he said .
On “ Good Morning America ” to promote her new film “ Mad Money , ” Keaton told host Diane Sawyer that she admired her beauty , especially Sawyer ’s lips , saying that if she had lips like that she would n’t have had to work on her “ f - -- ing personality ” and would be married by now .
After she spoke the word , Keaton made an offhand apology , and Sawyer warned that her mother was going to wash her mouth out with soap .
ABC News senior vp Jeffrey Schneider said the network bleeped the word for the Central , Mountain and Pacific time zone feeds and regretted the incident .
“ It was obviously unfortunate , and we were quick to correct it for subsequent feeds , ” he said .
Last year , a federal appeals court in New York threw out the FCC ’s rule that said a fleeting reference gets broadcasters a fine for indecency .
In its decision , the court told the commission that it failed to give a good reason for its decision and likely could n’t find a good reason if it had to .
The Bush administration is appealing the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court , and Congress has also taken action .
Briefs are due in the appeal next month .
In June , the Senate Commerce Committee agreed on the Protecting Children From Indecent Programming Act , which overturns the court decision .
Under the rule the court rejected in June , the FCC decided that language used by Cher and Nicole Richie during the Billboard Music Awards was indecent and profane .
During the 2002 show , Cher told the audience , “ People have been telling me I ’m on the way out every year .
So f--- ‘em . ”
In 2003 , Richie said : “ Have you ever tried to get cow s--t out of a Prada purse ?
It ’s not so f--- ing simple . ”
While the commission found that the shows violated the broadcast indecency rules , it did n’t issue a fine because the shows predated a policy established in 2004 after U2 frontman Bono said that winning a Golden Globe was “ really , really f--- ing brilliant . ”
In the Bono decision , the FCC changed its definition of “ fleeting ” use , deciding that a certain word can be so vile that it runs afoul of the nation ’s indecency laws .
The court ’s decision appeared to undo the Bono decision , which has been sitting at the commission on review for some time .
“ The commission ’s order makes passing reference to other reasons that purportedly support its change in policy , none of which we find sufficient , ” the court wrote .
Under current law and commission policy , broadcasters can be fined up to $ 325,000 per indecent incident for each station .

If , that is , you 're a Republican .
Atrios points us to an Associated Press article reporting that " U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded al - Qaida has rebuilt its operating capability to a level not seen since just before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks . "
Brendan Nyhan points out that later in the same piece , this damning indictment of George W. Bush 's policies is described as something that " could bolster the president 's hand at a moment when support on Capitol Hill for the war is eroding and the administration is struggling to defend its decision for a military buildup in Iraq . "
I mean , look , anything 's possible especially if the press is going to pre-emptively report the news in an up - is - down manner without need for aggressive administration spinning , but the intuitive thing to say here is that it 's likely to weaken Bush 's hand and strengthen the hand of those arguing that the country needs new policies .
The point of the report , after all , is that just as war - skeptics have been saying , while the Bush administration 's been chasing its own turds in circles in Iraq , al - Qaeda 's been rebuilding its capacities in the Pakistan - Afghanistan border area and parts of Europe .

The team behind the Storm Worm certainly does n't miss any excuse to shovel their malware into the tubes .
Both Christmas and New Year 's saw the appearance of new appropriately themed Storm variants , and it appears the little darling is on its way with a Valentine message as well .
As reported by the SANS Internet Storm Center , a new variant of the worm has begun to arrive .
At the moment , the attack seems lazy , as the infected e-mails simply contain a Valentine 's Day subject with only an IP address in the body .
Once clicked , end users are sent to a web site that displays a heart and a message that " Your download should begin shortly . "
Those of you whose downloads might not begin shortly as advertised , are advised that clicking " here " and choosing " run " will begin the infection process launch the download .
Storm 's basic social engineering attack remains the same , and the 2008 Valentine 's Day version apparently uses many of the same subject headers it deployed in 2007 .
The simplicity of the attack and the total absence of any related content at the IP address provided may also help limit the infection rate , assuming that end - users have learned anything about basic virus prevention .
Please note , however , that Ars does not recommend holding your breath and waiting to see if this is actually true .
The attack methodology may be similar to past Storm variations , but the creators of the worm have managed to package it differently enough to fool most current virus scanners .
The SANS Internet Storm Center reports that only four out of 32 virus scanners were able to properly identify the downloaded file as Storm - infected prior to actual execution .
The author does not mention how many AV products picked up Storm 's presence once the file was executed , but the fact that the worm managed to penetrate the system 's first line of defense points to the ongoing danger worm variants can cause .
We 've previously covered the difficulty AV vendors face when attempting to stay ahead of the constantly growing flood of variant worms ;
Storm may have popularized such attacks , but it certainly wo n't be the last virus to exploit them .
The best defense against Storm in this case may be that Valentine 's Day is a hard holiday to phish .
Christmas , after all , is typically the season where people get in touch with other people they have n't spoken to in months .
Valentine 's Day , on the other hand , is typically celebrated between a couple who typically know each others ' name .
It 's not too hard to realize an e-mail is fraudulent if you 're dating a Jacqui and you get an e-mail from Elle , or ... Peter .
Of course , at this rate , Storm may very well pop in to watch the Super Bowl as well .
Be on the lookout for the party crasher that randomly shows up , eats all the food , and rummages through the address books of the various other real people attending your party .
SHANNON , Ireland , Nov 2 ( Reuters ) - U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Friday defended her decision to force U.S. diplomats to serve in Iraq and said they had an obligation to take on such difficult assignments .
Many diplomats are incensed following a U.S. State Department decision last week to identify " prime candidates " who may have to accept compulsory one - year tours in Iraq or risk losing their jobs .
In her first public comments on the staffing directive , Rice conceded it was a " sensitive issue " but said people must serve where they were needed and Iraq was a priority .
" In a sense , the fact that so many people have volunteered and have served , I would hope others would think about their obligation not only to the country but to those who have already served to make sure that these difficult assignments are shared across the service , " Rice told reporters traveling with her to Turkey where she will attend a conference on Iraq .
More than 200 diplomats have been told they are in a pool of people who may be forced to go to Iraq to fill 48 positions for which no qualified candidates have volunteered .
At an emotional meeting at the State Department on Wednesday , diplomats complained about the enforced assignments and questioned why they read about the move via news reports rather than heard from Rice herself .
One diplomat said it was a " potential death sentence " to serve in Baghdad .
Mortar rounds frequently land in the heavily fortified " Green Zone " where the U.S. embassy is located .
" I am very sorry that the recounting of the comments of a few people left the impression that somehow the Foreign Service does n't want to serve in Iraq , " said Rice before a refuelling stop in Ireland .
" It could n't be further from the truth and on behalf of those who are serving , I want to say how much their service is appreciated , " she added .
More than 1,500 U.S. diplomats -- out of a total of about 11,500 -- have served in Iraq , some of them doing several tours since the U.S. invasion in March 2003 .
" People are serving and they are serving very , very well and they are serving with great bravery , " said Rice .
Rice sent a cable herself late on Thursday urging staff to go to Iraq and she said there had been several volunteers since the staffing decision was made last week .
" I do n't know if we will have to direct assignments or not .
We are one Foreign Service and people need to serve where they are needed . "
Many U.S. diplomats are reluctant to accept postings in Iraq because of the dangers of working in a war zone and the fact that they are separated for lengthy periods from their families who are not allowed on such hardship missions .
The top U.S. diplomat said everything possible was being done to protect diplomats , including providing fortified facilities and air cover where needed .
" We are doing everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats but this is the one of the highest priority tasks for the United States and we are going to meet our obligations , " she said .
Readius Cell Phone 5 - Inch Fold Out Display
The Readius cell phone with a 5 - inch foldable display is now in production .
I 've written extensively about the basic technology ( see Readius Rollable Display Starts Mass Production - with videos and Polymer Vision Readius With Merely Foldable Display to learn more about the display ) and soon you will be able to buy it in a cell phone .
The new device will function as a triband phone with a high - speed mobile wireless connection .
It uses the HSDPA ( High Speed Downlink Packet Access ) 3G ( third - generation ) service favored by European , Asian and some U.S. operators .
The Readius cell phone with a foldable screen weighs 115 grams and measures 115 millimeters by 57 mm by 21 mm when closed .
In the Readius cell phone you will find a slot for Micro - SDHC ( Secure Digital High Capacity ) memory cards up to 8G bytes in capacity .
According to Philips , the battery will allow up to 30 hours of continuous reading .
The Readius cell phone will run the Windows CE operating system with a custom user interface ; it can use the OMA 1.0 DRM ( digital rights management ) to prevent copying of content .
Otherwise the platform is open , and uses PDF , HTML and ASCII files .
Fans of Gene Roddenberry 's Earth : Final Conflict will certainly be pleased - gang , your phone is ready .
( Earth : Final Conflict )
Fans of science fiction writer William Gibson will also be impressed ; in his 1986 novel Count Zero , Gibson wrote about an amazing cell phone with a screen that unfolded like a butterfly 's wings :
He took an elegant modular unit from the bag and placed it in front of her .
A paper thin polycarbon screen unfurled silently from the top of the unit and immediately grew rigid .
She had once watched a butterfly emerge into the world , and seen the transformation of its drying wings .
' How is that done ? ' she asked , tentatively touching the screen . "
( Read more about Gibson 's polycarbon phone screen . )
See also the Readius cell phone with the display closed .
You might also have fun with the idea of an eScroll - style display , which is also possible with this technology .

He really is priceless .
Other world leaders see the Pope with their advisers and the Vatican 's peerlessly punctilious protocol experts , making sure they do not commit the slightest gaffe .
But George W. Bush can outwit them all .
On the plane to Rome , he was already struggling .
The Pope is addressed as ' Your Holiness ' .
Roman Catholics refer to him as ' The Holy Father ' .
But somewhere in the tumble dryer that is the part of the US President 's brain set aside for words , the two concepts got tangled and he told Associated Press : ' I think His Holy Father will be pleased to know that much of our foreign policy is based on the admonition to whom much is given , much is required . '
No doubt Pope Benedict , whom Bush later described as ' very smart ' , was able to deconstruct the rest of the sentence .
But before he got down to cases with Bush , the Bishop of Rome , Vicar of Jesus Christ , Successor of the Prince of the Apostles and Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church had the unusual experience of being called ' sir ' .
' It 's good to be with you , sir , ' said Bush as he sat down .
But it was just one of those days for George W. Even the car broke down .
His visit to Rome had been preceded by the biggest security operation this bodyguard 's nightmare of a city had ever seen .
The Tiber was dragged .
The sewers were searched .
Squares were cleared and roofs occupied .
Yesterday the presidential cavalcade hurtled along its route preceded by a swarm of more than a dozen motorcycles , scooters and even motorised three - wheelers carrying tough - looking armed police riding pillion .
But when it got to Largo Poli , near the Trevi fountain , Bush 's car ground to a halt .
It remained perilously immobile for a minute and half .
The President and Laura Bush were hustled into another car .
That was denied by a White House official , who said the reasons for the breakdown were ' unclear ' .
Just as unclear was how the wide presidential limo could get through the gates of the US embassy .
It could n't .
The presidential couple had to walk in .
' But this is how we do things in Italy , ' cried a delighted onlooker .
At least Bush could take heart from the G8 summit in what , in talking to the German - born Pope , he termed ' your old country ' .
He described it as ' successful ... good ' .
Not everyone saw it that way .
Some felt Bush had been spectacularly wrong - footed .
Russia 's President , Vladimir Putin , suggested that , if America 's anti-missile shield was really to protect Europe from Iran and not Russia , the US could use Russian - controlled radar .
The Pope mischievously asked Bush if his talks with Putin had also been good .
Glancing at the reporters who were about to be ushered from the room , the President replied : ' Ummm ... I 'll tell you in a minute . '
