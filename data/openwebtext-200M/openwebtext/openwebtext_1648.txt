Food Not Bombs in going to need some help this next Sunday June 8th .
Food
Not Bombs has served free healthy vegetarian food to hungry people at Market
Square for the last 15 years , but this past Sunday we got kicked out by the
Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership .
We found out that the Pittsburgh Downtown
Partnership has secured permits to use Market Square almost every day until
December , and they do not want us there .
This past Sunday they called in
police to force us out of the area .
Their rationale is that they are trying
to " economically revitalize " Market Square and that hungry people scare off
the rich people .
They also stated that the homeless people do not contribute
to a safe and comfortable atmosphere for the new demographic they are trying
to attract .
We at FNB believe that we should have the right to serve free healthy meals
to hungry people in centrally located public spaces .
We will not accept the
attempts by the PDP to hide and ignore the basic needs of the least
fortunate Pittsburghers .

The Obama Administration has formally abandoned its public calls for an international probe of the Israeli attack on a Gaza - bound aid ship , insisting that reports that they were still in favor of it were false .
“ We support an Israeli led investigation and we are open to potential ways in which the international community can participate in that , ” insisted Philip Crowley , State Department spokesman .
11 days ago when the world was still reeling from the attack on the civilian aid ship , President Obama had made vague calls to reserve judgement until an international probe into the killings could take place .
By this week , he was already making it clear that he was going to make sure that such a probe would not question the Israeli killings at all , but would instead focus on digging up dirt about the aid workers .
Even that led to Israeli condemnations , and privately the Obama Administration is said to have made deals to support only whatever internal probe Israel deigns to hold , though there remains internal opposition in Israel even to probing the killings themselves .
The “ international probe , ” just 11 days ago an excuse to avoid criticizing the killings in even the vaguest of terms , has at this point become inconvenient to the official Israeli narrative that the attack on the aid ship and the subsequent killings were actually a laudable act , and that the aid workers themselves , and the Turkish government which has complained so loudly about the killings , are the real villains .
The narrative does not stand up to even basic scrutiny , of course , which is why even the neutered international probe , designed to demonize the aid workers and avoid even cursory examination of the attack itself , has become inconvenient .

Soon after Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess , liberal House Democrats and teachers unions will make one last push to pass a $ 23 billion fund to prevent teacher layoffs .
Democrats are looking to package the fund with war and disaster spending in a supplemental appropriations bill the House will vote on as early as this week .
ADVERTISEMENT
The House approved the teacher fund in December as part of a jobs bill , but that legislation stalled in the Senate .
With lawmakers wary of moving big spending measures , the upcoming bill may be the last vehicle that could carry the teacher money before the November elections .
Democrats in the House pushing for the fiscal aid warn that up to 300,000 teachers could lose their jobs because the $ 44.5 billion in fiscal aid in the 2009 stimulus bill is running out .
" At the same time , states are still facing bleak budgetary outlooks and may very well have to cut funding for education in order to balance budgets , " Democratic Reps. Maurice Hinchey ( N.Y. ) , Phil Hare ( Ill. ) and Bob Etheridge ( N.C. ) wrote in a letter .
" If Congress does not pass additional funding for education jobs soon , many of the jobs that have been supported by [ the stimulus ] will be lost . "
The letter was signed by 104 other House Democrats , the American Federation of Teachers and National Education Association unions , and other public education groups .
The teacher fund has gotten public backing from Education Secretary Arne Duncan Arne Starkey DuncanThe Hill 's 12:30 Report : White House , Dems debate coronavirus relief package

The measure is likely to run into resistance from Democratic freshman and fiscally conservative Blue Dogs , both of whom face tough reelection races this fall .
House Appropriations Chairman David Obey ( D - Wis. ) is including the teacher money in an $ 86 billion package that also has $ 37.5 billion for the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and related State Department operations ; $ 13.4 billion for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange ; $ 5.7 billion for Pell Grants for college students ; $ 2.8 billion for Haiti aid ; $ 677 million for increased security at the Mexican border ; and $ 275 million for aid for the Gulf Coast oil spill .
Most of the money is n't offset and would increase the deficit because it 's considered emergency spending .

MORE ( Va. ) , a freshman Democrat , said Congress will be more mindful of additional deficit spending than they were when the recession was in full swing .
" Moving forward , what worked a year ago is not going to work now , " Connolly said .
" There is going to be a fiscal standard that is frankly much more rigorous than it was a year ago , and , by the way , correctly so .
A year ago we were still struggling to get out of the recession .
Today we are now managing a recovery and trying to sustain it . "
This year 's budget shortfall is expected to be about $ 1.5 trillion , which would be a record in terms of nominal dollars .
Deficits would average almost $ 1 trillion for the next decade , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
Just before the recess , freshmen lawmakers and Blue Dogs blanched at voting for a nearly $ 200 billion measure that would have extended expiring jobless benefits and business tax provisions because it would have added more than $ 130 billion to the deficit .
House leaders found enough votes for the package only after lopping off about $ 50 billion in spending .
" I would think that a lot of members would like to see these priorities paid for , " a Blue Dog aide said .

Introduction to Gautama the Buddha
Siddartha Gautama ( 563-480 BC ) was born as a prince in a small state in northern India in what is now Nepal .
According to legend , several soothsayers predicted that if he stayed home he would become a universal king , but if he left he would become a Buddha .
His mother died after one week , and Siddartha was brought up by her sister .
His father surrounded him with every luxury .
At the age of 16 Siddartha married Yasodhara , his cousin of the same age , and spent his time in the pleasure gardens of the palace .
When Gautama was 29 he saw the four signs which led to his renunciation of the world --- first , an old person , then a sick person , then a corpse being carried to a funeral , and finally a begging monk in a yellow robe .
Gautama began to contemplate the meaning of life with its inevitable decay , suffering , and death ; like the monk he too must find a solution to these problems .
Therefore he decided to renounce everything , and he left the palace immediately after the birth of his first son .
For a while he sought enlightenment by mortifying the flesh ; fasting and eating only one seed a day , he became so thin that his bones stuck out .
Weak from hunger , he fainted and almost died .
Then he decided that this was not the way to enlightenment .
He began to beg for food and concentrated on meditation .
When he gave up the austerities , his five companions in spiritual aspiration left him in disgust .
One day when he was 35 he sat under a banyan tree with the resolve not to get up until he was enlightened .
Perceiving that Siddartha wanted to pass beyond his control , the tempter Mara and his armies attacked him in various ways , but each time Gautama concentrated on the ten perfections ( charity , morality , renunciation , wisdom , effort , patience , truth , determination , universal love , and equanimity ) and received divine protection .
Mara tried to persuade him to give up his struggle and live .
However , Gautama identified the ten armies of Mara as follows : lust , dislike for the spiritual , hunger and thirst , craving , laziness , cowardice , doubt , inflexibility , glamour , and finally exalting oneself while despising others .
Gautama said that by conquering these one could attain bliss and that he would rather die than be defeated .
Mara retired , and Gautama went into deeper meditation , realizing his former lifetimes , becoming clairvoyant , and intuiting the psychological insights that became his principal teachings .
At first people did not know what to call him and asked him if he was a god , a devil , an angel , a person or what .
Gautama replied simply , " I am awake . "
Thus he became known as the Buddha , which means the awakened one or the enlightened one .
The first sermon included here are the words of the Buddha when he spoke in the deer park at Benares as recorded in the SAMYUTTA - NIKAYA V:420 , one of the collections of the SUTTA PITAKA , the largest of the " three baskets " of early Buddhist texts .
Hearing this brief discourse , the five previous companions , who were at first skeptical of Buddha 's new claims , were convinced and became the first five " perfected ones " in his order .
The order of monks or disciples grew , and soon the Buddha was sending out 60 of them in different directions to spread the teachings .
The Buddha fulfilled his promise to return to talk with King Bimbisara after his enlightenment , and he was converted also .
Although his father , King Suddhodana , did not like the idea of the Buddha begging for food , he accepted it ; many of his relatives became followers also .
Some of the wealthy built monasteries for the order .
Ananda , the Buddha 's cousin and closest disciple , pleaded that women be allowed to join the order , and finally the order of nuns was established .
Another cousin , Devadatta , wanted to become the Buddha 's successor ; but when he was rejected , he tried three times to kill Gautama but failed .
Then Devadatta tried to split the order .
However , two of the greatest disciples , Sariputta and Moggallana , were able to persuade those who had followed him to return to the Buddha .
Devadatta became ill ; but as he was dying , the Buddha forgave him .
When he was about 80 years old , the Buddha became seriously ill himself but felt that he should not die until he had prepared the order for his departure .
Thus he fought off the illness .
Ananda asked for instructions , but the Buddha said that he had not presented " the closed fist of the teacher . "
In other words , he had not held back any of the teachings .
Not even Sariputta nor Moggallana were to be his successor ; rather everything was to be decided by majority vote .
He suggested that they take refuge in the teachings , but they might abolish minor rules if they wished .
Finally the Buddha instructed a friend named Cunda to prepare him a meal , which was either pork or mushrooms trodden by pigs ; the leftovers were to be buried , and the other monks were to be given something else .
Soon after eating this meal , the Buddha became very sick with violent pains .
The Buddha declared that Cunda was to be honored as equal to the one who had given him the last meal before his enlightenment .
Finally he asked the monks three times if they had any questions , but none of them spoke .
Then the Buddha said his last words , " Transient are all conditioned things .
Work out your salvation with diligence . "
The body of Gautama was cremated a week later , and an argument over the relics of the Buddha was settled peacefully by dividing them into eight portions .

The Buddha 's First Sermon
English version by Sanderson Beck
These two extremes , monks , are not to be practiced
by one who has gone forth from the world .
What are the two ?
That joined with the passions and luxury ---
low , vulgar , common , ignoble , and useless ,
and that joined with self - torture ---
painful , ignoble , and useless .
Avoiding these two extremes the one who has thus come
has gained the enlightenment of the middle path ,
which produces insight and knowledge ,
and leads to peace , wisdom , enlightenment , and nirvana .
And what , monks , is the middle path , by which
the one who has thus come has gained enlightenment ,
which produces knowledge and insight ,
and leads to peace , wisdom , enlightenment , and nirvana ?
This is the noble eightfold way , namely ,
correct understanding , correct intention ,
correct speech , correct action , correct livelihood ,
correct attention , correct concentration ,
and correct meditation .
This , monks , is the middle path , by which
the one who has thus come has gained enlightenment ,
which produces insight and knowledge ,
and leads to peace , wisdom , enlightenment , and nirvana .
Now this , monks , is the noble truth of pain :
birth is painful ; old age is painful ;
sickness is painful ; death is painful ;
sorrow , lamentation , dejection , and despair are painful .
Contact with unpleasant things is painful ;
not getting what one wishes is painful .
In short the five groups of grasping are painful .
Now this , monks , is the noble truth of the cause of pain :
the craving , which leads to rebirth ,
combined with pleasure and lust ,
finding pleasure here and there ,
namely the craving for passion ,
the craving for existence ,
and the craving for non-existence .
Now this , monks , is the noble truth
of the cessation of pain :
the cessation without a remainder of craving ,
the abandonment , forsaking , release , and non-attachment .
Now this , monks , is the noble truth
of the way that leads to the cessation of pain :
this is the noble eightfold way , namely ,
correct understanding , correct intention ,
correct speech , correct action , correct livelihood ,
correct attention , correct concentration ,
and correct meditation .
" This is the noble truth of pain " :
Thus , monks , among doctrines unheard before ,
in me insight , wisdom , knowledge , and light arose .
" This noble truth of pain must be comprehended . "
Thus , monks , among doctrines unheard before ,
in me insight , wisdom , knowledge , and light arose .
" It has been comprehended . "
Thus , monks , among doctrines unheard before ,
in me insight , wisdom , knowledge , and light arose .
" This is the noble truth of the cause of pain " :
Thus , monks , among doctrines unheard before ,
in me insight , wisdom , knowledge , and light arose .
" The cause of pain must be abandoned . "
Thus , monks , among doctrines unheard before ,
in me insight , wisdom , knowledge , and light arose .
" It has been abandoned . "
Thus , monks , among doctrines unheard before ,
in me insight , wisdom , knowledge , and light arose .
" This is the noble truth of the cessation of pain " :
Thus , monks , among doctrines unheard before ,
in me insight , wisdom , knowledge , and light arose .
" The cessation of pain must be realized . "
Thus , monks , among doctrines unheard before ,
in me insight , wisdom , knowledge , and light arose .
" It has been realized . "
Thus , monks , among doctrines unheard before ,
in me insight , wisdom , knowledge , and light arose .
" This is the noble truth
of the way that leads to the cessation of pain " :
Thus , monks , among doctrines unheard before ,
in me insight , wisdom , knowledge , and light arose .
" The way must be practiced . "
Thus , monks , among doctrines unheard before ,
in me insight , wisdom , knowledge , and light arose .
" It has been practiced . "
Thus , monks , among doctrines unheard before ,
in me insight , wisdom , knowledge , and light arose .
As long as in these four noble truths
my due knowledge and insight
with the three sections and twelve divisions
was not well purified , even so long , monks ,
in the world with its gods , Mara , Brahma ,
its beings with ascetics , priests , gods , and men ,
I had not attained the highest complete enlightenment .
This I recognized .
And when , monks , in these four noble truths
my due knowledge and insight
with its three sections and twelve divisions
was well purified , then monks ,
in the world with its gods , Mara , Brahma ,
its beings with ascetics , priests , gods , and men ,
I had attained the highest complete enlightenment .
This I recognized .
Knowledge arose in me ;
insight arose that the release of my mind is unshakable :
this is my last existence ;
now there is no rebirth .

“ We negotiate the past while you navigate the future , ” read a caption on its Web site , next to a photo of a young woman nose - kissing an adorable boy .
“ The American Dream .
It was never about bailouts or foreclosures .
It was always about American values like hard work , ingenuity and looking out for your neighbor . ”
When Ms. Robertson called , a customer service representative laid out a plan .
Every month , Ms. Robertson would send $ 427.93 into a new account .
Three years later , she would be debt - free .
The representative told her the company would take $ 100 a month as an administrative fee , she recalled .
His tone was take - charge .
“ You talk about a rush - through , ” Ms. Robertson said .
“ I did n’t even get to read the contract .
It was all done .
I had to sign it on the computer while he was on the phone .
Then he called me back in 10 minutes to say it was done .
He made me feel like this was the answer to my problems and I was n’t going to have to face bankruptcy . ”
Ms. Robertson made nine payments , according to Financial Freedom .
Late last year , a sheriff ’s deputy arrived at her door with court papers :
One of her creditors , Capital One , had filed suit to collect roughly $ 5,000 .
Panicked , she called Financial Freedom to seek guidance .
“ They said , ‘ Oh , we do n’t have any control over that , and you do n’t have enough money in your account for us to settle with them , ’ ” she recalled .
Her account held only $ 1,470 , the representative explained , though she had by then deposited more than $ 3,700 .
Financial Freedom had taken the rest for its administrative fees , the company confirmed .
Financial Freedom later negotiated for her to make $ 100 monthly payments toward satisfying her debt to the creditor , but Ms. Robertson rejected that arrangement , no longer trusting the company .
She demanded her money back .

Hubble Finds a Star Eating a Planet

The hottest known planet in the Milky Way galaxy may also be its shortest - lived world .
The doomed planet is being eaten by its parent star , according to observations made by a new instrument on NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope , the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph ( COS ) .
The planet may only have another 10 million years left before it is completely devoured .
The planet , called WASP - 12 b , is so close to its sunlike star that it is superheated to nearly 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit and stretched into a football shape by enormous tidal forces .
The atmosphere has ballooned to nearly three times Jupiter 's radius and is spilling material onto the star .
The planet is 40 percent more massive than Jupiter .
This effect of matter exchange between two stellar objects is commonly seen in close binary star systems , but this is the first time it has been seen so clearly for a planet .
"
We see a huge cloud of material around the planet , which is escaping and will be captured by the star .
We have identified chemical elements never before seen on planets outside our own solar system , " says team leader Carole Haswell of The Open University in Great Britain .
Haswell and her science team 's results were published in the May 10 , 2010 issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
A theoretical paper published in the science journal Nature last February by Shu-lin Li of the Department of Astronomy at the Peking University , Beijing , first predicted that the planet 's surface would be distorted by the star 's gravity , and that gravitational tidal forces make the interior so hot that it greatly expands the planet 's outer atmosphere .
Now Hubble has confirmed this prediction .
WASP - 12 is a yellow dwarf star located approximately 600 light - years away in the winter constellation Auriga .
The exoplanet was discovered by the United Kingdom 's Wide Area Search for Planets ( WASP ) in 2008 .
The automated survey looks for the periodic dimming of stars from planets passing in front of them , an effect called transiting .
The hot planet is so close to the star it completes an orbit in 1.1 days .
The unprecedented ultraviolet ( UV ) sensitivity of COS enabled measurements of the dimming of the parent star 's light as the planet passed in front of the star .
These UV spectral observations showed that absorption lines from aluminum , tin , manganese , among other elements , became more pronounced as the planet transited the star , meaning that these elements exist in the planet 's atmosphere as well as the star's .
The fact the COS could detect these features on a planet offers strong evidence that the planet 's atmosphere is greatly extended because it is so hot .
The UV spectroscopy was also used to calculate a light curve to precisely show just how much of the star 's light is blocked out during transit .
The depth of the light curve allowed the COS team to accurately calculate the planet 's radius .
They found that the UV - absorbing exosphere is much more extended than that of a normal planet that is 1.4 times Jupiter 's mass .
It is so extended that the planet 's radius exceeds its Roche lobe , the gravitational boundary beyond which material would be lost forever from the planet 's atmosphere .
Galaxies traveling at million miles - per - hour speeds appear headed on one a one - way track toward the constellation Hydra , astronomers report Thursday , a " dark flow " baffling to cosmologists .
Since 1998 , astronomers have known that galaxies throughout the cosmos appear to be expanding away from one another in all directions at an accelerating rate , ascribed to a " dark energy " cosmological force that counteracted gravity 's attraction .
But in the Astrophysical Journal , a team led by Alexander Kashlinsky at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , report a group of galaxy clusters as far as 2.5 billion light years away ( one light year is about 5.9 trillion miles ) appear headed for Hydra , aimed in one particular direction , posing a puzzle that can't be explained by dark energy .
" " This is not something we set out to find , but we cannot make it go away , " Kashlinsky said , in a NASA statement .
" Now we see that it persists to much greater distances , " after initially detecting the " dark flow " in 2008 .
To make that determination , the study team looked at the motion of galaxies against the " cosmic microwave background " , a pervasive , unmoving , heat signature left over from 380,000 years after the Big Bang some 13.7 billion years ago , which has been mapped since 2001 by NASA 's WMAP probe .
The stars and galaxies seen by astronomers around the one - way clusters are n't heavy enough to gravitationally pull them and explain the dark flow .
" Its existence suggests that some structure beyond the visible universe -- outside our ' horizon ' -- is pulling on matter in our vicinity , " says the statement .
The clusters appear to be zooming along on one particular line aimed at Hydra , Kashlinsky said , but " right now our data cannot state as strongly as we'd like whether the clusters are coming or going , " to or from Earth .

Major update ( 5/20 ) : Kudos to Apple : they did it right this time .
In response to this situation , and the outcry it caused , Apple has both changed the no-cash policy described below and provided an iPad to the woman in the story .
This is the Apple we want to see .
-- David
You know that elitist image we 've all come to tolerate from Apple ?
The one where Apple products are generally upscale , luxury goods ?
The one where if you 're not stylish enough , svelte enough , or hip enough , Apple products are n't for you ?
Turns out it 's true .
KGO -TV in San Francisco is running an outrageous story about how an Apple Store in Palo Alto turned away a disabled woman who wanted to buy an iPad .
Her crime ?
She wanted to pay in cash .
Like tens of millions of Americans , she does n't have a credit card .
Although most members of mainstream society do n't realize it , not having plastic is n't necessarily a bad thing .
It 's hard to go further in debt when you can't charge everything .
According to KGO , a disabled woman named Diane Campbell saved up for months , simply wanting to buy an iPad so she could go online .
Once Ms. Campbell had finally saved up enough , she took her savings to the Palo Alto Apple store , with all her money in her backpack .
She brought the iPad up to the counter and presented her money -- and was turned away .
Apple turned away a disabled woman who wanted to use American legal tender to buy an iPad
According to KGO , who contacted Apple for comment , Apple turned her away because their policy is to only sell to people who have a credit or debit card .
There are business reasons why this might make sense -- for example billing for iTunes crap -- but it 's completely unacceptable as a corporate policy .
This is where Apple has gone too far .
Steve Jobs might have a bug up his butt about protecting Americans from porn , but apparently he could n't care less about disadvantaged Americans .
Apple 's policy of not accepting cash is a direct slap in the face to hardworking Americans -- and to our American way of life .
United States legal tender is just that -- legal tender .
For a major technology company to refuse payment by cash in a retail location is elitist in the worst sense of the word .
It 's also un-American .
Apple thinks it can set a standard for morality .
Apple thinks it can tell us what we can and can't read .
Apple thinks it can tell us what programs we can and can't run .
Apple is dangerous .
And , as we saw in the case of Diane Campbell , Apple is becoming an out - of - control , discriminatory monster .
We can not allow Apple to continue this sort of behavior .
This time , the company has gone too far .

I had no idea there were so many .
Where was I , while the oil companies were busy drilling and spilling ?
Ms Maddow does our country a great service by reminding us how negligent Big Corporations have become since deregulation has been used so frequently in a " you scratch my back and I 'll scratch yours . "
While the politicians and the corporate world are busy scratching for scratch ...
Earth , our one and only home , takes all kinds of abuse so these scratchers can continue to make as much money as possible without little regard for us or our home , the planet Earth .

The coalition government has agreed to introduce fixed term parliaments - and with it , a new power for MPs to vote to dissolve Parliament .
But it has been branded a " fix " aimed at keeping the Conservatives in power by opponents .
What is the row about ?
It boils down to an argument about the way the new coalition government wants to bring in fixed term parliaments - and the mechanism it wants to introduce to allow Parliament to dissolve itself before the full five - year term is up .
So - the government is making it harder for MPs to dissolve parliament ?
No. Currently MPs have no power to dissolve parliament .
That is a matter for the prime minister , who asks the Queen to do so and can currently do so at any time of his or her choosing within a five - year term .
New plans for fixed term parliaments will actually give MPs extra powers in that , if 55 % of them back it , they will be able to dissolve Parliament .
So why the concern ?
There seems to be a lot of confusion about what the government is planning - with even constitutional experts at odds over whether it amounts to a big change .
Currently MPs can win a vote of no confidence - which you would usually expect to trigger an election if the government loses .
That only requires a simple majority of MPs to back it - so 50 % , plus one .
But that will remain the same under the new plans , says the government .
What is the difference then ?
Well , if the new rules are introduced we will have fixed term parliaments - so elections would be called on a pre-set date every five years , rather than at any point during the five - year cycle of the government 's choosing .
Under the new arrangement , it appears that should a government lose a no - confidence vote , it would not trigger an election .
Instead the government could try to form a new majority government .
However , under the current system , losing a confidence vote would not automatically trigger a general election either - it is still ultimately up to the PM to dissolve Parliament .
It all sounds rather confusing .
It is - people on both sides of the argument have accused the other of misunderstanding the new rules .
This is perhaps because the rules , as such , are as yet only outlined briefly in the coalition deal drawn up between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats .
Describing legislation to bring in fixed - term parliaments , the document says it " will also provide for dissolution if 55 % or more of the House votes in favour " .
David Cameron has said the details will be debated in the Commons .
So , who 's against it ?
Labour heavyweights Jack Straw , Lord Adonis , David Blunkett and Lord Falconer have been scathing in their criticism .
Mr Straw said it amounted to a " fix " and was " completely undemocratic and totally unworkable " .
Mr Blunkett said it was " nothing less than a stitch - up by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats to overturn historic precedents for their own advantage " .
Lord Falconer warned of a " zombie government " if ministers were defeated on a vote of confidence , but there was insufficient support for a dissolution .
Conservative MP Christopher Chope said it was " unsustainable " and could be a " recipe for anarchy " if the government lost its majority .
Backbench colleague Charles Walker said it was a threat to the " primacy of Parliament " .
And constitutional expert Prof Peter Hennessy said it looked like " very iffy politics " and created a " very poor impression for the new politics . "
Are they right ?
Former Lib Dem MP
David Howarth , a legal academic who drew up the original Lib Dem plans for a fixed - term parliament , said the confidence vote and dissolution vote were totally different things and critics had got " entirely the wrong end of the stick " .
He said , in other countries with fixed term parliaments , if a government lost a vote of confidence the parties would have to try to work out a new government within the fixed term .
Professor Robert Hazell , director of the Constitution Unit think tank , told the BBC all fixed - term parliaments had to have a " safety valve " to allow an early dissolution if necessary .
He said , as he understood it , the 55 % threshold was intended to prevent the government from calling an early election without the consent of both coalition partners - not to prevent an opposition move for a no -confidence motion .
" It 's not some constitutional monstrosity .. we already do this in Scotland . "
If First Minister Alex Salmond lost a confidence motion , he would resign - and that would happen in Westminster , he said .
What does the government say ?
It says it wants " strong and stable government " with a " lasting coalition " .
A spokesman said fixed terms were a new idea for the UK Parliament , but were " perfectly normal around the world and require a mechanism for dissolution " .
He said in Scotland , two thirds of MSPs had to back dissolution - something created under the previous Labour government .
He added : " The mechanism for a no confidence vote in the Government is unchanged but what our proposals would do is give Parliament a new power to dissolve itself , a power currently only exercised by the prime minister . "
MPs and peers will ultimately agree the proposals .
Why have a 55 % threshold at all ?
There has been some suggestion it was put in to stop either the Tories or the Lib Dems walking out on the coalition halfway through when their poll ratings pick up .
But some argue it is not high enough as theoretically the Lib Dems and Conservatives could whip their MPs - who together reach just over 56 % - to support a dissolution motion and subvert their own fixed - term parliament plan .
What happens in other countries with fixed - term parliaments ?
Both the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly have fixed terms with a " safety valve " - if at least 66 % of MSPs or AMs vote for dissolution - or if they do not nominate someone to be first minister - they are dissolved and an election triggered .
In Germany , dissolution in mid-term is allowed only in cases of serious deadlock - if the Bundestag does not support the chancellor on a motion of no confidence and does not to elect a successor within 21 days - it is designed to stop an administration deliberately engineering a no- confidence vote , as has happened twice .

" They could sting , but they were pretty quiet because they were following the queen bee , which was trying to get in , " he said .
The queen had disappeared into a crack of the closed portal .
WASHINGTON , June 11 ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday repeated his call for Congress to pass a $ 30 billion package to foster hiring and help tackle painfully high levels of unemployment .
“ I ’m hopeful the House will pass these measures next week and that the Senate will follow as soon as possible -- with support from both Democrats and Republicans , ” Obama said in remarks delivered in the White House Rose Garden .
After the worst recession in decades , many small businesses report trouble getting credit .
Obama ’s proposal would establish a $ 30 billion fund to boost lending to small businesses looking to hire and expand operations by providing additional capital to community banks .
The House of Representatives ’ Financial Services Committee approved the Small Business Lending Fund Act last month by a vote of 42 - 23 .
With U.S. unemployment at 9.7 percent in May despite an apparent return of economic growth , Obama is under enormous pressure to ease the plight of the jobless .
Voters are likely to punish his Democratic Party in congressional elections in November .
“ This legislation would eliminate capital gains taxes for investment in small firms , which will help move capital to these companies across America , ” Obama said after meeting small businesses owners .
“ And it would provide tax relief to small start - ups to encourage folks to open up businesses , too . ” ( Reporting by Alister Bull ; Editing by John O’Callaghan )

Twelve people were killed by a gunman who went on the rampage across Cumbria in north - west England .
Taxi driver Derrick
Bird shot dead a colleague in the town of Whitehaven , before driving through the countryside apparently targeting people at random .
Eleven others were injured , three critically and five seriously .
Mr Bird 's body was found in a wooded area in Boot in the Lake District , where a shotgun and a rifle fitted with a telescopic sight were recovered .
Five victims were named locally as Darren Rewcastle , Garry Purdham , Kenneth Fishburn , Jane Robinson and Michael Pike .
Mr Rewcastle was a taxi driver .
Mr Purdham was a farmer 's son and is believed to have had two young children .
Mr Fishburn , from Egremont , is understood to have been a retired security worker at the nearby Sellafield nuclear site .
Flowers were left at the spot where he died , with a card saying " RIP Ken - tragically taken but not forgotten " .
Ms Robinson was shot dead in Drigg Road in Seascale , just yards from the home she shared with her twin sister , Barrie .
The mass shooting is the UK's worst since 1996 , when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and their teacher in an attack at a school in Dunblane , Scotland .
In 1987 gun fanatic Michael Ryan killed 16 people in Hungerford , Berkshire .
The Queen said she was " deeply shocked " by the Cumbria shootings and shared the country 's " grief and horror " .
Image caption A message of sympathy where Kenneth Fishburn was shot in Egremont
Hospital sources told the BBC that one injured woman in her 20s was being treated for gunshot wounds to her chest , arm and side .
Another man , believed to be a local taxi driver , suffered a serious gunshot wound to his hand .
He was due to be transferred to a hospital in Newcastle in the next 24 hours for plastic surgery .
One patient , already transferred to Newcastle , was said to have serious head injuries .
Three others who were injured have been allowed home .
Stuart Hyde , Cumbria Police 's Deputy Chief Constable , said more than 100 officers were investigating 30 crime scenes .
He said : " We are still at a very early stage in our investigation and we are not able to really understand the motivation behind it - or establish whether this was a premeditated or random attack .
" Current indications are that 12 people have died , plus Derrick Bird .
And a number of people are also receiving treatment in hospital .
" We are working hard to support the families of those involved and our focus is now on gathering as much evidence as possible to build up a clear picture of what happened this morning .
" We want to clearly understand his possession of these weapons , what happened , what went wrong and why he decided to use these to shoot people .
Image caption Shooting victims Garry Purdham ( left ) and Darren Rewcastle
Mr Hyde added that investigators would be speaking to people who knew Mr Bird about the days leading up to the rampage .
He said : " What we want to do is ensure we understand what has happened , speak to people about him , his life , what has gone on in the last few days , what might have turned somebody into a killer . "
Anyone concerned about the whereabouts of relatives should contact Cumbria Police 's Casualty Bureau hotline .
After the first shooting , witnesses said Mr Bird drove through Whitehaven with a gun hanging out of his car window , then headed south through Gosforth and Seascale before turning inland .
As well as Whitehaven , fatalities have been confirmed in Egremont , Seascale and Gosforth .
As he began his first Prime Minister 's Questions today , David Cameron said the House of Commons would be " alarmed and shocked by the events unfolding in Cumbria " .
He said : " When lives and communities are suddenly shattered in this way , our thoughts should be with all those caught up in these tragic events , especially the families and friends of those killed or injured . "
After the killings , detectives said 52 - year - old Mr Bird drove to the central Lakes in a Citroen Picasso , then abandoned it in the Boot area .
Before his body was discovered , people living nearby were urged to stay indoors for their own protection .
Helicopters and armed officers from other police forces were brought in to help apprehend the gunman .
Mr Hyde added : " We have a number of crime scenes across the county , which are being staffed by police officers , and I would ask people to show a little bit of restraint and respect in regard to those scenes as we try and piece together exactly what has gone on . "
A major incident has been declared at West Cumberland Hospital , in Whitehaven , where the NHS said all routine operations had been cancelled .
The accident and emergency department at the Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle is also on full incident stand - by , the hospital trust said .
West Cumbria University Hospitals
Trust deputy chief executive Kevin Clarkson , speaking from West Cumberland Hospital in Whitehaven , said : " The hospital 's trust is part of the community it serves and our staff share in the grief .
" The following is an update on those who are most seriously injured .
Three casualties are in a critical condition , five are in a serious condition . "
The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in west Cumbria closed its gates as a safety precaution and afternoon shift workers were told to stay away , though the site later reopened .
Cumbria Police Casualty Bureau 0800 096 0095
A local taxi firm boss , Glenda Pears , said : " We just do n't know what 's happened .
" He [ Derrick Bird ] was friends with everybody and used to stand and joke on Duke Street . "
Sue Matthews , a telephonist at A2B Taxis in Whitehaven , said the Mr Bird was self - employed and lived alone .
She described him as a " quiet fellow " .

Anti-Israel protests intensify as detainees are released Reuters
Israel today started deporting all the detained activists seized during its botched raid on an aid shipment to Gaza , as some of the first to be freed spoke of their mistreatment at the hands of the Israelis .
A group of 124 pro-Palestinian activists from 12 Muslim nations crossed the border in five Jordanian buses .
Another 200 activists have been transferred from a holding centre to Israel 's airport near Tel Aviv , a prison service spokesman said .
The remaining activists will be released throughout the day , the spokesman said .
Yesterday Israel indicated it may prosecute some of the activists .
The decision to free the detainees came as more accounts from those on the ships began to emerge .
One Briton who was on one of the boats heading towards Gaza arrived back in Britain last night .
IT professional Hasan Nowarah , from Glasgow , described the moment Israeli troops stormed the aid flotilla .
He told Sky News the Mavi Marmara ship was surrounded by helicopters and Zodiac assault craft .
" All you could see was screaming and bullets .
Out of the blue as I looked around our ship , all I could see were hundreds of Zodiacs : hundreds of Zodiacs full of soldiers , and big ships , lots of ships , and I believe as well submarines in the sea , " he said .
The assault left nine dead and dozens wounded , and has led to condemnation of Israel and increasing calls for an independent inquiry .
One of the group deported to Jordan today , Walid al - Tabtabai , a Kuwaiti politician who was on board one of the ships with other activists from Muslim countries , said : " The Israelis roughed up and humiliated all of us : women , men and children .
" They were brutal and arrogant , but our message reached every corner of the world , that the blockade on Gaza is unfair and should be lifted immediately . "
Like many passengers on the flotilla he insisted there were no weapons on any of the ships .
An Algerian , Izzeddine Zahrour , said the Israeli authorities " deprived us of food , water and sleep , and we were n't allowed to use the toilet " .
" It was an ugly kidnapping , and subsequently bad treatment in Israeli jail , " he said .
" They handcuffed us , pushed us around and humiliated us . "
Mauritanian Mohammed Gholam said Israel " wanted us to sign documents saying that we entered Israel illegally " .
An Algerian activist , who giving only a first name of Sabrina , accused Israeli commandos of taking a one - year - old child hostage .
" They point a gun to his head in front of his Turkish parents to force the captain of our ship to stop sailing , " she said .
A Jordanian government spokesman said there were 30 Jordanians in the group .
Jordan is one of two Arab nations with a signed peace treaty with Israel .
The Kuwaiti ambassador , Sheik Faisal al - Sabah , said the group included 16 Kuwaitis .
He said the other activists came from Azerbaijan , Indonesia , Malaysia , Pakistan , Algeria , Morocco , Mauritania , Yemen , Oman and Bahrain .
Turkey has led criticism of the raid , accusing Israel of committing a " massacre " , and the UN security council demanded an impartial investigation .
There were reports in the Israeli media today that Israel had ordered the families of its diplomats in Turkey to leave that country because of Turkish anger at the raid .
Washington blocked an attempt at the UN security council for an international inquiry yesterday , issuing a mild statement regretting the loss of life .
Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , later called the situation in Gaza " unsustainable " .
" Israel 's legitimate security needs must be met , just as the Palestinians ' legitimate needs for sustained humanitarian assistance and regular access to reconstruction materials must also be assured , " she said .
Nick Clegg , the deputy prime minister , said this morning that Israel 's blockade of Gaza was " an absolute humanitarian catastrophe " that was " not in Israel 's own long - term self - interest " .
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning Israel had " every right " to protect its people from terrorist threat , but said : " What I ask my Israeli friends and Israeli politicians and officials I meet is : what 's the strategy ; where do you go next ; how are you going to secure in the long term – not just day to day – the security which you rightly crave ? "
Last night , the foreign secretary , William Hague , said 31 British nationals and a further 11 with dual nationality were known to have been detained after the seizure of the vessels as they attempted to breach the Israeli blockade of the territory .
The Foreign Office confirmed that 29 of the Britons had received a visit – with no complaints about their treatment .
Mark Regev , a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , said the detainees were being treated in line with international practice .
" We are not charging them with anything .
We have detained them and we will help them leave our country , " he told the BBC .
There was concern among friends and relatives in the UK , who complained that they were unable to establish contact with the detainees .
Rachel Bridgeland , whose partner , Peter Venner , 63 , from Ryde on the Isle of Wight , was on the Mavi Marmara , said the government should be putting more pressure on Israel .
" It is absolutely terrible not knowing what has happened to him , and it's terrible that the British government has n't done more , but they do n't want to fall out with Israel , " she said .
Goalkeeper Robert Green suffered a World Cup nightmare as England were forced to settle for a disappointing draw in the opening game of their campaign against the United States .
Steven Gerrard gave coach Fabio Capello the perfect start to this South African mission when he slid Emile Heskey 's pass beyond Tim Howard after only four minutes .
And while England rarely hit the heights , they were maintaining their advantage in relative comfort until five minutes before half - time when West Ham United 's Green suffered the lapse that will haunt him .
Clint Dempsey offered an effort that was little more than pot luck from 25 yards , but Green hopelessly allowed the ball to squeeze through him and roll agonisingly over the line as he tried to recover .
England had opportunities to repair the damage , but Heskey once again illustrated his limitations in front of goal by shooting straight at Howard with only the keeper to beat .
Wayne Rooney , subdued for the most part , shot just wide , while substitute Shaun Wright - Phillips , on for the under - par Milner after only 30 minutes , saw his angled drive saved by Howard .
Capello will also have enjoyed finer nights in his illustrious career as his major decisions backfired .
Green got the nod in goal but must now fear for his place against Algeria , while Milner looked far from fit following a virus after his surprise selection .
And Ledley King , whose fitness was the subject of so much debate when Capello named his squad , lasted only 45 minutes after suffering a groin injury .
It exposed a glaring lack of pace in England 's central defence , which was almost punished when Jozy Altidore raced past Jamie Carragher with embarrassing ease only for Green to apply some repairs to his shattered reputation by turning his shot on to the post .
England have plenty of time to regroup and progress , but this was an unsatisfactory night for Capello and his players .
Capello , unconvinced about David James ' fitness , chose Green ahead of the inexperienced Joe Hart - on the surface a sensible decision but ultimately a costly one .
England 's first - half performance was undistinguished , failing to build on Gerrard 's fourth minute goal .
Frank Lampard 's pass was out of Rooney 's reach , but Heskey played in Gerrard to score with the outside of his right foot .
The United States were allowed the luxury of plenty of possession , and England almost paid for their generosity when Landon Donovan 's inviting cross was headed tamely wide by Altidore .
Milner , given his chance despite being laid low by illness in midweek , was off the pace and picked up a booking for fouling Steve Cherundolo before being replaced by Wright - Phillips on the half - hour .
England at least looked like holding their lead until the interval , before a moment of complete calamity engulfed Green .
Dempsey 's left - foot shot from 25 yards barely merited the label of speculative , but every aspect of Green 's technique collapsed as he allowed the ball to squirm through his grasp and over the line .
To add to England 's troubles , King failed to emerge after the break , being replaced by Carragher as Capello was forced into another change to his initial plans .
Heskey , having done so well to create Gerrard 's goal , then demonstrated his lack of confidence in front of goal when he wasted a clear chance to restore England 's lead after 52 minutes .
Aaron Lennon put the striker through , but he never looked convincing and shot straight at Howard .
England , however , were not looking comfortable and Altidore illustrated the lack of pace at the back to give them a real scare in the 64th minute .
He outpaced Carragher in comfort , but Green made some amends for his earlier mistake by turning his angled shot on to the post .
Rooney had been relatively quiet , but almost surprised Howard with a snapshot from long - range that flew just wide .
He then set up Wright - Phillips , but his effort was too close to Howard .
England then ran out of ideas as they tired - leaving Bob Bradley 's US side to celebrate a hard - earned point .
The iPhone 4 has been finally announced at the WWDC 2010 .
Steve Jobs himself revealed the new smartphone by Apple : the next iPhone is a 9.3 mm thick ( a quarter thinner than the iPhone 3GS ; “ the thinnest smartphone on the planet ” , as Jobs said ) , has glass on front and back ( “ for better optical quality and scratch resistance ” ) , and stainless steel around .
It uses the stainless steel band as part of the antenna system .
“ It ’s the most precise thing we ’ve ever made , ” Apple CEO said .
i Phone 4 is powered by the A4 chip ( designed ” in house ” ) and comes with two built - in cameras ( one on the front and one on the back with an LED flash ) , two mics ( one for a noise cancellation ) , micro-SIM ( “ we needed the space ! " ) , 802.11n WiFi , GPS , compass , accelerometer , Quadband HSDPA / HSUPA , 7.2 Mbps and up to 32 GB of storage .
The display is a huge innovation : based on new IPS technology ( " quite a bit better than OLED " ) , the 3.5 inch , 960 x 640 Retina Display displays 326 pixels per inch ( four times as many pixels as in any standard display ) giving us really sharp text and pictures .
The contrast ratio is 800:1 ( 4 x better than the 3GS ) .
Since the battery is now a bit bigger , its life has been improved .
Apple says there is 7 hours of 3G talk , 6 hours of 3G browsing , 10 hours of WiFi browsing , 10 hours of video , 40 hours of music and 300 hours of standby .
Another new piece of hardware is a gyroscope with pitch , roll , and yaw .
It provides 6 - axis motion sensing and features new CoreMotion APIs for extremely precise positioning .
" We ’re adding a 3 axis gyro , and we tied the gyro and accelerometer , compass , and gyro together for six axis .
It ’s perfect for gaming , " Jobs said .
Back camera has gone from 3 to 5 MP .
Apple is using something that ’s new to smarpthones — a back side illuminated sensor ( giving more light to the camera ) .
There ’s a 5X digital zoom , tap to focus , and LED flash built in .
Camera also does HD 720 p ( at 30 frames per second ) video recording .
It supports tap to focus and allows us to edit videos right on the phone .
It also has 1 - click sharing and the LED flash will stay on for the HD video recording .
There is also iMovie coming to the iPhone for $ 4.99 ( “ if we approve it , ” Jobs joked ) .
i Phone 4 will also feature " FaceTime " video calling .
It works between iPhone 4 devices , does n’t require any setting - up and works anywhere there is WiFi .
“ It ’s WIFI only in 2010 .
We need to work a little bit with our providers , ” Jobs said .
He added that Apple is going to make FaceTime and open industry standard .
Apple has renamed the iPhone OS .
Now it ’s just iOS 4 . "
Becuase it ’s on iPad , iPod Touch , and iPhone , ” Apple CEO said .
He also said that 100 millionth iOS device will be sold this month .
" There is definitely a market for your applications , " Jobs added .
As announced earlier this year , new iOS 4 features include Multitasking for third party apps ; Folders to better organize and access apps ; improved Mail with a unified inbox , fast inbox switching and threaded messages ; enhanced Enterprise support with better data protection , mobile device management and wireless app distribution .
Apple has also added Bing to the iPhone for search ( “ Microsoft has done a great job on this , ” Jobs said ) .
Google will still be the default , but now we ’ll have choice of Google , Yahoo , or Bing .
Developers will get a Golden Master Candidate release of iOS4 today .
Apple is also bringing iBooks to the iPhone with the iPhone 4 .
It has the same bookshelf as on the iPad , the same ability to read a PDF and comes with the same controls , highlighting , notes , and bookmarking .
We can download the same book to all our devices at no extra charge ( “ Buy it on your iPad , download to your iPhone ” ) !
In addition , iBooks will automatically and wirelessly sync our current place , bookmarks , and notes across all our devices .
On July 1st Apple will also start providing iAds to all iOS 4 devices .
“ Why are we doing this ?
To help our developers earn money to continue to create free and low - cost apps for users , ” Jobs said .
According to him , they are trying to combine “ the emotion of video with the interactivity of the Web . "
Apple sells and hosts the ads , so developers just have to tell them where to put the ads .
And devs get paid 60 percent of the revenue .
The company started selling ads eight weeks ago to : Nissan , Citi , Unilever , AT&T , Chanel , GE , Liberty Mutual , State Farm , Geico , Campbells , Sears , JCPenney , Target , Best Buy , DirecTV , TBS Network and Disney .
" We ’ve got advertisers committing to $ 60 m , " Jobs said .
Price and availability
i Phone 4 comes in two colors : black and white .
16GB model is for $ 199 , and 32 GB model for $ 299 .
Old 3GS is now $ 99
Jobs said that AT&T is going to make an “ incredibly generous upgrade offer : if your contract expires at any time in 2010 , you can upgrade to the iPhone 4 .
You can get it up to six months early . "
The new iPhone will be on sale June 24th .
Pre orders begin June 15th .
Apple will ship iPhone 4 in US and four other countries on the first day ( U.K. , Germany , France , Japan ) .
In July they ’re shipping in 18 countries more .
By September it will ship in 88 countries .
" Our fastest roll out ever , " Jobs said .
i Phone 3GS , iPhone 3G and iPod touch users can upgrade to iOS 4 for free starting June 21 .

When Robert Anson Heinlein died 22 years ago this month , in Carmel , California , at the age of 80 , the wonder of it all was that he had managed to live as long as he did .
Heinlein , who was born in 1907 in Butler , Missouri , a small town about 65 miles south of Kansas City , had been in poor health for most of his adult life .
His family had connections with the powerful Pendergast political machine , the outfit that later put Harry Truman in the US Senate , but Heinlein still had to spend his freshman year in a two - year Kansas City " junior college "  what today we would call a " community college "  before the Pendergast machine was finally able to wangle him an appointment to Annapolis .
After graduating from the naval academy in 1929 with a degree in mechanical engineering , Heinlein went to sea as an officer .
But in his fourth year of active duty , he contracted tuberculosis and was honorably discharged  retired , really , with a small pension  after a lengthy hospitalization at Navy expense .
It was now 1934 , the depths of the Great Depression .
Robert A. Heinlein was 27 years old and living in Los Angeles , where the Navy had sent him upon his graduation from Annapolis five years before .
He applied for admission to graduate school in physics and mathematics at UCLA , was accepted , and enrolled in classes there .
But he dropped out after only a few weeks , partly for reasons of his still - precarious health , partly because he had become interested in politics and wanted to devote his time to working for Upton Sinclair ’s gubernatorial campaign instead of studying math and physics .
Sinclair was an outspoken and self - identified socialist , whose campaign as the Democratic nominee for governor of California in 1934 was an outgrowth of his EPIC movement .
" EPIC " was an acronym for End Poverty in California .
In Sinclair ’s words , the EPIC
The Moon Is a Harsh Mi ... Robert A. Heinlein Best Price : $ 1.94 Buy New $ 26.93 ( as of 12:05 EST - Details )
movement propose[d ] that our unemployed shall be put at productive labor , producing everything which they themselves consume and exchanging those goods among themselves by a method of barter , using warehouse receipts or labor certificates or whatever name you may choose to give to the paper employed .
It asserts that the State must advance sufficient capital to give the unemployed access to good land and machinery , so that they may work and support themselves and thus take themselves off the backs of the taxpayers .
The " EPIC " movement asserts that this will not hurt private industry , because the unemployed are no longer of any use to industry .
Robert A. Heinlein worked for Sinclair ’s campaign in 1934  it won a little more than a third of all the votes cast in the election  then stayed with the EPIC movement for a few more years .
He became a staff writer for , then editor of , the EPIC News , the movement ’s flagship publication , with a paid circulation of two million .
Having discovered what seemed to be a natural bent for writing , he tried his hand at a novel  a utopian socialist polemic entitled For Us , the Living , that never saw publication until after his death .
In 1938 , he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the California state legislature on an EPIC platform .
Then , in 1939 , at the age of 32 , he began writing short stories for the commercial science fiction magazines .
He enjoyed immediate success .
Within months of publishing his first short story in the pages of the leading science fiction magazine of the day , Astounding Science Fiction , he was widely regarded as the leading writer in the field .
Within eight years , by 1947 , the year he turned 40 , he had become the first science - fiction writer to break the pulp barrier  that is , the first science fiction writer to publish not just one story but an entire series of stories , not in the cheaply produced " pulp " magazines like Amazing Stories , Astounding Science Fiction , or Thrilling Wonder Stories , but rather in the more expensively produced , more prestigious , larger - circulation , better paying , " slick " magazines like Town & Country and the Saturday Evening Post .
The Saturday Evening
Post alone published nearly half the stories , including the title story , that made up Heinlein ’s celebrated 1951 collection , The Green Hills of Earth .
It was also in the late ’ 40s that Heinlein began publishing science fiction stories in Boy ’s Life , the monthly magazine of the Boy Scouts of America .
It was in the late ’ 40s that he began writing , at the rate of one novel per year , what Brian Doherty calls " a series of S.F. novels for boys , published by Scribner ’s , that seemed to make it into every high school and elementary school library "  a series of " coming - of - age adventure tales " that made Heinlein a top favorite author of baby boomers long before those boomers were old enough to vote or order a drink in a bar .
Meanwhile , he wrote science fiction for adults as well .
During the ’50s and ’60s , Heinlein won four Hugo awards for best science fiction novel of the year .
In 1969 , he joined Walter Cronkite on national television to offer commentary on the first manned moon landing in history .
In 1975 , he was named the first recipient of the Grand Master Award for lifetime achievement in the field , by the Science Fiction Writers of America .
By the time of his death in 1988 , his nearly four - dozen books  including novels and collections of short stories  had sold more than 40 million copies .
And they have n’t stopped selling in the more than two decades that have gone by since then .
Why is all this important from the point of view of the libertarian tradition ?
Because , among the many hundreds of thousands of readers who made Robert A. Heinlein ’s career in science fiction such a brilliant success were quite a few who later came to think of themselves as libertarians and to associate themselves , in one way or another , with the organized libertarian movement .
Not a few of these would be happy to tell you that it was by reading Heinlein ’s stories and novels that they discovered libertarian ideas and became persuaded of their power and truth .
In the early 1970s , according to a survey undertaken at the time by SIL , the Society for Individual Liberty , one libertarian activist in six had been led to libertarianism by reading the novels and short stories of Robert A. Heinlein .
Among the prominent libertarians of the late 20th Century who have named Heinlein as an important influence on the development of their own political thinking were Dave Nolan ( the founder of the Libertarian Party ) and the late Samuel Edward Konkin III .

But was Heinlein a libertarian ?
There certainly are libertarian ideas in some of his books .
The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress , for example , the winner of the Hugo award as the best science fiction novel of 1966 , is the story of a libertarian revolution on the moon  a revolution designed to free Luna from the control of politicians and bureaucrats on Terra , that is , the Earth .
One of the leaders of the revolution is a " distinguished man with wavy white hair , dimples in cheeks , and [ a ] voice that smiled , " Professor Bernardo de la Paz , who speaks of " the most basic human right , the right to bargain in a free marketplace . "
De la Paz calls himself " a rational anarchist " and argues that the question we need to put to ourselves when thinking about political issues is this one : " Under what circumstances is it moral for a group to do that which is not moral for a member of the group to do alone ? "
According to Professor de la Paz , this is " the key question [ a ] radical question that strikes to the root of the whole dilemma of government . "
As the professor puts it ,
A rational anarchist believes that concepts such as " state " and " society " and " government " have no existence save as physically exemplified in the acts of self - responsible individuals .
He believes that it is impossible to shift blame , share blame , distribute blame as blame , guilt , responsibility are matters taking place inside human beings singly and nowhere else .
Robert LeFevre ( 1911 1986 )
Both in his physical appearance  the wavy white hair , the dimples , the smiling voice  and in his ideas , Professor Bernardo de la Paz bears a striking resemblance to a real - life libertarian who flourished and enjoyed considerable influence within the libertarian movement during the 1950s , ’60s , and ’ 70s  Robert LeFevre .
Now it so happens that Robert A. Heinlein and his third wife , Virginia Heinlein , lived in Colorado Springs throughout the 1950s and through the first half of the 1960s , the very period during which Robert LeFevre , a neighbor of theirs as it turns out , was serving as editorial page editor of the Colorado Springs Gazette - Telegraph .

Heinlein was writing The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress during the years when LeFevre was operating his famous Freedom School up the road a few miles in Larkspur and working to transform it into a degree - granting , four - year institution he wanted to call Rampart College  during the years when , in effect , LeFevre was transforming himself from an editorialist , controversialist , and rabble rouser to a professor .
It has generally been assumed , though it was never confirmed by either Heinlein or his widow while they were alive , that the fictional Bernardo de la Paz was based on the real Robert LeFevre .
The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress is unquestionably a libertarian novel .
It is unquestionably one of the three or four most influential libertarian novels of the last century .
But whether its author , Robert A. Heinlein , can plausibly be described as a libertarian in his personal political views remains a troubled question .
We have seen that Heinlein ’s first period of political activism , in the mid-to - late 1930s , was devoted to the advocacy of policies like a guaranteed annual income , universal tax - funded schooling , and government seizure of unused private factories and farms so they could be transformed , at taxpayer expense , into workers ’ co-ops .
Whatever this is , it is not libertarianism .
Heinlein ’s next period of political activism came in the late 1950s , during the very years when he was first getting acquainted with Robert LeFevre .
On April 5 , 1958 , the Colorado Springs Gazette - Telegraph published a full page ad sponsored by  but let ’s let Robert A. Heinlein tell the story .
The following quotations are taken from the full - page ad he wrote in reply and paid to have published a week later , on Saturday , April 12 , 1958 .
Last Saturday in this city appeared a full - page ad intended to scare us into demanding that the President stop our testing of nuclear weapons .
The instigators were seventy - odd local people and sixty - odd national names styling themselves " The National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy . "
This manifesto is the rankest sort of Communist propaganda concealed in idealistic - sounding nonsense .
We the undersigned read that insane manifesto of the so - called " Committee for a ‘ Sane ’ Nuclear Policy " and we despised it .
So we are answering it ourselves  by our own free choice and spending only our own money .
If it comes to atomic war , the best we can hope for is tens of millions of American dead  perhaps more than half our population wiped out in the first few minutes .
The risks cannot be avoided other than by surrender ; they can be reduced only by making the free world so strong that the evil pragmatists of Communism cannot afford to murder us .
The price to us will be year after weary year of higher taxes , harder work , grim devotion and perhaps , despite all this  death .
But we shall die free !
We the undersigned are not a committee but simply two free citizens of these United States .
We love life and we want peace but not " peace at any price "  not the price of liberty !
Poltroons and pacifists will think otherwise .

Heinlein urged his readers to join a new organization he was starting up , called the Patrick Henry League , to promote his ideas .
Again , whatever this may be , it is not libertarianism .
As Murray Rothbard explained in his classic essay " War , Peace , & the State , " published in 1963 , five years after the publication of Heinlein ’s fatuous polemic , suppose
Jones finds that he or his property is being invaded , aggressed against , by Smith .
It is legitimate for Jones to repel this invasion by defensive violence of his own .
But now we come to a more knotty question : is it within the right of Jones to commit violence against innocent third parties as a corollary to his legitimate defense against Smith ?
To the libertarian , the answer must be clearly , no .
Remember that the rule prohibiting violence against the persons or property of innocent men is absolute : it holds regardless of the subjective motives for the aggression .
It is wrong and criminal to violate the property or person of another , even if one is a Robin Hood , or starving , or is doing it to save one ’s relatives , or is defending oneself against a third man ’s attack .
Now , with regard to nuclear weapons , here is what Rothbard had to say :
While the bow and arrow and even the rifle can be pinpointed , if the will be there , against actual criminals , modern nuclear weapons cannot .
These weapons are ipso facto engines of indiscriminate mass destruction .
( The only exception would be the extremely rare case where a mass of people who were all criminals inhabited a vast geographical area . )
We must , therefore , conclude that the use of nuclear or similar weapons , or the threat thereof , is a sin and a crime against humanity for which there can be no justification .

Since " it is precisely the characteristic of modern weapons that they cannot be used selectively , cannot be used in a libertarian manner , " Rothbard argued , " therefore , their very existence must be condemned , and nuclear disarmament becomes a good to be pursued for its own sake .
And if we will indeed use our strategic intelligence , we will see that such disarmament is not only a good , but the highest political good that we can pursue in the modern world . "
Ten years later , in his invaluable introduction to the libertarian idea , For A New Liberty : The Libertarian Manifesto , Rothbard summed up his view of the point Robert A. Heinlein had made in that 1958 ad in the Colorado Springs Gazette - Telegraph .
Anyone who wishes is entitled to make the personal decision of " better dead than Red " or " give me liberty or give me death . "
What he is not entitled to do is to make these decisions for others , as the prowar policy of conservatism would do .
What conservatives are really saying is : " Better them dead than Red , " and " give me liberty or give them death "  which are the battle cries not of noble heroes but of mass murderers .
It is noteworthy , is it not , that while Heinlein boasted that he and his wife had paid for the publication of their ad by " spending only our own money , " he simultaneously made it clear that he expected all Americans to cheerfully pay " higher taxes " to implement the policy of mass murder he espoused .
Similarly , the man who wrote stories depicting a successful space program funded by private enterprise also made it clear that he expected Americans to pay taxes  that is , to tolerate government theft of their money  to support NASA .

Isaac Asimov , who knew Heinlein from the mid-’30s on , was convinced that his personal political views were largely a function of the woman he was married to at the time .
In the ’30s , when he was married to wife # 2 , Leslyn MacDonald , whom Asimov describes as " a flaming liberal , " Heinlein was working with Upton Sinclair and his EPIC movement .
Twenty years later , married to wife # 3 , Virginia Gerstenfeld , he re-emerged as a Cold Warrior fixated on the supposed nobility of the military and newly devoted to a " free market " for which he had had little use during the years of the Great Depression .
If so it was , I say , " so be it . "
Many men have tailored their beliefs to match those of their wives .
They have found that it helps to preserve and promote domestic harmony .
And they believe that domestic harmony is a valuable thing , a thing worth preserving .
Robert A. Heinlein was hardly the only man , or even the first man , to venture down this path .
What we need to stay focused on here , I think , is that in his books , Heinlein was his own man .
He found social and political ideas  ideas about the different ways human beings might figure out to live together peaceably in large groups  endlessly fascinating .
He liked to fool around with such ideas , speculate about how they might work out in practice .
Libertarian ideas were n’t the only ones he fooled around with and speculated about in his fiction .
But because of his interaction with Robert LeFevre in Colorado in the ’50s and ’60s , libertarian ideas were among those he toyed with and dramatized in certain of his stories .
Whether he was personally a libertarian or not , all those of us who are libertarians owe him a profound debt for writing The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress .
For that book alone , Robert A. Heinlein has earned a place in the libertarian tradition .

Improvements in aerial survey methods have led to increased estimates of narwhal populations in the eastern Arctic , according to a paper published Arctic , the journal of the University of Calgary 's Arctic Institute of North America .
Previous estimates of narwhals were based on surface counts and covered part of their eastern Arctic summering range .
They placed populations between 20,000 and 30,000 .
New estimates increase that number to over 60,000 , says Pierre Richard , lead author and research scientist with the Canada 's Department of Fisheries and Oceans .
Counting marine animals is notoriously difficult .
" It 's not like you 're counting your cows as they are going through the gate , " says Richard , who developed the survey techniques with a team of scientists from Canada , the U.S. and Greenland .
Not only are observers traveling in aircraft flying at 180 kilometers an hour , they also have to contend with inclement weather conditions which can hinder visibility .
" The weather can turn on a dime and you are often waiting for the sweet spot between foggy conditions and high winds , " he says .
In addition , many animals are submerged .
Narwhals are renowned for their deep diving abilities .
In the winter , they dive to depths of two kilometers and they can remain submerged for up to 25 minutes .
" Only one - third of their time is spent at the surface , " says Richard .
There is also the problem of narwhal sighting distance .
" The further the animal is away from the observer , the less likely you are to observe it , " says Richard .
At other times , whale sightings are coming " so fast and furious " it is difficult to count them accurately .
Richard and his colleagues developed two new approaches to correct for some of these biases .
Using dive data acquired from instrumented animals , they developed a method for estimating how many narwhals are submerged .
They also created a process to estimate the proportion of animals that observers might have missed , even if they were at the surface .
The surveys , which were conducted in August between 2002 and 2004 , also covered new territory .
Narwhals summer in the High Arctic archipelago and northern Hudson Bay and winter in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait .
Previous surveys had not covered all of their summering range .
Richard and his colleagues extended data collection into the Gulf of Boothia and the east coast of Baffin Island .
They were planning to fly over other areas , but were stopped by weather .
An accurate picture of narwhal populations is needed to set sustainable hunting quotas .
Richard says that while his survey results show the narwhal population is larger than previously thought , management of the population should be exercised with caution .
Survey results can be imprecise and there appear to be local stocks of narwhals that return each summer to specific areas within their range .
This site fidelity suggests that stocks of narwhal occupying different summering areas should be managed separately , and that management of a stock should be based on the summer estimate of narwhals for that area only .
Richard 's team will be waiting out weather again in 2010 to conduct further studies .
This time , they hope to conduct newly designed surveys of Admiralty Inlet -- if weather permits .
During previous surveys , the area had been beleaguered by bad weather and sampling problems that put the accuracy of the area 's narwhal estimate in question .

New York ( CNN ) --
Facebook is embroiled in another controversy after the popular social networking site on Monday temporarily disabled a page that calls for a boycott of oil giant BP .
Facebook officials said Tuesday the site was removed in error through a technological glitch and has been restored .
The Boycott BP page aims to organize a worldwide boycott of BP stations and all its brands in response to the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
It urges visitors to " Boycott BP stations until the spill is cleaned up . "
In addition to the station boycott , it advocates boycotting Castrol , Arco , Aral , Amoco , am / pm and even the Wild Bean Cafe .
The group said it has more than 700,000 members .
The site went down Monday , with visitors redirected to Facebook 's home page .
Facebook spokeswoman Annika Heinle said there was nothing sinister behind the move , and an automated system mistakenly flagged the page for removal .
" The administrative profile of the BP Boycott page was disabled by our automated systems , therefore removing all the content that had been created by the profile , " a Facebook statement said .
" After a manual review , we determined the profile was removed in error , and it now has been restored along with the page . "
The missing page prompted a protest from Public Citizen , a nonprofit public interest group that has been promoting the boycott .
It called the removal of the page irresponsible and said users should be given a better explanation .
" I do n't think it 's much of an explanation at all , " said Greg Beck , a Public Citizen attorney .
" They did n't explain why their system took it down , and just the fact that a community that large -- with more than 700,000 users -- could be taken down without explanation is problem .
The automated system does n't tell us that much . "
He added , " Facebook and other social websites have become the public squares of the internet -- places where citizens can congregate as a community to share their opinions and voice their grievances .
Facebook 's ownership of this democratic forum carries great responsibility . "
BP said it was n't involved .
" We had absolutely nothing to do with this .
When we were first asked about it we contacted Facebook , and their mistake was rectified , " said Robert Wine , a BP spokesman .
The controversy comes as the oil spill is in its 71st day , with BP saying it is likely to take until August before relief wells might be able to stem the flow .
The Boycott BP page is filled with posts from users who decry BP 's handling of the spill , as well as a few who say a boycott is not the answer .
BP has more than 11,000 stations in the United States , which sell more than 42 million gallons of gas a day .
Critics of the boycott note that BP does n't own the stations -- independent franchisees do -- and they 're the ones who would be hurt .
Advocates said the target of the boycott is wide , and even if they can't make a dent in BP 's billions of dollars in sales , they can make a moral point .

CYPRESS – A Cypress police officer arrested Wednesday over accusations that he had molested his daughter was released from jail Friday without being charged .
Ross Bowlin , 27 , had filed for partial custody of his children two weeks before the accusations were made .
Riverside County prosecutors sent the case back to the Murrieta Police Department for further investigation , said John Hall , spokesman for the Riverside District Attorney ’s Office .
Bowlin , a former Marine , has been on administrative leave from the Cypress Police Department since November over an unrelated matter , said Capt .
Jackie Gomez - Whiteley .
According to Orange County Family Court records , Bowlin was allowed to a visit with his 5 - year - old son and 4 - year - old daughter every Thursday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m .
His ex-wife , Corina Shauntele Bowlin , was allowed to monitor the visits herself , or have her mother monitor them .
Bowlin was accused of molesting his daughter during the May 27 visit .
The same day , Corina Shauntele called the Orange County Sheriff ’s Department , which referred the investigation to authorities in Murrieta , where the crime was alleged to have taken place .
Two weeks earlier , on May 13 , Bowlin filed papers for joint legal and physical custody of his children , whom he had given up in a divorce settlement 23 months earlier .
Sgt. Jim Ganley of the Murrieta Police Department said that investigators were aware that the accusations came within the context of a custody battle , where false accusations are sometimes used as weapons .
“ That ’s the first thing we looked into , which is why it took so long to get the warrant , ” Ganley said .
“ Cop or no cop , we do n’t want to send somebody to jail for life if he ’s innocent . ”
Detectives served a search warrant in the 23000 block of Cork Oak Circle , Murrieta , at 8:30 a.m. June 9 , and arrested Bowlin afterward .
Bowlin was cooperative , but denied the accusation , police said .
The evidence against Bowlin includes disclosure of abuse by his daughter , police said .
Ganley declined to say whether there was any corroborating evidence .
Verifying sexual abuse of prepubescent girls is very difficult , with clear physical findings present in around 3 percent of the cases , according to researchers .
In the couple ’s divorce settlement agreement of June 16 , 2008 , Ross Bowlin surrendered custody of the children , and agreed to pay $ 2700 a month in child support , well over the $ 1,656 set out in state guidelines .
In September 2008 , Corina Shauntele filed a restraining order against him , accusing him of belligerence , of grabbing her by the arm during a dispute over child support , and of making subtle threats in setting his gun on dressers or tables .
Bowlin argued that he could n’t afford his child support payments because his overtime was being cut , court records show .
In November 2009 , a judge agreed , finding that state guidelines called for him to pay just $ 1,548 in child support .
On May 13 , Bowlin filed for new custody terms , with longer weekly visits , and overnight visits every other week .
Bowlin could not be reached for comment .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Americans have become increasingly less tied to formal religion in recent decades , with the percentage saying they do not have a specific religious identity growing from near zero in the 1950s to 16 % this year and last .
This upward trend in the percentage having no religious identity has been evident for a number of years in Gallup and other surveys .
Gallup began systematically tracking religion using this measure in 1948 , asking Americans to name the major religion with which they personally identified .
At that point , 2 % of Americans volunteered " no religion " and another 3 % had an otherwise undesignated religious identity .
In 1949 and in the 1950s and 1960s , these percentages stayed low .
The number of Americans with no formal religious identity began to increase in the 1970s , reaching 11 % by 1990 .
After some fluctuations over the last two decades , 16 % of Americans now say they have no religious identity or have an otherwise undesignated response .
Gallup 's 53 - year trend on this measure represents nearly a quarter of the history of the United States as an independent country .
There is no systematic way of comparing this trend with what may have been the case stretching back to the earliest post - Revolutionary War days .
The best conclusion therefore is that Americans are more likely now than at previous times since World War II to say " no religion " when queried in traditional fashion about their religious identity .
Religion Old - Fashioned and Out of Date ?
An additional measure Gallup has tracked over time asks Americans if they believe that religion can answer all or most of today 's problems , or if they believe religion is largely old - fashioned and out of date .
The percentage of Americans who believe religion can answer all or most of today 's problems has fluctuated since the mid-1970s , as has the number who believe religion is old - fashioned and out of date .
When Gallup first asked this question in 1957 , 7 % of Americans said religion was old - fashioned .
That percentage was generally at or around 20 % during much of the 1980s and 1990s , but has risen to 29 % last year and 28 % this year .
Thus , although clearly still a minority , the segment of Americans who believe " religion is largely old - fashioned " is now modestly higher than it was a decade or two ago .
Bottom Line
Gallup surveys confirm a downward drift in religious identity among Americans , as well as a slight increase in the number of Americans who view religion as old - fashioned and out of date .
Lack of identification with a formal religious group does not necessarily mean religion is irrelevant in a broad sense in a person 's life .
One can remain quite religious , or at least spiritual , while at the same time eschewing attachment to or identity with a formal religion or denomination .
Still , trends on an additional Gallup question indicate that there has in fact been a slight uptick in the percentage of Americans who say religion is not very important in their daily lives -- from a range of 11 % to 14 % through most of the 1970s , 1980s , and 1990s to 19 % over the past two years .
This suggests that there may be some diminution of " inner " religion accompanying the reduction in explicit religious identity and the increased perception that religion is largely old - fashioned and out of date .
In April , the UK Information Commissioner 's Office ruled that Queen 's University Belfast must hand over data obtained during 40 years of research into 7,000 years of Irish tree rings to a City banker and part - time climate analyst , Doug Keenan .
Professor Mike Baillie , the man who collected most of that data , called the ruling a " staggering injustice " .
He explains his opinion below .
I regard myself as a chronologist and a dendro - catastrophist ; in particular I wish to link the tree-ring and ice core chronologies so that we can view some historical events , such as those around AD540 or 44BC , in human records , in tree - ring records and in ice core records of atmospheric chemistry .
My early work was as part of a team involved in constructing a 7,000 - year oak chronology at Belfast to allow calibration of the radiocarbon timescale .
Since then I have built further chronologies and have studied some extreme events initially indicated by the Irish trees .
To put the record straight , I am neither a climatologist nor a dendro - climatologist .
I have no academic stance on human - caused global warming except that , as a scientist reviewing the issue from an evolutionary perspective , if humans are even partly the cause of the warming since 1990 then we are already doomed as a species .
I agree with Doug Keenan ( the man who placed FOI requests at Queen 's University Belfast asking for my data ) that the issue of the Medieval Warm Period ( MWP ) is of critical importance at the present time .
In a nutshell , either the MWP was warmer than now and we are in with a chance of surviving long enough to do something about climate change , or the MWP was cooler than now and we are probably due for rapid extinction .
In the 1980s we supplied our modern oak data ( available at www.noaa.gov) to the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia .
Work by the dendro - climatologists there gave rise to two papers Dr Keith Briffa and colleagues that convinced us that British / Irish oak was not a good subject for the reconstruction of instrumental - style temperature and rainfall records .
Thereafter , at Belfast , we gave up any hope of contributing to the issue of climate change using tree rings .
Recently a paper by Dr Garcia - Suarez ( I am a co-author ) on Irish trees and climate records shows results compatible with that research .
It confirms that it is very unlikely that past temperatures can be reconstructed from Irish oaks .
I recently stated that our Irish oak data has never been used in climatic reconstructions .
It turns out I was wrong on this point .
I did not know that the US climate scientist Professor Michael Mann had used a few of our oak records in a 2008 publication .
I was not aware of his paper , nor of the use of the data .
While this seems to be regarded by some members of the public as criminal ( not to have read every paper on climate reconstruction ) , my reply is , why should I have known about it ?
I am not a climatologist .
I have little research interest in present climate , only in trying to understand aspects of the past ( as my publication list for the last several decades shows ) .
I consider that our raw tree - ring measurements should not have been released following an FOI request .
I know the Irish data better than anyone else ; particularly the highly disparate nature of the samples before the year AD1700 ( variously from historic buildings , archaeological sites , lake margins and peat bogs ) .
It is unlikely that these ancient woodland , forest or bog trees would have the same response to climate factors ( such as temperature or rainfall ) as current living oak trees .
Worse still , living parkland oaks in Ireland are much wider ringed than any of the ancient oak populations .
This is almost certainly because modern oaks on walled estates are probably imported stock , brought in from the 17th century onwards by landowners who wished to beautify their estates with large oaks .
Even worse than that , although ancient bog oaks occur across Northern Europe , there are no good examples of oaks currently growing on raised lowland bogs anywhere .
So it is essentially impossible to find out exactly what such oaks were responding to .
These latter observations mean that even if a climate - calibration exercise had been successful ( comparing oak growth with modern instrumental records ) , it is unlikely that any attempt at interpreting the climate response of the more ancient Irish oaks would be meaningful .
That is my considered view , though doubtless few will accept it .
Finally , regarding intellectual property and the release of data under FOI , when a dendrochronologist measures the widths of the growth rings in a sample , he or she has to make multiple decisions with respect to the starts and ends of the rings , problem rings , and so on .
Repeated measurement of the same sample , will not give exactly the same measurements .
The number of rings must be the same , but the actual measured widths will not be .
This means that the ring pattern of a tree -ring sample carries the " intellectual fingerprint " of the dendrochronologist who measured it , every bit as much as this text carries my intellectual fingerprint .
In my opinion , tree - ring patterns are therefore intellectual property and should not be handed out as if they are instrumental climate data .
• Prof Michael Baillie retired as a paid academic in 2005 before the current FOI issue began .
He now holds an Emeritus position at Queen 's University Belfast where he pursues research on chronology and mythology with a particular interest in sorting out the likely effects of volcanoes from those of comets or other extraterrestrial vectors .
* Individual tree ring - width data is available from 12 modern oak sites in Ireland , namely Ardara , Baron 's Court , Breen Wood , Caledon , Cappoquin , Enniscorthy , Garryland Wood , Glen of the Downs , Killarney , Loch Doon , Rostrevor and Shane 's Castle .
Individual tree data is also available for seven English and Scottish sites .
WireWorld
WireWorld is a two - dimensional four - color cellular automaton introduced by Brian Silverman in 1987 .
The rule for the automaton uses the cell 's old value together with the number of its eight neighbors that are set to 1 according to a system that roughly models the flow of currents in wires according to the following rules .
0 . The color 0 is considered background , and always stays as background .
1 . The color 1 is considered an electron head , and always turns into an electron tail .
2 . The color 2 is an electron tail , and always turns into wire .
3 . The color 3 is wire , which remains wire unless is 1 or 2 , in which case it becomes an electron head .
With these rules , digital logic circuits can be constructed , as illustrated above for OR , XOR , and AND gates .
In 2002 , Nick Gardner demonstrated how two 8 - bit binary numbers could be multiplied with a WireWorld construction using the network above .
Symptoms of Gonorrhea and Later Stage Complications
In my previous post Dial “ M ” for mangled – Wikipedia and Environment Canada caught with temperature data errors .
we identified some problems with temperature data from the Eureka Weather Station .
Today I ’m starting what may be a two or three part series having a detailed look inside the Eureka Weather Station and the data it produces .
Thanks to the manager of the station Rai LeCotey , we have a lot of new information that had not previously been available on the web .
Mr. LeCotey has been most gracious and forthcoming and I commend his openness , which as we have seen in Climate Science , is a rare quality .
Here ’s an aerial view of the station .
Ecotretas and I looked at a number of what we identified as errors in data from Eureka , Nunavut , Canada weather station .
Some errors are real , such as the January 1st 2007 METAR error ( caused by transcription error ) .
We identified what we thought were errors on July 13th and 14th .
The Station Manager Mr. LeCotey says that the July 14th new record high temperature “ error ” was real ( meaning meteorological data , not a transcription error ) , and a function of wind direction bringing air from the North that has been warmed by terrain .
He also says he ’s working to get the error on Jan 1 2007 corrected in the record .
He ’s sent along some photo documentation of the July 14th 2009 , event .
We ’ll get to that in a subsequent post , but first some background on the station itself .
Here ’s what the Meteorological Instrument Complex looks like :
The truck is interesting .
Note the blowers on top of the Stevenson Screens for continuous aspiration .
Mr. LeCotey provided this official visitors guide to Eureka , which I have posted as a PDF , link below
Visitor_Guide_to_Eureka_Apr_2010
He also graciously answered a number of questions .
His answers are in blue .
1 ) The sensors in the Stevenson Screens are electronic it appears .
Am I correct in assuming they are cabled to the met office ?
Of what type are they ?
Thermistors , RTD ?
Thermocouple ?
We use a remote temperature and dew point measuring system type 2 .
The dry bulb temperature is measured with a thermistor and the dew point is measured with a dew cell .
2 ) I notice fan aspirators on the screens .
Are these run continuously for the electronic sensors , or are they a holdover of earlier times when wet bulb DP / humidty readings required aspiration ?
The sensors are housed in a ventilated Stevenson screen that runs continuously .
Psychrometer comparisons between the remote system and our mercury thermometers ( in a second Stevenson Screen right next to the remote screen ) are done once a week with an thorough calibration done once a year .
3 ) How far away , in meters , is the Met Instrument compound from the nearest structure , such as the bright blue HQ building ?
The Stevenson screens are approx .
40 meters
4 ) Why are there no readings in the first two hours of the day ( 00 and 01 ) ?
We only do a surface weather program for 22 hours a day .
We have a contract with Nav Canada that only wants aviation weather between 06 Z to 03Z inclusive .
Surface weather observations are done on the side ( with NavCan funding ) .
Our primary function is that we send up 2 weather balloons a day as our commitment to the WMO .
We stay on EST all year ( there is no point to go to daylight savings time as an extra hour of daylight does mean anything to us when we have 24 hours of daylight in the summer anyway ) .
Therefore , our last observation is at 22:00 EST ( local ) and we start observing again at 01:00 EST ( local ) .
The 23:00 & 00:00 observations are missing as NavCan does not pay us for those two observations .
5 ) Do the electronic displays have max / min memories ?
Yes , our AES remote temperature and dew point ( 1987 ) system ( RTD - 87 ) measure the max and min temperatures and stores them in memory until cleared by the observer every six hours on the syno .
The RTD measures the temperature & dew point every minute .
6 ) How often are the meteorological instruments calibrated and how is this done ?
Psychrometer comparisons between the remote system and our mercury thermometers ( in a second Stevenson Screen right next to the remote screen ) are done once a week with an thorough calibration done once a year .
7 ) How are the hourly METAR reports made .
Are they transcribed from the paper form to teletype or Internet data , or some other method ?
The METARS are transcribe from the 2322 form into a WinIDE quality assurance software system ( WinIDE version 3.0 , is used as the principle data input system for human METAR observations within EC ) that automatically checks for errors / discrepancies and gives a warning to the observer to make a correction before the observation data will be sent out .
The WinIDE system is very good and follows the observing criteria of MANOBS very well .
It will not allow an observation to be sent out over the met circuit with any errors or unnatural trends as in the case of the temperature being entered in as +23.0 °C when it was supposed to be - 23.0°C .
There will be subsequent posts on Eureka coming in the next day or two .

As L.A. County sheriff ’s deputies evacuated residents during last year ’s Station fire , a training officer with the department noticed a deputy acting strangely .
He was stumbling , then he fell over .
The deputy later admitted he was drinking vodka concealed in a Gatorade bottle during the deadly blaze .
The incidents , and others , are detailed in an oversight report released Tuesday that highlighted the department ’s struggles with employees who drink on the job or whose drunkenness results in problems off the job .
Alcohol - related incidents involving department employees have increased this year , according to findings released by the county Office of Independent Review .
There were 33 incidents from January through May , more than in the same period last year , including several cases in which deputies were found to be drunk on duty .

Sheriff Lee Baca acknowledged Tuesday that the report shows the ineffectiveness of recent department efforts to crack down on drinking .
In 2008 , he announced plans to bar deputies from carrying firearms while intoxicated .
But the deputies ’ union is fighting the rule , with critics saying it infringes on the rights of deputies .
Meanwhile the department has taken a softer approach , mandating that all employees involved in alcohol - related incidents meet personally with the department ’s second - in - command .
The number of incidents dropped in 2009 , only to pick up again this year .
On Tuesday , Baca vowed to come down harder on the issue .
The sheriff said he was preparing provisions that would lead to dismissals for off - duty deputies who shoot their weapons or respond belligerently to law enforcement officers while intoxicated .
He called on the deputies union “ to do what ’s right , ” particularly to not hold up his restriction on firearms possession while drinking .
Among other incidents mentioned in the report :
Advertisement
• An off - duty deputy was arrested on suspicion of drinking and driving with her children in the car , and then arrested months later on another DUI charge .
She was arrested a third time for allegedly shooting her gun negligently while off duty and under the influence of alcohol .
• An on - duty deputy was driving a county vehicle to an assignment while allegedly under the influence of alcohol .
He ran a red light , hitting another vehicle and injuring two passengers .
• A deputy called in sick but was later found to be out of state .
During the trip , she was kicked out of a casino while intoxicated for engaging in overly vulgar behavior during a “ booty shaking contest . ”
The deputy was arrested on a trespassing charge after resisting removal .
• Last month , Deputy Randy Barragan , 25 , was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon after he allegedly fired a handgun in the air on the Redondo Beach Pier after drinking at nearby restaurants .
Redondo Beach Police Sgt. Shawn Freeman said Barragan , an off - duty deputy , got out a revolver and fired the gun May 24 while hanging on the pier railing .
The girlfriend of the deputy knocked the gun out of his hand , and nearby fishermen tackled him .
They held him until officers who had already responded to reports of a man with a gun took him into custody , Freeman said .

• An off - duty deputy was arrested for allegedly driving with a blood - alcohol level more than twice the legal limit .
When officers stopped her , she asked to be let off “ since she was one of them . ”
Baca ’s plan to restrict deputies from carrying firearms while drinking is before the county Employee Relations Commission because of a challenge from the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs , said Michael Gennaco , head of the Office of Independent Review .
Brian Moriguchi , president of the Professional Peace Officers Assn. , said the ban would infringe on employees ’ constitutional rights by keeping them from drinking in their homes .
“ We do n’t promote deputies drinking and carrying their guns around and being reckless , ” said Moriguchi , whose union represents sergeants and lieutenants .
“ Our objection is to an ill - conceived policy that is not going to accomplish what it ’s intended to . ”

But sheriff ’s officials said the department plans to move forward regardless of union complaints .
“ We cannot afford to have drunk deputy sheriffs thinking their weapon is in their full control , ” Baca said .
He went on to connect the department ’s drinking issues to a wider societal problem .
“ Our entire nation … is socially tied to alcohol , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think anyone intends to start off as a drunk , unless you ’re an alcoholic . ”

" I 'm not surprised he 's quit , " Col Lawrence Wilkerson , former chief of staff to then secretary of state Colin Powell , told The Daily Telegraph .
" He was in a position that was largely powerless .
He had little control over what was happening but got the blame when things went wrong . "
Still , the long tale behind this finding shows just how difficult this disease is and why progress toward preventing or curing it has been so slow .
Ever since Alzheimer ’s disease was described by a German doctor , Alois Alzheimer , in 1906 , there was only one way to know for sure that a person had it .
A pathologist , examining the brain after death , would see microscopic black freckles , plaque , sticking to brain slices like barnacles .
Without plaque , a person with memory loss did not have the disease .
There is no treatment yet to stop or slow the progress of Alzheimer ’s .
But every major drug company has new experimental drugs it hopes will work , particularly if they are started early .
The questions though , are who should be getting the drugs and who really has Alzheimer ’s or is developing it ?
Even at the best medical centers , doctors often are wrong .
Twenty percent of people with dementia — a loss of memory and intellectual functions — who received a diagnosis of Alzheimer ’s , did not have it .
There was no plaque when their brains were biopsied .
Half with milder memory loss , thought to be on their way to Alzheimer ’s , do not get the disease .
And with such a high rate of misdiagnosis , some who are mistakenly told that they have Alzheimer ’s are not treated for conditions , like depression or low levels of thyroid hormone or drug side effects and interactions , that are causing their memory problems .
Brain scans that showed plaque could help with some fundamental questions — who has or is getting Alzheimer ’s , whether the disease ever stops or slows down on its own and even whether plaque is the main culprit causing brain cell death .

Green Change Wants Delaware to Revoke BP ’s Corporate Charter
24 Corporate Crime Reporter 26 ( 1 ) , June 25 , 2010
Some would criminally prosecute BP America and its executives for the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Others would debar BP from federal contracts .
But a group called Green Change is calling for the corporate death penalty .
It is calling on the state of Delaware to revoke BP ’s corporate charter .
“ BP deserves the corporate death penalty , ” Green Change co-founder Gary Ruskin told Corporate Crime Reporter last week .
“ BP America Inc. does not have a God given right to perpetually violate our laws with near impunity . ”
“ Look at BP ’s record .
The Gulf of Mexico catastrophe .
Three environmental crimes , one deferred prosecution agreement , and a very long string of big fines and other wrongdoing . ”
“ There comes a point when enough is enough .
Our nation should not have to tolerate any more abuse from this company .
No more deaths , no more catastrophes , no more giant pollution disasters . ”
“ The corporate death penalty will remove BP America Inc. from the field of action .
It will stop their carelessness and lawlessness – for sure . ”
“ If our laws mean anything at all , we ’ve got to draw a line in the sand and say that if you violate our laws again and again , you will lose your charter . ”
“ Deterrence is very important .
We ’ve got to revoke BP ’s charter to deter other companies from acting with such carelessness . ”
“ If we do n’t , then we basically invite other companies to cut corners everywhere , and disregard the law , because the consequences wo n’t be worth worrying about . ”
“ We can expect that the threat of charter revocation will make companies act with greater respect for environmental , health and safety laws . ”
“ Severe wrongdoing deserves severe punishment .
When a company does something as awful as the carelessness that lead to the Macondo oil rig blowout and disaster , they deserve the corporate death penalty . ”
“ This is a simple matter of justice and of the dignity of our society , and really , of all of us . ”
Ruskin sent letters last week to the leaders of the Delaware legislature and to Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden – the son of Vice President Joseph Biden .
“ Serial corporate criminals are willing to kill people and wildlife , poison the water and land , and then pay the relevant fines , because it is more profitable to do so than to respect life , wildlife , health , the environment and the law , ” Ruskin wrote .
“ It is for this reason that ordinary legal and regulatory action and fines cannot correct their behavior – drastic and permanent punitive actions are the only appropriate measures .
In this case , the proper penalty is to revoke the corporate charter of BP America Inc . ”
Attorney General Biden ’s office and the leaders of the Delaware legislature did not return calls seeking comment .
The Delaware General Assembly can revoke BP America ’s charter outright .
The Delaware Attorney General is empowered to ask the Delaware Court of Chancery to revoke BP America ’s charter , Ruskin said .
Ruskin said that as far as he knew , no for - profit corporate charter has been revoked by Delaware .
But it has happened elsewhere .
“ In the 1990 ’s , some Florida stock brokerage companies involved in pump - and - dump schemes had their charters revoked or dissolved for failure to file annual reports , ” Ruskin said .
“ In 2001 , the Texas Secretary of State revoked the charter of Lionheart Newspapers for nonpayment of franchise taxes . ”
“ But I am not familiar with any cases involving large corporations , or multinational corporations , in modern times , ” Ruskin said .
Since , there has been no adjudication of wrongdoing yet , and Ruskin is already calling for the death penalty for BP , is n’t Ruskin a little concerned that he ’s getting ahead of the game ?
“ There has n’t been adjudication , but BP has admitted they are responsible for the oil spill .
Tony Hayward said that BP is ‘ absolutely responsible ’ for the spill , ” Ruskin said .
“ We know already from one month of news stories about the recklessness of the company and how they cut corners and their misconduct .
There is extensive evidence of this .
Look at the Wall Street Journal ’s investigation of the oil rig blowout on May 27th .
And read the letter from House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman to Tony Hayward .
It ’s devastating .
It lays out lots of evidence that ‘ BP repeatedly chose risky procedures in order to reduce costs and save time and made minimal efforts to contain the added risk . ’”
“ Also , a quarter owner of the rig – Andarko – said that the blast resulted from BP ’s reckless operation .
How much more evidence do we need ?
There is ample evidence that this company has an awful corporate culture – from its record of accidents , from its lawlessness , and from its own internal reviews that told it to be much more careful about obeying environmental and safety laws . ”
Why is there such strong support in America for the death penalty for individuals – but we rarely hear about the death penalty for corporations ?
“ There are lots of reasons , ” Ruskin says .
“ There is a tremendous amount of media attention devoted to street crime , but very little to corporate crime .
Why ?
Most media outlets carry advertising , and I ’ll bet that giant corporations will be less likely to advertise in newspapers and magazines that advocate for the corporate death penalty . ”
“ And so many of our news outlets are part of big media conglomerates that do n’t want to promote any discussion of the corporate death penalty . ”
“ Second , because we have a corrupt campaign finance system at the federal level and in most of our states . ”
“ Since so many of our elected officials get so much of their campaign contributions from corporate officials , they are not willing to bite the hand that keeps them in office . ”
“ Third , because corporate crime is more complicated than street crime . ”
“ Fourth , because companies spend a huge amount of money in advertising to make us all think that they are great corporate citizens . ”
“ Fifth , because the Justice Department does n’t adequately publicize statistics about corporate crime and trends in corporate crime . ”
“ When you add it all up , our elected officials act like the most permissive kindergarten teacher in the world , when it comes to punishing corporate crime and violence . ”
Do n’t we lose leverage over BP if we revoke its corporate charter ?
“ I think you gain leverage , ” Ruskin says .
“ If BP America is put in receivership , the company will find it harder to advocate for its own interests , because they wo n’t really exist anymore .
Its assets would be sold off to pay the creditors , like people in the Gulf states . ”
Most Americans would think that if they start a business , it belongs to them , not to the government .
But you believe a corporation is a creature of the state and serves the state ?
“ Yes .
Corporations are artificial entities created by states .
States grant them powers and privileges , as a part of their corporate charter .
These powers and privileges are revocable .
States do not , or should not , charter companies so that they can break our laws .
When a corporation abuses its charter , for example , by repeatedly violating the law , its charter should be revoked , to put an end to its lawlessness . ”

At least 16 people have died in the US state of Arkansas after floodwaters hit campsites in a mountainous national park , state governor Mike Beebe says .
Two dozen people were taken to hospital and some 30 others remained unaccounted for .
Helicopters are taking part in the search in a remote , mountainous area in the state 's south - west .
The operation is focused on campsites along the Little Missouri and Caddo rivers in the Ouchita Mountains .
Mr Beebe said the deaths had occurred at about 0530 , when the floodwaters reached their peak .
A river gauge at Langley , just south of Albert Pike in the Ouachita National Forest , showed the water rose 8 ft ( 2.4 m ) in one hour , according to the US Geological Survey .
The National Weather Service said 7.6in ( 19.3 cm ) of rain had fallen overnight .
Some campers described how they had to cling to trees for hours to survive .
The remains of destroyed tents and damaged log cabins were later seen lining the banks of the swollen rivers .
The governor said damage to the area was comparable to a strong tornado .
' People trapped '
Police spokesman Bill Sadler told US network CNN : " We believe there are still individuals trapped in the area .
Image caption Some campers later said they had to cling to trees for hours to survive raging torrents pouring through the campsites .
It [ pick - up truck ] was just like a boat tied to a tree Marc Marshall , Survivor In pictures : Arkansas floodwaters
" The primary mission of the Arkansas state police working with the local authorities right now is to get the living out of that area and locate the dead . "
Officials were bringing in a refrigerated truck to act as a temporary morgue , he said .
The authorities warned that it could take days to find survivors or recover bodies because of the rugged terrain .
Police originally put the death toll at 12 and later updated it to 20 , but the governor 's office said the higher figure had been based on an erroneous figure from a rescue worker .
It is not clear whether all those killed were staying at the campsites washed away by the floodwaters .
Brigette Williams , of the American Red Cross in the state capital Little Rock , said between 200 and 300 people were believed to be in the area at the time but it was unclear how many were campers and how many local residents .
Rescue worker Gary Fox said the Albert Pike Recreation Area , a 54 - unit campsite in the national forest , was packed with families on holiday when the floodwaters hit .
More than 20 people were taken to hospital and another 60 were rescued from the steep Ouachita Mountains valley .
The region includes a mix of campsites , hunting grounds and private homes .
Marc and Stacy McNeil of Marshall , Texas , survived by hauling their pick - up truck between two trees and standing in waist - deep water .
" It was just like a boat tied to a tree , " Mr McNeil said , describing how the truck bobbed up and down .
They said the water kept rising throughout the night .
By dawn the rain stopped , the water receded and they were able to walk to safety .
National Guard troops are helping to look for those affected .
This is the first dispatch from Charlie Skelton 's Bilderblog .

Another year , another Bilderberg .
The first " participants " ( as the delegates are known ) wo n't be arriving until Thursday , but already the Hotel Dolce in Sitges is buzzing with anticipation .
This Catalan seaside town has n't hosted an event as large and politically sensitive as Bilderberg since the legendary 2008 Foam Party at the Mr Gay Sitges awards night .
Last year , Bilderberg was held in Vouliagmeni , on the coast just south of Athens .
The Greek minister of finance attended , the minister of foreign affairs , and the governor of the National Bank of Greece .
A few months later , Greece was bankrupt and Athens was in flames .
So … good luck , Madrid !
Police are already stretching their red stripy tape around the hotel , and zipping up and around the local roads in their squad cars , sniffing for trouble .
I 'm really hoping there 's none to find .
The Spanish are promising a beach party and an " awareness camp " , with political discussion forums and meditation zones .
I plan to spend at least part of Friday sitting cross-legged in a campsite , sending beams of white light up the hill and into the hotel .
Feel my love , Marcus Agius – Chairman of Barclays and senior non-executive director on the BBC 's new executive board .
Let it surround you , Queen Sofia of Spain .
Do n't fight it , president of the World Bank .
You can't beat the love .
It would be nicer if the interface between Bilderberg and the world could be softer – if it could turn an open face towards us , rather than the barrel of a machine gun .
What I 'm hoping is that this year , in the all - new CamCleggian spirit of openness and political transparency , any British elected official who attends the meeting – and I 'm talking to you , Kenneth Clarke and George Osborne – will tell us they attended , tell us what they spoke about , and tell us what the next 12 months has in store .
I do n't think that 's too much to ask .
Not that anyone is really asking .
I 've come along again this year because I had the horrible , nagging thought that no other journalists would .
Not that I 'm a proper journalist .
Hardly : consider me an interested citizen of the world come to bear witness to a peculiar , important , and unsettling event .
For a long and luxurious weekend at the Dolce Sitges , relishing its " new and creative buffet concepts " ( a table with food on it ) , prime ministers will mingle with European royalty , with various EU commissioners , with representatives from Goldman Sachs , Microsoft , AIB , Deutsche Bank , Chase Manhattan and Royal Dutch Shell .
They 'll clink glasses with President Obama 's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan , Richard Holbrooke ( he is confirmed for this year ) .
And join the Friday night conga line behind the US treasury secretary ( Tim Geithner went last year ; he goes a lot ) .
We can reasonably expect the head of the Federal Reserve , the president of the World Bank , the secretary general of Nato … they 've all attended in the past and many will attend again .
So yes , important it is ; to think otherwise is painfully naive ( see below for the usual " just a big boys ' club " comments …)
The conference hotel may be perched above a golf course , and boast two ping pong tables , but this four - day event is n't about who is better at table tennis , Ken Clarke or David Rockefeller ( it 's Rockefeller ) .
This is about big business , global financial strategy and the economic future of Europe … if indeed it has one .
And most importantly , this four - day event does n't start until tomorrow – and continues all the way through the weekend – so if you 're a PROPER journalist reading this , or a blogger , or simply a curious citizen of a Europe teetering on the edge , then come along .
Please come .
I 'll buy you a Catalan beer .
I recommend the Rosita .
It 's fruity but ballsy – not unlike the winner of Mr Gay Sitges 2008 .

While he's not the biggest guy on the ice , he sure can score goals .
Skinner finished second in OHL goal scoring this past season , finishing with an even 50 .
As with most prospects , he has some bulking up to do and needs to work on his skating .
He was a teammate of Jackets prospect John Moore last season with the Kitchener Rangers .
He would be a bit of a gamble for most teams given his size and average skating ability , but he 's absolutely lethal around the net .
2009 /2010 Regular Season Stats :
GP G A PTS +/- PIM 64 50 40 90
+7 72
Scouting Report ( The Scouting Report ) :
Very few would have been able to predict that Jeff Skinner would be the OHL leader in goals in January at the start of the season , but that is the case right now .
Skinner has taken off this season with the resurgent Kitchener Rangers , establishing himself as one of the most potent snipers in the Canadian Hockey League .
Skinner ’s ability to lurk in the offensive zone and jump on opportunities will surely be enough for a team to take him in Round 1 , but there will be some concerns over his transition to the pros .
Skinner ’s skating still needs some refinement , especially given his stature .
There will also be some risk associated with his ability to handle the physical game of the NHL , as he will struggle to find the time and space he does at this level .
Why he'd be a good fit in Columbus :
To be honest , I do n't think he would be a good fit in Columbus .
If the Jackets are going to draft a center with a high pick , they need to draft a guy with size and playmaking ability .
His ability to score goals combined with his lack of size will likely see him moved to the wing as a pro anyway , and that 's not an area of need for Columbus going forward .
Skinner in Action :
I found this great video made by 519 :
I did n't plan to pick a fight with Steve Jobs last night .
It just sort of happened : An iPad advertisement ticked me off ; I sent the Apple CEO an angry email ; he told me about " freedom from porn . "
The electronic debate proceeded from there .
Of course , there was a bit more to it than that .
There 's the context : Jobs ' legal fight with my employer Gawker Media , over the handling of an iPhone prototype ; my long - simmering worries about Apple 's growing power to limit self expression through its lockdown on iPad apps ; and the fact that my wife , who might normally ( and quite sensibly ) veto the idea of spending Friday night sending email flames , was out of town .
So in retrospect I was primed to lash out .
But there was some serendipity too : Watching a new episode of 30 Rock on my digital video recorder , I somehow failed to skip over an Apple ad I 'd never seen before , one that billed the iPad as nothing less than " a revolution . "
You can see an excerpt of the ad at the bottom of this post .
With a Stinger cocktail at my side , I dashed off a short , pointed question to Jobs ' well - known email address .
A few hours later — after midnight here in California — he got back to me .
And I got back to him .
And so on .
I did n't identify myself as a writer for Gawker in my initial email , sent from my ryantate.com email address .
But , as you 'll see in the exchange below , I eventually made my affiliation clear , and Jobs did n't seem bothered .
Between that and the fact that Jobs regularly uses emails to disclose new information to the public , knowing full well recipients now regularly make the exchanges public , I feel fine reproducing the thread below .
It 's a feisty discussion , as you 'll see .
And heated , especially on my part .
Rare is the CEO who will spar one - on - one with customers and bloggers like this .
Jobs deserves big credit for breaking the mold of the typical American executive , and not just because his company makes such hugely superior products :
Jobs not only built and then rebuilt his company around some very strong opinions about digital life , but he 's willing to defend them in public .
Vigorously .
Bluntly .
At two in the morning on a weekend .
As much as Jobs and his actions anger me , and as harsh as I was to him , I came away from the exchange impressed with his willingness to engage .
Some notes on the actual content follow after the emails .
Click any message to enlarge :
A few notes on the emails :
There 's something absurdly Orwellian about Jobs ' line that the iPad provides " freedom from porn . "
It 's a statement I suspect will haunt him .
My line about Flash and my MacBook Pro is silly ; Flash as a Web plugin is , as I myself have written , a resource hog , no matter how well the miraculous battery in my Apple laptop handles that hoggery .
There 's no telling how Flash might hobble my iPad ' 's A4 processor .
But cross -compiled Flash apps are an entirely different matter :
They run as native Objective C code , and Apple has a chance to review them for performance .
Apple has never tried to argue that cross-compiled Flash wears batteries down any more quickly than other Objective C code , and in fact approved more than two dozen such apps before changing its policies .
Speaking of regrettable lines :
Why the heck did I bring up my wife in connection with " freedom from porn ? "
I was trying to say it 's a canard that porn somehow harms families , or something terrible and shameful , so I mentioned the other half of my family .
I was a little unfair summarizing my contact with Time Inc. ; the company has not " crowed " about its iPad bridge software , and in fact has plans to iteratively improve its iPad product .
That line was based on email exchange that I had with a Time Inc. executive who was speaking off the record and not on behalf of the company .
As such , I 've blurred a name that I had no business dropping .
But I do think , as I said , that a native Objective C app that merely contains magazine content , like Time 's , is a lot less exciting than an app that has some real interactivity , even if it 's been cross compiled from Flash .
And here is the end of the iPad commercial that set me off :

WASHINGTON , DC --
In 1970 , nine percent of California 's population was comprised of immigrants ; by 2008 it was 27 percent .
A new report from the Center for Immigration Studies ( CIS ) finds that as a result of immigration , California now has the least - educated labor force of any state .
Historically , California was not a state with a disproportionately large unskilled population , like Appalachia or parts of the South .
However , immigration has transformed the state .
Absent a change in immigration policy , other parts of the country may be transformed in a similar fashion .
The report , A State Transformed : Immigration and the New California , ' is authored by Steven A. Camarota and Karen Jensenius .
Among the findings :
In 1970 California had the 7th most educated work force of the 50 states in terms of the share of its workers who had completed high school .
By 2008 , it ranked 50th , making it the least - educated state .
One in six workers in the state has not graduated high school .
The decline in education in California is large relative to other states .
The percentage of Californians who have completed high school has increased since 1970 ; however , all other states made much more progress in improving education levels .
As a result , California has fallen behind the rest of the country .
The large relative decline in education in California is a direct result of immigration .
Without immigrants , the share of California 's labor force that has completed high school would be above the national average .
There is no indication that California will soon close the educational gap .
California ranks 35th in terms of the share of its 19 - year - olds who have completed high school .
Moreover , one - third of the adult immigrants who settled in the state in 2007 and 2008 had not completed high school , adding 91,000 new unskilled adults to the state .
In 1970 , California was right at the national average in terms of income inequality , ranking 25th in the nation .
By 2008 , it was the 6th most unequal state in the country based on the commonly used Gini coefficient , which measures how evenly income is distributed .
California 's income distribution in 2008 was more unequal than was Mississippi's in 1970 .
While historical data on welfare are not available , we can say that in 2008 California ranked 11th highest in terms of the share of its households accessing at least one major welfare program and 8th highest in terms of the share of the state 's population without health insurance .
The large share of California 's adults who have very little education is likely to strain social services and make it challenging for the state to generate sufficient tax revenue to cover the demands for services made by its large unskilled population .
Discussion .
California is home to the high - tech and entertainment industries , has one of the nation 's largest tourism industries , and has the most productive agricultural land in the country .
Historically , it was not a state with a disproportionately large unskilled population , unlike Appalachia , parts of the American South , or the Rio Grande valley .
Relative to other states , it had one of the more educated labor forces in terms of the share of workers who had completed high school .
But today it is the state with the largest share of its labor force that has not completed high school .
Analysis of Census Bureau data through 2008 by the Center for Immigration Studies shows this relative change is a direct result of immigration .
California has become a state with one of the most skewed income distributions and it is among the states with high rates of welfare use and lack of health insurance .
Immigrants in the state are six times more likely than natives not to have completed high school .
While some employers argue that a continuing stream of unskilled immigrant workers is desirable , such a policy has consequences .
Productivity , standard of living , welfare use , health insurance coverage , and the tax base are heavily impacted by education levels .
The low level of educational attainment in the state is likely to create significant challenges for California in the foreseeable future .

Image caption Nearly 90 % of Bangladeshis use groundwater
Up to 77 million people in Bangladesh have been exposed to toxic levels of arsenic from drinking water in recent decades , according to a Lancet study .
The research assessed nearly 12,000 people in a district of the capital Dhaka for over a period of 10 years .
More than 20 % of deaths among those assessed were caused by the naturally occurring poisonous element , it found .
The World Health Organization said the exposure was " the largest mass poisoning of a population in history " .
It began after hand - pumped wells were installed in the 1970s to tap groundwater .
Scientists say even small amounts of arsenic over a long period can cause cancer of the bladder , kidney , lung or skin .
Bangladesh was chosen for the study because nearly 90 % of the population uses groundwater as its primary source of fresh water .

Have you noticed that in this book Captain lost his beloved hat ?
The hat that he had to catch when it fell even though it almost caused him to fall from the rope he was holding on to and into the river .
The hat that he had to go back for when if fell from his head even though him and Tintin were in a hurry to catch a plane .
He obviously must have taken it off in Mr. Carreidas ’ plane and forgotten it ( in the confusion of it being hijacked ) and that was the last we saw of it .
He must of then bought a new one just like it in time for his next adventure in Tintin and the Picaros .

In February , Epic Beard Man ( aka Thomas Bruso ) became an Internet celebrity after video of an altercation he was involved in on an Oakland bus went viral .
( Background here . )
A slew of spin - off memes , mash - ups , and even a video documentary quickly emerged .
( My favorites focused on " Amber Lamps , " the headphone - wearing young woman in the background of the video who seemed completely oblivious to the violence taking place just a few feet away from her . )
What happened to Bruso since the fight though ?
The current issue of the SF Weekly tells the tale of this eccentric and unlikely Internet sensation .
It 's not a happy story .
From the SF Weekly ( image below by Frank Gaglione ) :
The phone rang , and Bruso asked me to answer it .
In the month since he became Epic Beard Man , he has become wary , and not just because of the kids who call to ask him how much he 'll charge to shine their shoes .
You can't have a gloves - off racial clash of the kind rarely seen by polite society and expect to avoid the fallout .
Dozens of black men posted videos on YouTube taking Bruso 's side , arguing that he was defending himself against a fool who read racism where there was none .
Yet white supremacists commenting on message boards saw an all - powerful white man triumphing over a scraggly thug .
The far - right Occidental Quarterly referred to Bruso as a " folk hero to hundreds of thousands of White Americans who are tired of being perpetual victims of violent hate crimes in their own land . "
Bay Area National Anarchists , which preaches white separatism , attempted to organize a rally to support him .
There 's no doubt Bruso uses wildly politically incorrect terms , but people who know him insist he 's no racist at heart .
His best friend , Junior , who is black , will tell you so , and Bruso attends a Baptist church with mostly black parishioners .
Even the bus driver , who is also black , told police that she did n't believe Bruso was making the racial remarks " in a mean way . "
According to the police report , she said he " did n't know his comments were insulting and … appeared to have a mental disorder . "
When the cops arrived after the bus fight and arrested Bruso , he was committed for 72 hours to a psychiatric ward at the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Oakland .
He was charged with battery resulting in injury of a transit passenger , but Lovette told police he was n't interested in pressing charges .
Yet as soon as Bruso was released from the hospital , white racists started calling to congratulate him , their salutations turning to threats upon finding out he did n't share their views .
Black people called with promises of violence .
Bruso started to worry .
In his big - talking moments , he 'll say things like , " You 're welcome to come to the funeral , girl .
I 've been threatened 17 times already .
It 's just a matter of time before they sneak up on me and blow me away . "
But behind the exaggeration , he got tired of the attention .
Soon after the fight , he shaved off his epic beard .
But then a video of him without his beard was posted online , too .
I picked up the phone .
It was one of Bruso 's sisters , calling from Wisconsin .
She demanded that I leave immediately : " It 's all a bunch of lies ! " she shouted .
According to a recent story in the Philadelphia Inquirer , American attendance at foreign language films dropped exponentially during the last decade .
Carrie Rickey reports that foreign film ticket sales account for less than 1 percent of business at the US box office .
Whatever lead to this drop in screenings and ticket sales is difficult to identify .
It might have been any combination of factors , such as film studios ’ marketing techniques , increased DVD distribution and sales , domestic and international politics , and even possibly a growing form of lingual xenophobia throughout the nation .
Foreign films have n’t always fared so poorly in the U.S. , Rickey writes :
The decline in number and popularity of foreign - language films in America is a historical paradox .
Before World War I , when America was at its most isolationist , more foreign than American films played on U.S. screens .
Today , despite a globalized economy , domestic product dominates to the virtual exclusion of all else .
We do n’t want foreign films to disappear from the American movie landscape– they remain a great way to expose American moviegoers to new languages and cultures .
We ’re starting a new feature that will highlight some of the best foreign films playing at the theater .
We ’ll provide you with plot synopses and trailers .
All you need to do is make your way to a local art house and enjoy these films on the big screen .
Everyone Else
Director : Maren Ade , Language : German
On the surface , Chris and Gitti are perfectly in love while enjoying their time in Sardinia .
Beneath their playful romps , secret rituals and silly habits however lies an underlying tension .
Full of verve , the idiosyncratic Gitti is fearless in expressing her love and devotion for Chris , while Chris is more reserved in his outlook on life .
When they accidentally run into another , obviously happier and more successful couple their fragile relationship destabilizes .
But as their fears and insecurities are brutally exposed , Chris and Gitti get a second chance to discover themselves and each other – and to be as happy as everyone else .

Mid-August Lunch
Director : Gianni Di Gregorio , Language : Italian
This international smash hit from the makers of Gomorrah is an utterly charming tale of good food , feisty ladies and unlikely friendships during a very Roman holiday .
Broke , and armed with only a glass of wine and a wry sense of humor , middle - aged Gianni ( director and screenwriter Gianni Di Gregorio ) is forced to entertain his 93 - year - old mother and three other lively mamas in their ancient apartment during Italy ’s biggest summer holiday , Pranzo di Ferragosto .
Winner of prizes at international festivals including Best First Film at Venice and the Satyajit Ray Award at London , plus the Golden Snail at the Academy of Food and Film in Bologna , Mid-August Lunch is both warmly vibrant family drama and delicately balanced comedy of manners .

A Prophet
Director : Jacques Audiard , Language : French

Arriving at the jail entirely alone , he appears younger and more fragile than the other convicts .

But Malik is brave and a fast learner , daring to secretly develop his own plans .

Home to around 240 homes , Camp Logan is bordered by Memorial Park to the west , Arnot Street to the south , and Westcott Street to the east .
It sits just north of Memorial Elementary School .
Camp Logan is north of the Glen Cove / Crestwood subdivisions , two of the most expensive neighborhoods in Houston .
Conveniently located just off Katy Freeway ( Interstate 10 ) and Memorial Drive , the neighborhood is an easy jump off point to several key districts , including downtown , the Texas Medical Center , and the Galleria .
An oak tree that predates the Texas Republic serves as the neighborhood ’s landmark .
Camp Logan has a triangular street pattern with winding , tree - lined roads .
With Memorial Park at its western border and the Washington Avenue Corridor / Rice Military area to the east , the community has an element of serenity amid a bustling urban area .

RouteNote has just launched a major upgrade of our site and services .
RouteNote is a leader in digital music distribution and with this new release we hope that we can help even more artists worldwide .
RouteNote improvements :
Additional payment options in which artists pay a small yearly subscription for the RouteNote service and keep 100 % of their revenues .
Updated management system
Improved upload process
New Payment options :
RouteNote artists have always had the option to use our distribution service for free and keep 90 % of their revenues .
Here at RouteNote we are trying to help even more artists and provide more options .
Thus , we have added a Premium solution , which allows artists to sign up to the RouteNote service and pay a small subscription and keep 100 % of their royalties .
We hope that this will appeal to a broader range of artists and will allow artists to keep as much revenues in their pockets as possible .
Premium costs are as follows : $ 10 for singles , $ 20 for EP ’s ( 2 - 6 tracks ) , $ 30 for an album ( 7 - 18 tracks ) and $ 45 for extended albums ( 19 tracks and over ) , all prices are per year .
Artists will also have complete flexibility and will be able to upgrade to the Premium service from the Free option and vice verse .
Therefore , artists will always be able to pay the lowest possible price to distribute their music to the worlds largest online stores and streaming services .
p.s. UPC codes and ISRC codes will always remain completely free within the RouteNote platform .
Updated Management System :
RouteNote has made a lot of improvements when it comes to our content management system .
There are now major upgrades to content pages , which will make managing your music a lot easier and more efficient .
Artists now have the ability to quickly see and edit all the albums and tracks within their catalogue , as well as upgrading options to the Premium service and even downgrading from the Premium service to the Free option .
Improved Upload Process :
RouteNote ’s upload process has been improved even further and now uploading your music could not be simpler .
RouteNote has merged the Single and Album upload tools to create the most efficient and simplest tool possible .
Firstly the artist selects the program they would like to use ( Premium or Free ) , then they are prompted to fill out the required meta data and choose their partners .
Once that ’s completed artists upload their music and done .
Its that simple !
Unlike most other music distributors our content uploading process is very simple and instantaneous , no need to run through hundreds of emails about agreements , etc. RouteNote is always available for either phone or email support from our expert support team .
About RouteNote
RouteNote is a leading digital music distribution service providing artists instant access to the worlds largest online music stores and streaming services .
Designed and built to take advantage of the shift towards independent and self - publication through online and mobile music outlets , and the consumer switch to online purchasing as outlined by the success of iTunes , Amazon and Spotify , RouteNote is partnered with some of the biggest retailers on the web to give artists massive and immediate availability for their tracks .
Onsite , artists can upload tracks to the RouteNote catalogue and enter into a non exclusive agreement permitting us to distribute their music to a worldwide audience in a matter of moments .
They then select partnered retail outlets that they wish their music to be available through and within moments their songs will begin earning money as part of a world wide , web wide , distribution network .
p.s. The Desktop upload tool is currently in the process of being upgraded , so you will not be able to upload via that until the new version is available .
Additionally , we still have a few small browser compatibility issues , all are just looks and will be fixed very soon .
The world 's most ancient frogs may soon be mined to extinction , if the New Zealand government 's plans to open up a conservation area for mining go ahead , conservation biologists warn .
The primitive Archey 's frog ( Leiopelma archeyi ) and Hochstetter 's frog ( Leiopelma hochstetteri ) are two of the species that inhabit the area of ' high conservation value ' on New Zealand 's North Island where the mining is planned to take place .
Archey 's frog is currently ranked top of the Zoological Society of London 's ( ZSL ) EDGE of Existence amphibian list , making it the most evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered amphibian on the planet .
Described as a " living fossil , " Archey 's frog is almost indistinguishable from the fossilised remains of frogs that walked amongst the dinosaurs 150 million years ago .
" In the year when reducing biodiversity loss is high on the political agenda , it is inconceivable to think that we'd put the nail in the coffin of some of our rarest and most extraordinary frog species , " say Helen Meredith , EDGE of Existence amphibian conservation projects coordinator at ZSL .
She adds : " We will be faced with these kinds of decisions again and again in the future .
Now is the time to start recognising the long - term value of our natural world over any short - term economic gains . "
The frog populations have been intensively monitored for over 40 years , representing the best data set on frog populations in the world .
The proposed mining will cut through the heart of these monitoring sites .
Dr Phil Bishop , leader of the University of Otago 's frog research says : " Only four species of frog survive in New Zealand , and this proposed mining activity could cause the extinction of one of New Zealand 's native amphibians , and a severe decline in another -- a devastating blow to global amphibian conservation . "
7,000 hectares of land in the West Coast 's Paparoa National Park , Great Barrier Island and the Coromandel Peninsula has been proposed to be considered for mining of coal , gold , iron ore and other rare minerals .
The North Island brown kiwi , long - tailed bats , striped geckos and Helm 's butterfly are some of the other rare and endangered species found in these protected areas .
The New Zealand government is now holding a public consultation on whether the conservation status of the area should be downgraded to allow mining to take place .
The closing date for submissions is May 26 , 2010 ( http://www.med.govt.nz/Schedule4).
ZSL conservationists are now calling for UK residents to support the protection of New Zealand 's unique flora and fauna by submitting to the public consultation process .
It is time to prepare for Dialogue Free Comics Day 5 !
If you know the drill , the next Dialogue Free Comics day is Monday , December 1st , 2014 .
I , Sanjay Kulkaček ( Cowbirds in Love ) , am taking over the primary responsibility for running the show from Noel Curry ( Milton ’s Life , DJ Bogtrotter ) because he ’s busy with other stuff !
Email me at sanjay@cowbirdsinlove.com or comment on this blog if you want to get involved .
I ’ll need your comic ’s name , when you plan on updating , a link to your comic , and a way to contact you .
If you ’ve never heard of it before , or want more details , read on …
One of the most recognizable components of comics is the juxtaposition of words and text .
Consider , for instance , how easily a speech bubble is used as a symbol of the medium .
Pretty easily !
However , though recognizable , this juxtaposition is UNESSENTIAL !
Comics do n’t need dialogue .
Comics do n’t even need words .
But lots of cartoonists feel powerless without them .
Noel Curry invented Dialogue Free Comic
Day to challenge himself .
The rules are as follows :
Post a comic utterly without dialogue on Dialogue Free Comic Day ( in this case , December 1st , a Monday ) .
If you do n’t update on Dialogue Free Comic Day and do n’t feel like making an exception , update on the closest day BEFORE Dialogue Free Comic Day .
Your comic does n’t have to be utterly without words , just dialogue .
Though this is encouraged especially if you want to challenge yourself more .
On the day of , I will display all the participant comics here with links back to their home sites , and we ’ll all get a chance to enjoy people ’s fine work .
If you ’d rather your comic not be posted here and I just post a link , let me know .
When I make my comics , I find I am usually not thinking visually .
I use dialogue as training wheels .
For me , Dialogue Free Comic
Day is wonderful because it challenges me and helps me grow a little as an artist .
But there are other great reasons to participate , including the joy of doing something together with your fellow artists , and getting a few eyes on your work that would n’t have seen it otherwise ( please , draw a dialogueless comic for me for the exposure ! )
If that appeals to you , come join me on December 1st.
P.S. December 1st is my nephew ’s birthday .
He is turning 4 and does n’t know how to read , so keeping your comic dialogue free will be especially useful for him .
P.P.S. Your comic absolutely does not need to be appropriate for a 4 - year - old .
P.P.P.S.
But if you DO want to write him a comic , he likes dinosaurs , trains , cars , and the color pink .
P.P.P.P.S. Who does n’t ?
Let ’s hear it for not saying anything – that ’s right , it ’s “ Dialogue Free Comics Day 4 ” .
Friday May 17th is the date and hopefully by now , you know the drill , so it ’s time to get your brains thinking visually .
Too often , when writing webcomics ( Milton ’s Life and DJ Bogtrotter ) , I forget that this is primarily a visual artform and so to emphasise that , I ’ve set myself the challenge of posting a dialogue free comic on that day and I ’d like you to join me .
If you do n’t post on a Friday , then just make it whatever day is nearest , as long as it ’s before Friday 18th .
I will link to the webcomics that have joined in , tweet about their involvement and , on the day , advertise it on the blog beneath my comic .
If you do the same , it ’ll be a fun way for us to promote each other ’s webcomics .
If you want to join in just email me at noel@miltonslife.com or leave your details in the comments section .
Please list your webcomic and the day that you ’ll be posting your dialogue - free comic .
I will email anyone who has signed up nearer the date to remind them .
Cheers Noel Curry P.S.
It is allowed to have text on signs or sound effects in the comic , but extra kudos will be given to those who keep their comics completely letter free .
Okay , it ’s time for this franchise to start going rapidly downhill – that ’s right , it ’s “ Dialogue Free Comics Day 3 ” .
Friday May 18th is the date and hopefully by now , you know the drill , so it ’s time to get your brains thinking visually .

Of all the MPs who could have been appointed to the health select committee on Thursday , Conservatives Nadine Dorries and David Tredinnick are perhaps the most controversial choices .
One attracted ridicule for claiming that an unborn foetus could punch its way out of the womb , while the other is a supporter of astrology who once asserted that blood does n't clot under a full moon .
The inclusion of either on any select committee is worrying , but for both to have been elected to the health committee is an extremely disturbing development .
Mid-Bedfordshire MP Nadine Dorries has been involved in select committees before .
As a member of the innovation , universities , science and skills committee , she achieved an attendance rate of just 2 % .
Having dipped her toe in the water , she then took up a place on the science and technology select committee , but clearly at this point she had overstretched herself , because she failed to attend a single meeting .
Critics will be hoping that she maintains the same record at health – certainly I 'd happily bet dinner on Nadine 's attendance failing to reach double figures in her new role .
Dorries ' primary interest in the health arena is abortion , a debate in which she has previous form .
Back in 2007 Ben Goldacre wrote about dubious evidence presented to the science and technology select committee that supported Dorries ' anti-abortion views .
Goldacre 's article prompted Dorries to issue a bizarre call for an enquiry into how select committee evidence – which is supposed to be in the public domain – got into the public domain .
Over the years , Dorries has issued a number of ill - founded claims about abortion .
They include the fairytale " hand of hope " story that she helped to propagate across the web ; the incorrect assertion that the NHS did n't carry out abortions after 16 weeks ; the claim that charity Marie Stopes International supported her policy views ; an attempt to dismiss scientific studies that disagreed with her view as " an " insult to the intelligence of the public " ; and some rather dubious interpretations of opinion polls that led a frustrated Dawn Primarolo , then minister of state for public health , to exclaim that " The Honorable Lady has asserted many things to be facts that are not . "
Faced with Dorries ' cavalier approach to science - based policy , it 's hard for the rational voter to imagine a worse candidate for a position on the health select committee , but the Conservative Party has managed it , with a second seat on the committee handed to the extraordinary character of David Tredinnick , MP for the constituency of Bosworth , and possibly Narnia .
Tredinnick 's passion for " healthcare research " landed him in trouble during the expenses scandal last year , in which he was caught claiming £ 700 for " computer software and consultancy to investigate whether astrology can be linked to alternative medicine . "
Protesting his innocence , he explained : " There are aspects of this such as plant cycles , the tides , that are linked to the moon .
That 's a fact of life , and there is a school of thought that says the moon affects other things as well .
It 's easy to make fun of me over this but the fact is there is a link . "
Indeed , Tredinnick 's views go further .
In a Commons debate on Complementary and Alternative Medicine last year he made the extraordinary claim that " ... at certain phases of the moon there are more accidents .
Surgeons will not operate because blood clotting is not effective . "
One wonders if Tredinnick wraps himself in wool and plaster at every full moon , lest a stray paper cut cause his blood to drain completely from his body .
Tredinnick is also a passionate advocate of homeopathy , and has filed a string of Early Day Motions in an effort to raise support for magical homeopathic remedies in parliament .
EDMs are listed with their signatories on the internet , providing a handy guide to the identity of the more credulous and ill - informed MPs .
The latest of these EDMs came in a flurry of activity this week .
First , the British Medical Association was called to account for daring to express the opinion – backed of course by last year 's science and technology select committee report – that homeopathy should not be funded by the taxpayer .
Another three consisted of the MP and some of his more gullible colleagues welcoming three recent studies into the efficacy of homeopathy .
These have already been drily amended by Liberal Democrat MP Julian Huppert , who tells me : " I tabled the amendments having analysed the methodology in the articles referred to ; it turns out that none of them lead to his conclusions !
In one case , one of the authors said ' I was not convinced it was a sound study ' and asked to be removed as an author . "
One of the studies has raised eyebrows as the research was apparently conducted at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center , a prestigious Texan cancer research group .
The centre 's credibility will not be helped by its association with this work , although it appears that the lead author has since left the centre ( my thanks to @medtek for that hot tip ) .
The study has been debunked by bloggers and scientists like Dr Rachel Dunlop and the blogger Orac , not least because the paper contains no statistical analysis of the significance of the results .
In fact one of the authors left an extraordinary comment on Dunlop 's blog , claiming that some results were removed from the paper , that she had asked not to be named as a co-author , and that there were clear alternative explanations for the results .
In spite of all this , the paper has been seized on by the homeopathy community , happy to ignore the flaws and the overwhelming weight of evidence against this 18th century relic .
No evidence is too tenuous for homeopaths .
Naturally , there has been alarmed reaction to these appointments to the health select committee , but I suspect there 's little really to worry about .
Dorries may not even turn up , and Tredinnick is a figure unlikely to be taken seriously by policymakers .
Still , questions should be asked about why a party that rejected alternative medicine before the election , and promised an evidence - based approach to public health has managed to place two such clearly unqualified people on this important Commons committee .

Why I Quit A Six Figure Job
Xavier , 22 June 2010
I had the best job in the world .
My immediate team of ten people were all world class , and everyday I was able to work on hard and interesting challenges with them .
Hours were flexible — many of us worked seven to four ( by choice ! ) — and there was virtually never any overtime .
It was n’t unheard of to have our end of week review down at the pub .
I was paid a six figure salary .
After six months , I quit .
I need to be working for a reason .
Salaried work is n’t necessarily a bad thing , but the benefits it provided me were n’t benefits I actually wanted .
The Up
A job is easy money .
This is the obvious one .
The easiest , most comfortable way to get money is to work for someone else .
I currently have enough assets to sustain me for about two years , and there ’s nothing that I want to buy , so I do n’t need any more money .
A job is low risk .
Related to the last point but worth stating separately .
You get a paycheck every month , whether or not the company makes money .
This risk is shouldered by the owners of the company , and that ’s why they stand to gain ( or lose ) a lot more .
I can provide my own safety net at the moment , I do n’t need someone else to do it for me .
A job fills the time .
This is n’t relevant to me , but I ’ve heard a few times “ Wo n’t you get bored without a job ? ”
This is so far outside my conceptual space I did n’t even think of it .
If you are worried about being bored without a job , first try cutting TV out of your life and see how you find ways to fill that space .
A job is a TV that takes up even more time .
A job allows you to work on large challenges .
The type and scale of problems you are able to work on in IT at a big company are totally different to those you have the opportunity to attack flying solo .
It was a fantastic experience working on these projects , but I ’m no longer feeling inspired by them .
A job allows you to work with smart people .
This is actually the primary reason I accepted the job .
The opportunity to work in such a high calibre team in such an environment was one that does n’t come up often outside of salaried positions .
There are many other smart people I will get to work with outside of a job , but I will have to work harder to make that happen .
They ’re pretty fantastic benefits , and I do n’t regret the last six months in the slightest .
None of them are particularly relevant to me any more though , and when matched with the downsides the balance is no longer positive .
The Down
A job is working on someone else ’s schedule .
I was expected to be productive for eight hours in the middle of the day , five out of seven days a week .
This does n’t match my natural rhythm .
Some days I can work for fourteen hours , others I just need a day off .
If I work in the mornings only , I do n’t need a weekend .
I ’m really keen to explore different modes of working to find what is most productive for me .
A job means you have to show up .
Forty hours of every week were sold to someone else .
That ’s a huge opportunity cost .
I could n’t put everything on hold for a few days to chase a new idea .
I could n’t use the burst of energy I get often when I had a great idea late at night , because I had to be up early the next day .
A job is working on someone else ’s dream .
This is n’t necessarily bad — helping people achieve their dreams is fantastic — but those dreams did n’t align with my own .
A job is selling your time .
When I ’m working by the hour , there is an economic incentive to take longer to complete a task , but a professional one to be efficient .
I do n’t want competing motivations .
Why are the hours spent on a task even relevant ?
I want to sell value rather than my time .
So what am I going to do ?
For a large part , I do n’t know , and that ’s kind of the point .
I have a few projects I ’m working on — A tour of the US and this blog being two major ones — but now the biggest benefit is that I ’m free to say yes .
Yes to projects , yes to schemes , yes to travel , yes to “ let ’s stay up on a weeknight and watch B - grade sci - fi . ”
I do n’t want the best job in the world , I want the best life .
Messy , truncated data ?
Trees on the Gaspé Peninsula in Canada : one of several pieces of evidence for rising temperatures that have been called into question
Andrew Montford ’s The Hockey Stick Illusion is one of the best science books in years .
It exposes in delicious detail , datum by datum , how a great scientific mistake of immense political weight was perpetrated , defended and camouflaged by a scientific establishment that should now be red with shame .
It is a book about principal components , data mining and confidence intervals — subjects that have never before been made thrilling .
It is the biography of a graph .
I can remember when I first paid attention to the “ hockey stick ” graph at a conference in Cambridge .
The temperature line trundled along with little change for centuries , then shot through the roof in the 20th century , like the blade of an ice - hockey stick .
I had become somewhat of a sceptic about the science of climate change , but here was emphatic proof that the world was much warmer today ; and warming much faster than at any time in a thousand years .
I resolved to shed my doubts .
I assumed that since it had been published in Nature — the Canterbury Cathedral of scientific literature — it was true .
I was not the only one who was impressed .
The graph appeared six times in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) ’s third report in 2001 .
It was on display as a backdrop at the press conference to launch that report .
James Lovelock pinned it to his wall .
Al Gore used it in his film ( though describing it as something else and with the Y axis upside down ) .
Its author shot to scientific stardom .
“ It is hard to overestimate how influential this study has been , ” said the BBC .
The hockey stick is to global warming what St Paul was to Christianity .
Of course , there is other evidence for global warming , but none of it proves that the recent warming is unprecedented .
Indeed , quite the reverse : surface temperatures , sea levels , tree lines , glacier retreats , summer sea ice extent in the Arctic , early spring flowers , bird migration , droughts , floods , storms — they all show change that is no different in speed or magnitude from other periods , like 1910 - 1940 , at least as far as can be measured .
There may be something unprecedented going on in temperature , but the only piece of empirical evidence that actually says so —yes , the only one — is the hockey …

Brad Friedman Byon 6/7/2010 , 9:37 pm PT
I 've been working on another story , of late , so have n't been able to cover the precinct place mess in Garland County , AR which emerged over the weekend .
( What 's the matter with Arkansas when it comes to elections ?!
See my exclusive on Monroe County from late last week , for just one possible answer , in case you 're wondering ) .
Also , I was happy to see the issue getting plenty of coverage from sites like DailyKos and MoveOn , etc. , so did n't feel I was either needed , or had anything additional to add at the moment .
But , as the bizarre decision / behavior by the Garland County Election Commissioner Charles Tapp could come into play tomorrow , depending on the reported results of the hotly contested Democratic U.S. Senate primary run-off election between incumbent Sen.
Blanche Lincoln and Lt. Gov. Bill Halter --- and as so many have written in to make sure I knew about the situation ( I do ) --- it seems worth at least flagging here for now at The BRAD BLOG , to make sure that you know about it .
For that , allow me to defer to Joyce McCloy 's Voting News coverage of the coverage today ...
Garland County Arkansas voters were turned away from the polls Saturday .
With only 2 polling places instead of the usual 40 , with 76,000 registered voters , a hotly contested primary runoff & other races , officials promised to open an extra polling place on Saturday .
The polling place was not opened & voters were turned away ...
AR : Hundreds of voters turned away from the polls :
Two hundred voters were turned away from the polls Saturday in Garland County after the election commission says it made a mistake by telling voters they could vote
AR : Making Sense of the Closed Polls in Arkansas * ( text , video interviews & photos ) :
So , after having promised the location would be open and the statement being printed in the local newspaper , they did not open the polling location .
AR : Garland County Election Controversy : Voters Turned Away * ( video avail )
So , he looked into opening up the location here for an extra day -- which would have been Saturday .
At first , he said an attorney with the Secretary of State 's office advised him he could do it , so he made the announcement .
But he later came across an Arkansas law that requires him to give at least 5 days notice to the public when opening a polling location .
AR : Halter : Concerned about Garland Co. early voting :
Lt. Gov. Bill Halter 's campaign says it 's concerned that Garland County election officials reneged on their promise to allow early voting on Saturday .
AR : O'Brien plan to avoid vote fiasco :
Pat O'Brien , in the Democratic primary runoff for secretary of state , steps forward with some sound legislative proposals to avoid future fiascos such as has occurred in Garland County

UPDATE 6/8/10 :
One more for now , also courtesy Joyce this morning , for those wondering who Garland had supported in the general primary election on May 18th :
AR : Halter , Lincoln in war of words to the finish :
“ We certainly are concerned that Garland County , which has over 80,000 Arkansas citizens and had approximately 40 polling sites for the primary , has now been reduced down to two polling sites , ” Halter told reporters today during a campaign stop in Little Rock ’s River Market district .
Garland County was the most populous county Halter won on May 18 .
He received 44 percent of the county ’s vote to Lincoln ’s 40 percent .

you need one puppet pterodactyl , three live pterodactyls and one girl who is willing to get dominated .
the girl should be in reverse cowgirl position on one of the pterodactyls while intermittently performing fellatio on the other two .
all the pterodactyls must be cawing and flapping throughout the process .
after several minutes of this cawing and flapping , the puppet pterodactyl must enter from stage right periodically , open its mouth and look around .
NOTE : If you do not have a mechanical or marionette puppet pterodactyl , a simple sock puppet will suffice .
It should also be noted that this position only works while actually in Jurassic Park , if you are unable to make the trip the pterodactyls can be substituted with guys with webbed fingers and toes .
Awesome x 30
It seems like it ’s been forever since the Canucks played and it feels as if it will be an eternity before they return to the ice again , but we ’d run short on time trying to point out every reason the 2009 - 10 season was awesome .
It ruled , it truly did .
From Rick Rypien feeding Hal Gill knuckle sandwiches and Roberto Luongo becoming the franchise shutout leader to beating Toronto in Toronto and Vancouver 's Olympic glory , the moments were vast , numerous and wonderful .
Here is part one of the top 30 moments of the season .
Bon appétit .
30 . RJ TICKLES THE TWINE
March 18 , 2010 vs. San Jose
Ryan Johnson went 82 games between scoring regular season goals , so his game - winner against the Sharks was a big one .
Off a give - and - go with Rick Rypien in tight on Evgeni Nabokov , Johnson backhanded a puck past the keeper for his first red light of the year .
One and done
29 . THE EVERYMAN , SEASON 2
January 21 , 2010 vs. Dallas
Kyle Wellwood is rarely spectacular , instead opting for a consistent approach to every shift .
Despite having only four multi- point games , the everyman made the most of single points plenty of times , including this sensational game - winner to sink the Stars .
Shooting stars
28 . GETTIN ' JIGGY WIT IT
April 26 , 2010 vs. Los Angeles
Going inside the Canucks locker room just seconds after they eliminated the LA Kings was priceless thanks to Ryan Kesler .
Following a walk through a fist - pound tunnel , Kesler channeled his inner Napolean Dynamite and got down with his bad self .
Gosh !
Hammer Time
27 . LUKO'S DREAM GOAL
January 25 , 2010 vs. Buffalo
BC boy Brad Lukowich always dreamed of playing for the Canucks and this year he finally got his chance .
Luko made the most of it against the Sabres scoring his only goal of the year , and first since November 5 , 2007 , when he played third Sedin for the game - winner .
Tic - tac-toe
26 . GOING GREEN
December 22 , 2009 vs. Nashville
It started as a salute to It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and snowballed into more than Force and Sully ever imagined .
The Green Guys were a staple beside the opposing sin bin at GMP all season ; while Patrick Kane admitted to being a fan , Dave Scatchard is n’t .
Christmas tree ?
25 . TAKING DOWN GOLIATH
October 7 , 2009 vs. Montreal
Vancouver ’s first win of the season was a shellacking of the Canadiens , punctuated by Rick Rypien knocking the snot out of Hal Gill .
Big Gill ’s reach advantage was no match for the tenacity of Rypien , who used a stream of rights , lefts and blocks for the decision .
The pitbull
24 . HOFF , BOBBY HOFF
November 20 , 2009 vs. Colorado
It was a career year for Christian Ehrhoff , Vancouver ’s Babe Pratt Trophy winner .
He set new highs with 14 goals , 44 points and a +36 rating ; his coming out party was a two - goal outing against the Avalanche that earned him the nickname Bobby Hoff .
Textbook goal
23 . UNSUNG HERO
December 27 , 2009 vs. Calgary
No one was more unsung this year than Mason Raymond , the third year junior proved he was worth the wait as his skills blossomed thrusting him into the top six .
He ’s a fan favourite for many reasons , one of them being a natural hat trick against the Flames in Calgary .
Filling the hat
22 . THE GREAT DANE
March 7 , 2010 vs. Nashville & March 9 , 2010 vs. Colorado
Of Jannik Hansen ’s 15 career scores , four have counted as golden goals and a pair came in back - to - back games against the Predators and Avalanche .
Normally quiet and reserved , the dangling Dane showed some real emotion following the second game - winner .
That 's a goal
21 . HOMECOMING KING
March 3 , 2010 vs. Detroit
A game after picking up a silver medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics , Ryan Kesler was back in his hometown receiving a boisterous cheer from the American faithful in Detroit .
How did he respond ?
With a pair of goals in his only two - score outing of the year .
Monster in Michigan
Jamaican police say they have arrested suspected drug lord Christopher " Dudus " Coke on the outskirts of Kingston .
He was detained at a roadblock on Tuesday accompanied by Rev Al Miller , a preacher who said Mr Coke was going to the US embassy to hand himself in .
The government wants to extradite him to face US drug and gun trafficking charges .
His case has shed light on the links between politicians and gangs .
Attempts to capture him in May led to clashes in which scores of people died .
The 41 - year - old is accused of being the leader of the notorious Shower Posse , which US authorities say operates an international drug and gun smuggling network .
It has also been blamed for numerous murders .
Mr Coke faces life in prison if convicted on charges filed against him in New York .
He insists he is a legitimate businessman and enjoys the support of many impoverished Kingston residents who see him as a benefactor .
' Secure facility '
Following his arrest at 1600 ( 2100 GMT ) on Tuesday , Mr Coke was taken to a nearby police station , where crowds quickly gathered as news spread .
A military helicopter was later used to move him to an undisclosed location .
Jamaican Police Commissioner Owen Ellington said in a statement that Mr Coke had been arrested by policemen " acting on intelligence " at a vehicle checkpoint along the Mandela Highway .
At the scene People on the island were waiting for his capture to happen .
I was on a bus and the news came over the radio and there were whoops of joy .
Around the police station where he was initially taken , there were crowds of people and there were real security concerns .
He was taken to a secure facility because the police did not want people to take the law into their own hands and try to take him out .
" Coke is being held now in a secure facility , and the security forces are taking every step possible to ensure his safety and well - being while he is in our custody , " he added , declining to give his exact location .
" The legal proceedings will commence immediately , once we are able to settle on the issue of legal representation and reach an agreement with the director of public prosecutions on where the hearings will be held , a court date will be set , and we anticipate that we can achieve that within 48 hours . "
Mr Ellington said he was uncertain whether Mr Coke would be charged in Jamaica in connection with the deaths of two policemen and a soldier last month .
The commissioner said the security threat level for the police had been raised to the level that it was during last month 's clashes in the capital , and that they had been alerted to the possibility of attacks .
" I would like to appeal to the families , friends and sympathisers of Christopher Coke to remain calm and to allow the law to take its course , " he added .
" We would also like to reassure the country that we will continue our efforts to defeat organised crime and to restore law and order in this country while , at the same time , turning around the crime and security situation . "
Mr Ellington added that police wanted to question Rev Miller , who was allowed to leave the police checkpoint after Mr Coke was arrested .
Rev Miller , who reportedly facilitated the surrender of Mr Coke 's brother Leighton earlier this month , said Mr Coke had been on his way to the US embassy to hand himself in because he did not trust the police not to harm him .
" He also wanted to waive his right to an extradition hearing so that he could go to the US for a trial , " he told reporters .
Mr Ellington said that he had spoken with his senior officers and " asked each individually if they were party to any discussion or agreement for the bypassing of the legal processes for Coke to be turned over to US Marshals " .
" Each officer responded in the negative .
I would like to have Mr Miller in so we can have discussions with him and we would advise him to have his attorney accompany him , " he added .

The pursuit of Mr Coke has shed light on the links between politicians and gang leaders in Jamaica .
Prime Minister Bruce Golding is said to have relied on Mr Coke to turn out the vote at election time in the Tivoli Gardens district he represents in parliament , and which the Shower Posse controls .
When Mr Coke was first indicted in the US last August , Mr Golding initially fought the extradition , arguing that it was based on flawed evidence .
But after months of delays and amid growing local and international criticism , he agreed to extradite Mr Coke and signed an arrest warrant in May .
However , gunmen loyal to him in Tivoli Gardens barricaded the streets there and mounted attacks against the police .
A state of emergency was declared and more than 70 people were killed in four days of gun battles , during which Mr Coke was able to escape .
The security forces have since been accused of using excessive force .
“ When I first started watching the monkeys , I thought the females were so mean , ” said Ms. Zahed , who is working on her doctorate .
“ The infants would try to get food , to get whatever the mother had , and the mom would grab it back and go away .
The dad , on the other hand , would give up his food and let the infants get away with anything .
“ Then I got pregnant with my second child while I was still nursing the first , ” she added .
“ Then I understood .
You do get grouchy . ”
In contrast to the obvious link between paternal care and offspring welfare seen in tamarins and marmosets , a male Barbary macaque ’s fascination with infants can look less than kid-friendly .
Once abundant throughout North Africa , but now limited to forest patches in Algeria and Morocco , these monkeys live in troops of some 30 animals , a mix of related adult females and unrelated adult males .
Females give birth in the spring , and Dr. Fischer said , spring “ is high season for infant dealing . ”
Within days of being born , every infant is fair game for male pawings .
“ A male will approach a mother slowly , ” Dr. Fischer said , “ seize the moment , and take the infant . ”
He will carry the infant under his belly , or in his arms , and he ’ll advance toward one or two other males and start to make nice .
“ If they do n’t have an infant , they ca n’t interact , ” Dr. Fischer said .
“ There would be too much tension between them . ”
A male may hold on to an infant for hours at a stretch .
If the baby starts to cry , he may take it back to the mother for a feeding , all the while hanging on to the ankle of his precious networking tool .
The researchers initially assumed that baby handling might have a tranquilizing effect on the males , but on measuring the macaques ’ hormone levels , they found the opposite : carrying an infant caused a male ’s stress hormones to spike .
The scientists now propose that the males use the infants as “ battle symbols , ” as Dr. Fischer put it , “ to show other males that they can bear the stress . ”
What better proof of a worthy ally , who will not wilt come breeding season  when males must form coalitions to monopolize fertile females and help spawn the next generation of fuzzy handheld devices ?
A good Samaritan died in a horrific New York City subway accident Friday night as he valiantly tried to save a young woman who jumped into the path of an oncoming train to retrieve her jacket , the New York Post reported Saturday .
Jose Gomez , 29 , and the unidentified woman were struck by a subway train in Astoria , Queens , around 10:30 pm , police said .
The two were pinned under the third car while NYC Transit workers frantically tried to de-energize the electrified tracks .
Gomez was pronounced dead at the scene , officials said .
The woman was transported to a nearby hospital Friday night , where she is in serious but stable condition .
Subway service in Astoria was shut down for about an hour after the gory incident .
Witnesses said the woman ’s decision to jump onto the tracks to pick up her fallen jacket sparked the terrible tragedy that cost Gomez his life .

Located on the campus of a new university in Pyongyang , the obelisk is dedicated to North Korea ’s ‘ eternal president , ’ whom North Koreans are forced to worship .
Christian groups , who are against the cult of the leader , donated the money that paid for it .
Seoul ( AsiaNews ) – A monument dedicated to Kim Il- sung was installed on the campus of the new Pyongyang University of Science and Technology ( PUST ) .
Built with donations from South Korean and US Christians , it could tank intra-Korean relations for good .
The 20 - metre granite monstrosity embodies the Juche idea , North Korea ’s quasi-religious state ideology .
The latter is based on the notion of self - reliance as defined by the country ’s founder , something that North Koreans must worship .
The Daily NK , an online newspaper that focuses on human rights issues in North Korea , has definitive evidence of the misuse of funds .
Named ‘ Yeong Saeng ’ or eternal life in memory of Kim Il- sung , North Korea ’s ‘ eternal president ’ , the obelisk is but one of many other erected to glorify the father of the last Stalinist state in the world .
The vertical structure displays a “ Kimilsungia ” flower sculpted in relief on the bottom and an inscription that reads , “ Great Leader comrade Kim Il Sung is with us for eternity ” .
Monuments dedicated to the eternal life of North Korea ’s founding father dot the country ’s landscape .
They were built by Kim Jong - il , the late dictator ’s own son in a frenzy of quasi-religious filial devotion .
In fact , “ Yeong Saeng ” monuments exist in many cities , big and small , and residents are violently “ encouraged ” to honour the great leader twice a year , on 8 July , the day he died , and 15 April , the day he was born ,
Next week , the whole country will thus celebrate the founder ’s birthday .
Current leader Kim Jong -il is expected to use the occasion to announce that his third son , Kim Jong - un , will succeed him .
However , building the monument has stopped the inauguration of the new university .
The delay is due to protests by donors , who coughed up 40 billion North Korean wons ( US$ 35 million ) to put up the structure .
In the case of South Korean taxpayers who contributed to the project , they will have to rely on their country ’s Unification Ministry for a response .
An official with the ministry said , whilst “ North Korea ’s stance is that PUST cannot be an exception ” to the rule that all educational facilities in the North have their “ Yeong Saeng monument , if “ the Yeong Saeng monument becomes a propaganda tool aimed at outside visitors , we will readily respond . ”
Is it me , or are the similarities between Facebook and Microsoft becoming downright eerie ?
I know Microsoft is a major investor in Facebook , so it 's probably not all coincidental .
But sometimes it seems like Facebook is running the MS playbook step by step , including the mistakes .
Origins
Gates and Zuckerberg both dropped out of Harvard to start their companies .
Superficial and coincidental , sure , but a little weird in the Kennedy - had - a - secretary - named - Lincoln - and - vice - versa way .
Additionally , both founders have been depicted in the press as being cold and calculating , with concern for little else besides the success of their company .
Gates ' image has softened quite a bit since he 's retired to pursue philanthropy , but Mark Zuckerberg has a lot in common with the Bill Gates of the 80s and 90s , for better or worse .
Aside from the founders , the companies started off in similar ways .
Microsoft 's breakthrough product , DOS , was not developed in - house but purchased from another software firm .
Zuckerberg is rumored to have " stolen " the Facebook idea from a previous startup he worked with .
Whether there 's any substance to such claims , it 's safe to say the the origins of both companies include some element of controversy .
There 's a deviation from the archetypal Silicon Valley success story where a group of genius programmers work maniacally to build a better mousetrap .
I do n't mean to imply in any way that the founding teams of either company are n't very talented or that they do n't work very hard , but both have been haunted with a historical footnote that there was an extra circumstance that helped catapult them into greatness .
Facebook and Microsoft have both been highly dependent on network and lock - in effects
Microsoft and Facebook are hardly the only two businesses to exploit these effects , but they are probably the two who met with the most resounding success in doing so .
In the early days of Microsoft , being " IBM - compatible " was a major selling point for computers .
Part of what this meant was that the computer ran DOS , the operating system IBM licensed from Microsoft .
As the number of people with IBM - compatible computers grew , consumers and businesses became increasingly dependent on being able to share data among a common set of programs .
The effect continued as Microsoft Office became popular .
It was difficult , if not impossible , to send someone a file created in a different office suite and expect them to be able to open it .
Eventually , anyone who wanted to have any hope of communicating had to start using Office .
Facebook is in a similar position as even the long - time holdouts are starting to cave simply because they need Facebook to get in touch with their friends .
Facebook had also until recently taken a walled - garden approach to curating its community .
The information on the site was largely closed to non-members .
It 's illuminating to consider that Microsoft Office has also moved to a more open file format now that the competition is safely crushed .
Is Facebook 's recent move to grow over its walls and extend its tendrils out onto the open web an assertion of their dominance in the social networking space ?
On the other hand , many of the walls remain intact .
You can't send a message to a friend on Facebook unless you also have a Facebook account .
You also can't follow your friends ' status updates or receive invitations to events planned on Facebook without an account of your own .
Predictions of Facebook 's imminent openness may be premature .
Facebook and Microsoft both push their business models to the limits of legality
Microsoft famously leveraged its success in the operating system market in an attempt to seize control of the booming new market for web browsers thus controlling how people interacted with the Internet in the same way they controlled how people interacted with the computer .
The result was a landmark antitrust case that cost Microsoft dearly in terms of consumer goodwill .
Facebook now finds itself in a similarly powerful position .
They are the default repository for personal information .
They are also becoming the default way for people to interact with each other via the Internet , much like Windows became the default way the people interacted with a computer .
The question on everyone 's mind is :
What is Facebook going to do with all this power ?
They have a truly staggering amount of data about consumer preferences all willingly submitted by the consumers themselves .
Facebook clearly wants to capitalize on this data - mining bonanza in the most profitable way possible , but they are already drawing the ire of lawmakers in the US and in Europe .
Unlike Microsoft , who already had a wildly successful business selling operating systems and office suites before they overplayed their hand with Internet Explorer , Facebook needs to capitalize on every advantage at its disposal in order to satisfy the outsized expectations ( and venture capital funding ) that have been placed on them .
Privacy : Facebook :: Security : Microsoft
Microsoft 's dominance of the software market made them a high profile target for writers of viruses and other malware .
The sheer size and homogeneity of the Microsoft ecosystem created the perfect environment for viruses to flourish .
Unfortunately , the core of the Windows operation system was not designed to operate securely in the highly networked world that it eventually inhabited .
Windows always worked best under the assumption that the user was the sole user of the computer and should have maximum privileges to make any changes .
This made it easy for malicious software to install and replicate itself .
The neverending torrent of spam sent out by botnets of infected Windows computers is the legacy of this broken security model .
Only recently , with Windows Vista and 7 has Microsoft started to make some headway in producing a more secure operating system .
In much the same way , the original Facebook was not built with privacy in mind .
Originally , users could only join if they could provide a college email address .
With private networks there was not as much of a need to control what information was displayed .
As the site has grown , the developers tacked on a bewildering array of privacy controls .
The complexity and constant revisions of the privacy policy have left many users unsure of what information they 're sharing and with whom .
As Facebook approaches 500 million users it presents a target similarly large and uniform as the Windows install base .
Aside from the exact same problem of being an attack vector for the spread of malicious software , the Facebook network provides a new set of problems with the spread of more human - readable information .
Some users are learning the hard way that you might not want all of your Facebook friends to see everything you post on Facebook .
The nature of the site -- you mostly interact with people you know ( or used to know ) in real life -- causes users to let down their guard more than they might on the open Internet .
As a result cons like the Western Union scam make hijacked Facebook account a particularly hot commodity for thieves .
In time , users will come to realize that they can't trust Facebook any more than any other communication medium , just like we 've all had to train ourselves not to open email attachments from untrusted sources .
What 's next ?
I do n't claim to have a particularly accurate crystal ball , and in truth , I 've probably already pushed this analogy as far as it can go .
If it were possible to directly compare the trajectories of these two companies , I 'd say Facebook today is probably equivalent to early 90s Microsoft .
They 're just coming into their own as the market leader and they 're looking for the best ways to throw their new weight around .
Unfortunately , Facebook has a much more fickle and mobile user base than Microsoft ever did .
Microsoft 's customers avoided competitors due to the need for compatibility .
The high cost of a second computer to try out a new operating system , or the technical expertise required to run two operating systems on the same computer , made it impractical for most to experiment with alternatives .
Such is not the case with social networks .
It 's trivial for anybody to maintain two or three different accounts .
Users migrate away gradually by starting accounts on new services and gradually spending more time there as more of their friends join .
Eventually , they close the old account or just abandon it .
( I do n't think I ever officially closed my Friendster account , did you ? )
So far , user outrage has managed to stymie most of Facebook 's attempts to profit off of their vast store of data .
This has n't seemed to slow their growth any , though .
The majority of the users do n't seem to care about the privacy issues , and if they do experience some negative consequences it 's likely they 'll adjust their use of Facebook rather than abandoning it altogether .
In the meantime , Facebook seems to be homing in on an unobtrusive way to realize the immense profits their investors are expecting .
Facebook has already passed the point where they can spectacularly flame out .
They 've got enough momentum that failure is more likely to be a painful , drawn out process .
With a vocal contingent of savvy users , Facebook can't afford to ignore the privacy issues like Microsoft ignore security for so long .
Facebook will find success by giving users the most control over their own data and demonstrating that the advertising based on that data adds value for the users .

I had a similar problem in France on entering the FNAC ( kind of the French Best Buy ) in Montparnasse .
I ’d open the door to go in , hold it for the person behind me , then every person behind them would keep coming in and not bother using their hand to support the door , so I ’d be standing there , ad infinitum , holding the door for everyone .
I finally just let it shut on someone .
( There was no pasta available . )
Story sounds funny at first , but on reading the entire thing , I ’m not so sure anymore .
The women told police “ they had to use their fists , their bags and their feet to teach him a lesson , ” according to the police report .
In fact , when officers arrived at the Tremont Street building late Saturday night they said they found noodles dripping off the back of Warsame .
And actually , the guy says that you need a pass to enter the elevator – it ’s a housing complex – and you ’re not supposed to let people in the elevator who do n’t have a pass .
That makes this a bit more interesting .
It ’s the age old question of whether you let someone slip in behind you when you enter your key - locked building .

You might have considered quitting Facebook , but stopped short because it's how a few far - flung friends and relatives stay in touch , or a place those without your email address can ping you .

Quit Facebook without really quitting , as Whitson did .
Create a new account , linked to a different email , and set it up so that your old friends are still there , but Facebook , even at its most Draconian , can't really reveal all that much about you , and your friends can't really overshare without your permission .

The Monday morning news announcing the new company follows a Friday that saw Activision , the mega- publisher that fired Jason West and Vince Zampella from their leadership positions at Modern Warfare development studio Infinity Ward , suing the ousted creators .
Activision has accused the duo of misdeeds and subterfuge designed as an alleged attempt to " steal the studio .
" West and Zampella had sued Activison a month prior following their dismissal from their perches atop Activision - owned Infinity Ward .

But today the two creators are announcing a new company and an exclusive publishing deal with Activision rival Electronic Arts .
The new company , based in Encino , California , will make games for the EA Partners label , an arrangement that means it will remain an independent company from EA .
West and Zampella 's former studio , Infinity Ward , remains wholly owned by Activision .

" Respawn Entertainment marks a fresh start for Jason and me , " Zampella said in a statement .
" For the past decade we led a great development team and poured our hearts into creating an epic game franchise .
We 're very proud of what we built – and proud that so many millions of fans enjoyed those games .
Today we hope to do it all over again — open a new studio , hire a great team , and create brand new games with a new partner , EA . "
" We 're excited , " West said .
" Now that the team is in control of the games and brands , we can ensure that the fans are treated as well as they deserve . "

While West and Zampella 's experience has recently involved military first - person shooters , including EA 's Medal of Honor series , which they worked on prior to handling Call of Duty and Modern Warfare for Activision , they offered no details on the new game .
The release indicated only that " the company will focus on creating state - of - the - art gaming experiences for global audiences . "

OTTAWA — In a landmark ruling , Canada ’s highest court says journalists do not enjoy a constitutional right to shield the identity of sources during police investigations .
Yet , in a decision hailed by some media lawyers for recognizing the value of investigative journalism , the Supreme Court of Canada declared Friday sources may be shielded on a case - by - case basis .
The onus , however , is on a media outlet to prove the public interest in protecting a source outweighs the interest in investigating a crime .
The 8 - 1 judgment upholds a 2001 order against the National Post ’s editors to hand over a document – which purported to be bank loan papers — received by former Post reporter Andrew McIntosh while he was researching a series of articles on the so - called “ Shawinigate ” affair involving then - prime minister Jean Chrétien .
The document suggested a conflict of interest in Chrétien ’s interventions to support a loan to a beleaguered hotel in his home riding .
RCMP spokesman Cpl. Luc Thibault , in Montreal , said an investigation into the allegedly forged document continues , and commercial crime investigators will soon meet to discuss next steps .
However , McIntosh no longer works for the Post , and had stowed the document in a “ safe ” place , off the paper ’s premises while the paper challenged the police search warrant .
The paper ’s current editors are unaware of its location .
McIntosh had “ no immediate comment ” Friday .
Lawyer Marlys Edwardh , representing the Post and McIntosh , said in an interview the ruling , released Friday by the Supreme Court of Canada , set out some clear guidelines that will help journalists .
“ In some senses , this is a huge win , ” she said .
The high court rejected the idea that the Charter of Rights ’ guarantee of freedom of expression grants a special constitutional privilege to journalists , but it also said , for the first time , that police investigations wo n’t always trump the media ’s interest in protecting sources .
Instead , Justice Ian Binnie wrote that courts would have to weigh “ the seriousness of the offence under investigation , ” and just how relevant or valuable the evidence sought really is to police .
Those factors would be measured against “ the public interest in respecting the journalist ’s promise of confidentiality , ” said Binnie , who wrote that investigative journalism helps fill “ what has been described as a democratic deficit in the transparency and accountability of our public institutions . ”
The Supreme Court said if the cops are called in to conduct a “ contrived ” investigation to silence a secret source , a court may well refuse to order a source ’s identification or the production of physical evidence that would tip them to a source ’s identity .
The high court flatly rejected the Crown ’s argument that “ the existence of any crime is sufficient ” to trump a journalist ’s promise of anonymity .
“ That is too broad a generalization , ” the court said .
But the Post ’s case is not a “ usual one ” where a reporter could protect a source , said Binnie .
Rather , it is a “ serious ” matter where the document sought by police may have been deliberately falsified in order to embarrass a sitting prime minister .
Binnie said even a lawyer who receives physical evidence relevant to a criminal investigation cannot withhold it on the basis of solicitor - client privilege , and journalists deserve no greater protection .
The ruling noted that with the proliferation of Internet , media , citizen journalists , bloggers and tweeters , there are no uniform professional guidelines that govern the ethics or practice of those claiming to be reporters , nor their handling of sources and information .
Binnie said “ to throw a constitutional immunity ” around such an “ ill - defined group of writers and speakers and whichever ‘ sources ’ they deem worthy . . . would blow a giant hole in law enforcement and other constitutionally recognized values such as privacy . ”
The National Post and McIntosh initially won their challenge of the search warrant at the Ontario Superior Court .
But the Ontario Court of Appeal in 2008 ruled the paper had no right to refuse the handover of the documents because it was using journalistic privilege to shield a wrongdoer .
Justice Rosalie Abella dissented with the majority Friday , concluding that confidential sources are key to the “ responsible performance of the media ’s role ” and “ ought to be protected . ”
“ I think it ’s a sad day for investigative journalism , ” said Toronto Star lawyer Bert Bruser , “ because the court has refused to provide constitutional protection for the relationship between a journalist and a source , and that in my view is an incredibly important relationship that needs greater protection . ”

“ Although not a win for the National Post on the facts of the case , this decision is the strongest statement yet by our courts as to the basis on which the law protects journalists ’ confidential sources , ” said Phil Tunley , lawyer and board member of Canadian Journalists for Free Expression .
“ It is unfortunate that a journalist who has been scrupulously careful in his dealings with a confidential source is now being put in the position of having to break his promise or face legal consequences , ” said Arnold Amber , president of CJFE .
“ But in the big picture , this has to be seen as a significant step forward for journalists in Canada . ”
Friday ’s ruling did not deal with a Globe and Mail challenge , still before the Supreme Court of Canada , that seeks to protect sources in the context of civil proceedings .

Let 's start off with an easy question .
Think of a number from one to 20 .
It was 17 , was n't it ?
For some reason , people are three times more likely to pick 17 than chance would suggest .
That 's not too mind - blowing , though , because people are idiots .
It 's no surprise that when you ask us to pick a random number , we fall back on one or two old favorites .
There 's probably a 17 tattooed somewhere on the inside of our stupid ape brains .

What is freaky is that nature and reality also seem to have their favorite number : one .
The phenomena was first discovered by a physicist named Simon Newcomb in 1881 .
Then it was rediscovered by a guy named Benford 53 years later , and it became known as " Benford 's Law . "
Meanwhile , the principle that no matter how cool your discovery is , " somebody is going to come along decades later and take credit for it became known as " Newcomb's Law . "
From town populations to the heights of the tallest buildings in the world to the number of people who vote for a given candidate : the first digit is going to be one at least 30 percent of the time despite the fact that one is only 11 percent of the numbers that could possibly show up there .

To illustrate just how weird that is , imagine you 're an architect of one of the world 's tallest buildings .
You check with the mayor to find out just how tall you can go , check with the engineers to ensure that you can maintain structural integrity , evaluate the skyline to make sure all other architects who have built in this city know whose got the biggest wang .
You are not keeping track of what the final measurement in feet will be , but when it 's done , no matter what your decision is based on , the first digit in your building 's height is six times as likely to start with one than nine .
If you switch to measuring that height in meters , does n't matter .
Is your building near a river ?
The length of the river is more likely to start with " 1 " than any other digit .
And so on .
OTTAWA — Heartened and emboldened by Canada ’s new anti-abortion stand on foreign aid , thousands of pro-life campaigners flooded in unprecedented numbers to Parliament Hill on Thursday , daring to hope that Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s government will take further steps against abortion at home as well as abroad .
The debate that Harper says he does n’t want to reopen in Canada arrived literally on his doorstep on Thursday , with high spirits and demands for the Conservative government to do much more to discourage abortion in this country .
Around 15,000 pro-life campaigners , clearly buoyed by what they see as last month ’s victory on the foreign - aid front , cheered loudly when numerous speakers talked about the next steps in what one called bringing a “ culture of life ” to Canada .
“ We would like some more courage to do something more in Canada in defence of the unborn , ” Cardinal Marc Ouellette , of Quebec City , told the crowd .
Ouellette minced no words in explaining later what he would like Harper to do next : “ Reopen the discussion in Canada about this judicial void ; there is absolutely no protection for the unborn , ” Ouellette told reporters .
“ The next step should be a reopening of discussion about the legal situation of abortion in Canada . ”
Some U.S. pro-life advocates were also on hand on Parliament Hill on Thursday , congratulating Canada for putting in place a foreign - aid policy against abortion that has been championed by Republican presidents , but repealed by President Barack Obama .
“ These are tangible , visible threads … we are moving toward a culture of life in Canada , ” said Carl Anderson , a former adviser to U.S. president Ronald Reagan as well as to the Vatican .
“ Under President ( George W. ) Bush , we had the Mexico City policy , which prohibited exporting abortion .
As you know , with President Obama , he repealed that policy , ” Janet Morana , founder of a pro-life group called Silent No More , told reporters in Ottawa on Thursday morning .
“ And so we ’re very pleased to see that Canada is taking that pro-life stance , meaning they ’re not going to export dollars overseas for abortion . ”
The rally was a kickoff to what ’s called the annual March of Life and organizers of this year ’s effort boasted that the strength of the crowds and the cause is rapidly growing in Canada .
Some long - time participants said that this year ’s turnout was by far the best ever for an anti-abortion rally on Parliament Hill .
The noisy presence was heartily encouraged by the politicians who spoke at the event – a sharp contrast from the advice to “ shut the f --- up ” that Conservative senator Nancy Ruth gave recently to a group of aid advocates looking for ways to oppose Harper ’s decision to block support for abortion in Canadian foreign aid .
No one was asking for silence or patience from the massive group on Parliament Hill on Thursday .
All together , about 20 MPs from the pro-life caucus were at the event , most Conservative , but a few Liberals too , including Paul Szabo , Gurbax Malhi and Dan McTeague .
All but one of the MPs on the stage – Conservative Kelly Bock – were men .
No cabinet ministers , New Democrats or Bloc Quebecois
MPs took part in the rally .
Among the crowd , meanwhile , were hundreds and hundreds of young students , bused in by their Catholic schools all over Ontario and Quebec to take part in the event .
Elizabeth Ducklas and Akanksha Zutshi , from the Holy Name of Mary Catholic Secondary School in Brampton , for instance , were two 16 - year - olds who were happy to be among the busload who made the trek this week to Parliament Hill .
“ I want abortion to be illegal , ” said Ducklas , who added that she was pleased by the Harper government ’s decision to withhold foreign - aid support for abortions in developing countries .
“ That ’s a first step in the right direction . ”
Bruinooge says he accepts Harper ’s long - stated refusal to open up any debate over abortion legislation in Canada .
Thursday ’s rally was purely for information purposes , he said .
“ The goal of the pro-life movement in general is to acknowledge that the unborn have value , that they ’re human and we as a society need to consider their value .
And I think that ’s a message that ’s beginning to come out , ” Bruinooge said .

He would not comment , however , on whether the movement has gained strength because the increasing clout of the Christian right in Canada , as asserted in a newly released book , The Armageddon Factor , by Canadian journalist Marci MacDonald .
“ In our country there ’s a number of faith groups … there ’s Sikhs , Hindus that have many similar philosophical viewpoints to Christians , and I think that many people , from various theological communities , suggest various ideas that I think are important to public policy , ” Bruinooge said .
“ On the life issues , I know that not only are Christians generally supportive of pro-life politics , but I know Sikhs , Hindus , Buddhists are as well . ”
At the rally , Bruinooge particularly singled out the two Sikh MPs who turned out on stage : Liberal MP Gurbax Malhi and Conservative MP Tim Uppal .

He told me that the paint would cost 95 cordobas ( about $ 5 ) , but that he had only 40 .
He showed me the 40 cordobas .
He was asking me for a loan .
I told him that I had very little money .
He said that if I gave him the money , he would bring me coconut milk every day until he had given me an amount of equal value .
So I gave him 50 cordobas and told him I was looking forward to seeing the freshly painted cart .

The next morning the coconut salesman did not show up , and once evening came , nobody had seen him all day .
I just figured that I had lost about $ 2.50 , and that I could learn some sort of lesson from it .
The following day , when the coconut salesman saw me , he immediately grabbed a coconut , hacked the top off , stuck a straw inside and handed it to me .
I drank the milk and asked him why his cart was the same sorry green it was before .
He told me that on the day I gave him the loan , a pickpocket stole all his money .
I decided that whatever happened , the coconut salesman was making good on the deal we ’d made .
The next morning the coconut salesman came again , gave me my coconut and told me he had a problem .
I drank my coconut milk and told him I was n’t surprised .
He told me that one of his sons wanted a Bible but that he did n’t have the money .
I told him that the managers of the hotel were Evangelical Christians and might be happy to give him one .
He asked me if I would go in for him .
I said sure , and went in and got him a Bible .
The next day the coconut salesman told me he had another problem .
I told him I was n’t surprised .
He told me that his son was very happy with the Bible , but now his other son wanted one , too .
He wanted me to go into the hotel and get a second Bible .
I said : “ I ’m pretty sure there ’s a passage somewhere in the Bible about the concept of sharing .
Maybe they could read that together . ”
The coconut salesman listened to me , then went inside the hotel himself and got another Bible .
Official claims that " your data is safe with us " suffered another body blow at the weekend with revelations of a dramatic rise in hacking of the UK ’s tax and benefit mega - database by council staff .
In most cases , councils appear to have concluded that the appropriate penalty for such unlawful prying into personal lives has been nothing more than a slap on the wrist .
The scale of the unofficial snooping came to light following a series of FoI requests by the Mail , which disclosed that there had been 124 security breaches by council staff last year – up sixfold from a mere 20 in 2008/9 .
Town
Hall snoopers have been looking at accounts belonging to friends , family and neighbours – as well as celebrities .
Although some 26 employees were dismissed – and eight resigned during the disciplinary process - the majority were let off lightly : 37 received a written or verbal warning , while 43 suffered no penalty at all .
The database , maintained by the Department of Work and Pensions ( DWP ) , is a monster : it records details of every individual issued with a National Insurance number : it includes details on the ethnicity , address , and tax status of 85 million individuals ( both the living and the dead ) .
The system also holds full income details for anyone in receipt of any form of benefit .
It can be accessed by workers at the 445 local authorities across the UK , as well as 80,000 DWP employees and 60,000 workers from other government departments .
Talking to the Reg this morning , Alex Deane , Director of Big Brother Watch , said : " These figures are a dismal indictment of councils and the people we pay to work in them .
" That the number of officers conducting this illegal snooping is on the increase is a real cause for concern .
" This just goes to show that our private data is not safe with councils – the less they have of it , the better . "
We also asked the DWP to comment .
In an earlier statement , a spokesman for the DWP was reported as saying : " DWP thoroughly deals with the risk to CIS by the small number of employees who commit unauthorised access . "
However , the DWP is understood not to hold details of the number of its own staff caught misusing CIS data .
This morning , a spokesman initially suggested that as the breaches were committed by Council workers they were not the responsibility of the DWP .
However , they did promise to get back on the overall security issues which , as the legal data processor , they might possibly have some responsibility for . ®

This news comes in a week when the coalition government followed through on promises to roll back the use of bin chipping to pry on individual household recycling – but failed to put a stop to the uploading of Summary Care Records in the NHS .
With other key systems – such as Contactpoint – coming up for review , we may soon discover just how deep is their commitment to rolling back the database state .
My imaginary friend once told me : “ setting up DJ gear is like making a pizza ; you have the base and the topping . ”
I thought he was crazy , but he did bring up an interesting point about the headaches of the cables filling the booth like mozzarella cheese .
Let ’s face it , cabling can be daunting , but it ’s something that all professional djs need to know .
With a solid understanding of cables , levels and common problems - you can trouble shoot almost any audio issue easily and look like a pro every time .
In this article we will cover the essentials you absolutely must know by heart .
Levels – the sauce
Think of levels like the power running down the cable , the spiciness of the sauce ( yes spicy pizza ) .
We have several types of levels useful for different things .
Microphone levels
Line levels , including
* Balanced
* Unbalanced
* Phono Level
Line Levels
These levels are the most common around the DJ booth .
They are mid power connections designed to plug sound cards into mixers , and mixers into amps or powered speakers – so on and so forth .
The professional audio world splits these levels into balanced and unbalanced , each having different “ power levels ” to suit each other .
As a result nasty things can happen if we plug one into the other .
Microphone Levels
Microphone input levels are very important to understand .
That input is expecting an input level of - 60db , compared to a standard line level input on a mixer which is looking for - 10db .
This means that if you plug a microphone into a line level , it will be too quiet and if you plug a line level output ( cd player ) into a mic input then distortion is guaranteed .
Phono Levels
Records have a very interesting characteristic .
They are cut with large dips in volume at specific frequencies so the needle wont skip .
To make up for this Phono level inputs on your mixer then increase these frequencies back up again .
If you accidentally plug a CD player into a phono input it will sound like some one cranked up the gain , and all eq ’s to 11 .
Speaker Level
This is the big daddy of levels - the very , very high powered level that comes straight out of the amp before going to non-powered speakers .
Do not ever , ever try to plug a speaker level cable into your soundcard or find your room the victim of a bomb … not that it would be easy to do that , but just saying .
Balanced and Unbalanced – seafood or pineapple ?
Now we have our sauce sorted , all that ’s left is the meat of the pizza .
The choice between balanced ( or professional ) signals and unbalanced ( more consumer ) signals is similar to the ever complex question of choosing seafood or pineapple .
It is sacrilegious and frankly wo n’t work to mix the two .
Unbalanced cables run at a line level of - 10dBV or roughly ( 0.316 V - RMS for the nerds out there ) .
All cd players and almost all dj sound cards have unbalanced outputs .
This is the most simple line level , which is suitable for short runs of audio .
Over longer runs the cable will start to pick up a lot of noise .
Balanced cables “ break the signal down ” ( for the sake of simplicity ) into two parts ( plus a ground ) , + and -.
By doing this , the amp or mixer gets the two pieces and works out what the signal should sound like subtracting any noise that may have been picked up along the way .
Balanced cables run at a line level of + 4dBu ( 1.228 V - RMS ) and are normally used for long runs to speakers and amps .
EAN ’S INSIDER TIP : Some sound cards have the choice of - 10 db or +4db outputs .
Your probably thinking , louder outputs = better !
Not really , dj mixers and sound boards are expecting un - ballanced inputs so your really sending way too loud of a signal .
Always run - 10 db outputs UNLESS your going directly to speakers or a special mixer with balanced inputs .
Cables – the base of our pizza
RCA
Now these little boys you may know from the family DVD player .
They have one metal rod with a metal cake - cutter shape ring around it .
Sorted into left and right ( white and red ) they carry an unbalanced signal through two cables .
These are some of the most common plugs and you should be able to find these on most mixers and soundcards , however , as they are unbalanced they are most susceptible to interference .
XLR
These plugs are the new industry standard for balanced cables .
They are three pronged cables and often have a little clip to keep them in place .
Superior to RCA , XLR cables are heavy duty and usually thicker .
Like all the other cables , you need one each for the left and right channels .
¼ ” TRS and TS
The ¼ ” Tip Ring Sleeve plug should be familiar as the humble DJ headphone plug .
Fatter than the little iPod plug , the TRS plug can do two main things :
Work as a headphone jack .
( read about the importance of good headphones )
Work as a balanced cable .
TRS plugs are found commonly on soundcards ( due to the fact they take up less room than XLR ) while they are technically the same as XLR plugs .
* A notable exception is Native Instrument ’s Audio2 DJ which has two TRS connections , but work the same way as unbalanced headphone jacks .
NI supplies a TRS to RCA converter cable , and the outputs are - 10db .
The TS ( Tip Sleeve ) cable is slightly different and found mostly on older soundcards .
They only have one little black ring and work in the same way as RCA plugs by transmitting unbalanced signals .
Finally , be careful plugging an unbalanced TS plug into a jack that is set up for balanced TRS due the different signal levels described before – all we ’ll get is distortion and fuzz .
When the pizza burns
Unfortunately , no matter how many books we read , something will always go wrong after hours of planning and setting up .
Here are three of the more common issues :
Throughout all these potentially scary and worrying issues , the principles of cabling , like a pizza are simple .
If something is n’t working , take it back to the basics and have a quick think .
Work out what your needs are , such as whether you should mix using hardware or software .
All you have to do is remember the key principles and things should work out ; and anyway , would you really want a pineapple flavoured seafood pizza ?

The Wayne Madsen Report ( WMR ) and the Examiner reported that FEMA has plans in place for the evacuation of the Tampa Bay in the event of a controlled burn of oil threatening to take toxic plumes through Tampa Bay .
Updated 7/03/2010
( TAMPA , Fla . ) –
There ’s no question that the Gulf oil spill is the biggest environmental disaster in the history of this country and maybe the world .
FEMA has plans to evacuate the Tampa Bay area in the event of a controlled burn of surface oil in the Gulf of Mexico , or if wind or other conditions are expected to take toxic fumes through Tampa Bay , according to a report by Maryann Tobin in the Hernando County Political Buzz Examiner .
Tobin has been a freelance writer for more than twenty years , writing for local publications in New York and Florida .
Maryann Tobin ’s news story has generated high reader interest .
It ’s obvious that the Gulf oil spill continues to be the leading story in the media as long as the oil well remains uncapped and the threat of exposure to environmental hazards like benezene exists .
For Maryann Tobin ’s news story on the FEMA plan to evacuate Tampa , see : Florida Gulf oil spill : Plans to evacuate Tampa Bay area are in place – examiner.com Maryann Tobin has been following the BP oil spill with a series of short , hard hitting news stories for weeks .

FEMA may use their hurricane evacuation plan for Tamp and other cities on the Gulf .
Tobin reported that , “ plans would be announced in the event of a controlled burn of surface oil in the Gulf of Mexico , or if wind or other conditions are expected to take toxic fumes through Tampa Bay . ”
The hurricance seasons poses additional risks of a storm surge , which would push water and oil inland .
Art Horn , a metrologist from Manchester , Connecticut , writing in Energy Tribune on June 21st used the term “ Oilcane ” to describe the effects of hurriane winds on the oil in the Gulf from the BP ’s gusher , “ Should a major hurricane push the spill towards the gulf coast there will be nothing that can be done to stop it .
No amount of planning or engineering will help .
No number of visits to the gulf by the president or any other official will stop the inevitable .
The storm surge will drive the water and the oil miles inland . ”

Horn ’s complete article , “ An Oilicane ? ”
If you ’re a conspiracy advocate and I ’m not , you may see some devious FEMA plot to do away with people .
In fact , if the crude oil nears Tampa Bay and burn off is used on the oil spill , there may be health risk of inhalation exposure to inhabitants .
It follows that evacuation as in the case of a hurricane is a logical alternative .
An informed source told us on June 25th that there were reports of the smell of oil in the Tampa Bay area .
Real or imaginations running wild ?
Joel Achenback , Washington
Post staff writer , in an article of June 23rd entitled “ Each Day Another Way to Define Worst - Case for Oil Spill , ” reported that Matt Simmons , founder of Simmons and Co. , an oil investment firm and “ and since the April 20 blowout , the unflagging source of end - of - the - world predictions .
“ Can you imagine evacuating 20 million people ? . . .
This story is 80 times worse than I thought . ”
The only thing for sure is that this story is not going away as long as the well is unplugged and the crude oil continues to spread into the Gulf .
Chemicals in crude oil and dispersants can cause a wide range of health effects in people and wildlife , depending on the level of exposure and susceptibility .
Crude oil has many highly toxic chemical ingredients that can damage every system in the body .
Dispersant chemicals can affect many of the same organs .

Britain's new government is giving fresh consideration to a hacker 's plea to postpone an upcoming court hearing in a long - running bid to avoid a U.S. trial that could send him to prison for decades .
The U.K.'s Home Office , which oversees criminal justice affairs , is reviewing a letter from lawyers for Gary McKinnon , who was charged in the U.S. in 2002 for breaking into military and government computers .
McKinnon is scheduled for a judicial review hearing in the High Court on May 25 and 26 on the basis of his diagnosis of Asperger 's syndrome , a neurological disorder related to autism characterized by deficiencies in social interaction .
Theresa
May , the new home secretary from the Conservative party , is expected to issue a response " as soon as possible , " according to a Home Office spokesman .
" The Home Secretary has received a letter from Gary McKinnon 's legal team asking her to agree to an adjournment of the Judicial Review in light of further representations , " according to a Home Office statement .
McKinnon 's case has risen in profile over the last couple of years , with celebrities , along with politicians , voicing their support for him .
The recent change in government could help his cause .
Some members of the U.K.'s new coalition government have been highly critical of the circumstances of McKinnon 's case .
Last year , David Cameron -- now Britain 's prime minister -- criticized the extradition treaty McKinnon was subject to .
Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat 's leader who is deputy prime minister , said last year he opposed extraditing McKinnon given his medical condition .
The U.K. government approved McKinnon 's extradition in 2006 , but his lawyers undertook a series of court maneuvers that have kept him from being extradited .
McKinnon had asked to be prosecuted in the U.K. , but the request was denied on the basis that U.S. authorities wanted jurisdiction over the case and because most of the witnesses are in the U.S .
McKinnon was indicted by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in 2002 for hacking into 97 military and NASA computers between February 2001 and March 2002 .
He could face up to 60 years in prison .
McKinnon has remained free in the U.K. but is n't allowed to use a computer .
He has publicly admitted to hacking the computers using a program called " Remotely Anywhere , " a remote access tool .
McKinnon has said that many of the computer systems still had their default passwords -- considered a poor security practice -- and that other passwords were easy to obtain .
McKinnon , who went by the name " Solo , " contends he was merely searching for proof of the existence UFOs and did n't harm the systems .
The U.S. military contends that McKinnon deleted critical files from its computers , which hampered its efforts after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Mavi Marmara was the lead ship in a six- vessel aid convoy
Israel and Turkey have announced an agreement to end an acrimonious , six - year diplomatic rift .
The two countries were close allies , but relations broke down after the killing by Israeli commandos of 10 Turkish activists on board a ship that was part of an aid flotilla attempting to breach the blockade of Gaza on 31 May 2010 .
How did the confrontation begin ?
The six ships in the flotilla were boarded in international waters , about 130 km ( 80 miles ) from the Israeli coast .
Commandos landed on the largest ship , the Turkish - owned Mavi Marmara , by descending on ropes from helicopters .
Clashes broke out immediately and the Israeli commandos opened fire .
Who started the violence ?
This is disputed .
The activists say the commandos started shooting as soon as they hit the deck .
Israeli officials say the commandos opened fire only after being attacked with clubs , knives and a gun which was taken from them .
Video released by the Israeli military stops just before the shooting begins .
A UN inquiry was apparently unable to determine at exactly which point the commandos used live fire .
Where were the dead activists from ?
They were all Turkish , although one had dual Turkish - US nationality .
All were travelling on the Mavi Marmara .
What was the purpose of the flotilla ?
It wanted to deliver aid to Gaza , breaking an Israeli and Egyptian blockade on the territory .
The ships were carrying 10,000 tonnes of goods , including school supplies , building materials and two large electricity generators .
The activists also said they wanted to make the point that , in their view , the blockade was illegal under international law .
Who organised it ?
Gaza Movement , an umbrella organisation for activists from numerous countries , and a Turkish group called the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Aid ( IHH ) .
The Israeli government says the IHH is closely linked to the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas , which it views as a terrorist group , and is a member of another organisation , the Union of the Good , which supports suicide bombings .
However , the Turkish government regards the IHH as a legitimate charity , and had urged Israel to let the flotilla through .
Why did Israel want to stop the flotilla ?
Israel prevents a large range of goods from reaching Gaza in order to put pressure on Hamas , which dominates the territory .
Israel also wanted to check that the ships did not contain deliveries of weapons or cash .
It offered to allow the flotilla to land in an Israeli port , and to deliver by road any goods that passed its checks .
Some flotillas have been allowed to reach Gaza in the past ; others have been sent back .
How did the international community react ?
There was widespread condemnation of the violence .
The UN Security Council issued a statement calling for a " prompt , impartial , credible and transparent " inquiry .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged Israel to lift the Gaza blockade .
What have the various inquiries found ?
In September 2010 , a UN Human Rights Council report said Israel 's military broke international laws , that the action by commandos , which left nine dead , was " disproportionate " and " betrayed an unacceptable level of brutality " .
Israel rejected the report as " biased " and " one- sided " .
Image copyright AFP Image caption
The UN panel said the loss of life from the use of force by Israeli troops was " unacceptable "
Israel and Turkey held their own inquiries , submitting the findings to an international panel set up by the UN , chaired by a former New Zealand Prime Minister , Sir Geoffrey Palmer , and including an Israeli member and Turkish member .
Turkey 's report , drawn up by government officials , accused Israeli commandos of " excessive , brutal and pre-meditated " conduct .
It concluded their action boarding the Mavi Marmara was " unlawful " and breached human rights .
Results of post - mortem examinations had earlier suggested a total of 30 bullets were found in the bodies of the dead activists , including one who had been shot four times in the head .
The Turkish panel also deemed the Gaza blockade " unlawful " .
The Israeli inquiry , headed by Judge Jacob Turkel , and including five Israeli members and two international observers , found the actions of the navy and Israel 's blockade of Gaza were legal under international law .
However , it offered some criticism of the planning of the military operation .
It also referred to " the regrettable consequences of the loss of human life and physical injuries " .
In September 2011 , the UN panel concluded in a repeatedly - delayed report that the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force by Israeli troops was " unacceptable " .
" Israel 's decision to board the vessels with such substantial force at a great distance from the blockade zone and with no final warning immediately prior to the boarding was excessive and unreasonable , " it said .
Image copyright Reuters Image caption
The Israeli commandos faced " significant , organised and violent resistance " , the UN said
However , the commandos did face " significant , organised and violent resistance " , requiring them to " use force for their own protection " , the panel found .
Nevertheless , no satisfactory explanation was provided by Israel for any of the deaths , and the " forensic evidence showing that most of the deceased were shot multiple times , including in the back , or at close range " was not accounted for , the report said .
There was also " significant mistreatment " of passengers by Israeli authorities after the takeover of the vessels , including physical mistreatment , harassment and intimidation , unjustified confiscation of belongings and the denial of timely consular assistance , it added .
At the same time , the panel said that the Israeli naval blockade on Gaza was imposed as a " legitimate security measure " to prevent weapons from entering Gaza by sea and its implementation complied with the requirements of international law .
The flotilla acted " recklessly " in attempting to breach the naval blockade of Gaza , and more could have been done to warn flotilla participants of the potential risks involved and to dissuade them from their actions , according to the report .
In November 2014 , a preliminary examination by the International Criminal Court 's Chief Prosecutor concluded that it should not take further action despite a " reasonable basis to believe that war crimes … were committed " , because it had to prioritise war crimes on a larger scale .
How were relations between Turkey and Israel affected ?
The flotilla incident caused a deep rift between the former allies .
In the immediate aftermath of the flotilla raid , Turkey withdrew its ambassador from Tel Aviv and then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for Israel to be punished for its " bloody massacre " .
Joint military exercises were also cancelled .
Following the publication of the Palmer report , which was delayed several times as diplomats tried to repair relations , Turkey expelled the Israeli ambassador in Ankara .
" The time has come for Israel to pay for its stance that sees it as above international laws and disregards human conscience , " Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said .
" The first and foremost result is that Israel is going to be devoid of Turkey 's friendship . "
The Turkish government had insisted on receiving an Israeli apology by the time the report was released .
Israeli officials noted that the UN report did not demand a full apology , establishing only that Israel should issue an " appropriate statement of regret " and " offer payment for the benefit of the deceased and injured victims and their families " .
" Israel , like any other country , has a legitimate right to protect its citizens and soldiers , " an Israeli government official told the BBC .
In November 2012 , a court in Istanbul began trying in absentia four retired Israeli commanders over the raid .
Among the charges was " inciting murder through cruelty or torture " .
The accused were named as Israel 's former military chief of staff , Gen Gabi Ashkenazi , former naval chief Vice - Admiral Eliezer Marom , former head of military intelligence Maj Gen Amos Yadlin , and former head of the air force Brig Gen Avishai Lev .
The Israeli embassy in Ankara called the trial a " unilateral political act with no judicial credibility " .
How was the dispute resolved ?
In March 2013 , Israel and Turkey 's prime ministers unexpectedly agreed to restore normalise diplomatic relations and end the legal action against former Israeli commanders .
The breakthrough came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to Mr Erdogan in a telephone conversation brokered by US President Barack Obama during a visit to Israel .
A statement from Mr Netanyahu 's office said he had " made it clear that the tragic results regarding the Mavi Marmara were unintentional and that Israel expresses regret over injuries and loss of life " .
" In light of the Israeli investigation into the incident , which pointed out several operational errors , Prime Minister Netanyahu apologized to the Turkish people for any errors that could have led to loss of life and agreed to complete the agreement on compensation , " it added .
Mr Erdogan , who became Turkey 's president the following year , said they had also " agreed on making arrangements for compensation " to the victims ' families , adding that he had " accepted the apology in the name of the Turkish people " .
In June 2016 , Turkey and Israel agreed to normalise their relations .
Officials said the reconciliation deal would see Israel pay $ 20 m in compensation to the families of those killed on the Mavi Marmara ; Turkey allowed to deliver aid to Gaza via an Israeli port ; and Turkish infrastructure projects aimed at improving the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory .
In return , Turkey agreed to pass legislation protecting Israeli troops from legal claims , and to prevent any military action or fundraising by Hamas operatives based there .

To : [ undisclosed recipients ]
Phil Willis MP , Committee Chair , is available for embargoed interviews today .
Please let me know if you wish to bid ( I will be at the embargoed briefing until approx 1 pm but will respond once I return ) .

SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE
Select Committee Announcement
[ X ]
31 March 2010
*** EMBARGOED UNTIL 00.01 WEDNESDAY 31 MARCH 2010 ***
CLIMATE SCIENCE MUST BECOME MORE TRANSPARENT , SAY MPs
The Science and Technology Committee today publishes its report on the disclosure of climate data from the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia .
The Committee calls for the climate science
community to become more transparent by publishing raw data and detailed methodologies .
Phil Willis MP , Committee Chair , said :
“ Climate science is a matter of global importance .
On the basis of the science , governments across the world will be spending trillions of pounds on climate change mitigation .
The quality of the science therefore has to be irreproachable .
What this inquiry revealed was that climate scientists need to take steps to make available all the data that support their work and full methodological workings , including their computer codes .
Had both been available , many of the problems at CRU could have been avoided . ”
The focus on Professor Jones and CRU has been largely misplaced .
On the accusations relating to Professor Jones ’s refusal to share raw data and computer codes , the Committee considers that his actions were in line with common practice in the climate science community but that those practices need to change .
On the much cited phrases in the leaked e-mails - “ trick ” and “ hiding the decline ” - the Committee considers that they were colloquial terms used in private e-mails and the balance of evidence is that they were not part of a
systematic attempt to mislead .
Insofar as the Committee was able to consider accusations of dishonesty against CRU , the Committee considers that there is no case to answer .
The Committee found no reason in this inquiry to challenge the scientific consensus as expressed by Professor Beddington , the Government Chief Scientific Adviser , that “ global warming is happening [ and ] that it is induced by human activity ” .
But this was not an inquiry into the science produced by CRU and it will be for the Scientific Appraisal Panel , announced by the University on 22 March , to determine whether the work of CRU has been soundly built .
On the mishandling of Freedom of Information ( FoI ) requests , the Committee considers that much of the responsibility should lie with the University , not CRU .
The leaked e-mails appear to show a culture of non-disclosure at CRU and instances where information may have been deleted to avoid disclosure , particularly to climate change sceptics .
The failure of the University to grasp fully the potential damage this could do and did was regrettable .
The University needs to re-assess how it can
support academics whose expertise in FoI requests is limited .

This monument in Moscow city depicts the children ( standing in the middle ) surrounded by filthy grown ups – each grown up has its own flaw or sin , one of the most common sins of the modern society , together they like stand around the innocent children that have nowhere to go – going to either side would lead to some kind of attachment .

The modern homes are no longer just merely habitats .
Instead , they comprise of a delicate ecosystem in which human beings , animals , and plants coexist .
This is especially so in cases where small gardens with aesthetic flowers , plants , pets , and reptiles have found their way into our homes .
These living things deserve an ideal environment just as the humans .
With this in mind , some form of home climate control is expected in almost all modern homes .
Nowadays , the need for homes to be just at the right temperature is demanded more than ever .
As if that is not enough , other aspects of the environment in homes are controlled too .
This may range from humidity to even precipitation in some cases .
What is more , some homes even go a step further and attempt to simulate winds and other environmental conditions so as to produce a feel as close to nature as possible .
Amazingly , in more advanced home climate controlled environments , even the specific chemical components in the air like oxygen , carbon dioxide , and nitrogen are controlled .
The outlined specifics place a very high demand on technology .
Designers of home climate control gadgets have to factor in several environmental requirements in their gadgets .
Even more , the modern consumer has greatly evolved .
People are now more technologically empowered .
Furthermore , folks prefer convenience in whatever they do nowadays .
Again , this places a very high demand on home climate control so that people can live in perfect conditions .
Manufacturers of climate control devices are now factoring the convenience use of the gadgets they design .
Luckily , technology has also evolved over the years .
Such demands would have been a big burden to a scientist in the past centuries .
In the 21st century , the advent of smart technology , advanced computer systems , and the internet make even the most unexpected changes in the way we live .
A trip to the shopping mall to buy a smart wifi thermostat can illustrate this point better .
The alternatives at the customers ’ disposal are nothing short of surprising .
To understand home climate control better , the following is an explanation of the scientific principles used in home climate control systems .
Operations of home control devices
Science has established that to effectively control the climate in homes , three factors are very important ; a functional heating system , a ventilation system , and an air conditioning system .
The combination of the three can manipulate thermodynamic principles , with a specific focus on fluid mechanics , heat transfer , and refrigeration to produce the desired microclimate appreciated in most residential areas .
Heating systems
Such systems use appliances that produce heat .
They have a warmth functionality in a home climate control system .
Heat pumps are the main appliance in most modern home climate controls systems .
They work by extracting heat from almost anything and consequently using it to warm homes .
Ventilation system
The main purpose of this function is usually to exchange air .
Fresh air from the environment is let in while stuffy air in residential homes is released out .
A form of a filter has to be installed in most ventilation to ensure air entering into the building is of the required quality .
Such things like dust particles , bad odors , and bacteria have to be removed from the air before it is ready to be used by human beings .
Ventilation systems can be either mechanical in nature .
For instance , motors rotate fans that bring in the air while the natural scientific principles are exploited to ensure the natural flow of air in and out of buildings .
Refrigeration system
This has the cooling functionality in home climate control systems .
A refrigerating fluid is circulated around the area to be cooled .
It absorbs energy from the environment leaving the environment cooler than before .
In most modern systems , the refrigeration and the heating systems are combined and work reversibly , that is to mean that a refrigeration system can also work as a heating system .
Smart thermostats
Based on the scientific principles outlined , a home control system has the following components ; a heating system , a ventilation system , and refrigeration system .
Additionally , modern home climate control systems have added functionality to ensure convenience of use .
A good example is a smart thermostat .
Smart thermostats have incorporated smart technology in their operations .
Therefore , they can be controlled remotely via an electronic gadget like a computer or mobile phones .
An application is first created and installed on a phone , tablet , or computer .
The application is then linked to the home climate control thermostat .
The gadget and thermostat communicate remotely via several internet and telecommunication signals .
Since a smart thermostat can be preprogrammed , it can control and issue commands to the system .
Interestingly , the user can operate it remotely like the way you can open the door locks to your car by pressing a button on the car keys remotely .
In the recent past , smart thermostats have seen an increase in popularity .
Apart from the climate control in the house , another area where they have encountered good reception is in wine cooling .
Wine coolers , as the name suggests are coolers specifically designed for wines .
They are slightly different from general refrigerators .
They have a variable cabinet size to accommodate wines of different tastes and sizes .
The units are classier and luxurious as compared to other coolers , suitable for any modern home .
Since wine coolers mostly attempt to regulate the temperature of wines , thermostats are now being used to regulate wine storage temperature .
The thermostat can be programmed or just controlled by the user to set the temperature required in the cooler .
The convenience of controlling the temperature of your wine remotely is now becoming popular among several homeowners .
You are far away from home but still want the wine to be at just the right temperature when you get there .
Well , in this particular case , smart thermostats for your wine cooler can be the best choice .
Using smart technology , you can simply press a button on your mobile gadget and get everything done without your presence .
Smart technology , the future is here .
To Whom It May Concern Among the Thin Women of the English - Speaking World : Please stop saying you have " Fat Days , " and / or days where you " feel fat .
" Understand that I 'm not asking you to deny or not talk about your experiences of feeling bloated with water retention , or feeling frustrated because you 've gained just enough weight that your clothes do n't fit right , or feeling unattractive , or feeling angry that trying on clothes in a poorly - lit dressing room in front of an unforgiving mirror can challenge the self - esteem of even the most body - positive among us .
I 'm just asking you not to use " fat " as an adjective to describe these feelings .
" Fat " is n't a feeling .
But if it were , it might feel like unadulterated joy ( which is how I feel in and about my fat body some days ) .
Or it might feel like the grim misery of carrying across your shoulders a sandwich board begging people to treat you like you 're a stupid , slack - jawed , immoral , self - loathing wreck with no concern for your own well - being ( which is how I frequently get treated because of my fat body ) .
Or it might feel like the exhilarating surge of fucktheworldery that the radical act of being publicly , shamelessly , unshakably fat and happy can be ( which is awesome ) in the face of mooing passers - by or tsking shamers who fancy themselves arbiters of what fat people should eat in public .
Or it might feel like all of these things , all at once , all the time .
Or other things , for other fat people .
But it would n't feel like a thin person having a bad day .
And when you use " I 'm feeling fat " to convey that you 're feeling unattractive — or unfit , or depressed , or slovenly , or unlovable , or generally not your authentic self in some way or other — you 're implicitly saying a rather lot of nasty things about fat women .
Which is unattractive in a way having nothing to do with what one looks like on her outside .
I 'd really just be ever so appreciative if you could resist appropriating a neutral description of my constant body to use as a negative descriptor of your fleeting emotional state .
Thanks .
Sincerely , Liss
Andres Torres was dozing on a couch with the blinds drawn when he heard a chorus of boots pounding the stairs .
The pudgy retiree with a fringe of white hair hobbled toward the door just as quiet settled over the yellow building of one - bedroom condos .
In the distance , cars hummed off the Palmetto Expressway and onto Bird Road .
Then , suddenly , a burst of husky voices sounded in the open - air hallway .
A battering ram splintered his neighbor 's door .
Torres scuffled toward the sound , his mouth hanging open .
Federal agents in riot gear swarmed past .
" Are there terrorists in there ? "
Torres asked .
An agent sent him back inside .
The retiree watched through a crack in the blinds as the feds hauled out a cash - counting machine and computer gear .
It was May 7 , 2008 , just before 5 p.m .
With military precision , agents at that moment were raiding five other homes across Miami - Dade .
There was a red - tile - roofed house in Coral Gables , a one - story home in Pinecrest , and an apartment just south of Killian Parkway .
A hydroponic marijuana grow house in West Kendall was also targeted .
Cops even burst into Room 1508 at the National Hotel , a celebrity hangout at 17th Street and Collins Avenue in Miami Beach .
The lawmen confiscated more than a dozen computers and $ 422,000 in cash .
They found evidence on the hard drives linking the computers to massive online thefts from huge companies such as T.J. Maxx , 7 - Eleven , and Dave & Buster's .
More than 170 million credit card numbers worth hundreds of millions of dollars had been stolen by a criminal ring stretching from the United States to Latvia , from Ukraine to Thailand .
It was the biggest identity theft case ever prosecuted .
And at its heart were four gifted hackers born and raised in South Florida : Albert Gonzalez , AKA " soupnazi , " had broken into NASA 's systems as a teen and later worked undercover for the Secret Service ; Jonathan James , known as " c0mrade " earned national fame at age 16 as the youngest hacker incarcerated ; and James 's best friend at Palmetto Senior High , Christopher Scott , was in custody too , as was Stephen Watt , AKA " Unix Terrorist , " a blindingly smart , seven - foot - tall prodigy from Melbourne .
During trials and investigations that are still underway , extraordinary stories emerged of lavish , drugged - out parties and chartered cross-country flights on a whim .
The fallout has included millions of cheated consumers and hundreds of millions in costs to businesses .
For the gang , there were two - decade - long federal sentences , massive fines , and — for one member — a bullet through the head .
With all its Miami - style excess , the case reeks of the cocaine cowboy days but with a sprig of new World Wide Web flavor .
" I think Albert and his crew got started like me , with hacking just for the thrill and the intellectual pursuit and basically thinking it was all a game , " says Kevin Mitnick , the most wanted hacker in America before his 1995 arrest and now a security consultant .
" But at some point in his life , Albert figured out he could make a lot of money hacking for profit .
He liked that .
And that 's when everything changed . "
Jonathan James and Albert Gonzalez grew up just 15 minutes apart in quiet , residential neighborhoods south of downtown Miami .
Both showed an early genius for computers , and both were interrogated by the FBI in high school .
The pair even seems to have joined the same online gang , the Keebler Elves .
Yet they likely did n't meet face - to - face until Gonzalez 's senior year of high school in 1999 .
Jonathan 's dad , Bobby , is a computer programmer from outside Pensacola with a thick goatee , a twinge of a Panhandle accent , and a dry sense of humor .
He moved to Miami in 1982 with his wife , Joanne Jurysta , a brunette with a dazzling smile .
Jonathan was born in 1983 , the year the family settled into a ranch - style home on SW 72nd Court in a leafy enclave of Pinecrest .
Three years later , they had a second son , Josh .
Bobby had a good job programming for Miami - Dade County , and the boys were raised upper - middle class and Jewish , attending arguably the region 's best private grade school , the pricey Temple Beth Am .
When Jonathan was 6 , he began spending whole days on his dad's PC .
By middle school , he had switched the family PC from Windows to Linux so he could have more control over the code .
Jonathan 's parents were thrilled at his gifts but also wary of his disobedience .
Once , when the boy was 13 , his mother took away a computer after catching him online in the middle of the night .
" He ran away from home and called to say that he would n't come back until he got his computer back , " Bobby remembers .
" We asked the police to trace the call , and he was at this Borders bookstore that was , like , four blocks away . "
Later , Bobby tried more desperate measures — slicing the phone lines that ran through his son's bedroom to kill the Internet .
Jonathan rebraided the filaments .
Albert Gonzalez 's parents , meanwhile , were waging a similar battle a few miles north in a Spanish - tiled home at SW 32nd Street and 64th Avenue .
Their son was almost two years older than Jonathan and born to Cuban immigrants .
His mother , Maria , had won a visa lottery on the island in the early ' 70s and moved to South Florida .
Around the same time , his father , Alberto Sr. , built a raft with two friends and launched it into the Caribbean Sea .
Two days later , a U.S. submarine found the men in the Florida Straits and called a cutter to rescue them .
Alberto Sr. lived in Chicago for a few years and then moved back to Miami to start a landscaping company .
After he met Maria and the couple married in 1977 , they bought the house in Southwest Miami - Dade .
Young Albert earned money during summers picking up grass clippings for his father 's landscaping jobs .
By age 8 , he 'd saved enough to buy a PC .
He flashed his natural brilliance two years later when a computer came down with a virus .
" It upset him that his computer was n't working right , " says Rene Palomino , a family friend who , like Alberto Sr. , was a deacon at the Prince of Peace Lutheran Church , and who later represented Albert as a lawyer .
" That 's how his fascination with what a computer is and how it works really started . "
Like Jonathan 's parents , Alberto Sr. and Maria began to worry that their rail - thin , pale son spent too much time online .
" He was fascinated by this new technology , " his sister , Frances Gonzalez Lago , says in a letter filed in court .
" He would sit at the computer for hours at a time .
He went from being an extroverted and talkative kid to quiet , introverted , and obsessed . "
But the Cuban immigrants also hoped their son's skills could land him a lucrative career .
" His dad said , ' It 's better than him getting high or running around with gangs , ' " Palomino recalls .
That attitude did n't last long .
When the boy was still in grade school , Alberto Sr. grew so worried about his son's disobedience that he talked some friends in the local police force into helping him stage a fake arrest to try to scare him straight .
It did n't work .
Halfway through his freshman year at South Miami High , when Albert was 14 , real FBI agents walked into principal Thomas Shaw 's office and asked to speak to the gawky kid with short - cropped dark hair .
Albert , it turned out , had been using stolen credit card numbers to buy CDs , shoes , and videogames .
He'd have them shipped to empty houses for sale and then pick up the goods late at night .
He 'd also been hacking for fun .
Once , he 'd found his way into the government of India 's main site , where he left offensive jokes : " Why are your women so ugly ? " and " What 's with the red dot ? "
But that 's not what alerted the FBI .
In early 1995 , Albert had hacked into NASA 's servers , Palomino recalls : " [ The FBI investigator ] said , ' We have no interest in prosecuting a 14 - year - old .
But we need to know : How did he do it ? ' "
Later that month , Palomino , Albert , and Alberto Sr. gathered in the FBI 's Miami office .
An expert spoke with the boy for more than four hours .
" Hours in , the guy pulls us into the hallway and says , ' This kid is amazing .
He 's running circles around me , ' " Palomino recalls .
The feds agreed to not file charges if Albert 's parents took away his computer for six months .
The boy returned to South Miami High , stayed out of trouble , and graduated in 1999 .
But Albert was already developing a split personality .
In public , he seemed like a decent student and computer savant .
In the privacy of his bedroom , online , he transformed into " soupnazi " — an aggressive , macho hacker .
The summer after he graduated from high school , " soupnazi " talked to ZDNet magazine and boasted about breaking into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's system for the Keebler Elves gang .
" Defacing a site , to me , is showing the admins , the government ... that we own them , " he bragged .
Albert was never pegged for that crime .
Jonathan James was n't so lucky .
On January 26 , 2000 , just before 8 a.m. , Bobby James got in his car to leave for his job at county hall .
He noticed a Pinecrest Police cruiser in his neighbor 's back yard but did n't think much of it .
Suddenly , the lights flicked on .
Bobby pulled over .
As an officer walked up , three dark - tinted Lincoln Continentals screeched to a halt .
His stomach dropped .
" What did Jonathan do now ? " the father asked .
The past year had been difficult .
Jonathan had been suspended from Palmetto Senior High , where he was a sophomore , after he was caught stealing computers from a lab .
Then his mother , Joanne , had been diagnosed with late - stage breast cancer .
She 'd recently had a mastectomy .
As cops entered the house , Bobby grabbed the lead agent 's arm .
" Listen , the bedroom you want is the first one in the hallway , " he said .
" In the back bedroom , my wife is 21 days postmastectomy .
She will not be happy to see you . "
From Jonathan 's bedroom , the agents took five computers , a cache of burned CDs , and — bizarrely — his Klingon - language dictionary .
" They thought he'd used it as an encryption tool , I guess , " Bobby says , laughing .
Like Albert , Jonathan had hacked into NASA 's computers .
But the younger hacker had gone a step further .
He had intercepted more than 3,000 emails and stolen data from 13 computers .
The boy had even downloaded the program that controlled the climate on the International Space Station .
On March 20 , Jonathan admitted he'd hacked the government and he belonged to the Keebler Elves .
Prosecutors were n't satisfied .
They were angry he'd told other hackers about his bust , which meant he could n't be used in a sting .
In September 2000 , at age 16 , he was sentenced to six months in a juvenile facility and probation until he was 21 .
Jonathan was n't contrite .
The day after his sentencing , he called the Miami Herald to brag .
He sent a photo of himself in dark shades and black clothes , strutting like Neo from The Matrix , his favorite movie .
He said he 'd hacked BellSouth , the Miami - Dade public school system , and many others .
" All the girls thought it was cool , " Jonathan told the newspaper .
His hacking , he said , had helped the government by showing weaknesses in the system .
Jonathan 's dad felt impressed , even if warning bells were ringing .
" He really did n't feel that he 'd done any malicious damage , " Bobby says of his son .
" But in hindsight , he was already showing some sociopathic tendencies .
He truly felt that rules were meant for everyone but him . "
In early 2007 , Albert sat at a desk dwarfed by a towering mound of wrinkled cash .
Hundreds of thousands of dollars in $ 20 bills were heaped in unruly piles as he chatted online with friend Stephen Watt .
Albert laughed as his automatic counting machine choked on the cash .
" I 'm trying to manually count over $ 340,000 , " Albert wrote to his buddy .
" My f'n money counter just broke , 340,000 , and it 's all in 20s.
ROFL ! "
His grand criminal enterprise — which he called " operation get rich or die tryin " — had already brought regular payments of $ 10,000 or more from Eastern Europe , laundered through Latvian banks and then delivered by courier to drop boxes in South Florida .
In just a few years , he had evolved from hacking for fun to masterminding a series of massive online heists , to some extent with the help of Jonathan .
Also involved were two of their friends from South Florida hacking circles , Stephen Watt and Chris Scott .
Albert had met Stephen when both were high school hackers .
The seven - footer from Melbourne — a savant who graduated at age 16 from Melbourne Catholic High — had won admirers online by founding a hacking cartel called Project Mayhem .
Chris , Jonathan 's best friend at Palmetto Senior , was an overweight social misfit with a gift for computers .
The four friends , according to Chris 's mom , probably encountered one another at meetings of an underground hacker magazine called 2600 in 1999 , when Albert was a high school senior .
Now , years later , the four had combined to hack into databases of some of the largest U.S. retailers and lifted millions of credit card numbers .
They then manufactured cards using some of the stolen data .
" These guys all started like me , hacking just to see what happens at first when you 're still a kid , " says E. J. Hilbert , a former FBI undercover agent who worked several cases connected to Albert 's criminal ring .
" Then you have to show off just to show what you can do .
Finally , you ... steal ...
That 's when things really get serious . "
But there was something the gang did n't know about their leader , Albert Gonzalez .
It had all begun after the handsome young Cuban with lively eyes and a buzzcut graduated from South Miami High in 1999 .
He enrolled in classes at Miami Dade College but soon dropped out to move to New York for a programming job with FortuneCity , a dot - com start - up .
When the site went belly - up a year later , Albert found work with European engineering giant Siemens .
A few months later , though , Siemens closed Albert 's office and asked him to relocate to Pennsylvania .
He refused .
Palomino says Albert had by then developed a drug habit — pot , cocaine , and amphetamines .
He hooked up with a group of hackers that ran a site called ShadowCrew ( slogan : " For Those Who Wish to Play in the Shadows ! " ) .
Their message board offered hackers a place to discuss topics such as " recreational pharmacy " and " physical ops . "
Mostly , though , it was a safe haven to buy and sell stolen credit cards .
By 2002 , Albert had become one of the site 's administrators , operating under the name " cumbajohny . "
Soon ShadowCrew had garnered more than 4,000 subscribers who traded more than a million stolen cards .
But then the operation imploded .
In late 2003 , Albert walked up to an ATM on a quiet New Jersey side street to test fraudulent cards .
Local detectives happened to be staking out a grand theft auto ring nearby .
They watched the then - 23 - year - old , who sported long , scraggly hair and a scruffy beard , feeding card after card into the machine .
After stopping him , they discovered more than 75 cards in his pockets .
They passed Albert onto the Secret Service , which decided to use him to bring down the ShadowCrew .
Yet again , Albert seems to have set up a two - faced personality .
For the federal agents , he played the part of a repentant hacker — sparing no effort to bring down his criminal coconspirators and pleading he'd joined them only out of curiosity .
But online , as investigators would learn years later , Albert was still " soupnazi , " the kid who could n't stop hacking for fun , for profit , and for the sheer joy of breaking the rules .
Days after his arrest at the ATM , " cumbajohny " was back at work at ShadowCrew .
He encouraged site members to log into a secure network to sell the cards , supposedly for their privacy — but really so he could feed their identities to the feds .
On October 26 , 2004 , Albert organized an online meeting of top users .
By the end of the day , " Operation Firewall " had ensnared 28 ShadowCrew members .
The feds turned up more than 1.7 million stolen card numbers .
And Albert had found a new career .
The Secret Service agreed to pay him $ 75,000 annually as a hacker / consultant .
" He was doing what he loves to do , " Palomino says .
" And he was doing it legally with the government 's consent . "
Back in Miami , Jonathan James was struggling to readjust to life after serving six months of house arrest for hacking NASA .
At least one computer company offered employment afterward .
But Jonathan was n't interested .
" That would have required actually , you know , showing up for work , " Bobby says .
Soon after , the boy violated his probation by smoking pot .
That earned him a four - month term in a Liberty City halfway house .
On February 10 , 2002 , breast cancer killed Joanne James .
Jonathan , always moody , became depressed .
In late March 2002 , after violating probation again , he was sentenced to a six months at Three Springs , a youth facility outside Tuskegee , Alabama , where he was kept away from newspapers , books , and computers .
The 19 - year - old clashed regularly with guards .
He was one of two white inmates in the facility , his dad says .
On New Year 's Eve 2003 , he was walking home from a party when a cop stopped him , suspecting he might have drugs .
He did n't , but a speeding ticket had lapsed while he was in the halfway house , and he was booked overnight into Miami - Dade County Jail .
When Bobby picked him up at 10 the next morning , the young man said , " Dad , I 'm never going to jail again .
Never . "
After his prison term , Jonathan grew closer to Chris Scott , who had earned a GED after dropping out of Palmetto Senior High .
The pair drank , played Ping - Pong , and hacked .
They also stayed in touch with Albert , who had bought a $ 118,500 condo off Bird Road .
Albert had already re-entered the world of illegal hacking — even as he infiltrated online gangs for the Secret Service .
It was n't long before he talked the two friends into helping him .
Their first big hack for Albert came in 2003 , when Chris helped him break through an unprotected wireless system at BJ's Wholesale Club .
The next year , according to one federal indictment , Chris and " J.J. " — probably Jonathan James — began " wardriving , " as hackers call it , up and down U.S. 1 in Kendall .
They looked for big companies ' wireless systems on the thoroughfare and then hacked in to steal credit card data .
On one of these tours , they hacked the OfficeMax on SW 109th Street .
Albert , meanwhile , recruited an itinerant hacker named Damon Patrick Toey to move into his condo .
Damon had begun stealing credit cards online as an 18 - year - old in Virginia , where he lived with ten other relatives in a tiny apartment .
His mother was absent , " out partying every night and drinking , " according to court documents .
Albert offered Damon free room and board in exchange for help stealing data ; his attorney later said the younger man was a virtual slave , trapped in the condo with no car or money .
By 2007 , Albert , Chris , Jonathan , and Damon — with the help of a " sniffer " program , written by Stephen , that found weaknesses in security systems — had hacked a staggering array of companies : TJX Companies , which owns the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains ; Dave & Buster 's ; Sports Authority ; Citibank ; a corporate payroll company called Heartland Payment Systems ; and others .
They worked with two mysterious , powerful hackers in Russia who helped direct them to targets .
After the gang members stole customers ' credit card numbers , they had two options .
With some of the data , they made fake cards and used them to withdraw cash from ATMs in Miami and elsewhere .
But the vast majority were fenced online .
To sell the cards , Albert had hooked up with a 25 - year - old Ukrainian named Maksym Yastremskiy , known online as " maksik . "
Maksym bought cards in bulk and then laundered Albert 's payments through a site called eGold before depositing money into Latvian bank accounts .
In chats , Albert marveled at media coverage of his crimes .
" I 'm surprised [ this latest theft ] was n't on the news , every hack i've made is on the news heh , " he typed .
With his profits , Albert soon moved with his girlfriend into the swanky National Hotel , leaving Damon to toil in the shabby condo .
He leased a 2006 BMW 300i and threw a $ 75,000 birthday party for himself .
He made plans to invest in Stephen 's dream project : a New York rock club .
Jonathan James was n't living that life .
He and his brother Josh lived rent - free at their childhood home , which their mother had left them when she died .
Their dad had moved into his own apartment in South Beach .
If his son was profiting from Albert 's crimes , Bobby did n't see much evidence .
" Jonathan took living with no cash to a new extreme , " he says .
" He was even scarfing wireless Internet from the neighbors . "
On July 25 , 2007 , a team of Secret Service agents huddled inside a posh resort in Kemer , a seaside town in southwestern Turkey .
Across the hall , Turkish secret agents slipped into a luxury suite and grabbed a Lamborghini laptop .
The laptop 's owner , the Ukrainian Maksym Yastremskiy , was dancing at a nightclub nearby .
The Turks handed over the machine , and the U.S. agents began downloading data .
When they finished , they put the computer back in Maksym 's room and slipped out of the resort .
The agents had waited years for the hacker to travel to a friendly country where they could carry out this operation ; in Ukraine , he was protected by corrupt officials .
Turkish police arrested Maksym the next day .
By July 30 , he had provided his passwords and given investigators full access to his computer .
Still , it was n't easy to pin down his accomplices .
Albert 's team used secure communication networks that gave users long numerical IDs , not easier - to - identify nicknames .
" We had this evidence of these strings of numbers being connected to a crime , " lead prosecutor Kim Peretti said in a recent interview with BankInfoSecurity.com .
" But connecting the numbers to a person was really difficult . "
Detectives focused on Maksym 's chats with one American — 201679996 — who had sold him millions of stolen credit card numbers .
They spent the next few months studying the data with experts at Carnegie Mellon University .
By late 2007 , they had linked the numbers to a Russian email address with a startling name : soupnazi@efnet.ru .
Alarm bells rang across the Secret Service .
Was their prize informant playing them ?
Then investigators found a chat in which 201679996 referred to himself as " segvec " — another nickname Albert had used in his ShadowCrew days .
That sealed it .
The Secret Service immediately began investigating Albert .
Soon they arrested an Estonian hacker and accessed two Latvian servers where they found more than 40 million unsold credit card numbers linked to the break - ins at U.S. companies .
After Maksym's arrest , Albert probably considered running .
But he made no move to erase his links to the Ukrainian hacker .
" I would have wiped all my drives clean , shredded all my paper , taken any evidence there was out of my possession , " former hacker Mitnick says .
" Then all you have is the logs , and they can't conclusively link that to you .
I do n't get it . "
For months , Albert holed up in the National Hotel .
He had cash — more than $ 400,000 on hand and another $ 1.1 million buried in plastic tubs in his parents ' back yard .
On May 7 , 2008 , eight months after Maksym 's arrest , the feds made their move , raiding Chris Scott 's and Jonathan James 's homes , Jonathan 's girlfriend 's apartment , and Albert 's hotel room , condo , and parents ' home .
They arrested Albert and Chris the same day .
Damon was soon in custody too .
Stephen Watt 's role in the crime was n't determined until August .
Jonathan was n't arrested during the raids .
For almost two weeks , he tried to understand why the FBI had targeted him again .
Then , on May 18 , a federal indictment against Albert Gonzalez was posted online .
Jonathan read it and was shocked : Albert had been working for the feds since 2003 .
Jonathan leaped to a quick — and tragically mistaken — conclusion : Albert had offered up Chris Scott to get out of the latest charges , and Chris , inevitably , would give prosecutors an even bigger morsel : Jonathan James , the young hacker they 'd already sent to the slammer once before .
Jonathan grabbed a sheet of lined notebook paper and wrote in uneven but unrushed cursive strokes .
" Story Time , " he penned at the top .
" When I Googled ' cumbajohny , ' what I saw blew my mind .
Albert had been working with the feds since 2003 .
That means that for five years , he had been having people like Chris hack credit cards for him while he made money selling them over the Internet and then at the same time has his buyers arrested to please the feds , " he wrote .
" Talk about entrapment ! "
Jonathan continued , " I honestly , honestly had nothing to do with [ the TJX break - in ] .
Unfortunately , I do n't picture the feds caring all too much .
" So despite the fact that [ Chris ] and Albert are the most destructive , dangerous hackers the feds have ever caught , they 'll let them off easy because I 'm a juicier target . "
A few minutes later , Jonathan picked up a handgun and sat on the floor in the corner of his bathroom .
He signed the letter : " Remember , it 's not whether you win or lose , it 's whether I win or lose , and sitting in jail for 20 , 10 , or even 5 years for a crime I did n't commit is not me winning .
I die free . "
Jonathan nestled the gun against his head , just over his right ear , aimed upward and to the left , and pulled the trigger .
Albert Gonzalez stood before a judge in a Boston courthouse on March 25 .
Maria and Alberto Sr. cried audibly in the front row .
He wore olive - green prison garb and spoke in an even tone .
" I stand before you humbled by these past 22 months , " he said .
" I 'm guilty not only of exploiting computer networks , but of exploiting personal relationships . "
It was the last day in a 22 - month legal process — one of three criminal cases Albert faced in Massachusetts , New Jersey , and New York for the thefts he orchestrated in " operation get rich or die tryin . "
He faced 15 to 25 years in federal prison , and he pleaded with the judge for mercy .
He 'd betrayed the Secret Service and cost U.S. companies and credit card users big money .
TJX alone lost 46.5 million credit card numbers and spent more than $ 132 million paying back customers , fixing security flaws , and defending itself in lawsuits .
Banks , retailers , and payroll companies racked up " hundreds of millions " in expenses , prosecutors said .
" He knowingly victimized a group of people whose population exceeded that of many major cities and some states , " prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memo .
But Albert pleaded with the judge that he did n't do it out of avarice .
" I did n't throw it away because of egotism or greed , " he said .
" I threw it away because of my inability to stop my pursuit of curiosity and my addiction . "
The month before , a psychologist named Barry Roth had testified that Albert might suffer from Asperger 's disorder , which is similar to autism .
He noted the hacker was " possessed by a twisted genius . "
Palomino , in part , blames the Secret Service for not monitoring Albert more closely .
" Sending him home with a laptop would be like a DEA agent sending a cokehead informant home with a kilo for the weekend and expecting him to come back with the whole thing on Monday , " he says .
" The guy had an addiction . "
But the prosecution 's psychologist , Mark J. Mills , argued that Internet addiction is n't recognized by mainstream medicine and that Albert clearly knew what he was doing when he stole .
The truth , perhaps , lies somewhere in the middle .
Going back to his earliest days as a hacker , it 's clear that Albert never really stopped breaking the law online — he just got better at pretending that he had reformed himself .
And if his hacking was rooted in intellectual curiosity , by the end it was also driven by naked greed .
This past March 25 , U.S. District Judge Patti B. Saris sentenced
Albert to 20 years in prison , much of it to be served in isolation because of his role as an informant .
He was also ordered to repay $ 69,143,862.80 .
Another restitution hearing is set for June .
It was the stiffest sentence ever handed down to a cybercriminal .
Chris Scott received a seven - year federal sentence .
Stephen
Watt got two years and was required to pay $ 171.5 million in restitution .
Damon
Toey earned five years in prison .
Yastremskiy was hit with a 30 - year prison sentence by Turkish courts .
Prosecutors say two Russian criminals , identified only as " Hacker 1 " and " Hacker 2 , " played a key role in all the thefts .
They remain at large .
After Jonathan 's death , Bobby James moved back into the Pinecrest home with his other son , Josh .
The house , still cluttered with Jonathan 's books and videogames , has the air of a bachelor pad .
The brick - lined pool out back is half - full of tea -colored storm water .
Bobby says he still struggles with Jonathan 's suicide .
He brushes his teeth every morning in the same bathroom where his son died .
" I just try to remember the good times we 've had in this house , " he says .
He is still not sure how much of a role Jonathan played in Albert 's scheme .
He believes his son's claim that he did n't participate in the huge TJX break - in .
" But I do believe that he was doing other illegal stuff for Albert , " he says .
Bobby also tries to keep a sense of humor about his boy 's brilliant and troubled life .
He and Josh sometimes laugh about how confused Jonathan was when federal agents took his Klingon dictionary .
They chuckle about the time he was desperate enough for cash to eat a whole jalapeño for $ 20 .
A few weeks ago , Bobby printed simple white business cards with Jonathan 's name , his date of birth and date of death , and this simple inscription :
" Google ' c0 mrade hacker . ' ( Please Remember Me ) . "
Doctors to be able to ' print ' new organs for transplant patients
Doctors might one day be able to ' print ' living body parts they need for surgery , including blood vessels and entire organs .
The astonishing technique is known as bio-printing and it could make the transplant list a thing of the past .
Currently patients on the transplant list have to wait months or even years before a suitable organ becomes available .
A scientist manipulates the prototype 3D bioprinter which is already capable of making real , living arteries
But the 3D bio-printer , developed by US company Organovo , is already capable of growing arteries and its developers say arteries ' printed ' by the device could be used in heart bypass surgery in five years .
More complex organs such as hearts , and teeth and bone should be possible within ten years .
The technology is based upon existing systems which create 3D models of components in industry .
The difference in bio-printing is that instead of layers of plastics , a 3D bio - printer uses layers upon layers of biological building blocks to create real , living tissue .
The concept is in its infancy but a working prototype of the first machine became available for testing at the end of last year .
The cells are layered in circles and sandwich a gel between them .
They then reform to create a new artery
The printer uses cells from the patient 's body so they will not be rejected .
A 3D model of the organ or artery to be printed is made first before layers of the cells are placed on top of each other .
A sheet of ' biopaper ' gel is printed first followed by a circle of ' bio - ink ' cells .
The process is then repeated layer by layer until the new organ is finished .
The natural cells then begin to reorganise themselves and fuse together to form the new blood vessel .
Each vessel takes about an hour to build and then a few days for the cells to knit together .
Organovo chief executive Keith Murphy told the Engineer magazine : ' Ultimately , the idea would be for surgeons to have tissue on demand for various uses . '
Meanwhile , hundreds of thousands of people who have damaged their knee cartilage may be able to regrow a replacement .
The cutting - edge MACI , or matrixinduced chondrocyte implantation , begins with the surgeon scraping a small amount of healthy cartilage from the patient 's knee .
The sample is shipped to a specialist lab , where a cocktail of chemicals coax the cartilage cells into growing .
In the hospital , the surgeon removes the damaged cartilage and plugs the hole with the lab - grown cartilage , which is stitched into place .
Centres using the MACI technique include the Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield .
A merican cuisine is less a melting pot than a smorgasbord laid out at the United Nations — we freely mix a variety of dishes from multiple cultures to make a great spread .
One benefit :
By using recipes from Italian , Mexican , Asian , and other kitchens , we can create extremely affordable menus that yield a tremendous flavor for very little money .
Starting with that expansive attitude , you can feed a family of four on $ 25 or less a day by using ingredients at their peak , by planning your week 's menu to recycle ingredients ( just like our Dinner Rush column ) and by keeping a well - stocked pantry and refrigerator with essentials like vinegar , olive and vegetable oil , sugar , all - purpose flour , garlic , salt , pepper , cinnamon , and baking powder .
In mixing and matching dishes from various cuisines , I 've cut a lot of extraneous ingredients , but you might want to spring for fresh herbs like dill and tarragon .
Or invest in small pots to grow on the kitchen counter , snipping them as you need .
See our article onWindowsill Herb Gardens for help
Most importantly , you need to be creative and organized at the same time .
Plan your menus around what 's in season and on sale .
Use online coupons from supermarkets , or clip them — if you can find a newspaper anymore !
Never waste leftovers .
Treat meat as a condiment , not as the main event .
And cook up recipes in larger batches to freeze for later .
DAKAR , Senegal —
Much more is riding in the backseat of Amy Ndiane ’s chic neon yellow cab than the occasional passenger .
A Muslim woman , 30 , who supports two kids from the fares she negotiates , Ndiane is an official , supported - by - the - president “ Taxi Sister ” — one of the select few female cabbies in Senegal .
“ I heard there is a woman in the United States who drives a taxi , ” mused Ndiane , a former data entry typist .
“ For Africa , this is a first , for a woman to have a taxi . ”
Her novelty can be measured in the exclamations of well - wishers cheering her on from the crowded sidelines of Dakar ’s chaotic rush hour .
“ Taxi Sister ! ” hollered a young man trudging up an unforgiving hill pushing a cart of juice for sale .
A laughing male taxi driver waved hello as he and Ndiane orbited a traffic circle together .
The rest of her fans are women — or girls like the teenager in school clothes who heave both hands into the air and cry out “ Taxi Sister ! ” as Ndiane zips by .
“ They all want to be taxi drivers , ” she said , then chuckled .
She is n’t joking .
Three years ago , when Senegal ’s government launched its all - women taxi fleet , it targeted modest numbers : Following a request by President Abdoulaye Wade , the state leased 10 hatchbacks on a rent - to - buy basis for women who wished to drive a cab .
Taxi Sister , the thinking went , would be a microfinance trial run for a government that is all but arm wrestling bank chiefs into lending to Senegal ’s un - banked masses .
In addition it would be a nifty gesture towards female empowerment .
Hundreds of women applied — a testament to the deep reserve of female talent in this country where the job market can hardly accommodate its men , let alone the other half .
Senegal is an overwhelmingly Muslim country and the Taxi Sisters wear head scarves .
They have not been confronted with significant religious objections to their work .
Now , the government wants to roll out 2,000 Taxi Sister taxis by 2015 — an influx of peppy four - door coupes that delights gender rights activists pushing to reform this somewhat conservative Muslim society .
Dakar ’s 15,000 taxi brothers are decidedly less than tickled .
“ We have too many taxis and not enough clients , ” lamented Moussa Iss , who has witnessed the cab lines overfill since he first picked up the keys in 1954 — and who , at 4 p.m. on a Thursday — had n’t found his day ’s first customer .
The Taxi Sister parked nearby had managed just one , a $ 2 lift across town .
Neither had begun to earn their daily car payments — $ 12 for her , $ 20 for him .
Iss , 85 , does n’t fault the Taxi Sisters — “ they are in the same bind as us , ” he said — but the math is clear .
“ This work is becoming so bad , ” he sighed .
And yet the wheels roll on .
However poorly the country ’s cabbies may fare , the taxi sister ’s struggle for their share of the yellow cars is seen by many as symbolic for a wider fight for women ’s jobs and rights .
The Taxi Sister drivers are trained in driving and mechanics and they have taken self defense courses , too .
Not to mention , a few more women on the road might be a good thing to moderate Dakar ’s aggressive driving culture .
“ In the traffic , women do n’t go for speed , they think more about safety , ” said Maiga Ndeye , secretary for Femme Auto , Dakar ’s women - manned car repairshop , and the only woman on - site whose hands were n’t manicured in grease splotches .
“ Women are getting to be everywhere now , ” she said .
“ We ’re working as auto mechanics , as bus drivers , and now taxi drivers , too . ”
She added a prophecy : “ We ’re on our way to dominating the transportation system . ”
Ndeye may be right , or at the very least , being a woman has its advantages in this economy of un-metered taxis and haggled fares .
“ We negotiate better , ” bragged taxi sister Oulimata Samba , 28 .
Transport consultant Papis Bassene agreed :
“ The taxi sisters are more charming , ” he said .
“ Psychologically , you may think that the woman has more need of the help . ”
Indeed .
Shortly before Ndiane coaxes a $ 10 fare from a GlobalPost correspondent — five times what he would have paid a taxi brother — she made a vow .
“ After five years , we ’re going to buy these cars , ” she said .
“ And then we ’re going to buy some more cars , bigger cars .
“ One , two , four , ” — she hesitated — “ then a thousand . ”
Iss , the octogenarian cab driver , hopes he lives to see it .
“ They work hard , ” he acknowledged .
“ We the men have to let them earn , because we have so many women who live on the street .
We need to lift them up . ”
CASH - strapped university students struggling to get by on baked beans and two - minute noodles and are at greater risk of developing chronic diseases , according to a new Australian study .
Researchers Dr Danielle Gallegos and Kai Wen
Ong surveyed 811 Brisbane - based university students on their household income , health and nutrition status , and access to food .
One in four of the study participants experienced " food insecurity ' ' in the 12 months leading up to the survey , and six per cent reported to be repeatedly hungry .
Presenting her research at the Dietitians Association of Australia ( DAA ) national conference in Melbourne this week , Dr Gallegos said cash - strapped university students were prioritising university fees , accommodation and bills over " discretionary expenses ' ' such as food .
" There seems to be an acceptance out there that getting by on less nutritious food is a typical part of being a uni student , '' she said .
" But a diet of baked beans and instant noodles is not good enough when health and academic results are at stake .
" This culture is counterproductive to Australia becoming a ' smart ' country . ''
Dr Gallegos said the study found that many university students found it hard to access nutritious foods , with about 50 per cent of students reporting their household income was $ 600 a week before tax .
" Two - thirds of the food - insecure students in our study ate less than two serves of fruit per week and four per cent had no fruit at all , '' she said .
Dr Gallegos said vulnerable groups tended to eat more fast foods or energy - dense foods , like take - aways , as these were often viewed as more affordable and filling .
She said low income groups who found it difficult to eat a healthy , balanced diet were more likely to be either overweight or underweight , and were at a greater risk of chronic diseases like diabetes , cancer and heart disease .
When people are murdered in Jefferson County , chances are the killer was a male under 25 using a gun .
More than half of the accused killers in the county were 24 or younger , according to a Birmingham News analysis of homicides from 2006 through 2009 .
Nine times out of 10 , the victims were shot to death .
The percentage of homicides with defendants under age 25 who used guns in Jefferson County substantially exceeds the national average , statistics show .
In Birmingham , where nearly three - quarters of the county 's murders occurred , the disparity was even worse from 2006 - 2009 .
Ages 16 through 24 are the killing years here .
That age group comprised 56 percent of the accused killers in Birmingham and 54 percent across the county those four years .
Nationally , 42 percent of the homicide defendants were 17 through 24 , according to FBI statistics , which do not break out separate numbers for 16 - year - olds .
The
made up 52 percent of the homicide defendants in Birmingham and 50 percent across Jefferson County .
" We 're seeing more violence from that age group , more kids with cold hearts , " said A.C. Roper , Birmingham 's police chief .
" Quite often we 've heard kids say , ' Well , the victim went to a better place , ' and chalk it up as if they were doing God 's will or something . "
Ages 16 through 24 also are the dying years .
About 16 percent of Birmingham 's population is in that age group , but 33 percent of its homicide victims die that young .
" The one issue that has caused me the greatest concern is seeing young men gunned down in the streets by other young men , " said Roper , whose 19 - year - old brother was murdered while holding his infant son during a 1992 robbery attempt .
" My wife 's brother also was murdered in Birmingham , " he said .
" I do n't know many cities where the chief and the chief 's wife have both lost siblings to murder in that city . "
The toll was especially harsh on black families .
A substantial number of young black men in the city and county wound up in prison or a coffin .
Statistics show :
>>
Black males were 80 percent of the homicide defendants in majority - white Jefferson County and 89 percent in majority - black Birmingham .
The national average was 57 percent .
>>
More than 70 percent of the victims in Birmingham were black males , versus 43 percent nationwide in 2007 , the only year a comparison was possible .
>>
Guns were used in 86 percent of Birmingham homicides , and 83 percent in the county as a whole , versus 68 percent nationwide .
Birmingham 's rate is higher among defendants ages 16 through 24 .
Some families suffered both ways in Birmingham and Jefferson County .
Otis Towns , 18 , was gunned down in 2006 .
In March his brother , Cortez Towns , went to prison for a murder committed when he was 17 .
Murder rates are dropping nationally and locally , including a 39 percent decrease in Birmingham 2006 through 2009 .
Homicides by white offenders also dropped substantially in Alabama and the nation from 2000 through 2007 , according to a study by Northeastern University professors James Allen Fox and Marc L. Swatt .
But the rate of homicides involving both black male offenders and victims under age 25 rose in the nation and state in that period , the study showed .
Homicide is the cause for nearly half of black males in the U.S. who die at ages 15 through 24 , according to the
.
" Kids have always fought , " said Joe Ackerson , a pediatric neuropsychologist at the
.
" But now they fight with bullets instead of fists .
And when you use bullets , the results can't be reversed . "

Hold the front page !
The docile White House press corps has got steamed up about something and finally taken a scalp as a result .
It seems the Capitol Hill cocktail set who usually sit and preen themselves like pampered Pomeranians while asking pre-screened , pre-approved , Obama - friendly questions have forced a resignation .
So what provoked them and who were they gunning for ?
Was it one of Obama ’s aids caught lying -- maybe some political sleaze or even another Watergate in the making ?
Could they have been making a final stand for journalistic integrity and freedom over the administration ’s plans to prosecute and imprison investigative reporters who refuse to reveal their sources ?
Well sorry to disappoint -- it was none of the above .
It seems the most famous gaggle of journalists in the world finally got steamed up about a comment made by one of their own … against Israel .
And their target just happens to be an 89 - year - old columnist who has nailed more U.S. presidents with her hammer - blow questions than any other member of the White House press corps .
The formidable grand dame of the White House press corps has now been forced to quit her much coveted front row seat -- from where she made no less than 10 U.S. presidents sweat with her probing questions .
Helen Thomas resigned just before the White House Correspondents Association announced it was considering stripping her of her prime position .
No doubt some of these are the same gutless scribes who gave President George W. Bush such an easy ride over Iraq , Guantanamo , Abu Ghraib , torture , waterboarding , etc. Now had Helen Thomas blasted : “ Palestinians should get the hell out of Israel , ” she would have been feted .
Instead , what the redoubtable Ms. Thomas , a lifelong critic of Zionism , said was that Israeli Jews should “ get the hell out of Palestine ” and return to Germany and Poland “ or wherever they came from .
” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnALLK5g--I&hd=1Ms.
Thomas , a columnist for Hearst Newspapers , apologized almost immediately for the off - the - cuff comments she made to a rabbi who was conducting a video interview with her outside the White House during a recent celebration of Jewish heritage .
Now the decision to retire her , with immediate effect , was announced by Hearst Newspapers , which syndicates her column .
The announcement was made just weeks ahead of her 90th birthday on August 4 .
The board of the correspondents association , which recently gathered to consider how to respond to her controversial remarks , issued this very wordy statement : “ Helen Thomas ’ comments were indefensible and the White House Correspondents Association board firmly dissociates itself from them .
Many in our profession who have known
Helen for years were saddened by the comments , which were especially unfortunate in light of her role as a trail blazer on the White House beat .
While Helen has not been a member of the WHCA for many years , her special status in the briefing room has helped solidify her as the dean of the White House press corps so we feel the need to speak out strongly on this matter .
“ We want to emphasize that the role of the WHCA is to represent the White House press corps in its dealings with the White House on coverage - related issues .
We do not police the speech of our members or colleagues .
We are not involved at all in issuing White House credentials , that is the purview of the White House itself .
But the incident does revive the issue of whether it is appropriate for an opinion columnist to have a front row seat in the WH briefing room .
That is an issue under the jurisdiction of this board .
We are actively seeking input from our association members on this important matter , and we have scheduled a special meeting of the WHCA board on Thursday to decide on the seating issue .
” What a gutless , feckless collective of cabestros .
Just a few days ago , no less than 60 journalists on board the Gaza - bound Freedom Flotilla were shot at , abused , beaten up , and robbed by the military representing the Zionist regime of Israel .
Was there one word of anger , one word of recrimination , or a statement released about the treatment of fellow journalists who were on board a series of ships which were attacked in international waters ?
Israeli soldiers destroyed and stole their cell phones , confiscating video footage and photographic equipment .
The later unauthorized use of journalists ’ footage shows the contempt that the Israeli authorities have for journalism .
By showing old photographs and edited footage there was a clear violation of journalistic ethics .
Such blatant attempts at control of news coverage are nothing new .
The same strategy was followed during Israel ’s last invasion of Gaza .
But what do these Washington scribes know ?
However , what they have proved by their swift action against Helen Thomas is that while Israel conducts a military occupation in Palestine , it is conducting a political occupation of the White House press corps .

From 60 Minutes Blowout : The Deepwater Horizon Disaster :
A Survivor Recalls His Harrowing Escape ; Plus , A Former BP Insider Warns Of Another Potential Disaster
The gusher unleashed in the Gulf of Mexico continues to spew crude oil .
There are no reliable estimates of how much oil is pouring into the gulf .
But it comes to many millions of gallons since the catastrophic blowout .
Eleven men were killed in the explosions that sank one of the most sophisticated drilling rigs in the world , the " Deepwater Horizon . "
This week Congress continues its investigation , but Capitol Hill has not heard from the man " 60 Minutes " correspondent Scott Pelley met : Mike Williams , one of the last crewmembers to escape the inferno .
[...]
Deepwater Horizon was in 5,000 feet of water and would drill another 13,000 feet , a total of three miles .
The oil and gas down there are under enormous pressure .
And the key to keeping that pressure under control is this fluid that drillers call " mud . "
" Mud " is a manmade drilling fluid that 's pumped down the well and back up the sides in continuous circulation .
The sheer weight of this fluid keeps the oil and gas down and the well under control .
The tension in every drilling operation is between doing things safely and doing them fast ; time is money and this job was costing BP a million dollars a day .
But Williams says there was trouble from the start - getting to the oil was taking too long .
Williams said they were told it would take 21 days ; according to him , it actually took six weeks .
With the schedule slipping , Williams says a BP manager ordered a faster pace .
" And he requested to the driller , ' Hey , let 's bump it up .
Let 's bump it up . '
And what he was talking about there is he 's bumping up the rate of penetration .
How fast the drill bit is going down , " Williams said .
Williams says going faster caused the bottom of the well to split open , swallowing tools and that drilling fluid called " mud . "
" We actually got stuck .
And we got stuck so bad we had to send tools down into the drill pipe and sever the pipe , " Williams explained .
That well was abandoned and Deepwater Horizon had to drill a new route to the oil .
It cost BP more than two weeks and millions of dollars .
" We were informed of this during one of the safety meetings , that somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 25 million was lost in bottom hole assembly and ' mud . '
And you always kind of knew that in the back of your mind when they start throwing these big numbers around that there was gonna be a push coming , you know ?
A push to pick up production and pick up the pace , " Williams said .
Asked if there was pressure on the crew after this happened , Williams told Pelley , " There 's always pressure , but yes , the pressure was increased . "
But the trouble was just beginning : when drilling resumed , Williams says there was an accident on the rig that has not been reported before .
He says , four weeks before the explosion , the rig 's most vital piece of safety equipment was damaged .

Warning :
The following video is ridiculously NSFW and NSFWS ( not safe for weak stomachs , as there are graphic surgery scenes ) .
But I 've posted it at the bottom so you can still absorb this magical info without getting canned .

Labiaplasty — not to be confused with vaginal rejuvenation or vaginoplasty — is an increasingly popular cosmetic procedure which typically involves trimming the labia majora or minora ( though usually minora ) to give your ladybits the look of a neat little package .
Unlike vaginal rejuvenation , it does nothing to tighten the vaginal canal , and unless you 're having a labiaplasty that involves the reduction of the clitorial hood , there are n't any sexual benefits to be had .
Except for feeling that much more sexy , because nothing is sexier than a childlike vag .
The superficial magic of labiaplasty was explored by the recently canceled Australian news show Hungry Beast ; the journalists posit that there 's connection between Australian decency laws regarding soft - core pornography magazines and the rise in women requesting the procedure ( though it should be noted that the surgery is on the upswing in both hemispheres ) .

According to the Classification Board , which has the pleasure of enforcing these matters , unrestricted softcore mags are allowed to show frontal nudity , but " only discreet genital detail . "
In their words , " There should be no genital emphasis . "
That 's pretty vague , and so softcore editors and publishers are playing it safe .
Says one former editor , " The only acceptable vagina as far as the Classification Board is concerned is one that is ' neat and tidy ' in their eyes .
They basically consider labia minora too offensive for soft porn . "
" Neat and tidy " — what the hell does that mean ?
There 's a huge variety in the natural appearance of labia , so the only way to play it safe is , as one softcore Photoshop pro puts it , to completely remove the labia from the photo .
The result is a wholly inaccurate depiction of the vulva and labia , wherein the entire package is airbrushed to a single crease .
That , apparently , is acceptable .

Confession :
When I watched this for the first time , after seeing multiple shots of acceptable labia , I paused the video and ran straight to my full - length mirror .
I 'd never really noticed how not " discreet " my ladyflower was !
I 've got all kinds of business down there !
I do n't look anything like those pictures !
Oh my god , is it ugly ?!
I went crazy for approximately 8 seconds , then shrugged and went back to watching .
If I had a moment of curiosity - cum - self - consciousness simply from watching a mini-doc on this matter , imagine the obvious effect this has on the women for whom these images are a part of their understanding of reality .
As one plastic surgeon puts it , " Most women do n't really have an idea of the normal range " of labia appearances , and this results in " people seek [ ing ] out to improve their little bits . "
And then we are helpfully shown the process of improvement , in which the doctor makes a quick snip , simply cutting off a completely normal part of a woman 's body .

While we 've recently argued that porn should not be blamed for the increasing plasticization of women , but we also can't completely discount the effects of porn when it comes to genital aesthetics .
And while this specific instance deals with sexual flesh , it 's no different than the the experience of being constantly exposed unrealistic imagery in magazines , impossible standards of beauty that we 'll never achieve , no matter how much of ourselves we cut away .

Again :
The following video is VERY NSFW and contains graphic images of surgery .

In 2000 , I had the opportunity to go through Leadership Orlando .
Of particular interest to me were the days in which traditional nonprofit issues were covered .
I ’ll confess much of the information was review for me – low graduation rates , high rates of students on free and reduced lunch programs , teen pregnancy .
As I started getting settled in for a day of review , I noticed that the business leaders around me were looking shocked .
Prior to that experience I had often gotten upset ( and somewhat angry I ’ll confess ) that business leaders in our community were n’t doing more about social issues .
As I learned that day , it was n’t that they did n’t care – they just did n’t know there was a problem .
Based on their new knowledge , a group from our class adopted a public school in a low - income area and collected school supplies and financial donations , volunteered in the classrooms , and put together a celebration for the families in the neighborhood .
Raising Awareness
In a difficult economic time , it ’s more important than ever to raise awareness and introduce more people to your cause .
The primary reason :
If people do n’t know about the need of the community and your organization , they wo n’t become involved ( or give ) .
As Dan Pallota said in the Harvard Business Review ( http://blogs.hbr.org/pallotta/2009/05/why-nonprofits-should-spend-mo.html), “ spending money to build demand for the great causes of our time is as central to those causes as direct service — maybe more central , as it is the only way nonprofits have any hope of reaching the scale of the problems they confront ” .
The traditional marketing funnel aims to move people from Awareness through Consideration and Preference to Action and Loyalty .
Nonprofit communication also aims for action and loyalty .
If someone is aware that there is a need , they can consider various ways to address that need ( whether through existing organizations or on their own ) .
They select their preference and then take action ( volunteering , donating or engaging in some other work ) .
Ideally , they will become advocates for the organization and increase their involvement ( perhaps by encouraging others to become involved with the organization or through a planned gift ) .
When marketing about a nonprofit organization there are two different messages that need to be communicated .
First , educate the community about the need ( to increase awareness ) .
If potential advocates do not know that there is a problem , they wo n’t become engaged in it .
Next , build credibility of the organization ( to increase the possibility of your organization being selected as the way to address the community need ) .
You ’ll want to make the case that your organization is the best one suited to address those challenges .
There are ways to invest in marketing and communications without spending a lot of money .
Creativity can go a long way in gaining attention from the media .
Katya Andresen shares in her blog about a nonprofit in Seattle that adopted a chicken ( trying to cross the road ) as a way to build awareness of the need to be a more ‘ walkable ’ community ( http://www.nonprofitmarketingblog.com/comments/help_i_have_no_marketing_budget/).
A Story of Two Nonprofits
I encourage you to visit the following two websites .
Both address issues related to water in third world countries .
Both are engaged in meaningful work .
A t the risk of oversimplifying their differences , one chose to invest heavily in public relations and development and the other did not .
In 2006 ( their first year of operation ) , Charity : Water ( www.charitywater.org) spent $ 105,234 ( or 30.3 % ) of their total budget on development and public relations .
Their second year they raised just over $ 1.6 million and spent 15 % on development and public relations .
It was an investment that paid off .
Their 2008 Annual Report shows that their total revenues were $ 6,642,022 .
Global Water ( http://globalwater.org/) is a similar organization that was founded in 1981 .
Their total revenue in 2008 ( per their IRS Form 990 ) was $ 56,943 .
A Note of Encouragement
We live in a very generous society and people want to support those causes they are engaged in and passionate about .
By raising awareness and inviting people to engage in the organization ( whether through giving , volunteering or advocating for your cause in another way ) , you will be one step closer to fulfilling your mission .
Too bad they wo n’t be calling it the “ Battle of the Teen Queens . "
THR reports that former 80s teen pop sensations Debbie Gibson and Tiffany have been cast opposite each other in a Syfy original movie .
" Mega Python vs. Gatoroid " will feature Gibson as a fanatical animal - rights activist who frees illegally imported exotic snakes from pet stores and releases them into the Everglades - where they then morph into super - sized menaces - while Tiffany will portray an over - enthusiastic park ranger out to save endangered alligators .
The pair , who used to battle it out on the charts , have starred in Syfy productions before , but this film marks the first time they will appear together .
This article gives the best overview of the issues surrounding corporate personhood I have seen .
In 2009 , Riki Ott was on the road for 252 days educating people about the dangers of “ corporate personhood . ”
That ’s the legal doctrine that says corporations have constitutional rights , just like human beings .
She mostly spoke in academic settings , and there was some interest in the idea , says Ott , but not much .
All that changed on January 21 , 2010 , when the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission .
Now interest has skyrocketed , and Ott finds people eager to volunteer , to organize , to meet , to do anything to reverse the Court ’s decision .
Rallying Around Citizens United
Supreme Court cases are usually interesting to lawyers , scholars , and those directly affected .
Occasionally , a decision makes the news for a few days before disappearing from the public eye .
But sometimes there ’s a game changer - a decision that is so clearly wrong that it becomes a rallying point .
David Cobb , former Green Party presidential candidate and longtime activist on corporate personhood , points to Dred Scott v. Sandford as one such decision .
Citizens United , Cobb says , is shaping up as another .
The two cases are mirror images of error .
In 1857 , the Dred Scott decision said that a flesh - and - blood human being had no constitutional rights because he was black .
On January 21 , 2010 , the Court , in a 5 - 4 decision , used Citizens United to declare that corporations - legal entities with no human attributes - have the same constitutional free - speech rights that humans have .
Dred Scott was the most notorious Supreme Court decision of its time .
It was not a groundbreaking case - it simply took existing law to its logical conclusion .
But it so clearly violated both logic and human decency that it forced people to look at what slavery really meant .
Rather than legitimizing the status quo , as it was intended to do , the decision galvanized the growing abolitionist movement , and set the stage for the end of slavery .
But it took the 14th Amendment to overturn Dred Scott .
Citizens United also takes existing law to its logical conclusion .
And , like Dred Scott , it is generating tremendous discussion and debate - this time about corporate power and about what role , if any , corporations should play in the political process .
An ABC News / Washington Post poll taken February 4 - 8 , 2010 , found that 80 percent of Americans oppose the Court ’s ruling , including 65 percent who “ strongly ” oppose it .
Opposition cuts across the political spectrum : 85 percent of Democrats oppose the ruling , as do 81 percent of Independents , and 76 percent of Republicans .
Within days of the Citizens United decision , groups formed to undo the Court ’s damage .
They are pursuing remedies ranging from local ordinances to federal legislation to a constitutional amendment .
Why Should We Care
Citizens United says that corporations can spend unlimited amounts of money on political advertising .
The Court declared more than 30 years ago that spending money is a form of speech , and that corporations had a First Amendment right to speak that way .
But there were still limits , particularly in the area of political speech , where there is a century - old tradition of controlling the influence of corporations on the electoral process .
Citizens United takes away those limits .
According to the Court , if human beings are allowed an unrestricted right to free speech , then corporations must have the same right .
The Court overturned a key provision of the McCain - Feingold campaign - finance reform law that prohibited corporate - and union - funded campaign advertising within 90 days of a federal election .
Now , corporations can spend unlimited money influencing our elections right up to Election Day .
More than $ 5 billion was spent on the 2008 campaigns with the McCain - Feingold law in place .
If that seems like a lot of money , wait for the next election cycle .
Citizens United was a case about a corporation spending money to advertise and air a movie that amounted to a hit piece on Hilary Clinton .
There are now no limits on the funding of that sort of negative campaign material .
Any candidate who does n’t toe the corporate line can look forward to a flood of opposition cash .
The Humanity of Corporations
Just as Dred Scott was only an extension of existing law , Citizens United merely extends law that has been developing for a long time .
But , like Dred Scott , the Court ’s conclusion makes clear to most people that the law is wrong .
To say that a corporation with billions to spend on advertising is no different from a human being with one voice and one vote goes beyond what a large majority of Americans are willing to accept .
But this is the logical conclusion of the doctrine of corporate personhood , a legal theory that has been developing since the 1800s .
Until 1819 the law was clear that corporations had no constitutional rights .
In that year , the Court held for the first time that the Constitution applied to corporations .
The key moment was the 1886 case , Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific , an unremarkable case about taxes on railroad property .
One of the railroad ’s arguments was that the tax they were challenging violated the then - relatively new 14th Amendment to the Constitution - the Amendment that specifically overruled Dred Scott .
The railroad claimed that it had been deprived of “ equal protection under the law , ” which is one of the guarantees of the 14th Amendment .
The problem with the argument was that the Amendment said , “ No state shall … deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . ”
There is nothing in the language of the Amendment that makes it apply to anyone but humans - it uses the words “ person ” and “ citizen . ”
The railroad ’s argument was that , since a corporation was a legal entity , it was rather like a person and , thus , should enjoy the rights granted by the 14th Amendment .
The Court made no official decision on that issue , and it is discussed nowhere in the Court ’s opinion .
But in the headnotes ( an unofficial summary of the case , not written by a judge ) , the court reporter , a former president of a small railroad line , quoted the Chief Justice as saying that the Court did not want to hear arguments on whether the 14th Amendment applied to railroads because “ we are all of the opinion that it does . ”
A lawyer who based an argument on a headnote would be laughed out of court .
Yet the headnote in Santa Clara has been treated ever since as a statement of the law .
From that crack in the door , the Constitution has been broken open to gradually provide corporations more of the rights granted to humans .
We have gone from a Constitution that nowhere mentions corporations , let alone grants them rights , to Citizens United , which says that the Constitution cannot tell the difference between General Motors and a member of the general public .
Corporations are now a sort of super - being :
They can live forever , they cannot be jailed , they have no conscience - yet they also enjoy virtually all the rights that humans have .
“ [ T ]he Court ’s opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people , who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self - government since the founding , and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt .
It is a strange time to repudiate that common sense . ”
But for the style , those words might have come from one of the activists working to abolish corporate personhood .
They are actually the words of Justice John Paul Stevens , speaking for the four dissenters in Citizens United .
A Turning Point
Eighty percent of Americans agree with Justice Stevens , and they ’re ready to demand a return to common sense .
The Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund ( CELDF ) , founded by Thomas Linzey in 1995 , has long championed abolishing corporate personhood .
Citizens United “ opens peoples ’ eyes , ” says Mari Margil , CELDF ’s associate director .
“ Very often we walk into communities and they ’ve never heard of corporate constitutional rights , or they think it ’s an academic concept that ’s not important for their lives .
So we have to show through stories , through examples , through breaking down how our structure of law came to be and how it works , ” says Margil .
“ Now Citizens United allows us to speed that process up a bit . ”
Riki Ott and David Cobb are working under the banner of Move to Amend , a coalition that launched its Web site the day the Citizens United decision came down .
In less than three months , says Cobb , without coverage in a single mass media outlet , more than 77,000 people have signed the group ’s online petition for a constitutional amendment to reject the Citizens United ruling .
Move to Amend now counts among its growing steering committee and key partners more than 20 progressive organizations , including Black Agenda Report , the National Lawyers Guild , Velvet Revolution , and the Women ’s International League for Peace and Freedom .
A partnership of Voter Action , Public Citizen , the Center for Corporate Policy , and the American Independent Business Alliance launched Free Speech for People ( FSFP ) , also on the day of the decision , and also seeking a constitutional amendment .
They worked with Rep. Donna Edwards ( D - Md. ) on the amendment she has introduced in the House , which restores the right of Congress and the states to regulate corporate spending .
They have collected about 50,000 signatures on their petition .
John Bonifaz , legal director of Voter Action , has participated in FSFP presentations .
“ It ’s pretty clear that the public is ahead of Washington , ” Bonifaz says .
“ Washington , D.C. is looking at relatively modest reforms .
The people around the country are very clear on the idea that corporations are n’t people .
They believe the Citizens United ruling is a threat to our democracy and to the First Amendment . ” … [ emphasis added ]
The Communications Minister , Stephen Conroy , has attacked the social networking site Facebook and its former college student founder for what he says is its '' complete disregard ' ' for privacy .
Senator Conroy is under fire from many in the internet industry for his proposed mandatory net filter .
He has previously attacked Google , a key critic of the filtering plan , but last night in a Senate estimates hearing turned his attention to Facebook .
'' Facebook has also shown a complete disregard for users ' privacy lately , '' Senator Conroy said in response to a question from a government senator .
'' Facebook , I understand … was developed by Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg , who after breaking up with his girlfriend developed a website of all the photos from his yearbook so he and his mates could rank the girls according to their looks .
An auspicious start for Facebook . ''
Alan
Wake ends with a single line and , while we wo n't ruin it for you , it raises a few more questions than it answers .
This is n't a Lost - type situation — the ending was satisfying — but you 're left asking yourself what just happened and who was in control of the experience you just had .
It is an amazing ending because it gives the player credit , asking him or her to put some thought into what was just shown .
There is a certain power in leaving things up to the player 's imagination .
During my time with the under - appreciated Metro 2033 , I played the game in the original Russian , where not every bit of dialog was given a subtitle .
The level of verisimilitude and atmosphere this gave the game was wonderful , however , and the language brought home the very foreign nature of the place to my American ears .
I felt like a visitor in a strange , desperate land , and once again the ending of the game drove home the point that my drastic actions were in response to events that I did n't completely understand .
What was going on in Metro 2033 ?
No , seriously .
I 'd like to know !
Another game that successfully used the art of withholding information from the player was Shadow of the Colossus .
You 're given something of an idea about what 's going on , but the death of each colossus seems to be tragic , not something to be celebrated .
The land your character travels is desolate , and the ending leaves the door open to talk not only about what comes next , but what happened before .
Would the game have earned its cult status with a more conventional story ?
It 's possible : the gameplay really is enjoyable , but part of the allure of the title is the exploration of that magical land , along with the sense of isolation and wonder the game gives you .
The trick is to give players enough hints and emotional cues that they have a good idea of what 's going on , and then take away enough of the detail that their imagination fills in the holes .
Done correctly , it can make a good game great .
WELCOME TO IMPOSSIBLE BOTTLE
A few words of explanation for those of you who are curious , or just plain confused ...
An impossible bottle is a bottle containing an object which clearly does not fit through the bottle 's mouth .
​
The most common type of impossible bottle is a ship in a bottle , but have you ever seen a deck of cards in a bottle ?
Or a padlock in a bottle ?
Or a solid steel bolt in a bottle ?

For over ten years I have been creating and sending original handmade Impossible Bottles all over the world .
Thank you for visiting .
I hope you find some wonder and insipration here , and I invite you to view my FAQ page if you would like to find out more .
An Intro to the Size of Nations
As you might have guessed from the name of this blog , we want to see more nations .
There are serious benefits to having more and smaller states : the efficiency coming from jurisdictional competition , the robustness coming from decentralization , and the satisfaction coming from choice are all , frankly , awesome .
In his keynote at the 2009 Seasteading conference , video below , Peter Thiel asks how many countries there will be in the year 2050 .
There are just under 200 independent states now ; significantly more than at the end of the second world war .
It would be a strange coincidence indeed if that number happened to remain roughly the same .
We therefore need to think about two possible futures : a world with many more nations ( let ’s say a thousand ) , or many fewer ( let ’s say one ) .
We want the first outcome ; others want the second .
While the size of nations is normally taken as an uninteresting brute fact by political economists , there have been some notable attempts to explain what causes a country to be a particular size and what size a country should be .
In his 1977 paper A Theory of the Size and Shape of Nations , David Friedman uses the tools of economic theory to lay out the conditions which determine the size of nations .
He is concerned purely with how big nations will be , not how big they should be .
He models states as profit - maximizing leviathans in military competition with one another for territory .
A government aims as maximizing its tax yield net of collection costs .
Generally speaking , states will want to take over as much land as possible in order to achieve this goal .
They are , however , constrained by other states seeking to do likewise .
What happens when two government want the same piece of land ?
One answer is that the state with the most military power always prevails .
That ’s not a good answer , however .
Rather , we need to think about the price each country is willing to pay for the territory in terms of military and / or diplomatic effort .
Just as markets provide goods to those with the willingness , not simply the ability , to pay , disputes over land are decided primarily by who wants it the most .
Given the assumption that each state aims to maximize its total net tax yield , it ’s the complementarities among regions in terms of tax collection we need to consider : the state whose other land will best combine with a disputed territory in order to increase total tax take will be willing to pay the most and will prevail .
This means that national borders will be arranged in a way which maximizes taxes minus collection costs .
What factors maximize the total net tax yield ?
If a state can tax trade , it will be in its interest to encompass an entire trading area .
If a state can tax labor , it will be in its interest to increase the barriers to exit .
Large and culturally homogeneous countries increase exit costs by increasing the physical and cultural distance of neighboring jurisdictions .
Friedman shows that the size and shape of past and existing nations tends to support his theory .
If you think that sounds like a bad thing from an individual welfare point of view , you ’d probably be right .
In their book The Size of Nations , Alberto Alesina and Enrico Spolaore take a different approach to thinking about how big countries will be , and also consider how big they should be .
When considering how big countries ought to be , they compare the costs of large countries with those of small countries ; the country size which minimizes the sum of these costs is considered optimal .
The main cost of big countries comes from preference heterogeneity .
As a single state encompasses a larger population , we ’re likely to see more diversity in what people want government to do .
Since government imposes one solution upon everyone , a larger country is going to make its citizens less happy with government on average .
If this were the only issue , we ’d want roughly six billion countries each having one citizen ( which sounds alright to me ) .
That way , we ’d have no preference heterogeneity within countries .
A central simplifying assumption of the model is that physical distance from the center of a country matches up with ideological distance : geographically peripheral regions diverge most strongly in terms of their preferences over government policy .
There are , of course , costs of small countries too .
First , Alesina and Spolaore suggest , there are economies of scale in the production of government services .
As the size of a country increases , the fixed costs of government are shared among more people and the cost per head decreases .
Secondly , a bigger country implies a bigger market .
Wealth is generated by specialization and the division of labor which , as Adam Smith pointed out , is limited by the extent of the market .
This means that being able to trade over a larger area makes people better off .
Of course , living under different governments should n’t stop two people from making a voluntary trade , but borders do increase costs .
Most obviously and annoyingly , governments like to restrict trade across borders by means of tariffs , subsidies , and quotas .
They best idea is to get rid of protectionist policies , but given they exist there ’s a second - best case for having geographically larger states .
There is also a more inevitable cost of transacting across borders .
Since different jurisdictions have different rules ( a wonderful thing in general ! ) , striking a deal across a border is more complicated .
There are many mundane examples : certification or labelling requirements for products frequently vary by country , meaning that a product sold in one country will often be illegal in another .
Getting the right certification and including the right information on the label is costly , and will tend to reduce cross - border trade .
Another issue is the settling of disputes .
Living in different jurisdictions under different rules increases transaction costs .
With negotiation , they can agree to rules which suit the situation , but the fact that businesses within a country are generally optimized to local law makes cross - border trade costly .
When it comes to how big countries will be , Alesina and Spolaore ’s argument depends on the system of government in question .
In a dictatorship , their way of modelling the problem is similar to David Friedman’s .
In a democracy , they assume that majorities can vote to split up an existing country .
When the costs of preference heterogeneity exceed the benefits of economies of scale for a majority of voters , a country will fracture .
Alesina and Spolaore see the incentives of democracy leading to countries which are too small .
In his review of the book , though , David Friedman shows that this result is entirely dependent on arbitrary assumptions : we could get the opposite result with equally reasonable assumptions .
The work of these economists provide a useful framework in thinking about the size of nations .
We ’ll attempt to move beyond this static approach , though , and consider what happens when we consider a dynamic market for governance .
May 4 , 2010
In the run-up to Britain�s general election we�ve heard next to nothing about Middle East policy from the three main party leaders in their much - publicised debates on TV .
They have studiously avoided all mention of the outrage in the Holy Land and the way it impacts so directly on world peace .
The plight of the Palestinian people ever since Britain abandoned its mandate responsibility , and their endless struggle for freedom from Israel 's military occupation , threatens our safety but word of it never passes their lips .
And the programme bosses appear to block questions on the subject .
Early in the campaign I received a message from a local Liberal Democrat MP saying : " I urge everyone to get to Norwich and help elect our fantastic candidate Simon W. "
But hang on ... before rushing to volunteer I wanted to know just one thing .
What was Mr W's personal stance on Middle East policy and especially Israel 's 43 - year illegal occupation of the Holy Land ?
It 's an important question for the simple reason that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) has such a vice - like grip on the private parts of US congressional representatives that Israel�s interests are put ahead of America's .
And due to the influence of the Israel lobby here in the UK we too are so embroiled in their perpetual strife with the Islamic world that we�ve been sucked into the same stinking swamp .
Britain is now one of the most hated nations on earth thanks to our cosy association with US - Israeli ambitions in the Middle East .
Party leaders talk passionately about cleaning up politics but carefully avoid addressing this , the most corrupting and dangerous influence of all .
A recent Channel 4 Dispatches programme alleged that 80 % of Conservative MPs and MEPs are signed - up Friends of Israel .
The Conservative shadow Foreign Minister , David Lidington , has promised that Conservatives will be staunch defenders of the State of Israel .
The Liberal Democrats allow a similar lobby group to flourish within their party .
Its main aim is to " maximise support for the State of Israel within the Liberal Democrats and Parliament " .
And I note that when the MP who contacted me visited Israel and the occupied West Bank he went with a Friends of Israel delegation .
I emailed the candidate Simon W twice with my question but he didn�t reply .
Needless to say , he got no help from me .
All our political parties , strangely , have little to say in their manifestos about action ( rather than meaningless words ) to end the ethnic cleansing and blockading of the Holy Land and the terrorising of its residents , including the Christian communities .
I have seen not so much as a hint of sanctions like those they are eager to apply against Iran for much less reason .
It has been reported that powerful Christian businessmen are now bankrolling the Conservatives .
This is the party that backed the Iraq war , has a majority of Israel flag - wavers among its MPs and whose leader , David Cameron , is a self - proclaimed Zionist .
Cameron says : " If I become Prime Minister , Israel has a friend who will never turn his back on her� Israel is a democracy �
Hamas want to create a theocracy .
Israel strives to protect innocent life � Hamas target innocent life � "
Side - splitting stuff .
But what �s truly scary is that if the Conservatives get elected it 'll be business as usual � full steam ahead - with the loons and psychopaths in Washington and Tel Aviv .
The party also has the support of a Christian organization , the Conservative Christian Fellowship , which claims to include in its ranks a large number of election candidates .
The group says it " contributes to the life and thinking of the Conservative Party " .
When its chairman David Burrowes visited the Holy Land the trip was paid for by Conservative Friends of Israel and the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs , and judging from his remarks in Parliament it is clear that his sympathies lie with the lawless entity that blitzed , vaporised and shredded the jam - packed citizens of Gaza and a year later still has them on the torture rack , allowing a paltry 81 items only to be imported for the starving and homeless among the tiny enclave�s ruins .
The huge range of forbidden goods includes jam , chocolate , wood for furniture , fruit juice , tinned fruit , textiles , and plastic toys .
Israel , with typical bloody - mindedness , has made life for humanitarian groups exceedingly difficult by refusing to actually publish a list of banned items .
They make it up as they go along to create a permanent state of confusion and deprivation .
Is this the sort of thing real Christians endorse and defend ?
I don�t thinks so .
Christian Conservatives are put to shame by the Israeli human rights group Gisha , who have been trying for more than a year to squeeze information from the Zionist regime about what exactly they allow and forbid to cross into Gaza , and why .
Gisha has even taken the Israeli authorities to court to force them to come clean .
Gisha 's director , Sari Bashi , says : " Preventing children from receiving toys , preventing manufacturers from getting raw materials - I do n't see how that 's responsive to Israeli security needs . "
The Israelis explain their rationale thus : " The limitation on the transfer of goods is a central pillar in the means at the disposal of the State of Israel in the armed conflict between it and Hamas . "
You and I know it as collective punishment .
They take their spite for Hamas out on women and kids .
Nice " friends " you have there , CCF .
You realize , of course , that the thugs who run the Israeli regime are persecuting your Christian brethren as well as the Muslims .
Or maybe they don�t count because Palestinian Christians are some sort of lesser breed ?
Now the final straw .
We�ve arrived at the point where we can�t even take the piss out of Israel 's illegal occupation on the airwaves .
Comedian Frankie Boyle was rebuked for doing just that by the BBC governors .
He explains in an open letter :
In case you missed it , the jokes in question are :
I 've been studying Israeli Army Martial Arts .
I now know 16 ways to kick a Palestinian woman in the back .
People think that the Middle East is very complex but I have an analogy that sums it up quite well .
If you imagine that Palestine is a big cake , well ... that cake is being punched to pieces by a very angry Jew .
I think the problem here is that the show 's producers will have thought that Israel , an aggressive , terrorist state with a nuclear arsenal was an appropriate target for satire .
The Trust 's ruling is essentially a note from their line managers .
It says that if you imagine that a state busily going about the destruction of an entire people is fair game , you are mistaken .
Israel is out of bounds .
So there you have it .
Party managers , political leaders , election candidates , the mainstream media , the rest of the Establishment including our state broadcaster and even the Church and its assorted hangers - on , are all working to suppress any debate about what�s probably the biggest menace to world peace� and praying that most British people go to the polls on May 6 blissfully ignorant of their country�s complicity .

16 - year - old Jessica Watson is the youngest sailor who voyaged around the globe without any assistance .
Jessica Watson ’s journey on her pink boat lasted 210 days , during this time she traveled 23000 nautical miles .
She left Sydney on Oct. 18 , 2009 , crossed the Pacific Ocean , then the equator , she rounded the Cape Horn ( the most southerly point of South America ) , swam across the Atlantic Ocean to South Africa and then swam across the Indian Ocean and along the southern coast of Australia .
Earlier , the youngest participant of around the world was considered a 17 - year - old Briton Mike Perham .
Meanwhile , the record in a single nonstop solo circumnavigation belonged to Australian Jesse Martin , who made the voyage at the age of 18 in 1999 .
The Watson ’s voyage , however , will not be recognized officially as a record in any case in order to discourage ambitious parents pushing younger children off to sea .

Mystery surrounds Australia 's final 23 - man squad for the World Cup after coach Pim Verbeek held back making any public announcement about which players he is cutting from his line - up .
The deadline for the final squad lists to be submitted to Fifa has now passed , with Australia the only nation still outstanding .
It remains unclear whether Verbeek did submit his final list to Fifa before the deadline , and is talking to the players cut before making the news public , or whether he is waiting for medical reports on any injuries arising from their 1 - 0 friendly win over Denmark before finalising his squad .
With Eugene Galekovic , Tommy Oar and James Holland already told they will not be in South Africa , Verbeek has to cut two more players .
The other nations in Group D have all confirmed their 23 - man squads .
Yang Guihua , mother of the team leader who orchestrated the escape , insisted that his son continue rehabilitation treatment at the centre .
" I do n't think there is any problem with the training methods at the center .
They are for my child 's own good , " she told the " Global Times " .
Oil giant blames thieves and militants for the spilling of nearly 14,000 tonnes of crude oil into the Niger Delta last year
Royal Dutch
Shell plc spilled nearly 14,000 tons of crude oil into the creeks of the Niger Delta last year , the company has announced , blaming thieves and militants for the environmental damage .
The amount of oil spilled by Shell 's Nigerian subsidiary was more than double the amount poured into the delta in 2008 , and quadruple what was spilled in 2007 – highlighting the worsening situation the oil company faces in Nigeria .
Shell faces regular attacks by militants who have targeted pipelines , kidnapped petroleum company workers and fought government troops since 2006 .
Its chief executive officer has even hinted that the company can no longer depend on Nigeria as a profit - maker , despite its 50 - year history in the country .
The majority of the total , according to the company , was lost through two incidents – one in which thieves damaged a wellhead at its Odidi field , and another where militants bombed the Trans Escravos pipeline .
In all , some 13,900 tonnes spilled into the swamps , but Shell said it was able to recover nearly 10,000 tonnes of that .
In its annual environment report , released yesterday , Shell also quadrupled its original estimate of oil spilled during normal operations in 2008 to 8,800 tonnes , blaming an explosion in November of that year at its Iriama field for the increase .
The government is aware of the spills , and Shell has properly taken care of the damage and remains " involved in serious clean - up exercises " , said Levi Ajonuma , a spokesman for the state - run Nigerian National Petroleum Corp .
Responding to the spills remains difficult , however , as Shell 's workers are increasingly seen by criminal gangs as lucrative kidnap targets .
The company reported that 51 of its employees and contractors were kidnapped for ransom in 2009 , compared with 11 in 2008 .
" Nigeria , especially the Niger Delta , remains a very challenging place in which to operate , " Peter Voser , the Shell CEO , said in the report .
" Security issues and sabotage are constant threats to our people , assets and the environment .
But we are cautiously optimistic that conditions there are improving . "
Still , Voser has said Shell can no longer depend on growing profits coming from Nigeria , a country of 150 million people that sees nearly all of its government operations funded by oil money .
That money funnels down into massive federal and state budgets that remain open to manipulation in a country consistently ranked as one of the most corrupt in the world .
Shell discovered the first oil play in the Niger Delta in 1956 and started pumping crude out of the swamps two years later .
It has since been the dominant oil company in the former British protectorate – and has been criticised both by environmentalists and by community activists who want more of Nigeria 's oil wealth to flow back into the poverty - stricken delta .
The delta itself , some 51,800 sq km ( 20,000 square miles ) of wetlands in southern Nigeria , is home to about 150 species of fish and other wildlife that remain endangered by spills .
Shell also was accused in a US lawsuit of playing a role in the 1995 executions of activist Ken Saro - Wiwa and other civilians by Nigeria 's former military regime .
Shell reached a $ 15.5 m settlement to end the lawsuit in June , but acknowledged no wrongdoing .
Since Saro - Wiwa 's execution and Nigeria 's return to democracy in 1999 , the company has tried to burnish its image in the country .
The environmental reports , started in 1997 , are part of that effort .
Kick - Ass rushes inside to see if he can save anyone but everyone inside is dead , horribly cut and burned .
Red Mist grabs a teddy bear from the wall and runs out of the building with Kick - Ass as it explodes .
The two part ways and Kick - Ass resolves to give up crime fighting .
He goes to Katie 's house with the intention of revealing his identity .
On Saturday , June 19 , it is the 50th Anniversary of the Mt. Washington Road Race .
This is a 7.6 mile run up the mountain , at an average grade of 12 percent , which Northeast Delta Dental sponsors .
We call this the “ Only Hill ” and this year it ’s the U.S. Mountain National Championship as well ; elite runners across the country will be with us ( total number of runners is around 1,000 ) .
I am running it this year , and looking forward to the process and challenge !
It may be as challenging as interpreting Health Care Reform legislation , but I am looking forward to it !

Determining brain death is a complex process that requires dozens of tests to make sure doctors come to the correct conclusion .
With that goal in mind , the American Academy of Neurology has issued new guidelines — an update of guidelines first written 15 years ago — that call on doctors to conduct a lengthy examination , including following a step - by - step checklist of some 25 tests and criteria that must be met before a person can be considered brain dead .
The goal of the guidelines is to remove some of the guess work and variability among doctors in their procedure for declaring brain death , which previous research has found to be a problem , said guidelines co-author Dr. Panayiotis Varelas , director of the Neuro - Intensive Care Service at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit .
According to the U.S. Uniform Determination of Death Act , brain death occurs when a person permanently stops breathing , the heart stops beating and " all functions of the entire brain , including the brain stem " cease .
While no one disagreed with that description , a 2008 study that included 41 of the nation 's top hospitals found widespread and worrisome variability in how doctors and hospitals were determining who met the criteria , said Varelas , co-author of the 2008 review .
For example , low body temperature , or hypothermia , can cause a person to have the appearance of brain death , so bodies have to be warmed before a determination can be made , Varelas said .
But hospitals in the 2008 study had 11 different " target temperatures " that varied by several degrees , and there was no consensus about what temperature was optimal to get the best diagnosis , he said .
HYPOTHERMIA : Medicine 's cool comeback from cardiac arrest
Those types of details have been worked out in the updated guidelines , which are published in the June 8 issue of Neurology .
" Even the best hospitals in the United States had such a tremendous variability in their policies , " said Varelas .
" You die either because your heart or lungs stop working , or because you become brain dead .
The former two are easy to determine .
If there is no pulse , you die .
If there is no breathing , you die .
But becoming brain dead is much more complex . "
FAITH & REASON : How do you want to die ?
The new guidelines were developed based on a review of all of the studies on brain death published between 1995 and 2009 .
According to the guidelines , there are three major signs of brain death : coma with a known cause ; absence of brain stem reflexes ; and breathing has permanently stopped .
Periodically , news reports will talk about a patient in a long - term coma who miraculously woke up , or someone in a persistent vegetative state who seems to have an inner life , Varelas said .
One of the best known examples was the Terri Schiavo case in Florida , which pitted the woman 's parents against her husband .
The 41 - year - old Schiavo died in 2005 , two weeks after the removal of a feeding tube that had kept her alive for more than a decade .
But brain death should not be confused with other conditions , such as persistent vegetative or minimally conscious state , in which there is still some limited brain activity .
" We found no credible report of anyone who was brain dead and who woke up and survived , " Varelas said .
The new guidelines , he added , have nothing to do with those high - profile cases .
Brain death can result from a severe traumatic brain injury , stroke or lack of oxygen after cardiac arrest .
About 90 % of organ donations come from people who have been declared brain dead , Varelas said .
Dr. James Bernat , a professor of neurology and medicine at Dartmouth Medical School , said the new guidelines will help to remove some of the variability in how doctors determine brain death .
" The 2008 study disclosed rather surprising and disturbing variations in determining brain death , and in some cases there were practices that were just plain wrong , " Bernat said .
The main risk is that a patient will be declared brain dead who really is n't , Bernat said .
" The authors of this ( new ) study are experts in their field and have done an evidence - based , authoritative review , " Bernat said .
" They are saying , ' This is the way it ought to be done . '
The goal is to improve the uniformity and the quality of neurological practice . "

Turkish authorities are accusing Israel of " ordering " a terror attack carried out by Kurdish rebels on the same day the Israeli Navy raided a Turkish - owned Gaza - bound ship last week in revenge for Ankara 's involvement in the incident , Turkish newspaper Zaman reported Sunday .
Seven Turkish soldiers were killed in Monday 's attack , which took place at a Turkish navy base in the southern city of Iskenderun .
It occurred several hours after the Israel Defense Forces ' raid on the Marmara vessel left nine activists killed .
Bloody Waters IDF troops shown bleeding in Turkish press Ynet Hurriyet newspaper publishes photos of Israeli Commando soldiers bruised , bleeding after being beaten by activists aboard Gaza - bound Marmara aid vessel .
Report says army erased photos , but they were reproduced .
IDF : Images prove ship was carrying mercenaries IDF troops shown bleeding in Turkish press
Head of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Ankara told the newspaper that several Israeli organizations were suspected of cooperating with the Kurdish rebels ' Iranian arm .
He said that " the fear of a connection between the two organization is much deeper than any conspiracy theory , " claiming that " a number of former Mossad officials and Israeli army officers trained the Kurdish organization fighters in north Iraq . "
The man added that another sign increasing the suspicion of Israeli involvement was that on the day of the deadly Navy raid , the rebels suddenly announced that they were ending the ceasefire with Turkey .
" The same terrorists were trained by Israeli intelligence officers and trained to infiltrate the cities in the best way possible .
The Israeli government is trying to present the Turkish leadership as radical and close to Hamas in order to influence the global public opinion .
The Kurdish rebels are Israel 's sub-contractors . "
The newspaper added that Turkish Interior Minister Bashir Atalay said during a press conference after the attack that his people were " working hard to find out what happened at the military base " – a statement which , according to the newspaper , implied that Israel may have been involved .

A likely worker shortage sparked by retiring baby - boomers has lit a fire under Des Moines ’s civic leaders .
The city is working to lure back young Iowans and attracting global talent by developing its downtown and promoting the jobs available in the many industries that flourish there .
Other big draws : low - cost housing , plus the city ’s long - touted reputation for family - friendliness and a “ 19 - minute commute . ”

Pioneer Hi-Bred International , a top agricultural - seed company , plans to invest $ 154 million on an expansion that will create 400 jobs over the next three years , including well - paying positions in scientific research .
In the past two years , Pioneer has added nearly 500 jobs in central Iowa , where it now employs nearly 2,400 workers .
“ We use Des Moines as a global hub for agriculture biotechnology , ” says Bill Niebur , an executive who has overseen crop genetics research and development at Pioneer , which is owned by DuPont .
Niebur thinks the tide has turned in attracting talent to Des Moines “ It used to be that you ’d go off and spend your twenties and thirties somewhere else and then come back with your children , ” he says .
Now , when Pioneer recruits recent college graduates for Des Moines biotech jobs , “ we do n’t feel we ’re at a disadvantage . ”
Only 5 days ago the brilliant team behind the android - wifi - tether project , which provides free WiFi hotspot capabilities to rooted phones , added support for EVO 4G .
This meant users of this recently released beast could now turn their phones into WiFi routers , broadcasting WiFi signal to devices nearby , thus removing the need for a similar application Sprint charges $ 30 / month for .
Well , there were a couple of limitations :
The android - wifi - tether hotspot ran in ad - hoc mode , which meant devices that did n't support ad - hoc mode could n't use or even see it .
This included other Android phones , some game consoles ( like the Wii ) , and other devices .
, which meant devices that did n't support ad - hoc mode could n't use or even see it .
This included other Android phones , some game consoles ( like the Wii ) , and other devices .
Another limitation was lack of support for WPA / WPA2 , which offer a much stronger security than WEP .
WEP is weak and easily breakable ; though combined with whitelist support , it was still relatively secure .
Good news everyone !
Following the discovery of a secondary firmware file within the EVO 's directory structure and undocumented driver calls in the source , the team working on the android - wifi - tether project have fully implemented infrastructure mode on the Sprint EVO 4G , allowing users the same experience as if they were using the bundled Sprint Hotspot application , but without the $ 30 monthly fee .
By fully supporting infrastructure mode vs the previous ad - hoc only mode , you will now be able to enjoy the full wireless hotspot experience , including support for WPA2 encryption , compatibility with a larger set of devices , and easier configuration on the client device .
This application adds yet another bullet point to the long list of reasons to root your Android device .
In combination with the unrEVOked one - click root you can go from a phone fresh out of the box to free , feature - full wireless hotspot capability in under 5 minutes .
For now , only the EVO 4G supports the newly added WPA2 and infrastructure mode , while the rest of the Android phone lineup will default to the previous ad - hoc+WEP mode .
Next on the feature list will be full support for the newly rooted HTC Incredible , and possibly other phones .
Comparison To Sprint's $ 30 WiFi Hotspot
Now that WPA2 and infrastructure mode have been added , the $ 30 / month Sprint WiFi Hotspot application offers almost no benefits .
The only feature still not present in the Android WiFi Tether app for root users is automatic hotspot shutdown after a period of inactivity , which could provide considerable battery savings for the forgetful ones .
There is already a ticket to add this support , so hopefully it will get implemented one day .
Also untested are both apps ' effects on battery life , but because they use the same firmware , I am thinking they should be quite comparable ( I would definitely have a charger ready in either case ) .
Download
Download Android WiFi Tether version 2.0.5 - pre1 or above from the download page in order to get the functionality described above and report back with your success story .

Here are the screenshots showing the new WPA2 security on the EVO 4G :

Image caption Mr Harvey said the prime minister was ' expressing a hope '
Armed forces minister Nick Harvey has insisted that the prime minister has not set a timetable for the withdrawal of British forces from Afghanistan .
On Friday , David Cameron said he wanted to see troops leave by 2015 , speaking ahead of talks with President Obama .
But Mr Harvey said it would only happen once the country was stable enough not to " slip back into being a haven for international terrorism " .
Downing Street said both men took the same view on Afghanistan .
Mr Harvey , one of the Liberal Democrat ministers in the coalition government , said the prime minister was reiterating what he hoped could be achieved .
' Expressing a hope '
Speaking at the G8 summit in Canada , Mr Cameron said he wanted to see troops home by the time of the next general election , due in 2015 , " make no mistake about it " .
However , ahead of talks with US President Barack Obama on Saturday , Mr Cameron told Sky News he preferred not to " deal in too strict timetables " .
Some 307 UK forces personnel have died since the Afghan mission began in 2001 .
Mr Harvey said Mr Cameron had been " expressing a hope " by making the comments .
" He 's not committing to a firm timeline .
It 's actually exactly the same forecast that I was making during the course of the election .
And I think it 's just putting into the public mind a sense of an overall time frame but it's not committing a particular calendar date for coming out , " he said .
We do not want foreign soldiers , foreign troops in Afghanistan for one day longer than is necessary Sir Jock Stirrup , Head of the Armed Forces
" It will depend on the conditions on the ground .
But I think he 's trying to avoid the confusion in some peoples ' mind that it might all be over in a matter of months . "
The head of the Armed Forces , Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , has said that he still expects British forces and others to be able to hand over security responsibilities to Afghans by 2014 .
He said : " We have to remember that we are there militarily for two reasons , to hold the ring until the Afghans are ready and to help them get ready .
" Once they 're ready they 'll be doing it .
We do not want foreign soldiers , foreign troops in Afghanistan for one day longer than is necessary for the support of the Afghan people themselves . "
' Shoulder the burden '
The head of the Army , Gen Sir David Richards , said a five - year target would allow the UK to complete its mission .
He said : " There is measurable progress being made ; we now need to accelerate that within this very clear indicator we 've got another five years in which to do it .
I was actually worried that people might say we have got less .
" And finally , the prime minister and President Obama have made it clear that it is conditions - based , and we 're leaving behind even at that point the sort of help that will enable their army to take on the challenge that we currently shoulder the burden of in the main . "
During the election campaign , Mr Cameron said he would like to see troops brought back during course of this Parliament .
Interviewed in Canada , where he will take part in the G8 and G20 summits , Mr Cameron told Sky News : " We can't be there for another five years , having been there for nine years already .
" But one thing we should be clear about - Britain should have a long - term relationship with Afghanistan , including helping to train their troops and their civil society , long after the vast bulk of troops have gone home . "
Mr Obama wants a US drawdown of troops to begin next summer although US General David Petraeus - who this week replaced the sacked commander of multinational forces Stanley McChrystal - is among those insisting that has to be based on conditions on the ground .
Some 10,000 British soldiers are based in Afghanistan , many fighting a counter - insurgency campaign in the southern Helmand province .
After more than three months of public comment and controversy , the TriMet board of directors voted Wednesday to raise fares by 5 cents and to reduce service on about 50 bus lines .
Two lines also will be eliminated .
Citing low ridership and proximity to other routes , TriMet directors voted unanimously to discontinue the No. 27 Market /
Main and No. 157 Happy Valley lines .
Dozens of other bus and MAX lines will run less frequently .
The move to raise fares , however , was not as easily approved .
After a period of public comment raised several questions from board members , the board seemed to the entertain the idea of tabling the ordinance until its June meeting .
However , the measure eventually passed 5 - 1 .
" It 's a difficult balancing act we 're trying to do , " said new TriMet Board President Rick Van Beveren , who was appointed to the position Wednesday .
" I assure you no one on the board , whether elected or appointed , likes to be in this position . "
More
The changes come in the wake of TriMet 's $ 27 million budget shortfall , which officials have attributed to the recession .
It has resulted in falling passenger revenues , rising employee costs and a loss of payroll tax revenue .
Although the board has taken other measures to reduce costs , including a salary and hiring freeze and the use of federal stimulus funds , the service reductions and fee increases have drawn the most attention .
Since the changes were first proposed in February , TriMet has been flooded with public reaction .
About 1,800 public comments were received during a three - month period that was also marked by three public hearings , according to TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch .
That resulted in some modifications to the reduction plan .
Originally , four lines had been placed on the chopping block , and weekend service on three other lines faced elimination or significant reduction .
TriMet instead opted to decrease service in portions of the lines with low ridership rather than discontinue entire routes .
" We had a whole series of places where people said , ' I need this to get to work , I need this to get to school , ' so we ended up making numerous modifications , " TriMet general manager Fred Hansen said .
Still , the cuts come on the heels of similar changes made to address the $ 31 million deficit in last year 's budget , which eventually resulted in service reductions and the elimination of four lines .
TriMet last raised fares in September 2008 , and expects this increase , which brings the all - zone fare to $ 2.35 for bus , MAX and Westside Express Service , to generate about $ 1.5 million in revenue .
The increase and route changes go into effect in September .
Some TriMet riders said Wednesday that although they were disappointed , they understood the pressures TriMet faces .
" It 's one of those things where everything just gets more expensive , " said Scott Killen , who uses the bus five days a week .
" It 'll add up for people with monthly passes , but hopefully it wo n't be that bad . "
Traci Chenette , who rides the bus and MAX , said she was more concerned with the altered routes than the fare raise .
" For me , if it keeps service at its present level , I can absorb a nickel -- but I do worry about people who can't , " she said .
" Route changes worry me because it might make it harder for me to get to work and the places I need to go . "
Hansen assured the board that , should additional revenue become available , the eliminated services could be restored and fares reduced , if the board approved .
Hansen , who will be replaced by Neil McFarlane after he retires in June , also promised members of the public and board officials improvement in another area : safety .
Before Wednesday 's vote , he addressed safety concerns , many of which arose after an April bus crash killed two pedestrians in downtown Portland .
Both Hansen and Van Beveren said a full safety review was being conducted by the agency and that some improvements , including limits on unscheduled courtesy stops , have been implemented .
David Sale , the father of 22 - year - old Danielle Sale , who was killed in the crash , spoke to the TriMet board about the urgent need for improvement .
" I 'm going to continue to fight for this because it 's wrong what I go through each day , " Sale said .

Fundamental to computer science is transmitting information using electromagnetic communication - the 0s and 1s of binary code .
But nature 's tiniest lifeforms have used a very different method for eons , and figuring out how they do it could revolutionize computers .
Advertisement
Bacteria make great use of what 's known as molecular communication , in which they transmit and receive molecules to share information .
One example of this is quorum sensing , where bacteria send around chemical signals to figure out their local population .
This form of communication had long been ignored by information science , and it's only recently that the amount of information that can possibly be relayed using this method has been seriously considered .
Scientists at the University of Illinois have tackled this problem with a thought experiment .
A transmitter sits in a fluid , replicating the conditions in which bacteria communicate .
The transmitter emits a series of identical molecules , with the information encoded by the amount of time that elapses between each molecule released .
In theory , that could be a fairly powerful form of communication , but the fact that the transmission is in a fluid introduces one hell of a randomizer : Brownian motion .
Advertisement
Brownian motion describes the apparently random movement of particles in a fluid .
Indeed , this would work to completely scramble the molecules emitted ; the molecules would arrive at the receiver at time intervals completely different from when they were first emitted - in fact , there 's no guarantee they would even arrive in the right order - which would seemingly render the information unintelligible .
At least , that was the prevailing wisdom .
Not so , argue the scientists .
The uncertainty introduced by Brownian motion degrades the original information , to be sure , but not necessarily to a greater extent than the effect noise has on conventional communication .
As long as the noise can be kept sufficiently small relative to the overall flow of information , the message will remain more or less intact .
The same applies here , and the scientists point to factors like the fluid flow velocity and the molecular diffusion rate that can positively impact the flow of information and help reduce the relative " noise . "
All of this is great news for computer scientists looking to add molecular communication as a complement to its electromagnetic counterpart .
Certain computing problems are not well - suited to the highly ordered organization of the silicon chip , instead requiring something like the more disordered wetware that nature has developed .
Indeed , there are certain types of computing problems that are perfectly suited to molecular communication - all we need to do is keep figuring out how to actually do it .

Sometimes photos speak louder than words .
This slideshow provides just a few snapshots of what Bentley buyers experience if they visit the factory in Crewe , England , to commission a new Mulsanne .
The new body assembly hall built just for the Mulsanne includes a viewing platform , so visitors can watch the process of steel stampings and aluminium panels coming together into a single body shell .
They may also visit the " commissioning room " within a building housing Mulliner , the former coachbuilding firm that now creates custom finishes , fittings , and accessories for Bentley customers .
A new 2011 Bentley Mulsanne is the centerpiece of the room , with samples of woods , leathers , furs , and paint colors on tables and in presentations on shelving walls at the sides of the room .
The Mulsanne line is far from running at full tilt , which is to say , 20 cars a day .
It 's still building pre-production prototypes in fits and starts , with customer cars not due until August .
But craftspeople like Cath Green continue to create leather and wood interior fittings by hand for the GT , as they always have .
Depending on whether the wheel has a wood rim or one wrapped in leather -- and whether the customer has specified a heated rim -- Green 's output varies .
On average , she finishes about one and a half wheels per day .
The manufacturer provided airfare , lodging , and meals to enable High Gear Media to participate in the event that led to this story .
Still , Mrs. Boxer said ,
Why not clear things up ?
“ I said to Chairman Dodd , I have an idea that we should put together a very simple bill , an amendment to the bill that basically says what we know is true , that all financial companies put into receivership under this title shall be liquidated .
No company is going to be kept afloat .
All funds expended will be repaid to the taxpayers by the financial sector through assessments or the sale of the assets of the company . ”

In a provision titled , “ Liquidation required , ” Mrs. Boxer ’s amendment states : “ All financial companies put into receivership under this title shall be liquidated .
No taxpayer funds shall be used to prevent the liquidation of any financial company under this title .
All funds expended in the liquidation of a financial company under this title shall be recovered from the disposition of assets of such financial company , or shall be the responsibility of the financial sector , through assessments . ”
Her amendment also stresses that taxpayers will not pay for shutting down failed companies .
“ Taxpayers shall bear no losses from the exercise of any authority under this title , ” it states .
“ All funds expended in the liquidation of a financial company under this title shall be the responsibility of the financial sector , through assessments . ”
No votes were expected on amendments to the legislation until sometime next week .
With the Kentucky Derby taking place in Louisville this weekend , Mr. McConnell , in particular , has reason to want to head home from Washington .
Debate on the legislation moved forward after Republicans said on Wednesday that they would no longer block the Democrats from bringing the bill to the floor .
The floor fight is expected to last at least two weeks .
Republicans control enough votes to filibuster the measure and , if they remain united , could block it from being adopted .
As the debate began , Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama , the senior Republican on the Banking Committee , said that he would work aggressively to force changes to the legislation .

Implanted tissue and microchip mimic both perform functions of lung .
A chip coated with lung cells and blood capillaries mimics a human lung .
Kristin Johnson
Biomedical engineers have built many types of human organs in the lab , but they 've lagged on lung tissue — until now .
Two new studies have used very different approaches to do the job .
One team has grown lung cells that performed their gas - exchange functions when transplanted into living rats .
The study provides proof of principle that such regenerated tissue may one day be used to treat patients with serious lung disorders .
The other has built a microfluidic chip that mimics lung function , resulting in a biologically relevant model for testing medicines for lung disorders or conducting toxicity screens for nanoparticles .
" Lungs do n't heal themselves , and when we transplant lungs , patients tend to do very badly , " says Laura Niklason , a biomedical engineer at Yale University in New Haven , Connecticut .
Her group wanted to make lung tissue from the body 's own cells , to prevent rejection when transplanted .
A tissue - engineered left lung ( bright red , top of picture ) photographed about 30 minutes after implantation into an adult rat .
Thomas Petersen and Laura Niklason , Yale University .
They decided to grow the cells on the lung 's extracellular architecture rather than on synthetic cell matrices — the approach most researchers have focused on until now .
Training for cells
Niklason 's team first gently removed the lung cells from their support architecture — made mostly of collagen — leaving it intact .
They then added eight or nine cell types back onto the matrix and cultured them for eight days .
To the team 's surprise , the natural extracellular matrix directed the cells to their correct locations , essentially ' training ' them to function appropriately .
Finally , the researchers transplanted the tissue into rats .
Much like Niklason 's study , published online in Science today1 , two other recent studies used such decellularized matrices rather than synthetic ones2,3 .
What has never been done before , however , says Peter Lelkes , a tissue engineer at Drexel University in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , is transplanting the bioengineered lung tissue into a living organism .
" We were actually kind of surprised at how well they worked , " Niklason says .
The transplants functioned for about two hours , fulfilling the lungs ' key function of exchanging oxygen for carbon dioxide .
In practice , however , lung cells — especially from older , ill patients — wo n't grow well enough in culture , but will have to be produced from stem cells or induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells , she says .
" What we 've really done is developed the technological and scientific underpinnings so that we can bring stem - cell biology to bear on this problem . "
Angela Panoskaltsis-Mortari , who studies lung injury and repair at the University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , agrees .
Panoskaltsis- Mortari , an author on one of the other recent lung - engineering studies2 using a similar matrix , and her group presented data at a conference last month showing that iPS cells can differentiate into a key type of lung cell when grown on decellularized matrices .
" It 's a really ideal model " for studying lung differentiation , lung infection and related topics , she says .
Mechanical mimicry
In the second study in Science4 , researchers from Harvard University in Boston , Massachusetts , created a chip 1 to 2 centimetres long in which a 1 millimetre - wide channel , coated with human lung cells on the inside and overlaid with human blood capillaries on the outside , mimicked the air sacs , or alveoli , of the lungs .
The idea , says biomedical engineer and study leader Donald Ingber , was to create a way to do high - throughput screening — used by the pharmaceutical industry to screen large numbers of molecules — but in a system that 's biologically closer to human tissue than to a petri dish .
ADVERTISEMENT
What is most impressive about the chip , says Michael Shuler , a biomedical engineer at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , is that it mimicked not just the physiology of the lung , but also the mechanical forces that act on lung cells as the chest expands and contracts with each breath .
The group also tested the chip as a system for determining how different types of nanoparticles penetrate the lungs , and how bacteria enter the lungs to cause infection .
Ingber says he and his colleagues are now contacting pharmaceutical companies to find out how the device can best be used .
" As a system by itself , it could be used to test drugs very directly , " says Shuler .
Only one out of ten drugs in development makes it successfully through clinical trials , he adds .
" Maybe by having a more authentic system , you change the odds " to more like three out of ten , he says .
" It does n't have to be perfect to be valuable . "
The leak began Friday night when an underground Chevron Corp. pipeline in the mountains near the University of Utah broke .
The breach sent oil into a creek that flows through neighborhoods , into a popular Salt Lake City park , and ultimately into the Jordan River , which flows into the Great Salt Lake .
The 10 - inch pipeline was shut off Saturday morning , when workers at a nearby Veterans Affairs building smelled oil and called the Salt Lake City fire department , which notified Chevron .
The pipe carries crude oil from western Colorado to a refinery near the Salt Lake City International Airport .
Jason Olsen , spokesman for the Salt Lake City Joint Information Center , said Sunday that emergency workers believe they have contained the spill to the Jordan River .
But the spill still took its toll on birds at Red Butte Creek and at a large pond at Liberty Park , where visitors often feed birds from the shore and from rented paddle boats .
About 300 birds were coated in oil and cleaned at Utah 's Hogle Zoo .
Fewer than 10 have died , said Salt Lake City spokeswoman Lisa Harrison - Smith .
Emergency workers say they believe they have stopped a 21,000 - gallon oil leak from reaching the environmentally sensitive Great Salt Lake , one of the West 's most important inland water bodies for migratory birds that use it as a place to rest , eat and breed .
Most of the birds were Canada geese , although some ducks were also covered .
Harrison - Smith said the oil also flowed through several other riparian areas , which could threaten a rare Utah fish called a June sucker .
It 's been listed as an endangered species since 1986 .
Most of Liberty Park reopened Sunday .
The pond remained closed , and Olsen urged those who live near affected waterways to stay away from them .
“ Wherever the oil is , the smell is still fairly strong , ” Olsen said .
The Salt Lake City Police Department told residents whose yards were polluted by the spill not to clean them up , but to file a claim with Chevron first .
Chevron has said it is taking full responsibility for the spill and will pay for its cleanup .
Harrison - Smith said Chevron had investigators at the scene of the leak Sunday and that the Environmental Protection Agency had brought in a U.S. Coast Guard water recovery expert to assist with cleanup efforts .
She said city officials were hoping to receive a report on the spill from Chevron sometime Sunday evening .
U.S. Rep. Jim Matheson , D - Utah , said he spoke by telephone Sunday with Becky Roberts , president of the company 's Chevron Pipe Line Co. unit .
Matheson said Roberts told him that until Chevron crews dig up the broken section of pipe , the company can't be sure what caused the leak .
Matheson is urging full disclosure on the leak 's cause , and said his office will follow up to make sure Chevron follows EPA regulations .
“ I would say they are responding very aggressively to it .
I think they know there is a heightened concern among people in this country about oil spills , ” Matheson said .
“ I think they understand it's in their best interest to do everything they can to fix this as soon as possible . ”

Fox News ' Greta Van Susteren received an email from a viewer , " Brian , " saying that her " brain is empty . "
Naturally , she started a poll on her blog : " Who is dumber ?
Greta , or Brian . "
Guess who 's winning .
Van Susteren , the network 's resident weird Scientologist , is an experienced blogger who knows that the best way to deal with personal slights is to blog about them extensively .
So when she received an insulting email from viewer " Brian " of " Tahlequah , OK , " she posted it without hesitation :
Greta ,
You got that right , you have a mind like a seive .
Your brain is empty .
Matter of fact , it is so empty , if you put a pea in your skull it would rattle around like a BB in a boxcar .
You said it , gal , not me , but I sure do agree with you .
A true blonde .
Brian ***
Tahlequah , OK
PS How do you get that cush job , anyway ?
What Greta seems to have forgotten is that while the internet is a great place to air grievances , it is not a great place to find personal validation .
In fact , it is the actual worst place to find personal validation .
Especially in poll form :
Can you guess how this is going for Greta ?
If you have been on the internet before , even for five minutes , you may have a clue .
Obviously , as a professional blogger , I took the poll very seriously and weighed the evidence carefully :
On the one hand , " Brian " does n't know how to spell the word " sieve . "
On the other hand , Greta actually made a poll asking if she was dumber than a guy who wrote her an email .
I voted for Greta , in the hopes that they will replace her .
I look forward to On the Record with Brian from Tahlequah .

PS Read their thread for a lot of crazy stuff , like this secret website .
Improving website performance is hard work , and SEO alone will not get the job done .
The following analysis of human search behavior is the first step in developing a world - class website strategy .
Top performing websites have most of these traits in common :
They understand in detail human search behavior .
They have strategically invested in information architecture .
They have a commitment to develop and deploy high - quality content on a scheduled basis .
They understand the role quality visual design ( UI ) plays in successful user experiences .
They believe in human factors , and conduct usability tests .
They do n’t let technology impact products and services in a negative way ( gratuitous use of web 2.0 gimmicks ) .
They have high engineering standards , and validate their code before shipping .
They understand that SEO page markup has to be based upon quality content , not gimmicks .
They understand technically how crawlers and search technologies impact content find - ability .
They understand that a first - page search engine ranking has more to do with high - quality content , and a superior user experience .
You should keep all these factors in mind when developing your website strategy .
However , here I will only focus upon item number one , which is how do you figure out what your customers are doing when they are looking for your services .
Search behavior analysis
Choosing keyword phrases randomly , based upon volume or Google ’s suggestion can lead to success , but you never really know until you try the phrases out .
This costs time and money .
A better way to insure success is to take a step back , and look at the total search experience as it is reflected in an AdWords data set .
This means manually reviewing each keyword phrase , and classifying it to one of several behavioral categories — usually less than ten .
A quick look at the keyword phrase “ home improvement ” shows that nearly 10 million people a month search for home improvement products , services and information .
When you examine the data to see what is going on topically you can identify nine categories of distinct search behavior .
They are looking for :
Home improvement products : 1,477,100
Home improvement by specific project : 1,039,700
Home improvement by quality and value : 274,860 Home improvement company by Name : 208,890
Home improvement companies in general : 199,040 Home improvement TV / Media : 60,420
Home improvement advice , blogs & reviews : 88,000
Home improvement projects in general : 46,490 Home improvement financing : 6,900
Let ’s look at each of these categories more closely .
Home improvement products
The largest category ( 1.48 M ) is informational in nature .
In these searches the user is looking for product and information using vague terminology .
They use just four secondary terms to modify the primary keyword phrase .
In order of importance ( volume ) the terms are :
Tools Hardware Products Appliances
Home improvement by specific project
The second largest category ( 1.04 M ) is users looking for information so that they can learn about or transact for services for a very specific project .
There are ten secondary project related terms in this group , with the top four accounting for the lion - share of the traffic .
In order of importance by volume :
Bathrooms Flooring Plumbing Kitchens
The remaining six project related terms account for about 5 % of this categories traffic .
5. Tile
6. Mobile home
7. Roofing
8. Drywall
9. Siding
10 . Basement
Looking for products and services by quality and value
The third largest category ( 275K ) is users who are concerned with quality and value .
Hands down they are more concerned with quality than they are with value .
The important observation about this category is that the lexicon of terms being used is small , and they should play a role in ad copy and page markup .
The secondary terms in order of importance are :
Quality Discount Best Value Reliable Affordable
Looking for a company
The fourth and fifth largest categories ( 209 K and 199 K respectively ) are users looking for a company by name , or looking for a list of companies .
Users searching for a specific company by name is the larger category .
A review of all the company names show that these firms fall into two major categories :
Home improvement stores selling products
Home improvement contractors
When users does not yet have a specific company in mind they search for company related information using more ambiguous secondary terms such as :
Stores
Contractors
Construction
Centers
Companies
Services
Design
Websites
The Home Improvement TV series
This is the fly in the ointment .
The sixth largest category ( 165K ) is users searching for information about the Home Improvement TV series .
This category needs to be understood so that the dominant secondary terms can be identified for exclusion from web page ad copy .
The dominant secondary terms in this category are :
TV Season Video Tim Series DVD Cast Set
The important issue here is that a company who develops and markets “ how to ” videos and DVD ’s for the DIY community will likely get traffic that they are not really interested in .
Informational searches
The seventh category ( 88 K ) reflects users early in the search cycle .
They are in research mode , and are looking for ideas and information .
These terms represent rich content opportunities .
The dominant secondary terms in order of importance are :
Ideas DIY Advice How to Guide Reviews Green
General home improvement projects
The eighth category accounts for 46 K search a month .
These searches are informational in nature , somewhat vague and cluster around three broad terms that have several meanings :
Remodeling Repairs Projects
Transactional queries
The final category ( 6.9K ) is transactional in nature .
There is very little traffic but it is valuable traffic because searchers are looking for ways to finance their home improvement projects .
The top terms are :
Money Finance
Observations about queries
It ’s useful to remember that 71 % of all consumer search terms are nouns , and 7 % of search terms are adjectives .
This means that nearly 80 % of all queries are noun - noun or adjective - noun phrases .
This is important when considering your SEO page markup and page copy strategy .
Since verbs , for example account for only 2.4 % of all search terms , you would not sweat bullets over their usage in your website .
The linguistic profile for human search term usage is :
Proper noun : 40.2 % Noun : 30.9 % Adjectives : 7.1 % URI : 5.9 % Preposition : 3.7 % Garbage strings : 2.5 % Verb : 2.4 % Punctuation : 1.4 % All other parts of speech : 5.9 %
So , how does the “ home improvement ” data set look when considering the importance of adjectives , nouns and phrase word order ?
There are three things that can be observed about these consumer queries :
First , 66 % of the queries have this noun - noun pattern : home improvement [ noun ]
Second , 23 % of queries have a proper noun - noun pattern : [ company name ] home improvement
The remaining 11 % of the queries have an adjective - noun pattern : [ adjective ] home improvement
There are a few examples that do n’t fit this model — but , as a rule - of - thumb linguistic search behavior follows these three simple patterns that we see with the “ home improvement ” data set .
A search behavior model
The primary thrust of user searches in the home improvement category is for information about products and information about remodeling or repairing a part of the home .
Searchers are also looking for ideas , advice and reviews — and are interested in doing some of the work themselves .
Quality and affordability are very important , and is reflected in the search behavior .
The secondary focus is searching for companies that provide contracting services , and companies that sell hardware .
And finally , there is an interest in financing these renovations .
Modeling a content strategy
Once a search behavior model is understood you can use this information to develop a content strategy .
The following strategic content model reflects human behavior in the AdWords dataset .
Many users tend to start their search sessions using ambiguous queries such as home improvement remodeling , or home improvement projects .
They then move to specific keyword terms , using phrases such as home improvement contractors , Home Improvement Bathroom or home improvement DIY .
The use of the terms remodeling or repairing is practically the same in intended outcome — the searcher wants to improve a portion of his house .
Customers are using two different phrases to frame a single concept .
From an information architecture perspective you could use these two categories as funnels on custom landing pages depending upon what preferred phraseology is being used .
When you view all the categories from an organizational perspective they fall into the following groups : projects , information , products and companies .
This dictates a very simple home page organizational strategy , with four major modules with projects and products playing the most dominant roles , with information and company directory in supporting roles .
The following information architecture reflects user intent , and provides a one - stop strategy to provide users with what they are looking for .
Web page copy
When you strip away the primary keyword phrase ( home improvement ) and look at the top secondary terms by volume , you are left with a set of terms that suggest major SEO opportunities , with a very focused list of words that should be worked into the website ’s ad copy .
The following list also provides you with a set of terms that people are using to find information about the Home Improvement TV show ( red font ) .
Most of these you do not have to worry about — but , if you had a “ series of How To videos and DVD ” for sale on your website , you may want to think about providing some “ goodwill ” value by providing links to the content these folks are interested in .
Or you could just ignore this traffic ( unless you are running an AdWords campaign , in which case you should consider including these as negative match keywords ) .
These secondary terms , with the number of queries for each , includes :
tools : 1,000,000
bathroom : 550,000
hardware : 450,000
quality : 246,000
flooring : 165,000

Summary
In this analysis you see that a complex set of reported data from AdWords searches around a single topic can be reduced to nine search behavior categories .
In my experience , I ’ve seen as few as six categories in some travel - related AdWords data sets , and as many as twelve in medical areas .
Resolving the keyword phrases for the top secondary terms provides your information architects with a focused short list of terms that provide SEO opportunities , and content module labeling opportunities .
This list of terms also provides you with a preferred vocabulary for website ad copy .
This analysis of human search behavior provides a data - driven approach to developing and refining a content strategy that aligns your information architecture with user intent .
If you give the users what they are searching for — they will find you .

When it comes to roadblocks for the electric car market , “ range anxiety ” — or prospective buyers ’ concern that they might get stuck with a low battery without a charge point in sight — often looms large .
But as we come within mere months of cars like the Nissan LEAF , Coda Sedan and others becoming available for sale and lease , another question that could give cold feet to would - be electric car buyers is bubbling to the surface :
How much will these next - gen vehicles be worth a few years down the road ?
According to a report from the UK’s Glass Guide that Autocar picked up this week , a typical electric vehicle will retain only 10 percent of its value after five years of ownership , compared to gas and diesel - fueled counterparts retaining 25 percent of their value in that time period ( h/t Autoguide ) .
Depreciation represents a relatively mundane factor when buyers consider conventional gas cars — buyers can consult guides like Kelly Blue Book and others for a sense of how the value of a given car in previous model years has held up over time .
But depreciation involves a host of unknowns for electric models .
CAP Motor Research , one of the UK ’s biggest providers of vehicle valuation data for leasing companies , insurance firms , vehicle retail groups and financial institutions , recently described the task of reliably forecasting the residual value of electric vehicles ( how much a car will be worth at the end of its lease , which affects where monthly lease payments are set ) as being simply impossible .
With electric vehicles , the inherent uncertainty surrounding a new technology ’s long - term value is exacerbated by the fact that the biggest question mark rests on the costliest piece of the car : the battery .
Glass , meanwhile , is basing its forecast on a “ worst - case scenario , ” explaining that consumers ’ perception may matter more than whatever reality emerges for the technology in this case .
Among consumers , Glass anticipates a widespread belief that electric car batteries “ will need replacing in the near future regardless of the manufacturers ’ predictions of battery life . ”
After one year of ownership , Glass expects the residual values for electric vehicles to rank higher than “ the segment average ” in monetary terms .
But if automakers sell the battery outright ( rather than lease it ) and fail to provide “ appropriate warranty ” ( check out some ideas for new battery warranty schemes here ) , then an electric car ’s value will “ fall dramatically until the vehicle is five years old , ” Andy Carroll , managing director for Glass Guide , said in a statement .
More on Electric Vehicles
To improve residual values , he proposes that automakers look to new business models like leasing batteries separately from the vehicle ( an idea that companies including Nissan have discussed , but ultimately rejected ) , removing the cost of the battery from the list price and allowing a guarantee for minimum battery performance as a feature of the lease agreement .
Alternatively , Carroll calls for manufacturers to offer all - in - one leasing packages , with automakers underwriting the capital cost of the vehicle , battery lease and servicing .
Nissan , for one , has opted to take financing into its own hands for the upcoming LEAF , which is slated to have one of the lowest price tags of any electric car on the road in the next few years .

Thirty years ago , on May 18 , Mount St. Helens lost its top — 3.7 billion cubic yards of mountain , to be exact .
The peak of the Pacific Northwest icon dropped by about 1,300 feet in a matter of seconds , taking down with it enough trees to build 300,000 two - bedroom houses .
Gone , too , were 200 homes , 57 human lives and most of the visible wildlife across 230 square miles .
" The first reaction for many of us was that what remained was a moonscape , " recalls Jerry Franklin , professor of ecosystem analysis at the University of Washington .
" But that proved to be very wrong . "
Those initial bleak impressions were based on aerial views .
As scientists got a closer look at the ash - laden ground , they discovered that the devastating losses had made room for remarkable gains — in terms of both ecosystem productivity and scientific progress .
Plants and animals that never stood a chance under heavy canopies of trees , or in the presence of predominating predators , began to flourish .
Some of these species were brand new to the area , such as the western meadowlark .
The resulting early - successional ecosystems turned out to be even more productive than those of the pre-eruption old - growth forests .
As the years went by , several lessons in fields ranging from biology to engineering to atmospheric science piled up .
Zoologists studied curious cases of spiders windblown into the blast zone ; volcanologists engineered stainless steel " smart spiders " to monitor ongoing volcanic activity ; and forest managers took notice that areas left untouched by human hands after the eruption fostered greater biodiversity than places where people attempted to speed recovery by salvaging dead trees and planting new ones .
" For a lot of the scientists , including myself , it was kind of like being a kid in a candy store , " Franklin says .
" There was so much going on , and so many surprises . "

Thomas , who had a career in corrections and once served indicted Governor Fife Symington , recently resigned his office to run for Attorney General .
But during his five years as County Attorney he was Arpaio ’s Sancho Panza , hauling his legal water and providing the Sheriff political cover to conduct his nefarious activities , such as his neighborhood sweeps .
Both the County Sheriff and Attorney are elected offices here , and Arpaio and Thomas raised funds and campaigned together , they were that close of a team , that like - minded .
The investigation of Thomas , which was ordered by Arizona Chief Justice Rebecca White Berch , is looking into lawsuits and other harassments that the County Attorney leveled at Don Stapley and Mary Rose Wilcox , who are Maricopa County Supervisors with whom Thomas and Arpaio often disagreed .
The investigation also covers the County Attorney ’s indictment of Gary Donahoe , a Superior Court Judge who Thomas and Arpaio saw as an obstacle to bringing about their police state .
These cases are too involved to go into here , covering years and gallons of newspaper print ; needless to say , they were all dismissed .
What is Arpaio ’s May 3 letter to the attorneys at the County Attorney ’s Office about ?
On the face of it , it appears Arpaio is trying to stall the investigation of his old pal , Andrew Thomas :
“ This letter is intended to advise you that I do not consent to you revealing any information provided to you by my office , regardless of any personal incentive to breach the attorney - client privilege …
Be advised that should you disclose any information that could harm any pending criminal investigations , I will consider charging you with violations of applicable statutes . ”
That ’s a pretty typical Arpaio tactic : file a lawsuit .
Shielding Thomas is no doubt Arpaio ’s concern , and when Thomas ’s Chief Deputy Phil MacDonnell received and read the letter he said , “ It gave me pause . ”
Gee , Phil , ya think ?
What ’s also behind Joe Arpaio ’s letter , I ’d suggest , is that he is testing the waters because he is also under investigation , the federal grand jury type , for abuse of power , including the lawsuits mentioned above and probably a long list of other breaches of authority .
To that end , his letter is warning any attorney who worked with Thomas ’s office not to disclose information about the Don Stapley fiasco , for example , because Arpaio is as close to that case as Thomas , perhaps even more so .
Thankfully , Interim County Attorney , Rick Romley , is no Arpaio lackey like Thomas .
He fired off a letter to Arpaio advising him that he did not have the power to issue this threat , and that he could not claim attorney - client privilege because “ the relationship between the two offices is not attorney and client but law enforcement and prosecutor . ”
But what I really love is the end of Romley ’s letter , something very few people in this state have been willing to say to Joe Arpaio :
“ This threat is not only inappropriate but is a clear abuse of your authority as sheriff of Maricopa County .
Thereby , I shall be forwarding your letter to the U.S. Attorney ’s Office . ”
Ouch !
There is some good news coming out of Arizona .
We await the grand jury report for even more good news .

UPDATE : Thanks guys .
You dash off a diary early in the morning , hit the hay , and wake up to see it at the top of the Rec List .

A good first step .
In 2009 , the United Nations Member States decided to make further and decisive progress , within a decade , in controlling illicit drug supply and demand .
Many illicit drug markets have reached global dimensions and require control strategies on a comparable scale .
In that context , there is a need to better understand these transnational markets and the manner in which they operate .
This year 's World Drug Report is a contribution towards that objective .
It opens with an analytical discussion of three key transnational drug markets : the markets for heroin , cocaine and amphetamine - type stimulants .
The market discussion is followed by a presentation of statistical trends for all major drug categories .
The latest information on drug production , seizures and consumption is presented .
Finally , there is a discussion on the relationship between drug trafficking and instability .

An Ohio family recently learned their 6 - year - old daughter was on the Department of Homeland Security ’s ' no - fly ' list , Fox8.com reported .
Alyssa Thomas , 6 , was traveling with her parents when a ticket agent notified the family she was on the list of restricted fliers .
" We were , like , puzzled , " said her father , Dr. Santhosh Thomas .
" I 'm like , well , she 's kinda six - years - old and this is not something that should be typical . "
When the family tried to clear up the issue with Homeland Security , they received a letter notifying them that it could not be changed .
" She 's been flying since she was two - months old , so that has not been an issue , " said Dr. Thomas .
" In fact , we had traveled to Mexico in February and there were no issues at that time . "
Transportation Security Administration told Fox8.com that Alyssa never had any problems before because the " Secure Flight Program " just went into effect in June for all domestic flights .
“ The watch lists are an important layer of security to prevent individuals with known or suspected ties to terrorism from flying , ” a TSA spokesman told Fox8.com .
The Thomas family plans to make another appeal to Homeland Security .

THE clearest measure of recent investor uncertainty is the VIX or volatility index , traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange .
The index shows the price investors are willing to pay to insure themselves against substantial market moves .
Having declined pretty steadily since the middle of 2009 , the VIX has more than doubled in May and hit its highest level for over a year last week as it became clear that the euro - zone 's rescue package on May 10th had not steadied government - bond markets as much as was hoped .
Another concern for investors is fiscal policy .
While they want governments to cut their deficits , they also worry about the impact of many developed countries doing so at once .

The furor triggered by the announcement during US Vice President Joe Biden ’s trip last week of plans to build 1,600 housing units in northeastern Jerusalem continued to reverberate over the weekend , with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton calling the move “ insulting ” and the new EU foreign policy chief hinting Europe could use trade ties as leverage against Israel .
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , apparently taken aback by Clinton ’s sharp criticism , called a meeting of his inner cabinet on Saturday night to discuss the continuing fallout and formulate a response .
Following that meeting , Netanyahu put out a statement late Saturday night saying he would set up a committee headed by the director - general of his office , Eyal Gabai , to investigate the unfolding of events during the Biden visit and come up with regulations to prevent a similar occurrence in the future .
The committee will also include the directors - general of the Interior Ministry , the Construction and Housing Ministry and the Jerusalem Municipality .
Prior to the inner cabinet meeting , Netanyahu spoke to two of Israel ’s closest allies in Europe , Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , and said he realized that the announcement of the project during Biden ’s visit was a mishap , but that Jerusalem had apologized to Biden and coordinated with him the statement on the matter released on Thursday morning by the Prime Minister ’s Office .
In addition , Netanyahu said , Israel was instituting a new mechanism to ensure that what happened last Tuesday , when an Interior Minister committee announced approval of the plans hours after a Biden - Netanyahu meeting and press conference , would not happen again .
Still , the prime minister said , the policy on building Jewish neighborhoods in east Jerusalem is not new , and goes back to Levi Eshkol ’s government immediately after the 1967 war .
Netanyahu , according to government sources , said that his government had not radically increased housing in the Jewish neighborhoods of Jerusalem ; that there was a wide consensus on the matter in Israel ; and that construction in these neighborhoods has been done continuously by every government , both from the Right and the Left .
In addition , he said , everyone – including the Palestinians – understood that neighborhoods like Gilo and Ramat Shlomo would remain part of Israel in any final agreement , and that this has been the case in all the various plans drawn up over the years .
Clinton sharply admonished Netanyahu over the plans in a phone conversation on Friday .
Both Clinton and Netanyahu are scheduled to address the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference in Washington next Monday .
Clinton ’s call to Netanyahu came hours ahead of a condemnation of the housing plan issued by the Middle East Quartet composed of the US , UN , EU and Russia .
“ The Quartet has agreed to closely monitor developments in Jerusalem and to keep under consideration additional steps that may be required to address the situation on the ground , ” read its statement , which also called for the resumption of peace talks .
The Quartet said it would “ take full stock ” of the situation at its meeting in Moscow on Friday .
The Quartet did not spell out what “ additional steps ” it had it mind , and government sources in Jerusalem said they did not immediately know what was being implied .
In an interview with NBC , Clinton labeled the move “ insulting not just to the vice president , ” who was in Israel conveying his support to the Israeli people when the announcement came , but “ an insult to the United States .
” During her call to Netanyahu , she described the announcement as “ a deeply negative signal about Israel ’s approach to the bilateral relationship , ” one that went against the spirit of Biden ’s trip and “ undermined trust and confidence in the peace process and in America ’s interests , ” according to State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley .
Crowley said Clinton also stressed that “ the Israeli government needed to demonstrate not just through words , but through specific actions , that they are committed to this relationship and to the peace process .
” The Prime Minister ’s Office provided no document about the conversation with Clinton .
Biden wrapped up his four - day visit to Israel on Thursday , one in which he repeatedly stressed the strength of the alliance and the US commitment to Israel ’s security .
When news broke on Tuesday about the plans for building in Ramat Shlomo , he drafted a response in consultation with US President Barack Obama , using the harshest diplomatic language to condemn the move .
The Palestinians have threatened to pull out of upcoming indirect talks with Israel if the housing plans are n’t shelved .
Netanyahu ’s office has said repeatedly that he did not have any intention of declaring a housing - start moratorium in east Jerusalem .
US Mideast envoy George Mitchell is expected back in Israel on Tuesday to try to push the talks forward .
A State Department official , speaking on condition of anonymity , would n’t say whether the US was looking for Israel to accede to the Palestinian demand , but said , “ We ’d like to see the Israeli government take specific steps to build confidence .
” The Arab League , in a special meeting on Wednesday , withdrew its support for indirect talks that it had endorsed a week earlier .
US Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman and Mitchell have been working the phones to keep Arab leaders on board .
As part of their outreach , they spoke to the foreign ministers of Egypt , Jordan , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates , as well as to Arab League Secretary - General Amr Moussa and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
“ We ’ve been dealing with some obstacles this week , but we ’re working with both sides to overcome those obstacles and keep the proximity talks moving forward , ” the State Department official said .
“ We ’re still moving forward with our plans .
” Crowley noted on Thursday that the US had not received any official word from the Palestinians that they were pulling out of the talks , despite media speculation , and that Mitchell was still planning to head back to the region next week .
Also on Friday , the State Department announced it was increasing assistance to Palestinians via the United Nations Relief and Works Agency by $ 55 million , bringing the total US aid for 2010 to $ 95 m .
During Clinton ’s nearly 45 - minute call with Netanyahu about the housing plan ’s approval , she also told the prime minister that “ she could n’t understand how this happened , particularly in light of the United States ’s strong commitment to Israel ’s security , ” according to Crowley .
Netanyahu has insisted he was blindsided by the Interior Ministry committee vote and apologized for its timing , but he has n’t walked away from the building program itself .
Asked whether the secretary ’s comment indicated the Americans did n’t believe Netanyahu ’s explanation , Crowley said that “ we accept what Prime Minister Netanyahu has said .
” But , he added , “ By the same token , he is the head of the Israeli government and ultimately is responsible for the actions of that government .
” Meanwhile , the EU ’s foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , hinted broadly on Saturday at a meeting with EU foreign minister in Cordoba that the EU could use the prospects of an upgrade with Israel as leverage .
“ We ’re a huge supplier of aid and development in that region .
We are strong with Israel in terms of trade and Israel wants to enhance its relationship with us , it wants to upgrade relations , ” Reuters quoted her as saying .
“ Our ambition is that they know – because they do – that the solution lies in a negotiated settlement .
Our view is that it needs to happen quickly and now , with the opportunity that that affords Israel ... to be able to enhance the relationships it wants with us in any event for the future .
” Ashton starts a four - day tour of the Middle East on Sunday , and is expected to arrive in Israel on Wednesday .
She will also travel to Egypt , Syria , Lebanon , Jordan and the Gaza Strip , officials said on Friday .
“ What we have at the moment is a traditional relationship with Israel .
They would like more , ” Ashton was quoted as saying .
Ashton said she hoped to visit Gaza , where the EU is a majorcontributor of aid .
“ I want to see for myself how we are spending ourmoney and what kind of impact it has on the ground , ” she said .
Annually , the EU and its 27 member states spend about € 1 billion onhumanitarian and other aid for the Palestinians .
Israel has said it will let Ashton , as well as UN Secretary - General BanKi-moon , who is scheduled to arrive two days later , into Gaza fromIsrael .
Archaeologists have disproved the fifty - year - old theory underpinning our understanding of how the famous stone statues were moved around Easter Island .
Fieldwork led by researchers at University College London and The University of Manchester , has shown the remote Pacific island ’s ancient road system was primarily ceremonial and not solely built for transportation of the figures .
A complex network of roads up to 800 - years - old crisscross the Island between the hat and statue quarries and the coastal areas .
Laying alongside the roads are dozens of the statues - or moai .
The find will create controversy among the many archaeologists who have dedicated years to finding out exactly how the moai were moved , ever since Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl first published his theory in 1958 .
Heyerdahl and subsequent researchers believed that statues he found lying on their backs and faces near the roads were abandoned during transportation by the ancient Polynesians .
But his theory has been completely rejected by the team led by Manchester ’s Dr Colin Richards and UCL’s Dr Sue Hamilton .
Instead , their discovery of stone platforms associated with each fallen moai - using specialist ‘ geophysical survey ’ equipment – finally confirms a little known 1914 theory of British archaeologist Katherine Routledge that the routes were primarily ceremonial avenues .
The statues , say the Manchester and UCL team just back from the island , merely toppled from the platforms with the passage of time .
“ The truth of the matter is , we will never know how the statues were moved , ” said Dr Richards .
“ Ever since Heyerdahl , archeologists have come up with all manner of theories – based on an underlying assumption that the roads were used for transportation of the moai , from the quarry at the volcanic cone Rano Raraku .
” What we do now know is that the roads had a ceremonial function to underline their religious and cultural importance .
“ They lead – from different parts of the island – to the Rano Raraku volcano where the Moai were quarried .
“ Volcano cones were considered as points of entry to the underworld and mythical origin land Hawaiki .
“ Hence , Rano Ranaku was not just a quarry but a sacred centre of the island . ”
The previous excavation found that the roads are concave in shape –making it difficult to move heavy objects along them
And as the roads approach Rano Raraku , the statues become more frequent – which the team say , indicated an increasing grades of holiness .
“ All the evidence strongly shows that these roads were ceremonial - which backs the work of Katherine Routledge from almost 100 years ago , “ said Dr Sue Hamilton .
“ It all makes sense : the moai face the people walking towards the volcano .
“ The statues are more frequent the closer they are to the volcano – which has to be way of signifying the increasing levels of importance . ”
She added : “ What is shocking is that Heyerdahl actually found some evidence to suggest there were indeed platforms .
“ But like many other archaeologists , he was so swayed by his cast iron belief that the roads were for transportation – he completely ignored them . ”
Notes for editors
Routledge and her husband arrived at Easter Island in 1914 , to publish her findings in a popular travel book , The Mystery of Easter Island in 1919 .
Geophysical surveys are used to create subsurface maps by passing electrical currents below the ground and measuring its resistance .

( NewsTarget )
Hot and cold baths have been used for centuries and some of the benefits they bring include : increased energy , increased circulation , detoxification , and the clearing of negative energy .
An easy way to replicate the spa experience of alternating hot and cold baths , and the primal experience of jumping from hot springs to cold rivers , is to simply alternate hot and cold water in your shower .
Most of us are quite accustomed to warm showers and even the idea of introducing cold water can be intimidating .
But once you 've done it for yourself , you 'll see it 's really not that bad .
Actually , you 'll probably find it 's quite invigorating .
It 's best to start with hot and after a few minutes to use a blast of cold for a minute .
Then use hot water again , repeat several times , and end your shower when you 're ready .
The hot should be hot and the cold should be cold - in fact , as long as you 're not scalding yourself : the hotter the better and the colder the better .
This can be done daily , but if you 're clearing a negative energy dump or if you need more powerful detoxification , it can be done several times a day .
The extremes of hot and cold water cause your muscles to expand and contract which offers gentle detoxification as toxins are squeezed from your muscles .
It also improves circulation and the benefits of improved circulation should n't be underestimated .
When your body has poor circulation , it 's impeded in delivering fresh blood to all areas of the body .
As a result , the body can't cleanse the blocked and stagnant areas regularly - and toxins , filth and disease accumulate in these oxygen and fresh blood deprived areas .
This is regularly seen with cancers and tumors which are really just clumps of fungus and filth that the body was unable to remove .
They develop to contain the waste that could n't be removed because our detoxification systems are frequently overwhelmed due to the large amounts of chemicals and improper foods that most people take in daily - and also because poor circulation prevents regular cleansing .
Cold water , it should be noted , holds a magic of its own .
Cold water has more oxygen in it than hot water , and therefore has an alkalizing and detoxifying effect .
Plus , cold water is known to wipe away negative energy from our bodies .
And there 's a negative energy component to most disease - particularly where cancers or tumors are located .
Using cold water can help remove the energy that 's binding the filth in certain locations and when that energy is gone , the filth can more easily be moved out of your body - where it truly belongs .
Sea salts and ocean swimming also remove negative energy , which may be the reason many beach oriented cultures have reputations for being laid back .
Plus , if you can release the negative energy when it 's produced , there 's a much slimmer chance that it will be stored in your body and come back to haunt you , either as a disease or an emotional trigger .
To clear negative energy , another technique is to hold a couple teaspoons of quality sea salts in the palms of each hand for a few minutes to absorb the energy if it returns after your shower .
Negative energy is released through the palms of our hands and in this manner , the salts can absorb the energy from you .
After the salts have absorbed your negative energy , let them sit in the sun for a day or two to regain their purity .
People with heart problems , the elderly , and infirm may want to forgo extremely cold waters .
More : Kim Evans is a natural health writer and author of Cleaning Up !
The Ultimate Body Cleanse offers deep cleansing and using methods in this book , people have gotten rid of dozens of different types of health problems , as well as just losing excess weight , thinking more clearly , and feeling better .
Kim 's next book chronicles events in her life that happen to match patterns in the Bible .
She 's also found three places in the Bible that tell us its about these patterns and even asking you to match them .
Here 's a little from the upcoming book ...
In Isaiah 22:20 , it says , " And it must occur in that day that I will call my servant , namely Elia . "
But , because these prophecies are cryptic and they are n't meant to be understood until they are understood , it 's only the last three letters .
A few lines later , it says , " From the land of Kittim it has been revealed to them .
" Here , you just take out any three middle letters , and again , it 's the name of the person bringing you this message , or the sacred secret of the prophecy .
Actually , if you take those two passages , Kim is about the only name you can get from both of them .
In Numbers 1:1  1:18 , it 's talking about " the family " and mentions Pagiel .
It also twice mentions February 1st , ( Kim 's birthday ) and then says that the youngest is 20 years old .
Kim 's little sister Paige is currently 20 years old .
In Chronicles 1 11:20 it mentions the brother of Joab and then in the same sentence uses the word brandishing .
Kim 's middle name is Jo and her older sister 's name is Brandi .
There are other patterns to her sisters too but these sort of mention them by name .
Of course , it helps if you know that there is a magical spiritual reality available that comes deep cleansing and often major dietary upgrades .
It 's also why Jesus was teaching the same thing , if you find his teachings in the Essene Gospel of Peace .
In this text , he even says things like , " You 'll never see the father unless you clean your colon . "
But , this is paraphrased ...
In the Bible Jesus says things more like , happy are those who wash their robes , as they can enter the tree of life .
The tree of life is elsewhere explained as God 's paradise .
He also said , first clean the inside of the cup and then the outside will also be clean .

Perhaps you have heard of KFC ’s “ Buckets for the Cure ” campaign .
The idea is , every time you buy a pink bucket of fried chicken from the chain , 50 cents is donated to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation for breast cancer research .
Now , raising money for cancer research of any kind is great , but I ca n’t help but think ( and I am by no means alone here ) that this campaign is misguided and misleading ( not to mention the weird irony of buying – and eating – certain breasts to save others ) .
Of course , tying an advertising campaign to the fight against breast cancer , a practice commonly known as pinkwashing , is nothing new .
Let ’s look at some more examples and discuss !
KFC ’s Pink Buckets :
So yeah , buying a pink bucket of chicken raises money for breast cancer research .
But wait !
According to the National Cancer Institute , “… studies have shown that an increased risk of developing colorectal , pancreatic , and breast cancer is associated with high intakes of well - done , fried , or [ barbecued ] meats . ”
Methinks that KFC sells both fried and barbecued meats , making this a somewhat hypocritical partnership .
On top of that , the Washington Post has this to say on the campaign :
Also , the fine print points out that “ KFC restaurant operators have contributed 50 cents to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure for each Komen branded bucket purchased by the operators from April 5 , 2010 - May 9 , 2010 … .
Customer purchases of KFC buckets during the promotion will not directly increase the total contribution . ”
( It ’s also noted that KFC has guaranteed the contribution will be at least $ 1 million .
Which really is very nice . )
So it looks like buying pink buckets does n’t even have as much of an impact as they say it does ( which is still just 50 cents per bucket ) .
You ’d probably be better off just eating at home and contributing money directly to the cure if you want to help out .
Sparklett ’s Bottled Water :
Earlier this year , Sparkletts began decorating their water delivery trucks and their website ( pictured ) with pink ribbons to advertise their affiliation with the Susan G. Komen foundation .
Unfortunately , Sparkletts ’ bottles contain a known hormone disrupter , Bishenol - A ( BPA ) , that is suspected to cause breast cancer and prostate cancer , and can even interfere with chemotherapy treatments .
Sorry Sparkletts , but a pink sparkly truck is n’t enough to do the trick – we are n’t in Barbie ’s Dream House anymore .
Port - o- Pong Floating Beer Pong Table :
Ah , the floating beer pong table .
For breast cancer .
Though the website claims that , “ Our mission is to help eradicate breast cancer by exposing young people to methods of prevention , early detection and support , ” I have a hard time seeing the connection here .
Several studies have shown that certain levels of alcohol intake can increase a woman ’s risk of developing breast cancer , and the fratty pool parties where these floating beer pong tables are likely to be used do n’t exactly sound like woman - friendly environments .
Facebook “ Bra Color ” Campaign and Others Aiming to “ Tit ” illate :
Remember a few months ago when you got that message on Facebook asking you to share the color of your bra to raise awareness for breast cancer ?
Yeah , that did n’t work .
Nor did it have much to do with real cancer research .
Campaigns that aim to “ tit ” illate ( pun intended , of course ) like Save the Ta - Tas and Save Some Boobs , as well as the Facebook campaign , put the focus on the breasts and not on the research ( or the women attached to those breasts ) .
Total sexist pinkwashing .
Smith & Wesson ’s Breast Cancer Awareness 9 mm Pistol :
That ’s right ; it ’s a gun meant to raise awareness ( and money ) for breast cancer research .
Aside from the sheer weirdness of this , according to a 2008 report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control , firearms are the second most common cause of violent deaths of women , accounting for 29.2 % of all violent deaths among females in the U.S. in 2008 .
There ’s some real cognitive dissonance at play in that “ awareness campaign . ”
These are just a few of the stranger and more offensive “ pinkwashed ” products out there , but as I ’m sure you know , there are lots more .
From toasters to cosmetics to luxury vehicles , tons of big companies exploit our real desire as consumers to raise money for cancer research in ways that are often problematic .
For more information on pinkwashing , including a list of “ Critical Questions to Ask Before You Buy Pink ” , visit Think Before You Pink .
They have done some great work helping big companies like Yoplait to turn their pinkwashing ways around and do some real good for cancer research .
I ’d like to think they can do the same for the KFC campaign , but I ’m not seeing any obvious solutions there beyond turning off those fryers ( yeah , I doubt it ) .
Same goes for that beer pong table .
Have any pinkwashed products or ideas to share ?

Hoping to turn their frustration and anger into action , tens of thousands of protesters against Arizona 's new immigration law marched on the state Capitol Saturday and urged the nation 's leaders to hear their pleas .
" We must stand together for justice , opportunity and peace , " said U.S. Rep. Ed Pastor , D - Ariz. , at the mid-afternoon culmination of what was a peaceful demonstration on the Capitol grounds .
" What we need in the United States is not scapegoating immigrants . "

Brewer rejects Goddard in defense of SB 1070
Sarahi Uribe , a representative of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network , which helped organize Saturday 's event , said her California - based group participated to send a message to Washington , D.C. " We have a very clear demand that President Obama stop Senate Bill 1070 , " she said .
The 5 - mile March Against SB 1070 , which began shortly before 10 a .m. at Steele Indian School Park , had no reported arrests , but the afternoon 's heat took a toll , with 20 people treated for heat - related illnesses , seven of them taken to area hospitals , public - safety officials said .
An official crowd estimate was not available .
Phoenix police declined to give an official tally , but officers overheard on the police scanner estimated the crowd at about 30,000 .
Uribe said the march drew about 100,000 .
Banging drums , chanting , singing and waving American flags , the throng made its way toward the Capitol .
Organizers , scattered throughout the crowds , picked up trash and provided water to the marchers .
As the temperatures climbed , several people peeled off the march to find shade .
The National Weather Service said the day's high was 94 degrees .
The first of the protesters reached the Capitol about 12:30 p.m. and gathered around a stage .
Mariachi bands played , and organizers called out instructions on bullhorns .
The Rev. Warren Stewart of the First Institutional Baptist Church in Phoenix directed his comments to Obama : " God put you in the White House .
You are a person of color .
Stand with us . "
Richard Trumka , president of the AFL - CIO , spoke about the climate of fear Arizona 's immigration - enforcement law has created .
" Immigrants are not the cause of America 's problems , and ( Senate Bill ) 1070 is not the answer , " he said .
Eric Ruder , 40 , flew in to Tucson from Chicago after learning of the protest online last week and said the influx of protesters from around the country shows the nation 's interest in Arizona 's law .
" The criminalization of immigrants is a scary direction that this country is heading in , " Ruder said .
Protest organizers said Saturday that others from Texas , California and Washington state planned to participate .
Justin Akers Chacon , 38 , a college professor from San Diego , came to Phoenix Friday night with more than 100 people who slept on sleeping bags in a downtown warehouse provided by organizers .
" There was a seriousness and confidence that we 're all here for the right reasons , " he said .
Isabel Gareja , a member of the Coalici�n de Derechos Humanos , human - rights group , said in Spanish : " We 're going to resist .
Resistance is the word of the day . "
Arizona 's immigration law , signed by Gov. Jan Brewer April 23 , is set to take effect July 29 .
The law makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally .
It states that an officer engaged in a lawful stop , detention or arrest shall , when practicable , ask about a person 's legal status when reasonable suspicion exists that the person is in the U.S. illegally .
The law has sparked protests nationwide , boycotts of Arizona from other cities and groups and spurred a number of lawsuits challenging its legality .
The Department of Justice also is considering whether to challenge it .
Despite the rising opposition , polls have consistently indicated that the majority of Arizonans support the measure .
A rally in support of the law � Stand with Arizona � was held Saturday evening at Tempe Diablo Stadium , drawing more than 5,000 .
Derek Dauma , 37 , who lives near Steele Indian School Park , only had to stand along Third Street to share his view of the law .
He held a sign that read " Respect U.S. laws . "
" The system in general is broken .
Employers are not being punished for hiring illegal immigrants , " Dauma said .
" People coming here illegally is unfair to the people who 've waited years and years . "
For some protesters , the Arizona law hits particularly close to home .
Marlene Vazquez , 18 , said she came to the country illegally 16 years ago with her family .
They stood together at the park Saturday morning concerned about the impact the law could have on their lives .
Like many opponents of the bill , Vazquez is concerned that it will lead to police targeting Hispanic - looking residents in an effort to root out illegal immigrants .
" There 's no way that they 're not going to racially profile , " she said .
" How does someone look illegal ? "

Thursday is the feast of San Juan in my part of the world , a celebration of the start of summer that also traditionally marks the beginning of the gazpacho season .
And just in time :
My gazpacho garden is about to bear fruit .
Summer ’s sun is turning the tomatoes crimson .
They ’ll soon be gloriously ripe and sweet .
I ’ve got the first crinkly , thin - skinned green peppers and fat cucumbers , as well as the onions and garlic harvested earlier .
A jug of my own extra - virgin olive oil , a chunk of stale bread and tangy lemon juice complete the ingredient list for the season ’s first gazpacho .
The recipe is ever so simple .
I whirl the ingredients in a blender , sieve out the bits of skin and tomato seeds , thin the gazpacho slightly with cold water , then pour it into a tall glass and serve it neat — no restaurant - style garnishes .
My garden gazpacho is the perfect antidote to an Andalusian summer .
Cool and refreshing , it ’s a light lunch or an afternoon pick - me - up .
Gazpacho , in southern Spain , is older than tomatoes .
It probably derives from a Roman dish , a simple gruel of bread and oil .
The name “ gazpacho ” may come from the Latin caspa , meaning fragments or little pieces , referring to the bread crumbs that are an essential ingredient .
The Moorish - Arabic influence is evident too , especially in some of the variations on the basic theme , such as a white gazpacho made with ground almonds .

None of those forerunners of gazpacho contained tomatoes , considered basic today .
That ’s because tomatoes were unknown in Spain until after the discovery of the New World .
Gazpacho belongs especially to Andalusia , southern Spain .
Here day laborers working on big estates , in vineyards , olive plantations , citrus groves , wheat fields or cork forests received rations of bread and olive oil for their meals .
Bread soaked in water made a simple soup , to which was added oil , garlic and salt for flavor , plus whatever fresh vegetables were available — tomatoes , peppers and cucumbers in the summer .
Everything was pounded together in a mortar or dornillo , a large wooden bowl .
Gazpacho provided nourishment , quenched the thirst and sustained a body working in the hot sun .
From these peasant beginnings , gazpacho has become quite the cosmopolite , appearing on the menus of sophisticated restaurants in many parts of the world .
Recipes from abroad sometimes call for tomato juice , beef broth , ketchup or chile - hot salsa .
Unfortunately , something is lost in the translation — namely , the freshness of gazpacho made with raw ingredients .
This is not to say that you ca n’t experiment with the basic gazpacho .
For instance , chopped basil — which no self - respecting Andalusian housewife would add to gazpacho — is a nice addition , and a dash of piquant Tabasco adds pizazz .

Innovative chefs have had some fun with gazpacho , foaming it , gelling it , adding luxury ingredients such as shrimp and lobster .
Chef Dani García ( his Marbella restaurant , Calima , has one Michelin star and his tapas venture , La Moraga , will open in Manhattan this year ) , makes a cherry gazpacho garnished with a drift of queso fresco “ snow . ”
José Andrés , chef of the Bazaar restaurant in Los Angeles , attributes his very authentic gazpacho recipe to his wife , Patricia , who is from Andalusia .
He jazzes it up by using yellow and green tomatoes in place of red ones .
He also specifies Sherry vinegar to give the soup its tang and , in one version , a bit of sweet oloroso Sherry to balance the tartness .
If there is a single essential ingredient in gazpacho it is extra -virgin olive oil .
The oil contributes flavor and , in combination with bread , turns the cold soup into a thick , creamy emulsion .
Raw tomato puree is a reddish - pink in color , but the olive oil - bread emulsion turns it a pale , creamy orange .
Add even more bread in proportion to the tomatoes and omit the water and you achieve a thick gazpacho “ cream , ” called salmorejo or porra .
Salmorejo is served in individual ramekins as a starter , garnished with thin strips of Serrano ham and chopped hard - cooked egg .
It also makes a great party dip , accompanied by breadsticks and vegetable dippers .

The basic oil and bread emulsion is also the starting point for white gazpacho , such as ajo blanco con uvas , literally , “ white garlic with grapes . ”
Made with ground almonds , garlic , bread , olive oil and vinegar and garnished with grapes , this cold soup comes from the rich Moorish - Arabic heritage .
More than the sum of its parts , ajo blanco is both unusual and delicious .
Another white gazpacho , made with pine nuts instead of almonds , is thickened with egg .
And , for a non-traditional gazpacho , I use pureed avocados for the soup , with a garnish of diced tomatoes .
Speaking of garnishes , anyone who has visited Spain in the summer has likely sampled restaurant gazpacho , which usually is served accompanied with little dishes of chopped onions , peppers , cucumbers , tomatoes and croutons .
One year , when my garden produced an abundance of cucumbers , I invented a cucumber granita to garnish the gazpacho .
Other authentic touches are sprigs of mint , chopped egg , chopped apple or melon .
Flavorings are few — salt , but no pepper — garlic , cumin , sometimes sweet paprika — but never hot chile .

How cold is a cold soup ?
Gazpacho in the fields was made with cool spring water .
Even today , purists wo n’t put gazpacho in the fridge , as chilling damps down the sweetness and fragrance of fresh - picked tomatoes .
I serve gazpacho , made with cold water , without further chilling — but I refrigerate what ’s left for enjoying at a later time .
White gazpacho also can be served either room temperature or chilled .
I serve gazpacho in ceramic bowls , in mugs or , if diluted , in glasses .
Think of it as “ liquid salad , ” to be served as a starter or alongside a main course .
Gazpacho goes especially well with fried fish , with omelets or with foods from the grill .
It ’s often served as a merienda , an afternoon pick - me - up or snack .
I put chilled gazpacho in a Thermos to take on picnics , easy to serve in paper cups .
Gazpacho or ajo blanco shooters are great tapa party fare .
A Spanish refrain says , “ De gazpacho no hay empacho ” :
There ’s never too much gazpacho .
While my tomatoes are in season , I ’m happy to serve gazpacho every day .
By the end of summer , when the tomatoes are gone , I ’ll be gathering almonds and cutting grapes to make ajo blanco .
And , in the winter , there ’s hot gazpacho with sour oranges — but that ’s another story .

As far as I can tell , substantial part of Qanswers in current formula is problematic :
( log ( Qviews ) * 4 ) + (( Qanswers * Qscore ) / 5 ) + sum( Ascores )
About 1/3 of the answers studied here ( 83 of total 254 ) have score less than 1/100 of top voted post in respective question .
Given the high amount of views and votes on studied questions , it looks like when sufficient evidence is obtained for the question , time comes to re-check ( Qanswers * Qscore ) part of the algorithm to make sure that it still reflects the underlying assumption :
one assumes if there are lots of answers , there will be a lot more voting on the answers , too
The observed score difference ( " less than 1/100 of top voted post " ) clearly indicates that not all the answers satisfy above assumption .
Algorithm assumes voting on the answers but the evidence strongly indicates readers do n't vote on some of these ; thus ( Qanswers * Qscore ) part becomes fake .
Given that questions checked were ones with tens thousands views , insultingly low score indicates that assuming these answers to be popular would n't even be in the ballpark .
Still , the formula pumps these into Qanswers value , as if it is something everyone would be happy to read ( hint : it is n't ) .
Consider tuning the formula to make it closer match observed voting evidence ( when it becomes sufficient to learn from ) with the initial assumption of " a lot more voting on the answers " .
When question and answers gain a lot of votes , begin ignoring answers with low / non-positive score .
Or better yet , ignore answers scored less than some reasonable fraction ( eg 1/10 ) of the top one .
For the sake of completeness , another option would be to keep current algorithm and instead modify " feature specification " to better match the formula .
Although I honestly can not imagine how apparently useless answers can be explained / specified as contributing to " hotness score " in a meaningful way .
Note there is a feature request at Prog.SE meta to test a less ' klingonic ' modification of the formula :
Yet another indication of issues with current formula is how easy it is to manipulate hotness score .
In my recent experiments with a particular typical hot question , it looked like changing direction of a single question vote ( up - > down - > up ) has been causing changes in score by 10 - 15 points .
This is because any question vote is leveraged by amount of answers .
Consolidated , 2 - 3 voters can " swing " the score by 30 - 50 ( for comparison , current top screen at collider shows me 6 questions scored from 77 to 38 ) .
Similarly , adding / removing an answer ( any answer ) in a highly voted question offers even more possibilities for cheating , because of it being leveraged by question score .
If it was a game , I would call this somewhat boring because of poor game balance .
Actually , one can say that sort of unconscious coordinated manipulation already happens quite regularly , when hotness lemmings attracted by titles shown on top of collider land on the questions and begin posting multiple zero - effort braindumps , making formula pump the score even higher , which attracts more lemmings that break things further and so on .
" My particular concern is the poisonous effect these mis-answers have on questions , making interesting and well presented problems look the same as non-constructive popularity contests . " ( quote source ) .
For the record , in August 2010 algorithm has been tweaked as follows :
Succeeding questions from the same site are penalized by increasing amounts .
So , the first question from SO in the list gets multiplied by 1.0 , the second by 0.98 , the third by 0.96 , etc )
Community wiki questions are penalized , to keep the entire home page from being Poll - type questions
The benefit of many answers is capped at 10 , and we only look at the score of the top 3 answers
We only degrade based on question age , and not the last update date on a question , so questions do n't pop back up to the top every time they 're edited
Views are not counted towards the score
The core of the formula ( without the site - based degrading or traffic scaling ) is : ( MIN ( AnswerCount , 10 ) * QScore ) / 5 + AnswerScore
-------------------------------------------------
MAX( QAgeInHours + 1 , 6 ) ^ 1.4
Yeah " benefit of many answers is capped at 10 " , how cute .
Even with tweaked formula , stuffing 8 useless , zero - score answers into +50 question would have the same effect as giving 80 upvotes to answers .
At +200 question , this would be like giving 320 ( over three hundreds ! ) upvotes to answers .
No wonder than even with above tweak , some questions stick to the top of the hot questions list forever .

It just wo n't start , even after several ( time consuming ! ) re-installs .
I 'll try to continue development on my secondary system , still it wo n't be as easy because of missing configurations and dependencies .
My search for a job also consumes some of my spare time .
Anyway , I wish everyone a successful 2008 , and I even have a small suprise upon my sleeves : SoundLib will be hosted on soundlib .
net with the next release .
- Stefan - 9th of November 2007 SoundLib 3 beta released

Go directly to SoundLib 3 - Stefan - 28th of December 2006
Read the c't magazine
The c't magazine published one of my articles .
The article " Am Anfang stand die Raubkopie " is in the issue of 1/07 on page 84 .
It reports about the demo scene -- people who not only inspired not only mine but also many others work .
While earlier being a race about challenging the hardware , today the presentation is what it 's all about .
The scene evolved from cracker groups in the early 80's and later splitted apart from illegal activities .
Many companies were founded by scene members -- Futuremark ( 3DMark ) , Remedy ( " Max Payne " ) and Starbreeze Studios ( " The Chronicles of Riddick " ) , just to name a few .
The research and writing down took me three months , the publishing took even longer .
So , buy the c't and enjoy reading the article -- feedback welcome !
... and soon ...
The work on SoundLib 2 continues .
There should be a new release for the beginning of 2007 , probably being followed by another release later .
The current new features , based upon the current development status : OGG support
Matrix mixer -- multichannel sound , for input ( OGG , WAV ) as well as output
Support of C++ with the same class model ( and no support anymore for the good ol ' BP7 ... rest in peace ! )
Higher quality sample interpolation
Improved class model ( clearly more simple initialization )
Multi channel samples ( only mono was possible yet ) ... and a happy new year to all visitors !

Have fun !
- Stefan - 24th of December 2005 Ein weiteres Jahr ...
It 's a sin not updating the page a whole year .
There are actually things that have changed here , but not to the usual viewer 's eye .
More to happen next year -- a new content management is in work , which means less work for more content .
A new , big article will follow and there are even other plans .
Merry Xmas and a happy new year to everybody !
- Stefan - 18th of July 2004
The beloved lazyness ...
Somehow there happened a few things on this page , but it seems I was n't able to document this .
two new images are available at " Art " , probably even soon some more
a new article about PGP in connection with Thunderbird added by a fellow ( german only )
a newly designed page for a customer is watchable under Webdesign / preferences ( german only ) - Stefan - 4th of March 2004 Dozens of new MOD's !!
You can find a good bunch of new MOD 's in coding / MODs .
Have fun listening !
- Stefan - 3rd of March 2004 SoundLib 2 is back !!
The turn - away from the world of DOS is upon the time , and hence SoundLib 2 does also support Delphi and Free Pascal for Windows .
It was quite a piece of work , and it also will be for the future .
The current release is an alpha-version , and should make taste for more , or simply help to find into its system .
Release notes as well as SL2 itself are available under " coding " .
Expect also an excerpt of my current MOD - collection these days .... - Stefan - 30th of September 2003 Updates ...
Believe it or not , there are actually two updates ...
On one hand , the article " Phonomenal " , for which I still receive positive response , got an update .
There are additional pictures while the current pictures have been replaced by some with a much higher quality .
As reference for MIDI playback , Descent I has been chosen , which is far more qualified for this task .
The IBM MFC got another sample .
Some content - related inconsistencies have been removed .
On the other hand , you 'll find another picture under " art " , which is a continuity of my current photo series .
Have fun with rummage !
- Stefan - 18th of September 2003 News ...
One could think , the owner of this page just lies around and lets the sun improve his tan these term holidays .
Well , ( almost ) right !
But as this kind of unproductivity just keeps getting more and more annyoing , something is going on here !
You 'll find 3 (! ) new pictures on the art page , shot with my new digi-cam .
Actually , I have even more of them , but before presenting everything , I have to improve some page internals in order to show them .
So visiting more often could be useful right now ... - Stefan - 30th of March 2003 UPDATE
The article has been extended by some information , samples , images and links again .
This should be the last one for the next time ... have fun !
- Stefan - 12th of March 2003 Article available ...
Right now the english version of the article on PC sound development has been uploaded .
Enjoy ! - Stefan - 8th of March 2003 Finally ...!
Another article .
No doubt , it was about time for an update .
Not without pride I can announce my next article - about the evolution of PC Sound .
In some way I have to disappoint our english readers for this moment .
The article is currently only available in the German language .
However , the English translation will follow in a few days !
That 's all about it ?!...
No .
If I do n't run out of time , it 's very likely that one or two other articles will follow pretty soon .
Not again another year waiting for the next one ; ) . - Stefan - 7th of December 2002 Celebration , joy , happyness ...
Finally !
I 've finally done the switch to a new provider for Crossfire Designs !
No just 10 K per second , the database does n't wait for finishing its coffee - break , and anyhow and anyway .
Despite the fact that my new Webhoster is kinda bit overeager , and does everything NOW ( what actually caused a bit disappointment in one case , which was n't finished ) , I can't complain yet .
I do n't wanna do any advertisement here , so ask me via mail , if interest .
And before I go crazy in my raptures , I just wanna warn you , ' cause soon there will be something done on this page .
Probably not referring my units , but some other parts of this page .
Until then my best wishes !

Ever heard of “ Fracking ” ..?
I had n’t before yesterday .
In this video from The Daily Show , “ Gasland ” director Josh Fox talks with Jon Stewart about the toxic materials from hydraulic fracturing that are turning up in people ’s water supplies .
Vodpod videos no longer available .
The process is called hydraulic fracturing , or “ Fracking ” .
It is a process of pumping more than a million gallons of water along with a mix of sand and fluids [ pdf ] deep into the Earth to break apart the rock below and free the gas locked inside it .
It ’s a technique that ’s been used for decades to extract oil and natural gas from shale , but it has seen a growth spurt in recent years , thanks to technological advances , like hydrofracking , that have made it more competitive economically .
This article from “ Speakeasy ” ( WSJ ) goes into more detail on this new documentary “ Gasland ” :
: : : : : : : : : :
The director of the experimental theater group the International WOW Company , Fox first became interested in the subject of natural gas after the Pennsylvania native was asked to lease his land for drilling .
The inquiry led Fox to embark on a multi-state investigation of the natural gas companies , and their use of hydraulic fracturing , or fracking .
The process involves pumping large amounts of water deep underground , fracturing rock to release natural gas .
When asked about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , Fox says he sees definite parallels to the natural gas industry .
“ It ’s the same sort of situation in terms of the regulation atmosphere , ” he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal .
“ We ’ve seen natural gas blowouts all over the country , and people are abandoning their homes because the industry wo n’t take responsibility for their actions . ”
Fox added that oftentimes individuals who either invest in natural gas or middle - managers who work at natural gas companies are shocked by what they see in his film .
Fox ’s documentary has ruffled a few feathers and several natural gas - affiliated organizations are claiming that Fox has his facts wrong .
But Fox says all the facts speak for themselves and can be looked up .
“ The natural gas industry ’s PR system is so great , many people believe that natural gas is a good solution to climate change , ” he said .
“ But it ’s a dirty polluting fossil just like the others . ”
The documentary film “ Gasland ” premieres on HBO this coming Monday .
( Wish I got HBO .. )
For more detailed on the process of “ Fracking ” ( Hydraulic fracturing ) , go here .
NPR did an interview with director Josh Fox on this “ Fracking ” and his new film .
Here ’s a segment of the discussion that caught my eye ( the entire interview is quite interesting ) :
[…] FLATOW :
And the chemical they inject underground , the formula for that is secret …
Mr. FOX : Yeah , highly proprietary .
Well , not everything is secret .
Their – the fracking fluid is something – there are many different chemicals in the process that they use over time .
At first , they thicken the fluid with gelants and then they turn it around and turn it into a liquid .
And it ’s very , very – there ’s no friction at all .
So they ’re injecting all these different chemicals down on the wellbore – about 596 that we know about – a lot of which are proprietary .
We do n’t know the chemical compositions .
The industry is not releasing what those chemical compositions are .
They ’re saying it ’s like the special formula for Coca - Cola .
But this is , you know , being injected underground and left there by the millions of gallons .
And we know that most of the stuff is toxic : carcinogens , neurotoxins , other – endocrine disruptors , things that are – can – that can really be very harmful in small , small quantities .
FLATOW : The FRAC Act , which is lying in committee in Congress , would force them to release all the information about what ’s actually in that …
Mr. FOX : Yeah .
It would force the disclosure of the chemicals and reregulate the industry under the Safe Drinking Water Act .
They were exempted from Safe Drinking Water Act in 2005 by the 2005 energy bill which was a baby of Dick Cheney and their energy taskforce .
And , you know , in fact , hydraulic fracturing is exempted from most of our most basic environmental laws …
FLATOW : It shows it right there in the legislature ?
Mr. FOX : In the 2005 energy bills , it says right there .
Yes .
This is the Halliburton loophole .
It is the exemption for hydraulic fracturing to the Safe Drinking Water Act .
But they ’re also exempt from the Clean Air Act , the Clean Water Act , which controls storm water runoff and the Superfund Act .
So they do n’t have – they ’re not liable to clean up their mess .
And also , the Community Right to Know Provisions .
I mean , the list goes on and on . [.. ]
Seriously , read the entire interview .
Cheney … Halliburton … Brother ..
There was a discussion on “ Fracking ” on Democracy Now !
Want more information ?
An excellent graphic on the “ Fracking ” process from Pro Publica :
Try reading more in - depth at Huffington Post .
This is a very good article on “ Gasland ” by Bill Chameides who is Dean of Duke ’s Nicholas School of the Environment .
He talks lots of details and history on this drilling process for natural gas , and then ends with this :
For me one of the most compelling moments of the movie comes near the end .
Josh [ the director of the documentary ] is in the office of an official from a state environmental protection agency asking him to do something to stop fracking in his backyard .
Even though he will not allow drilling on his property , others likely will .
The official says there ’s nothing he can do — it ’s the price we have to pay to get the energy we need .
When pressed further , the official gives Josh his business card .
“ Call me if you have any problems , ” he advises — in other words , the industry is going to be allowed to frack , but after the creek you live on is polluted and once your drinking water becomes unhealthy to drink , let us know and we ’ll be there for you .
“ And then what ?
Build me another creek in my backyard , ” asks Josh .
The official shrugs his shoulders and walks out of the room .
This is a map showing where in the USA “ Fracking has been and continues to be used :
Do we as the people who LIVE in this country have any say at all about what happens TO this country and our environment ?
Corporations seem hell - bent on destroying the land in their race to get wealthy ( wealthier ) .
They have bought and paid for our country ’s lawmakers in order to ensure their success and cover their asses , with no consideration to the land , water , air , or the people .
They fight any attempt at rules and regulations .
What can we do ?
Is this really the price we must pay for energy ?
The timing could n’t be better for this film to come out .
Perhaps we are really close to finally doing something to stop the wanton destruction of our environment , of our world .
One can hope ..

One of the great pleasures of last week was hearing Jack Straw speaking on the Today programme in that patient , reasonable way of the true autocrat , and suddenly realising that I never have to pay attention to him again .
Nor for a very long time will I have to listen to Mandelson , Campbell , Clarke , Smith , Reid , Falconer , Blunkett , Woolas or Blears : they 're history and the New Labour project to extend state control into so many areas of our lives is incontestably over .
This is not merely a hopeful inference drawn from the change of government .
The coalition agreement makes an explicit commitment to liberty and privacy , rolls back state intrusion , restores freedoms and puts a brake on the erosion of rights .
There are omissions , of course , but overall this is a moment to cherish because along with specific guarantees , it is clear that the tone of government has changed and that the influence of the new administration may extend right down to the rude and officious exercise of petty authority that flourished under New Labour .
The Queen 's speech , now being drafted , will establish a Freedom or Great Repeal bill – the title has not yet been chosen – as a major part of the coalition 's legislative programme .
All the areas detailed in the agreement between the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives , such as the abolition of ID cards and the children 's database ( ContactPoint database ? ? ) , the further regulation of CCTV and the restoration of right to protest will be in it .
Measures that were n't in the published agreement will reassert the right to silence and protect people against the huge number of new powers of entry into the home allowed by Labour .
Separate from this will be a complete review of terror legislation that will assess 28 - day detention , control orders , section 44 stop and search powers , the harassment of photographers , the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act , and its amendments , which sanctioned 650 agencies and local authorities to carry out undercover surveillance operations on , for example , people suspected of making dubious school applications for their children , eel fishermen in Poole harbour , punt operators in Cambridge , depressed police officers and malingering council workers .
The strategy is to keep debate on the terror laws apart from the Freedom Act , which in one fell swoop will repeal all the anti-libertarian laws that have accumulated on the statute book in what was described to me as " an absolutely comprehensive fashion " .
The government does not want discussion of terror laws to obstruct the swift repeal of Labour 's attack on liberty in other areas .
Clearly , this all has to be watched very closely indeed – a lot has yet to be decided and there will be pressures from the civil servants , police , GCHQ and MI5 on such things as internet surveillance and phone intercepts .
European plans for data collection and surveillance are a particular worry .
But the essential point is that this exciting turn of events would not have been possible under a Labour - Lib Dem coalition or a Conservative minority government .
It is a rare stroke of luck for the interests of liberty that the coalition allows the prime minister , David Cameron , to embrace this Lib Dem policy with open arms and ignore the reservations of the law - and - order nuts on his right .
This is a palpable benefit of the new coalition government , which should go some way to changing the minds of all those who protest that Labour was qualified to retain power by forming a " progressive alliance " with Liberal Democrats .
Seems to me these people are still in the slow lane ; or they have n't come to terms with the way Labour savaged liberty , while claiming support from progressives as its moral entitlement .
At the end of an historic week , that looks very much like the old politics , because it involves a denial of the facts .
Four years ago , the day after an email exchange about liberty between Tony Blair and I was published in the Observer , the bad cop home secretary , Charles Clarke , set about briefing against this newspaper 's campaign and made a speech at the LSE in which he accused me , and others , of spreading " pernicious , even dangerous poison " .
That was OK – Clarke 's invective had the opposite of the desired effect – but it occurred to me then that I should think about what was behind the attack on liberty .
So I wrote a list of reasons , which I still have .
First of all , people such as Clarke , Reid , Straw and Blunkett had been involved in far - left politics in their youth and from those days they retained a belief in the inherent wisdom of the state and saw it as the only real force for good .
This accounted for the largely undetected seam of authoritarianism that ran through New Labour .
Second , New Labour was a quasi - revolutionary movement that had fallen in love with the market and had no coherent ideology other than a belief in modernisation .
These were people who were impatient with history and the great achievements of such things as Magna Carta , the Bill of Rights and so forth .
The struggle for liberty seemed to mean nothing to them .
All that was new and modern was good : the old had nothing to tell them .
Third , New Labour displayed a deep pessimism about ordinary people , which had quietly replaced the traditional compassion of the old Labour party .
How this was allowed to happen is difficult to say –perhaps it was the brutalising effect of absorbing so much from Thatcherism .
At any rate , that jaundiced view inspired ministers and civil servants to draft legislation that removed defendants ' rights , to abandon faith in rehabilitation and redemption , and to assume ordinary people would always act in their own interests rather than those of society .
If you want an explanation for the looming mistrust behind so many of the databases and all the other expensive paraphernalia of suspicion it is this pessimism , which has spread through the media and society to the point where we think much less of ourselves and are disposed to believe the worst will always happen .
In that 2006 speech , Charles Clarke ridiculed this sentence of mine : " The presumption of innocence is no longer a fixed legal principle . "
The point I was making was that in narrow terms the government had undermined legal rights in such things as control orders , where a suspect is held under conditions of house arrest without being found guilty of a crime , or being told the evidence against him , and that more widely , everything from football banning orders to 28 - day detention without charge , the use of Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( Ripa ) , terror laws and mass surveillance of communications and movement offended the principle that law - abiding citizens should be respected by the state .
Convictions were made easier and we reached a point where mere accusation seemed to become an indicator of guilt .
Mark George QC – a left - leaning lawyer from a Manchester chambers – wrote passionately this year about the introduction of hearsay evidence and effects of introducing civil standards of proof ( the balance of probabilities ) to replace requirements in a criminal case ( sure beyond reasonable doubt ) in anti-social behaviour orders , serious crime orders and gang - related offences .
The culture of suspicion and of the state always knowing best led not simply to a weakening of justice , but to a process in which the public was gradually infantilised : we were to be protected by health and safety regulations and chivvied by various new manifestations of authority in high - visibility jackets .
People returning from the supermarket in Brighton had their wine confiscated for being in possession of alcohol in a public place .
A 75 - year - old blind man whose guide dog fouled in a field was handed a £ 40 fixed penalty notice .
The UK Borders Agency started asking people where they were travelling to and why , and whether they had anything in their luggage that would be of interest to it .
The same agency started locking up thousands of innocent children in detention centres for asylum seekers , a seriously damaging practice that the new government – thank God – is going to abandon .
This mass disrespect for the public played out in parliament , where elected representatives were treated as an inconvenience , sidelined or bullied by Labour whips to pass laws that were clearly against the interests of transparent government .
The Inquiries Act 2005 , for example , changed the law so that official reports were presented to a minister , not parliament , and enabled ministers to suppress evidence , change the terms of the inquiry and dismiss the chair .
I cannot see this law as being anything other than deliberately hostile to good government .
Thinking about the five years of this campaign , I realise that the most agonising part of it was the sense that few people were really paying attention , and that Labour politicians could dismiss those who were as cranks and hysterics .
This fear was behind the setting up of the Convention on Modern Liberty last year by Anthony Barnett and me , and the commission of a survey of all the laws that attacked liberty by University College law students , which we published as he Abolition of Freedom Act .
The same fear compelled David Davis MP to resign during the previous summer and campaign against 42 - day pre-charge detention and the database state , a gesture that cost him politically but which was critical in the defence of liberty .
This vindication is almost as much fun as not listening to Jack Straw .
The programme of measures listed in the agreement between the governing parties " to reverse the substantial erosion of liberties under the Labour government " proves for once and all that we were n't making it up .
We are very fortunate that the election played out the way it did .
Five years ago today , on May 1st , 2005 OASIS approved Open Document Format 1.0 as an OASIS Standard .
I ’d like to take a few brief minutes to reflect on this milestone , but only a few .
We ’re busy at work in OASIS making final edits to ODF 1.2 .
We ’re in our final weeks of that revision and it is “ all hands on deck ” to help address the remaining issues so we can send it out for final public review .
But I hope I can be excused for a short diversion to mark this anniversary .
I wo n’t talk much about the 5 years since ODF 1.0 was approved .
The ODF Alliance and their “ ODF Turns Five ” [ pdf ] does a good job there .
But I would like to talk a little about ODF and why it is so important that it came about when it did , why it was so timely .
To fully appreciate the significance of ODF you need to understand the market climate in which it was created , and to understand that you need to understand a little of the history of word processors .
The following time line illustrates the introduction dates of word processor applications over the past 30 years or so .
You will notice some familiar and not - so - familiar names :
We can divide this time line into four time periods , each one driven by a pivotal development .
The first period was the “ Pioneering Age ” , when the first steps toward the modern word processor were taken .
This was research - driven , primarily by Xerox PARC , who developed the first WYSIWYG word processor , Bravo as well as the first GUI word processor , Gypsy .
Except for the line editor vi , which still has some adherents among the troglodyte cave dwellers , none of these first - generation applications survived , though their influence did .
For example , Charles Simonyi , after working on Bravo at Xerox , went to Microsoft to develop Word .
( Ah , the days before software patents … )
The next wave of word processor applications , the “ Personal Computer Age ” came in the 1980s with the new platforms of the IBM PC ( 1981 ) and the Apple Macintosh ( 1984 ) .
New platforms require apps , either new or ported , and you will see several familiar names introduced in that fruitful period .
Then we have a gap .
From around 1990 to 1999 we do not see many new word processor introductions .
This was the “ Lost Decade ” .
New word processor introductions died off .
Unchallenged by competition , even Microsoft Word advanced relatively little in this decade , compared to innovations before or since .
A few forces were at play here .
First , there was a platform shift , from MS - DOS to MS - Windows 3.1 ( 1991 ) and Windows 95 ( 1995 ) .
Few companies were able to successfully port their applications to Windows .
Also , the market changed significantly with the introduction of Microsoft Office as a suite of applications .
Suddenly it was not enough to have a good word processor , say WordPerfect , or a good spreadsheet , say 1 - 2 - 3 , or a good presentation package , say Harvard Graphics .
To be competitive you needed to have all three suite components .
And few companies did .
Finally , there was the preferential access to operating system technical information Microsoft gave to their own applications teams , allowing Microsoft apps to run better on Microsoft operating systems than their competitors could .
The decade closed with word processor competition wiped out .
Analysts stopped tracking and reporting market share data when Office ’s share exceeded 95 % .
And file formats ?
There were the binary DOC , XLS and PPT .
And the file format documentation was only available under license from Microsoft , and only if you agreed not to make a competing word processor .
That was the shape of the market around 2000 .
Or more properly the state of the Microsoft monopoly .
So what happened that made ODF possible ?
In one word , the Internet .
Well , not so much the technology of the internet itself , but widespread access to the internet via the web .
This enabled the open source movement as we know it today to scale .
Although open source existed before the web , unless you were at a major university or research centers , sharing source code and working collaboratively on software was very difficult .
But with widespread access to email , ftp , web , eventually version control , we had the tools needed to scale open source from small teams to large teams .
And to write a competitor to Microsoft Word you need a substantial team .
Why was open source so important ?
Because no rational profit - seeking entity would compete against a monopoly , especially one maintained by restricting access to technical information needed to interoperate .
Lacking effective government regulation , the market was revived by open source .
You see the same thing happen with Linux and with web browsers .
The other thing the internet and the web brought was a new platform based on open standards , HTML , CSS , XML , Javascript , allowing an interactive style of web application called “ AJAX ” .
And since this new platform was based on open standards , Microsoft was less effective in preventing competition in this area .
Certainly they tried .
From ActiveX to Silverlight , from poor standards support in Internet Explorer , to the infamous memo by Bill Gates in 1998 : “ One thing we have got to change in our strategy – allowing Office documents to be rendered very well by other peoples browsers is one of the most destructive things we could do to the company .
We have to stop putting any effort into this and make sure that Office documents very well depends on PROPRIETARY IE capabilities ” , they tried , but ultimately failed to “ take back the web ” and turn it into a proprietary Microsoft platform .
With the new web application platform came new web - based word processors , some of which are charted above .
The net effect is that since 2000 or so we have a new diversity of word processors , open source , web - based , even the revival of commercial competition .
It was against this backdrop , the history of competition and diversity all but wiped out but then restored in the new millennium , that ODF was born .
Today every word processor of note supports ODF , including Microsoft Word .
As Microsoft ’s National Technology Director , and former CIO of Washington State , Stuart McKee said , “ ODF has clearly won “ .
We ’ve scaled the steep walls of monopoly and planted a new flag .
Our former opponents are now our colleagues , working with us on ODF 1.2 .
We ’ve shown we can win .
But now we need to show that we can rule .
This is the challenge .
We need to continue to evolve ODF to meet user needs — and these are diverse needs — as well as accommodate a wide range of application models , from traditional heavy - weight desktop applications , to mobile apps , to web based apps , while realizing that these platforms themselves are shifting and possibly converging .
Standards advance at glacial speed , while technological and competitive forces move at faster speeds .
Allowing flexibility and extensibility while at the same time preserving interoperability among ODF implementations — this is a hard task , and one that is not entirely technological .
The key value of ODF is to support interoperability in a market of diverse applications .
This is the choice that users want .
But enough of the reflection .
Time to get back to my work on ODF 1.2 .
I need to figure out linear depreciation according to the French accounting system so we can specify the AMORDEGRC spreadsheet function properly .

Unlimited , all - you - can - eat wireless data was a beautiful thing for Apple devices on AT&T , delivering streams of Pandora , YouTube videos , a million tweets , and hundreds of webpages without worry .
And now it 's dead .

AT&T's new , completely restructured mobile data plans for both iPhones and iPads have officially launched the era of pay - per - byte data , which we 've known was coming .
We just hoped it would take a little longer .
It 's the anti-Christmas .
Advertisement
AT&T is likely just the first , since carriers rarely do anything alone ( like when everybody launched unlimited voice calling in lockstep ) , and Verizon 's CTO has rumbled that plans with " as much data as you can consume is the big issue that has to change . "
And so it is .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
If you look at the costs per megabyte , you can see how , despite the fact AT&T is pitching the availability of lower priced plans as a value move , you actually are paying more for less .
( Update : Corrected chart , moved a decimal place . )
Advertisement
Under AT&T's old iPhone and smartphone plans , $ 30 / month bought you truly unlimited data .
With their new plans for smartphones , arriving June 7 ( not coincidentally , the day of Steve Jobs ' WWDC keynote ) the confusingly named DataPlus offers 200MB of data for $ 15 a month , while DataPro gives you 2GB for $ 25 .
With DataPlus , if you run over 200MB you get another 200MB for $ 15 .
But , AT&T tells us that if you 're running over the 200MB limit , you can actually switch to the beefier 2GB DataPro completely pain - free ( no ETFs or any of that business ) , and then switch back to the skinnier plan " over time . "
With DataPro , if you run over 2GB , you get another 1GB of data for $ 10 , ad infinitum .
So , if you use 5 GB of data , you 're looking at a $ 55 bill for data .
Tethering for the iPhone is here , finally !
Hurray !
Right ?
Wrong .
First , consider that the old , non-iPhone tethering option offered you 5GB of tethering data for an extra $ 30 a month .
The new plan charges you $ 20 extra to use the same 2 GB pool of data for tethering .
You are not buying extra data .
You are simply paying extra to use it for tethering .
Advertisement
Let me repeat that : AT&T is charging you an additional twenty dollars a month based purely on how you use your data .
This is bullshit , plain and simple .
Advertisement
Why does it matter how you use that 2GB ?
Why does it cost extra to use it in a slightly different manner , if you 're paying for it all the same ?
It 's asburdity — especially when you consider the basic math .
Under the old plan , you paid $ 60 a month for unlimited data , plus 5GB worth of tethering .
Under the new plan , you will pay $ 45 for 2 GB of data , total .
Advertisement
When you break out the dollar - per - byte value , showing just how much data you get per dollar , it becomes clear how outrageous the new pricing schemes are , whatever AT&T murmurs about how much data 98 percent of users actually consume .
( Felix Salmon sharply explains further how AT&T potentially screws even normal , non -data - hogging people with these new plans . )
The new plans apply to the iPad as well .
Meaning the no-contract $ 30 unlimited data plan , the plan both Apple and AT&T pitched so hard , assuring us that we would never have to worry about data or contracts , is no more .
If that $ 30 - whenever - you - want - it unlimited data was a part of your calculus in buying the 3G iPad — it was part of mine — you 've effectively been baited - and - switched .
They promised one thing , and in just two months , it 's gone .
I suppose that 's the downside of not having a contract with a multi-billion dollar corporation — you 're free to ditch them , but they 're free to screw you in return .
Advertisement
There is a way out , though it 's really more like a way in , since it requires you to dive more securely into the vice grip of AT&T .
If you already have an unlimited smartphone data plan and you renew your contract after June 7 , as long as you do n't change your plan , you can keep on keepin ' on with your unlimited plan .
In other words , you can get a new smartphone , but keep the same plan — then you 're grandfathered in with unlimited data .
Same deal with the iPad :
If you start an unlimited data plan before June 7 , and let it keep automatically renewing , you 'll keep unlimited data .
If you add the $ 20 tethering option after June 7 , though , you move to the new plans ( which obviously screws iPhone owners interested in tethering ) .
If you do n't already have an unlimited smartphone data plan , and buy one after June 7 , you 'll get one of the new plans .
If you come to AT&T after June 7 , you 'll get one of the new plans .
If you start a new iPad 3G data plan after June 7 , you 'll get one of the new plans .
( Here 's a bit more on various scenarios and what 'll happen with different configurations . )
Advertisement
So , what 'll be ?
Tie yourself up more tightly with AT&T to preserve your data privileges , or join this brave new world , where you pay for every byte you eat ?
Any hopes you could 've possibly had for unlimited 4G , you might as well shred them now .
It 's true , for most people ( 98 percent of users , says AT&T ) , 2GB a month might be fine — I 've only used 1GB on my iPad 3G , even after streaming a ton of movies with the intent of killing my battery .
And I 'm not opposed to metered internet , per se .
But I am opposed to higher costs per megabyte , BS charges for tethering , and broken iPad promises .
And there 's a principle at stake here , dammit .

Communications Minister Stephen Conroy has reiterated the Government ’s support for its mandatory internet filter policy after the change in Prime Minister and has slammed proposed amendments by Senator Kate Lundy that would allow Australians to opt in or out of the technology .
“ We have got an election commitment to deliver , ” Conroy told journalists in a doorstop interview in Sydney this afternoon ( see video ) .
“ Just because [ Greens Senator ] Scott Ludlam says it ’s been shelved , does n’t mean it ’s true . ”
Conroy reiterated the election commitment statement when asked whether he had spoken to new Prime Minister Julia Gillard about Lundy ’s proposed amendments to the filter legislation .
Asked about his personal views of the amendments , Conroy had a stronger statement .
“ I ’m not into opting in to child porn , ” he said .
The Minister said consultation around the filter project had taken a little bit longer than the Government had hoped , but it would still be introducing the filter legislation in the second half of 2010 .
Asked whether the timing of the Federal election could affect the passage of the legislation , Conroy said it would be up to Gillard to determine the timing of the vote .
Conroy was also asked whether he had participated in any negotiations regarding the controversial data retention regime being considered by the Attorney - General ’s Department , which could see ISPs required to store records pertaining to Australians ’ email , telephone calls and web browsing habits .
“ No , it ’s actually Rob McClelland ’s portfolio , ” he said , referring to the Federal Attorney - General .
Another topic of interest from the press was the status of the Government ’s telecommunications reform legislation , which deals with the break - up of Telstra and other matters such as the introduction of stronger consumer safeguards into the telco sector .
Conroy said he was working with Senator Steve Fielding to win his support for the bill , with the Family First parliamentarian to receive briefings from Telstra and NBN Co. Conroy said he hoped that Fielding would support the bill now that Telstra and NBN Co had come to an agreement about the terms under which Telstra would transfer its customers into the NBN and shut down its copper network .
“ I spoke to him a couple of times last week .
He wants to look at the overall package now , with the amendments , and make a decision , ” said Conroy .
“ We ’re providing all the information that we can . ”
The lady in green to the right of Conroy in the video is his press secretary , Suzie Brady .

The ball - shaped pollen that brings misery to allergy sufferers
They may look like a bizarre pair of tennis balls , but these pink orbs can make Wimbledon hell for allergy sufferers .
That is because this stunning 3D picture actually shows flower pollen that has been magnified a million times .
The Passion flower ( Passiflora caerulea ) pollen look like strange spongy tennis balls
It was captured by retired scientific photographer Steve Gschmeissner , who gathered the passion flower pollen near his home in Bedford .
He described the intricate structures as ' mesmerising . '
The 61 - year - old used a Scanning Electron Microscope ( SEM ) which is far more powerful than regular light microscopes that can only magnify by up to 1,000 times .
The SEM builds up extreme close - ups of anything that can fit inside the 4ft high device by bombarding it with electrons .
The technique is popular with scientists and artists , such as the American photographer David Scharf .
His close - up image of Japanese knotweed revealed pollen grains that look like puckered golf balls .
This is not a golf ball but the pollen from the Japanese knotweed that is choking British riverbanks
A conker shell ?
This is actually the pollen from the yellow daisy - like flower called Chamisso Arnica
Although beautiful up close , these pollen can spark dreaded hay fever in sufferers around the world .
Grass pollens and others like rape seed are well known causers of the allergic reaction as the tiny grains enter the respiratory system and trigger sneezes , itchy throats , running noses and watery eyes .
Allergy UK advises hayfever sufferers to keep windows closed especially in the early mornings and evenings when the pollen count is at its highest .
After becoming the first U.S. city to impose a special tax on medical marijuana dispensaries , Oakland soon could become the first to sanction and tax commercial pot growing operations .
Selling and growing marijuana remain illegal under federal law .
One of the authors , Councilman Larry Reid , said the proposal is more of an effort to bring in money than an endorsement of legalizing marijuana use _ although the council has unanimously supported that , too .
The city is facing a $ 42 million budget shortfall .
The tax voters approved last summer on the four medical marijuana clubs allowed under Oakland law is expected to contribute $ 1 million to its coffers in the first year , Reid said .
A tax on growers ' sales to the clubs could bring in substantially more , he said .
" Looking at the economic analysis , we will generate a considerable amount of additional revenues , and that will certainly help us weather the hard economic times that all urban areas are having to deal with , " Reid said .
How much money is at stake is n't clear because the tax rate and the number of facilities the law would allow have n't been decided .
A report prepared for AgraMed Inc. , one of the companies planning to seek a grower 's license , said its proposed 100,000 - square - foot - project near the Oakland Coliseum would produce more than $ 2 million in city taxes each year .
Given their likely locations in empty warehouses in industrial neighborhoods , the marijuana nurseries under consideration would have more in common with factories than rural pot farms .
Dhar Mann , the founder of an Oakland hydroponics equipment store called iGrow , and Derek Peterson , a former stock broker who now sells luxury trailers outfitted for growing pot as a co-founder of GrowOp Enterprises , have hired an architect to draft plans for two warehouses where marijuana would be grown and processed year - round .
Their vision includes using lights , trays and other equipment manufactured by iGrow and creating an online system that would allow medical marijuana dispensaries to see what pot strains are in stock , place orders and track deliveries .
" We are emulating the wine industry , but instead of ' from grape to bottle , ' it 's ' from plant to pipe , ' " Mann said .
" Or seed to sack , " offered Peterson .
The pair say they intend to operate the pot -growing business they have dubbed GROPECH _ Grass Roots of Oakland Philanthropic and Economic Coalition for Humanity _ as a not - for - profit .
They anticipate gross sales reaching $ 70 million a year .
After paying their expenses , they 'd funnel the money to local charities and non-profits through a competitive grant process .
The discussion in Oakland comes amid a statewide campaign to make California the first state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana and to authorize cities to sell and tax sales to adults .
Another Oakland pot entrepreneur , Richard Lee , is sponsoring a ballot measure voters will consider in November .
Lee , who owns two of Oakland 's four dispensaries as well as Oaksterdam University , a trade school for the medical marijuana industry , hopes to secure one of the cultivation permits , but he thinks the city should opt for having more , smaller sites instead of a handful of large ones .
" We need to legalize and tax and regulate the production side as well as the retail side , " Lee said .
" It 's a natural step . "
Other supporters say licensed growers would create hundreds of well - paying jobs .
The local branch of the United Food and Commercial Workers union already has signed up about 100 medical marijuana workers , and the growers are expected to have union shops as well , said Dan Rush , special operations director of UFCW Local 5 .
" I think Oakland 's intention is to make Oakland the leader and the trendsetter in how this industry can be effective in all of California , " Rush said .
Allowing medical marijuana to be grown openly also could give patients a better idea of where their pot is coming from .
Now , many growers hide their identities to avoid federal prosecution .
Oakland has already developed a reputation as one of the nation 's most pot-friendly cities .
Legislation on the city 's books includes a declaration of a public health emergency after federal crackdowns on marijuana clubs and a ballot measure instructing police to make marijuana their lowest enforcement priority .
Self - described " guru of ganja " Ed Rosenthal , a popular writer of pot - growing how - to books , lived in Oakland for 25 years before moving recently to a more affluent borough nearby .
He credits the city 's positive attitude toward marijuana to a critical mass of activists who have flocked there since the 1970s .
" The whole population of Oakland is just very progressive , " Rosenthal said .
" It 's the radicals who could n't afford Berkeley or San Francisco who all moved to Oakland . "

It would be really hard to beat the subtlety and cogency of this post by Noah Millman on Israel 's now - accelerating assisted suicide .
What Noah understands is that the pulverizing of Gaza , the embargo and the blockade are all enormously popular with the Israeli Jewish public , even as they immiserate and further embitter well over a million Palestinians .
Even the relatively secular left is on board :
I get notes all the time from family and friends in Israel .
These are generally liberal , secular people .
None of them are settlers .
None of them vote for Likud , to say nothing of parties further to the right .
Overwhelmingly , the sentiment among people I know in Israel was in favor of the Gaza war , in favor of the embargo and blockade , in favor of a policy of collective punishment against the people of Gaza .
And let 's not delude ourselves : the reason so many of us find the policy toward Gaza repellent is that it is quite obviously an attempt to collectively punish the people of Gaza for voting for Hamas , and then for lobbing missiles after Israel 's withdrawal .
That was the element of the 2009 war that was so horrifying to those of us on the outside , and that is why this blockade , designed to maintain total control over 1.5 million people ( and to benefit various Israeli economic sectors ) , is so disconcerting .
And it is , of course , self - reinforcing .
Has the war and the blockade hurt the idea of Hamas ?
Au contraire .
It has legitimized it .
When you end up killing civilians to prevent access to toys and wheelchairs , you have lost any desire to win the war of ideas and have retreated instead to the logic of force .
The Bush - Cheney administration is , in other words , alive and well ... and in Jerusalem , and backed by the opposition , because it is backed by the people .
This is one of the problems with democracy , as Millman notes :
STONE BREWING - BERLIN
Our dream to become the first American craft brewery to independently build , own and operate a brewery in Europe became a reality in 2016 .
The state of the art brewhouse sits under the same roof as Stone Brewing World Bistro & Gardens – Berlin , inside a historic 1901 building .
With up to 65 beers on tap , a stunning garden and a unique , eclectic menu , this destination restaurant in the Mariendorf neighborhood of Berlin is truly a thing of beauty !

Contributing editor Jim Richardson is a photojournalist recognized for his explorations of small - town life .
His photos appear frequently in National Geographic magazine .
So earlier I held forth about aerial photography and the virtues of preparation and foresight and just generally about being smart whenever you get the chance .
And I held forth as if that 's what I do all the time .
Today it 's time for confession and this is a pretty good picture to be confessing about .
There I was in Scotland , just happily looking through the viewfinder of a Nikon N90 ( sweet camera for the era ) mounted on my 80- 200 f/2.8
Nikkor sitting on a tripod , staring at Rusty and Tufty , two of the hulkiest Highland cattle I had ever seen .
I was there photographing whisky country for National Geographic Traveler magazine and so I was in the Highlands town of Dalwhinnie , home of the eponymous whisky .
Highland " coos " ( as the Scots like to call them ) are not exactly a profound photographic subject but I was n't feeling particularly profound , anyway .
I just could n't think of anything better to point my camera at .
When suddenly , out of nowhere , this guy with Mohawk hair and a leather jacket walked into my viewfinder .
I never saw him coming at all .
Hardly had a chance to pop my head over the camera to see if what I was seeing in the viewfinder was , in fact , real when he pulled out a loaf of white bread and started feeding Rusty and Tufty , who seemed to be well acquainted with the drill .
Recovering swiftly ( I try to do that when good fortune rescues me from my general incompetence ) , I hit the motor drive and let it run .
Just dumb blind luck !
Which I will never , ever turn down .
And I will always thanks the gods of fortune for shining their light on me for just a moment .
And I will never , ever get over the feeling of just how wonderful it is when this happens , when the world presents you with a moment of splendid reality , when the serendipity of life just seems so deliciously improbable and yet so absolutely right .
Well , there it is .
I did n't deserve it but I got it .
That 's my confession .
So I took the gift .
And from time to time I tell the story of my luck and it's always a good anecdote , the kind that we photographers love to embrace , that the picture came about by some incredible combination of chance and karma , and is n't it funny .
These anecdotes do make great stories .
But they do not make careers .
I scraped by that day .
Besides that one picture I was a pretty worthless photographer from dawn to dusk .
I love those lucky moments , but they scare me , too .
I 'm basically a nonfiction photographer .
I 'm utterly dependent on the world to keep supplying moments .
And I have the utmost faith that the world is utterly filled with such wonders .
What I 'm not sure of is whether I 'm always smart enough to see it when it 's right in front of me .
On that day in Scotland some giant arrow came down and pointed at this scene and said , " It 's a picture , dummy , punch the shutter button ! "
So I did .
And so I delivered on that assignment and lived to tell about it .
As the housing market continues to sputter , the real estate industry is increasingly split on the responsibilities of overextended and foreclosed homeowners .
On one side are the bankers , who say borrowers should be liable for what they owe .
On the other side are real estate agents , who say those who lost their houses should not be so burdened by debt that they cannot move on .
The differences have real financial consequences : bankers want to collect on billions of dollars in outstanding loans ; real estate agents want as many people as possible to return to the housing market .
For the first time , the debate is spilling into the realm of law making , with state legislators in California considering a bill that would redefine the obligations of many defaulting homeowners .
The efforts to shape the bill demonstrate how much is at stake  in California and the many other states with distressed real estate markets .
While the news about British Petroleum ’s ( BP ) Deepwater Horizon platform blowout in the Gulf of Mexico is on a 24 - hour news feed , it took a long boat ride and some serious slogging by John Vidal of The Observer ( UK ) to uncover a bigger and far deadlier oil spill near the village of Otuegwe in Nigeria ’s Niger Delta .
“ We lost our nets , huts and fishing pots .
This is where we fished and farmed .
We have lost our forest , ” Otuegwe ’s leader , Chief Promise , told Vidal .
The culprits in Nigeria are Shell and Exxon Mobil , whose 40 - year old pipelines break with distressing regularity , pouring oil into the locals ’ fishing grounds and drinking water .
The Delta supports 606 oil fields that supply close to 40 percent of U.S. oil imports .
This past May , an Exxon Mobil pipeline ruptured in the state of Akwa Ibon , dumping more than a million gallons into the Delta before it was patched .
According to Ben Ikari , a writer and member of the local Ogoni people , “ This kind of thing happens all the time in the Delta … the oil companies just ignore it .
The lawmakers do not care , and people must live with the pollution daily .
The situation is worse than it was 30 years ago . ”
Just how bad things are is not clear , because the oil companies and the Nigerian government will not make the figures public .
But independent investigators estimate that over the past four decades the amount of oil released into the Delta adds up to 50 Exxon Valdez spills , or 550 million gallons .
According to the most recent government figures , up to June 3 , Deepwater Horizon had pumped between 24 to 51 million gallons into the Gulf .
Nigerian government figures show there have been more than 9000 spills between 1970 and 2000 , and there are currently 2,000 official spill sites .
The oil companies claim the majority of them are caused by local rebels blowing up pipelines or siphoning off the oil , and that spills are quickly dealt with .
However , the locals say most of the spills are caused by the aging infrastructure , and they and environmental groups charge that the companies do virtually nothing to clean them up .
And when local people do challenge the oil giants , they say they get run off by oil company security guards .
The biggest oil disaster in the world , however , is not in Africa or the Gulf of Mexico , but in Ecuador ’s Amazon jungle , where Texaco — now owned by Chevron — pumped 18.5 billion gallons of “ produced water ” into an area of more than 2,000 square miles .
“ Produced water ” is heavily laden with salts , crude oil , and benzene , a carcinogenic chemical , .
According to the Amazon Defense Coalition , Chevron dumped the toxic waste directly into rivers and streams , in spite of recommendations by American Petroleum Institute that such waste be injected deep into the earth .
“ The BP tragedy was an accident ; Chevron ’s discharge in Ecuador was deliberate , ” said the Coalition in a press release .
Experts estimate that 345 million gallons of oil have been discharged into the rainforest , one of the most biodiverse areas in the world .
The oil and wastewater , along with “ black rains ” produced by the uncontrolled burning of gas , has created a nightmare for the local indigenous groups — the Secoya , Cofan , Siona , Huarani , and Kichwa .
Ecuador and the five tribes are currently suing Chevron for $ 27 billion , but the oil company claims it bears no responsibility for Texaco ’s practices and says it will not pay a nickel if it is assessed for any of the damage .
As oil resources decrease , the pressure will be on to seek new resources in more marginal territory , including the deep ocean , tropical rain forests , and sensitive artic and tundra zones .
Shell is chomping at the bit to start drilling in the Artic Ocean .
Judith Kimerling , who wrote “ Amazon Crude ” about the oil industry in Ecuador , told The Observer , “ Spills , leaks and deliberate discharges are happening in oilfields all over the world and very few people seem to care . ”
Except , of course , the people who live in the middle of them .
The Terrafugia Transition , closest thing to a flying car yet built , has received a unique exemption from the US government allowing production models to be 110 pounds heavier than a normal " light sport aircraft " .
This will permit the car / plane combo to satisfy safety requirements when driving on roads .
Now with airbags .
The Transition has been under development by startup firm Terrafugia , founded by flying - enthusiast MIT engineers , since 2006 .
It is basically a normal light single - engined plane with folding wings and a more substantial , four - wheeled undercarriage .
With wings folded a Transition can be driven on roads at normal highway speeds .
On reaching an airport - or a suitable bit of private land , with the owner 's permission - it can extend the wings and make a normal rolling takeoff to cruise the skies at 115 mph .
On landing , the usual hassles with finding hangar or tiedown space and getting a cab or hire car onward to one 's destination do n't apply .
The Transition simply drives out of the aerodrome gate and parks wherever it 's going - fitting in a standard size garage if one is available .
If bad weather should close in before the return journey - a constant worry for private pilots who do n't possess instrument ratings - no matter .
The Transition can simply drive home .
Handily , the plane - car was originally designed to fit within a weight limit of 1320 lb , meaning that it could qualify as a " light sport " aircraft .
A US light sport pilot 's licence is significantly easier and cheaper to get than a normal private ticket , requiring only 20 hours logged , and red tape is lessened .
However it seems that in fact it was proving very difficult to fit mandatory road - safety features such as crumple zones , airbags and a structural cage around the passenger compartment into the 1320lb weight limit .
Sportingly , the FAA have now agreed that the Transition , uniquely , can have another 110lb of leeway and still count as a light - sport plane .
Terrafugia originally planned to commence deliveries of production aircraft last year , but in the event got only as far as test flights of a " proof of concept " prototype .
This was mothballed after 28 flights , however , and the firm then said it would build a " beta prototype " which it now refers to as the " production prototype " .
Graphics of this - though not an actual airframe - are to be revealed at this summer 's OshKosh air show .
The company hopes now to commence customer deliveries in " Q4 2011 " , and says that more than 70 aircraft have been ordered .
The deposits are held in escrow , and thus will be refunded even if Terrafugia should go out of business or suffer some other disaster . ®

( CNN ) -- Arab modernity .
Why is it that at the beginning of the 21st century the Arab world seems stuck in time ?
Why are most Arabs still ruled by kings or military dictatorships ?
And specifically , why has the most populous Arab nation , Egypt , been governed by one man for nearly three decades ?
President Hosni Mubarak , a former general , came to power in the aftermath of Anwar Sadat 's assassination in October 1981 .
He has ruled Egypt ever since under a state of emergency .
Last week , Mubarak 's regime extended for another two years a Draconian emergency law that permits police to detain individuals indefinitely , prohibits unauthorized assembly and severely restricts freedom of speech .
We Americans should care about this state of affairs .
Mubarak 's regime exists in part because our tax dollars subsidize this dictatorship to the tune of several billion dollars a year .
We also support the Saudi royalty .
And although President Obama and previous presidents have often spoken eloquently about the need for democratization , Egypt 's elections are anything but democratic .
Why does nothing change ?
I spent virtually my entire childhood in the Middle East , and though it is not my home , I worry about it as if it were my home .
I mourn for it , I fear for it -- and I also greatly fear it .
Modernity , if not ever completely defeated , seems to have been put on hold throughout much of the Arab world .
A worn - out , 82 - year - old pharaoh still reigns in Egypt .
Royalty still rules in Jordan and Saudi Arabia .
Islamists still seem to be winning hearts and minds in a political vacuum .
The fact is that the Egypt of my adolescence in the 1960s was a more democratic and secular society than today .
My father was an American Foreign Service officer stationed in Cairo from 1965 - 67 .
An army colonel , Gamal Abdel Nasser , was Egypt 's virtual dictator .
But Nasser had at least been elected president in 1956 .
He was a wildly popular and populist politician throughout Egypt .
Sadat was never as popular as Nasser .
He had catered to the Islamists in the aftermath of Nasser 's death , thinking they were not dangerous , and ending up being killed by them .
Neither he nor Mubarak could have survived a truly democratic election .
Nasser became an autocrat , but at least he offered the Arabs a secular vision .
Even today , Nasser remains emblematic of a lost era when hope still existed among Arabs of all classes and tribes for a modern , secular and progressive Arab nation .
Suave and articulate , Nasser exuded a quiet intelligence .
His colleagues knew him to be incorruptible .
He had no personal peccadilloes , aside from smoking three packs of cigarettes a day .
He loved American films .
His good friend the newspaper editor Mohammed Heikel claimed that Nasser loved watching Frank Capra 's syrupy Christmas tale , " It 's a Wonderful Life . "
His favorite American writer was Mark Twain .
He spent an hour or two each evening reading American , French and Arabic magazines .
His closest political enemies at home were the Muslim Brotherhood , political theocrats who then attracted an insignificant following .
Today , the Muslim Brotherhood would undoubtedly win any democratic election in Egypt .
But back in the 1960s , most young Arab men aspired to a secular modernity .
They wanted to be engineers or doctors or lawyers -- and they admired , like Nasser did , American culture .
I lived in Cairo 's upscale suburban community of Maadi , about eight miles south of the city on the eastern bank of the Nile River .
I am startled to realize now that another resident of Maadi was the young Ayman al - Zawahiri .
In 1965 , the future doctor and No. 2 leader of al Qaeda was attending Maadi 's state - run secondary school .
He was exactly my age .
And like me , al - Zawahiri used to watch Hollywood films on an outdoor screen at the Maadi Sports Club .
Al - Zawahiri once aspired to a career in public health .
His ambitions were the same as most young Arab men in the Nasser era .
Even then he was a practicing Muslim .
And his religious sensibilities did not become politically radicalized until after Nasser ordered the execution of the Muslim Brotherhood 's leader , Sayyid Qutb , in 1966 .
But I would argue that al - Zawahiri and other young men would never have taken the road to jihadist terror had it not been for the June 1967 war .
Sadik al - Azm , the Yale - educated , Syrian philosopher , described Nasser 's defeat in the June war as a " lightning bolt " and a " shock " to the Arab ethos .
Nasser 's humiliation spelled the defeat of the idea of a secular path to Arab modernity .
Nasser 's once powerful notion that the Arabic - speaking peoples of the Middle East could unite under the banner of a progressive Arab nationalist movement was now discredited .
Over time , political Islam moved into this political vacuum .
Al - Zawahiri himself wrote in his 2001 memoir that the " Naksa " -- the June 1967 defeat -- " influenced the awakening of the jihadist movement . "
Al - Zawahiri today is hiding in a cave in Afghanistan , or dodging drone missile attacks in Pakistan .
Someday he will be a dead man , along with his pitiful co-conspirator Osama bin Laden .
The jihadists do n't have any thing real to offer the Arabs of the 21st century .
They can't put bread on the table in this era of globalization .
Al - Azm believes the jihadists have already lost : " There may be intermittent battles in the decades to come , with many innocent victims .
But the number of supporters of armed Islamism is unlikely to grow , its support throughout the Arab Muslim world will likely decline .
... September 11 signaled the last gasp of Islamism rather than the beginnings of its global challenge . "
I hope so .
But if Al - Azm is right , the new generation of young Arab men and women must find hope for their lives elsewhere .
And so long as tired old kings and pharaohs smother their rights to democratic elections and free speech , the jihadists will still offer a desperate alternative .

Der österreichischen Promitruppe gelingt Seltenes .
Sie besiegt die deutsche Fußball - Auswahl im sehenswerten ORF - Kick mit 5:2 .
Dem Österreich - Trainer Hans Krankl gehen dabei die Nerven durch .
Österreich hat wieder ein kleines Cordoba : Der ORF - Promikick " Das Match " ist am Freitag mit einem souveränen Sieg der österreichischen Auswahl über die deutschen Gäste ausgegangen .
Mit 5:2 kickten die Österreicher die von Verletzungen und dem Altersunterschied gehandicapte deutsche Mannschaft vom Platz im Stadion Altach ( Vorarlberg ) .
Aus dem Gaudi - Kick wurde phasenweise Ernst und die Emotionen gingen auch auf den Trainerplätzen wohl höher als erwartet .
'' Das Match ' ' : David gegen Goliath
Ex -Ski-Ass Mayer bricht den Bann
Die deutsche Auswahl , die zwei Über - Sechzigjährige beinhaltete , hatte gleich in den ersten Minuten zwei Treffer zu verdauen .
Ex -Skirennläufer Christian Mayer schoss das 1:0 , danach netzte der Ex -Profikicker Thomas Flögel zum 2:0 ein , woran ihn auch ein Cut nicht hinderte , das er sich beim Kopfball zugezogen hatte .
Danach wurde das Spiel auf deutscher Seite etwas rasanter .
Nachdem zeitweise bis zu sieben " Legenden " , also ehemalige Profifußballer auf der Hälfte der Gegner dem Ball nachliefen , war der erste Streit auf der Trainerbank vorprogrammiert : Lautstark protestierte " Teamchef " Hans Krankl gegen das deutsche Vorgehen , was aber nichts half , denn irgendwann fehlte dem deutschen Trainer Werner Lorant schlicht Nachschub , weil einer nach dem anderen verletzt vom Platz humpelte .
Auch mit der Kondition der im Schnitt fast ein Jahrzehnt älteren deutschen Mannschaft war es nicht immer sehr gut bestellt .
Als Tormann Andreas
Thiel mit ausgekegelter Schulter vom Platz ging , musste kurzzeitig sogar der österreichische Ersatztormann Leo Hillinger das deutsche
Tor hüten .

Wenig Spaß verstand unterdessen Lothar Matthäus , der mit zahlreichen Unsportlichkeiten vor allem die österreichische Trainerbank auf die Palme brachte .
Dank Mikro - Verkabelung konnte man Krankl dabei zuhören , wie er den deutschen Rekordkicker mit wienerischen Unfreundlichkeiten bedachte .
Trainerkollege Lorant dürfte von Krankl an diesem Abend außerdem erstmals den Ausdruck " derblos 'n " ( wienerisch für : schaffen ) gehört haben .

Zwei glückliche deutsche Treffer
Das deutsche 1:2 schoss zunächst der Rodler Georg Hackl , wobei Heimo Pfeiffenberger kurz darauf das dritte österreichische
Tor nachlegte .
Ex -Kicker Michael Wagner brachte das 4:1 zustande .
Der als Notbesetzung auf den Platz gelaufene deutsche Co- Trainer Armin Selig , der mit handgemaltem Trikot spielen musste , schoss ehrenhalber schließlich ein zweites
Tor für die Bundesrepublik , das ausgerechnet dem eingewechselten österreichischen Goalie Leo Hillinger durch die Lappen ging .
Nach einer kurzen Aufregung durch einen Flitzer , der mit aufgemalter Telefonnummer am Rücken splitternackt durchs Bild lief , setzte Pfeiffenberger schließlich noch einmal nach und erhöhte den österreichischen Triumph auf 5:2 .

Image caption The Rachel Corrie was taken to Ashdod under military escort
An aid ship intercepted by the Israeli military while trying to break the blockade of Gaza has arrived in the Israeli port of Ashdod .
Israel says its soldiers boarded the Irish - owned Rachel Corrie from the sea and did not meet any resistance .
There has been no word from those on board , who include several activists .
The incident comes five days after nine people were killed in clashes when troops boarded a Turkish aid ship , prompting international criticism .
Turkish officials have released details of autopsies carried out on the nine dead activists , saying a total of 30 bullets had been found in their bodies .
One of the activists was shot four times in the head , the officials said .
The BBC's Jonathan Head in Istanbul says some of the details seem to contradict the Israeli assertion that their commandos used minimum lethal force .
' Extremists ' claim
The crew and activists from the Rachel Corrie are being questioned at Ben Gurion airport while Israeli officials try to organise their deportation .
Israel said it would transfer the aid to the Gaza Strip by land after checking the cargo for banned items .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the peaceful outcome to the operation .
" We saw today the difference between a ship of peace activists , with whom we do n't agree but respect their right to a different opinion from ours , and between a ship of hate organised by violent Turkish terror extremists , " Mr Netanyahu 's office quoted him as saying .
Mary Hughes Thompson , a co-founder of the Free Gaza Movement which organised the shipment , told the BBC she was " outraged " by the latest Israeli action .
" They [ the Israelis ] once again went into international water and violently boarded a boat and forced people against their will to go to Israel , when all we wanted was to be left to go to Gaza , which is our goal , " she said .
She added that further aid shipments to Gaza would be organised .
Passengers gathered
There are five Irish and six Malaysian pro-Palestinian activists , plus several crew , on the boat .
The Rachel Corrie is named after a US college student who was crushed to death by an Israeli army bulldozer as she protested over house demolitions in Gaza in 2003 .
Israel has blockaded Gaza since 2007 , when the Islamist Hamas movement took control of the territory .
The 1,200 tonne cargo ship was boarded about 16 nautical miles ( 30 km ) off the Israeli coast .

Your say : Was interception right ?
Hague ' glad ' of peaceful boarding
Israeli military spokeswoman Lt Col Avital Leibovich said the takeover took minutes , and the ship 's captain had gathered the passengers in one area of the vessel .
Footage taken by the Israeli military from a helicopter above the Rachel Corrie showed the activists sitting in the middle of the top deck .
The Cyprus - based Free Gaza Movement is a coalition of pro-Palestinian groups and human rights organisations .
The Rachel Corrie is carrying hundreds of tonnes of aid , including wheelchairs , medical supplies and cement .
Construction materials are banned from entering Gaza by Israel , which says they could be used for military purposes by Hamas .
Israel came under fierce criticism after its troops shot dead nine people during a violent confrontation with those on board the Turkish Mavi Marmara in the early hours of Monday
Israel says its commandos were attacked with weapons , including knives , and opened fire in self - defence .
Activists on the ship say troops shot at them without provocation .
Israel says its policies towards Gaza will not change while Hamas remains in power and while rockets continue to be fired from Gaza into Israel .
Protests over Israeli action against Gaza aid shipments were held in several cities around the world on Saturday , including Dublin , London , Istanbul , Paris and Cairo .
There were also clashes in Tel Aviv between government supporters and protesters angry at the flotilla attack .
WASHINGTON — A senior United Nations official is expected to call on the United States next week to stop Central Intelligence Agency drone strikes against people suspected of belonging to Al Qaeda , complicating the Obama administration ’s growing reliance on that tactic in Pakistan .
Philip Alston , the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , said Thursday that he would deliver a report on June 3 to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva declaring that the “ life and death power ” of drones should be entrusted to regular armed forces , not intelligence agencies .
He contrasted how the military and the C.I.A. responded to allegations that strikes had killed civilians by mistake .
“ With the Defense Department you ’ve got maybe not perfect but quite abundant accountability as demonstrated by what happens when a bombing goes wrong in Afghanistan , ” he said in an interview .
“ The whole process that follows is very open .
Whereas if the C.I.A. is doing it , by definition they are not going to answer questions , not provide any information , and not do any follow - up that we know about . ”
Mr. Alston ’s views are not legally binding , and his report will not assert that the operation of combat drones by nonmilitary personnel is a war crime , he said .
But the mounting international concern over drones comes as the Obama administration legal team has been quietly struggling over how to justify such counterterrorism efforts while obeying the laws of war .
WASHINGTON —
In the weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks , the eloquent 30 - year - old imam of a mosque outside Washington became a go - to Muslim cleric for reporters scrambling to explain Islam .
He condemned the mass murder , invited television crews to follow him around and patiently explained the rituals of his religion .
“ We came here to build , not to destroy , ” the cleric , Anwar al - Awlaki , said in a sermon .
“ We are the bridge between Americans and one billion Muslims worldwide . ”
At first glance , it seemed plausible that this lanky , ambitious man , with the scholarly wire - rims and equal command of English and Arabic , could indeed be such a bridge .
CD sets of his engaging lectures on the Prophet Muhammad were in thousands of Muslim homes .
American - born , he had a sense of humor , loved deep - sea fishing , had dabbled in get - rich - quick investment schemes and dropped references to “ Joe Sixpack ” into his sermons .
A few weeks before the attacks he had preached in the United States Capitol .
Nine years later , from his hide - out in Yemen , Mr. Awlaki has declared war on the United States .
“ America as a whole has turned into a nation of evil , ” he said in a statement posted on extremist Web sites in March .
Though he had spent 21 of his 39 years in the United States , he added , “ I eventually came to the conclusion that jihad against America is binding upon myself , just as it is binding on every other able Muslim . ”

The Dangers Of Isolation
Over time , working in isolation ( even if you function as part of a team ) can prove harmful to your mental health , business and website .
In fact , even if other people are working on a project of yours , if they are junior to you , you can still feel isolated .

If you do n’t find a peer with whom you can share ideas and discuss your business or project , you face a number of dangers :
Dry up creatively .
Creativity is born of interaction .
Being consistently creative on your own is hard .
The best ideas come from people brainstorming together and from one great idea leading to another .
Without someone to bounce ideas around with , your business or project will lack a creative spark .

Lose confidence .

This is a trait I suffer from ; I would happily dive headlong into disaster if my fellow directors did not constantly question my ideas .

Have a blinkered perspective .
Another problem with working alone is that you have only a single perspective on your work .
By adding another set of eyes to your problems , you gain a broader vision and can approach your challenges from a different angle .

Feel overwhelmed .
Running a business or a business - critical website can feel like a burden .
You are often required to make big decisions , particularly with hiring and expenditures .
Making these decisions alone is a big responsibility and can be really scary .
Having someone to share that with would make a big difference .
So , can you identify with any of these traps ?
If not , then I suggest you read the one about over - confidence again !
I do n’t believe a single website owner or entrepreneur could n’t benefit from an outside perspective .
The question , then , is how do you find someone ?
Getting An Outside Perspective
The most obvious solution is to partner with somebody at the outset .
Whether you work with someone on a website or form a business with an associate , partnerships can be very beneficial .
This is what I did with our company , and I have n’t regretted it for a minute .
I would be lost without my two co-founders , Chris and Marcus .
That said , I know that not everyone ’s experiences with partners have been rosy .
Also , by the time you read this , the opportunity for this kind of partnership may have already passed .
What can you do then ?
What other options are available to those seeking an outside perspective and someone to bounce ideas around with ?
Here are some options :
Sleeping partner .
This is the approach we took .
We have a non-executive director named Brian who works with a number of companies and keeps us on our toes .
He has a radically different view of business and constantly challenges us .
In return , he has a small stake in the business .
He is worth every penny .

Paid consultant .
If you do n’t fancy having someone so entrenched in your business , why not consider an external consultant with whom you could speak on an ongoing basis ?
Admittedly , this kind of consultant can be pricey , but they do bring an outside perspective to the table .

Mentor .
Another option is to approach a Web designer or website owner you admire and ask them to mentor you .
Obviously , these people are probably busy with their own work , but if you are willing to pay for their time , you might get some valuable advice .
You ’ll usually need only an hour per month to stay on the right track .

Buddy .

The two of you could agree to chat regularly and share the challenges you face as business or website owners , discussing different approaches and ideas .

Community .
Yet another option would be to look not for a consultant , mentor or buddy , but for a supportive online community .
Loads are around , but make sure the one you join is not too big .
You want people to remember you and your circumstances .
Whatever you decide is entirely up to you .
The point is , if you want to realize the potential of your website or business , you need the help and encouragement of others .
Humans by nature work best in groups , and you are no exception .
We are not meant to do it alone !
London , England ( CNN ) --
The eruption of an Icelandic volcano , which had slowed in recent days , strengthened Monday , spewing a new cloud of ash that officials said was heading toward the United Kingdom , possibly posing a renewed threat to air travel .
" This demonstrates the dynamic and rapidly changing conditions in which we are working , " the United Kingdom 's National Air Traffic Service said in a written statement .
" Latest information ... shows that the situation is worsening in some areas .
Based on this information , the situation for Northern Irish airports for the morning is uncertain , due to the new ash cloud . "
The statement came after millions of travelers stranded on both sides of the Atlantic were given a glimpse of hope earlier in the day , with officials announcing a plan to partially reopen European skies to air traffic .
However , Iceland 's Eyjafjallajokull volcano spewed a new cloud of ash up to 15,000 feet in the air .
Scottish airports should be available Tuesday morning as announced , the air traffic service said , and more UK airspace may become available Tuesday afternoon " although not as far south as the main London airports . "
The situation is likely to change overnight , officials said .
" We are working closely with government , airports and airlines , and airframe and aero engine manufacturers to get a better understanding of the effects of the ash cloud and to seek solutions , " the air traffic services said .
Earlier , European Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas said , " from tomorrow morning on we should see progressively more planes start to fly .
And this is good news for Europe 's stranded passengers , good news for airline industry and other sectors hard hit by this crisis . "
Authorities warned that Tuesday 's reopening will not bring air traffic to its usual levels .
European Union officials agreed to a plan involving three zones : one that remains closed , one open to all flights and one open only to certain flights .
The measures will go into effect Tuesday morning , Kallas said .
There will not be " any compromise on safety , " Kallas said .
He called the current situation " unsustainable " and said it is clear " we can not just wait until this ash cloud dissipates . "
Kallas rejected suggestions that European Union ministers should have acted more quickly to allow flights to resume .
It took Sunday 's test flights to provide the information necessary , he said .
Since the volcanic eruption worsened last week , sending an ash cloud into the skies , airlines have been losing at least $ 200 million a day , according to the International Air Transport Association , the trade group representing airlines .
Airports had lost close to 136 million euros ( $ 184 million ) as of Sunday , said Olivier Jankovec , director general of Airports Council International , Europe .
More than 6.8 million passengers have been affected , Jankovec said in a statement , adding that the effect is worse than after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States .
Thousands of people have been living in airports .
" I have been living out of my carry - on for five days , " said Paulo Wu , stranded in Amsterdam , Netherlands .
After two nights sleeping on a cot at the airport , he was able to get into a hotel with an actual bed , he said .
" I have no bags .
My bags are somewhere , I think , at the airport .
I just have my carry - on , " he said .
Britain dispatched Royal Navy ships to bring home some stranded British travelers , including members of its military , Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Monday .
The HMS Albion will arrive Tuesday morning in Santander , Spain , " where its primary role will be to collect U.K. service personnel who have recently left the ongoing operation in Afghanistan , " Britain 's Ministry of Defense said in a statement .
The HMS Ocean is in southern British waters and standing by for orders , while the HMS Ark Royal , which had been deployed on an exercise off the northwest coast of Scotland , was sailing south .
Brown said he spoke to Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero about using airports in Spain , which have been less affected by the air travel chaos , as a hub through which to bring people back to Britain .
Further information will be released later Monday , Brown said .
Along with the EU announcement that skies were open , several governments and airlines announced specific plans to resume some flights .
Announcements poured in from Finland to Belgium to France .
Germany 's Lufthansa airline said it would send 50 planes currently in international destinations back to Germany , and they would bring back up to 15,000 passengers .
The flights will begin late Monday , with the first set to land early Tuesday .
Some domestic flights would also begin Monday night , the airline said .
At the airport in Frankfurt , Germany , some Lufthansa workers took covers off plane engines .
A cargo plane pilot said that one or two flights per day have operated out of Frankfurt and that no ill effects were seen from the ash cloud .
The planes were outfitted with special foils that ash would stick to .
British Airways said it would resume some flights in and out of London 's airports beginning at 7 p.m. Tuesday ( 2 p.m. ET ) .
A British Airways test Sunday found no damage to the aircraft at a variety of altitudes , the airline said in a statement Monday .
" The analysis we have done so far , alongside that from other airlines ' trial flights , provides fresh evidence that the current blanket restrictions on airspace are unnecessary , " said Willie Walsh , British Airways ' chief executive .
Finland 's Ministry of Defense , however , said in a statement Monday that Finnish Air Force F - 18 Hornet fighters that conducted test flights over northern Finland on Thursday showed effects from volcanic material .
" A post - landing inspection revealed accumulations of powdery volcanic dust in the aircraft 's air intakes , " the ministry said .
Officials used a fiberscope to closely examine the engines of one aircraft , and " imagery ... indicated that even a short - duration flight inside an ash cloud may cause substantial damage to aircraft engines . "
The engines will undergo a more thorough inspection , the ministry said .
Meteorologist Derrick Ryall of the MET Office in London said there is no " defined safe limit " for volcanic ash .
" No one has said what a safe limit for aircraft is , so therefore it 's very difficult for these judgments to be made , " he said .
Would you be scared to fly through the ash cloud ?
The air disruptions have led to cancellations of numerous high - profile visits .
Many world leaders , including President Obama , were unable to attend Sunday 's funeral services for Polish President Lech Kaczynski .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton canceled plans to travel to Helsinki , Finland , a State Department official said .
Clinton was set to depart Washington on Tuesday .
No decision has been made about whether she will keep plans to visit Tallinn , Estonia , the official said .
If she does , she will not depart before Wednesday .

“ Dozens of passengers who were aboard the Mavi Marmara Turkish passenger ship are suspected of having connections with Global Jihad - affiliated terrorist organizations , defense officials said Tuesday , amid growing concerns that Turkey will dispatch Navy warships to accompany a future flotilla to the Gaza Strip , ” reports the Jerusalem Post .
Turkey is a NATO member state with a modern military .
It is interesting the Jerusalem Post — a documented propaganda outpost for American neocons — would link Turkish warships and the the so - called “ Global Jihad , ” itself a creation of the CIA , Mossad , and other assorted “ intelligence ” agencies that specialize in covert false flag operations .
In other words , according to the Post , Turkey will be facilitating “ terror ” — providing protection for the delivery of humanitarian aid — to Palestinians who are routinely characterized as terrorists .
Is it possible Israel will respond in kind and dispatch warships of its own ?
Is it possible there may be high explosive fireworks on the Mediterranean in the coming days ?
“ During its searches of the Mavi Marmara on Tuesday , the military also discovered a cache of bulletproof vests , night - vision goggles as well as gas masks .
On Monday morning , nine international activists were killed during the Navy ’s takeover of the Mavi Marmara which was trying to break the Israel - imposed sea blockade on the Gaza Strip . ”
Here Israel is essentially saying Turkey either allowed or put this equipment on the Mavi Marmara .
“ Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Turkey ’s prime minister , says the vessels were all carefully searched before they left Turkey , ” the Los Angeles Times reported on May 31 .
“ These boats that left from Turkey and other countries were checked in a strict way under the framework of the rules of international navigation and were only loaded with humanitarian aid , ” he was quoted as saying by Al Jazeera , adding that there was no one on board “ other than civilian volunteers . ”
Are the Israelis calling Recep Tayyip Erdogan a liar ?
If so , the neocon Post should clarify .
The Post , of course , did n’t bother to mention that the blockade is illegal under international law .
Never mind the proclamations of the United Nations — United Nations human rights chief Navi Pillay said last year Israel is violating the rules of warfare with its blockade — the criminal blockade is illegal under the Fourth Geneva convention dealing with the collective punishment of civilians .
The blockade has “ contributed to a humanitarian crisis , deepened poverty and ruined the economy , ” explained Human Rights Watch in a letter sent to then Israeli Prime Minister Olmert in 2008 .
For American neocons and Israeli Likudniks , of course , the Palestinians are terrorists and terrorists are not allowed human rights .
International law does not apply to them .
Ask the 72 % of innocent detainees the neocons threw in Gitmo .
“ The group of over 50 passengers with possible terror connections have refused to identify themselves and were not carrying passports .
Many of them were however carrying envelopes packed with thousands of dollars in cash . ”
No independent confirmation of this allegation will be allowed by the Israeli military .
“ Yesterday , the activists were kept in a detention facility in the port of the town of Ashdod in southern Israel .
The port area was declared a closed military zone ; therefore , lawyers were not allowed to access the activists yesterday .
According to the most recent information , the majority of the activists are being held in ‘ Ella ’ prison facility in the town of Beer Sheva , ” the Ethiopian Review reports .
Greek activist Michalis Grigoropoulos explained how the Israelis forced activists to sign papers apparently in Hebrew they could not read .
If they did not cooperate , they were beaten .
Is it possible the activists were signing papers admitting they were part of the “ Global Jihad ” ?
If so , will the Israelis use these “ confessions ” to make their case ?
Is grass green ?
“ The military is working to identify the passengers and is looking into the possibility that some of them have ties with Global Jihad - affiliated terror organizations and that some were involved in past global terror attacks .
Some of them are apparently known Islamic extremists . ”
Again , the Post and the Israeli military offer absolutely no evidence .
But then the neocons offered fabricated evidence that Saddam had WMDs and millions of gullible Americans believed it thanks to a complaisant corporate media with skilled disinfo assets like Judith Miller at the New York Times .
So far over a million Iraqis have paid for the lies of the neocons .
“ This is the group that was behind the violent lynch against the naval commandos , ” a defense official told the Post .
“ They came on board the ship prepared and after they had trained for the expected Navy takeover . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
No Israeli commandos were “ lynched , ” an act that usually results in death by asphyxiation .
But then it is possible the Israeli defense official “ misspoke ” — Newspeak for telling lies and getting caught — or maybe he was not every good with the English language .
If the Global Jihadist peace activists trained for the Israeli military “ takeover , ” why did they have kitchen knives and wood batons ( or so Israeli propaganda claims today ) instead of AK47s and RPGs ?
Finally , the Post , citing the Israeli military , reports that ships now steaming toward Gaza will “ be intercepted the same way the flotilla was stopped on Monday morning ” ( emphasis added ) .
In short , more activists will be killed .
“ According to the sources , the Navy , in a future operation will use more force to prevent ships from reaching the Gaza Strip ” ( emphasis not in original ) .
More force ?
Maybe Israel will blow the ships out of the water ?
Kill everybody and let God sort ’em out ?
“ We boarded the ship and were attacked as if it was a war , ” one officer said .
“ That will mean that we will have to come prepared in the future as if it was a war . ”
If you ’d like a glimpse of how this will work , look at Lebanon , Gaza City , and the Palestinian refugee camps .
Ask the Shi’ite Muslims of Beirut that had their apartment blocks leveled by fighter jets manufactured by Lockheed Martin .
However , this time around , it may prove to be a bit more difficult than simply lobbing missiles and artillery at unarmed civilians and grade school kids cowering in basements .
Turkey now promises to provide naval support for aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip .
“ If Turkey is promising to send new supplies with naval escort , then we ’re headed for an epic showdown between two of Americas closest allies , ” opines AlterNet .
Militarily speaking , Turkey is no push - over .
It has a modern military and is an active member of NATO .
Back in the old days of unchallenged Israeli hegemony , the legendary general Moshe Dayan said : “ Israel must be a like a mad dog , too dangerous to bother . ”
Now the mad dog has competition .
But there is a catch .
Israel has hundreds of nuclear weapons , including those of the thermonuclear variety .
“ ” If left to its own Israel will have no choice but to fall back on a riskier defense which will endanger itself and the world at large , ” said an economic adviser to former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir .
“ To enable Israel to abstain from dependence on nuclear arms calls for $ 2 to 3 billion per year in U.S. aid . ”
Can a country that considers itself a mad dog and engages in nuclear blackmail be trusted ?
In the next few days we may find out .

Washington ( CNN ) --
A top White House aide and the managing director of oil giant BP provided differing versions Sunday for who provided the initial inaccurate estimates of the size of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
Robert Dudley , the BP official who appeared on CNN's " State of the Union " and other talk shows , said early estimates that 5,000 barrels ( 210,000 gallons ) were leaking into the ocean each day came from government satellite imaging , rather than BP 's figures .
An updated estimate issued last week by a government - led team put the leak at 12,000 - 19,000 barrels ( 504,000 to 798,000 gallons ) a day , more than double the initial figure .
" The best way to measure those early rates or estimate those early rates were from satellite data , not BP data , " Dudley said on the CBS program " Face the Nation . "
Not true , countered Carol Browner , the assistant on energy and climate change to President Obama , who spoke to the NBC program " Meet the Press " and the CBS show .
" The very , very first estimates came from BP , " Browner said on the CBS program .
" They had the footage of the plume .
The government then did satellite imagery and we realized that those estimates were not accurate . "
Browner noted that BP had a " vested financial interest " in downplaying the size of the leak .
" They will ultimately pay a fine based on those rates , " Browner said .
" That 's why we brought in an independent team .
We did not include BP in the estimates that were made available this week . "
Rep. Ed Markey of Massachusetts , who heads the House Energy and Environment subcommittee , agreed that the company " had a stake in low - balling the number right from the very beginning . "
" I think that they were either lying or they were incompetent , " Markey said on the CBS program .
Noting that BP has consistently provided information that proved to be wrong , Markey said he had " no confidence whatsoever in BP . "
" I think they do not know what they are doing , " Markey said , adding : " I do n't think that people should really believe what BP is saying in terms of the likelihood of anything that they 're doing is going to turn out as they 're predicting . "
Browner emphasized steps the government has taken to oversee BP 's efforts to stop the leak , noting the administration ordered the company to begin digging two relief wells intended to eventually stop the leak instead of a single one proposed by BP .
In addition , she said , it was government scientists led by Energy Secretary Steven Chu who recommended that BP halt the so - called " top kill " effort to pump heavy mud down the well to try to plug the leak .
" It was that group of people yesterday who looked at the information we had gotten from ' top kill ' and realized that it was too dangerous to continue to proceed to put pressure down into that well , that things could happen that would make the situation worse , " Browner said .
Dudley told CNN that BP was " disappointed the oil is going to flow for a while and we 're going to redouble our efforts to keep it off the beaches . "
The top kill effort failed because " there was just too much flow " of oil and gas coming out of the well , Dudley said .
He detailed a plan to cut a new opening in equipment from which the oil is leaking to try to lower a cap over it and pipe up most of the leak .
A similar previous effort failed , and Dudley said steps would be taken to prevent the problems from the first attempt .
" Our objective is to contain a majority of the oil and gas , " Dudley said , adding that cutting the new opening was unlikely to increase the amount of oil leaking out before the cap is placed .
Browner , however , said on the CBS program that an increase of up to 20 percent was possible .
And Markey , on the same show , contended that BP " has been making it up as they go along the whole way .
" They do not know for sure what the result is going to be of anything which they are doing , " Markey said .
AMSTERDAM  Netherlands winger Arjen Robben injured his left hamstring Saturday and will undergo scans to determine if he will recover in time to play at the World Cup .
The injury to one of the Netherlands ' most dangerous forwards came after he scored two goals as a second - half substitute in a 6 - 1 rout of Hungary in a friendly at Amsterdam Arena .
" He felt a sharp pain .
That can't be good , " Netherlands coach Bert Van Marwijk said .
" Treatment for these injuries has improved hugely , so I 'm not giving up hope yet . "
The Netherlands ' first match at the World Cup is against Denmark on June 14 .
Robben , an injury - prone Bayern Munich winger , fell awkwardly after cutting inside from the right and trying to deliver a deft pass to the right with his left foot .
He immediately clutched his left leg just above the knee and grimaced in pain .
After treatment on the field , he limped off and made his way slowly to the changing rooms .
The Netherlands squad was flying to South Africa on Saturday night without Robben .
Van Marwijk said Robben would head to the hospital for scans on Sunday to establish the seriousness of the injury .
Robben 's was the latest in a string of injuries to top players at the World Cup .
It came a day after England captain Rio Ferdinand and Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba were hurt .
Robben has been in the form of his life this season , and his goals helped Bayern reach the Champions League final .
Saturday 's second - half appearance was Robben 's first in three World Cup warmups for the Dutch because he had been nursing a hip injury .
Replacing Dirk Kuyt , Robben 's impact was immediate .
He provided dangerous passes from the right as well as repeatedly cutting inside with the ball and unleashing curling left foot shots < emdash /> one of them providing his second goal .
He tapped in his first goal at the far post after a cross from Giovanni van Bronckhorst .
" I hope he 's OK , because he 's a very important player for us , " Robin van Persie said .
" Everyone is down now . "
Van Marwijk said he would await the results of tests before considering a possible replacement .
Dutch preparations for the World Cup had been going smoothly , with all players fit and in form .
The team scored 12 goals and conceded three in three straight warmup victories over Mexico , Ghana and Hungary .
But that was all overshadowed Saturday as a disconsolate Robben hobbled off the field .
" I would rather have lost the game and had a fit Robben , " Van Marwijk said .
Van Persie , Wesley Sneijder , Mark van Bommel and Eljero Elia also scored for the Netherlands against an outclassed Hungary .
Balazs Dzudzsak had given Hungary the lead in the sixth minute after Van Bronckhorst gave him too much room .
But the Netherlands dominated the rest of the match , with Van Bommel , Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart controlling the midfield and releasing repeated attacks down both flanks .
Elia scored the best Dutch goal of the match just a minute after coming on in the 73rd as a substitute .
The left winger beat three defenders and sent a shot through the legs of a fourth to make it 5 - 1 before Robben scored his second and then got injured .
But Elia said Robben 's injury cast a shadow over post - match celebrations .
" In the changing room you saw everybody thinking about it .
Nobody talked about our victory , " Elia said .
" I could n't care less about my goal .
Arjen is very important for us . "
Robben was not the only Dutch injury worry .
Center back John Heitinga was substituted after about an hour and his ankle was immediately wrapped in ice .
___ Lineups : Netherlands : Maarten Stekelenburg , Gregory van der Wiel , John Heitinga ( Andre Ooijer , 61 ) , Joris Mathijsen , Giovanni van Bronckhorst ( Demy de Zeeuw , 78 ) , Mark van Bommel , Dirk Kuyt ( Arjen Robben , 46 ) , Nigel de Jong , Robin van Persie ( Klaas Jan Huntelaar , 68 ) , Wesley Sneijder ( Eljero Elia , 73 ) , Rafael van der Vaart ( Ibrahim Afellay , 78 ) .
Hungary : Marton Fulop , Laszlo Bodnar ( Zsolt Laczko , 75 ) , Vilmos Vanczak , Roland Juhasz , Zoltan Szelesi , Boldizsar Bodor , Balazs Dzudzsak , Gabor Horvath ( Krisztian Vadocz , 78 ) , Sandor Torghelle ( Akos Elek , 58 ) , Tamas Priskin , Szabolcs Huszti ( Janos Lazok , 68 ) .

Previous | Next Hot Tub Repairman Posted at : 2010-05-05 10:11:15 Original ad :
We are in need of someone who can fix our hot tub .
If you know what you are doing , it is probably a fairly easy fix .
The hot tub is about 11 years old and has a cracked pipe and a broken pipe .
Also , some of the jets are not working ( may be related to the pipe ) .
We will pay for the parts .
Please respond with an estimate for the cost of labor .
From Me to ********@**********.org :
Hello ,
I am a certified hot tub repair technician and would be happy to help fix your hot tub .
Please let me know if you are still looking for someone .
Thanks ,
Mike
From Ellen ****** to Me :
Mike ,
How much will you charge to fix it ?
Ellen
From Me to Ellen ******:
Helen ,
It seems like a simple fix , but it will be time consuming .
I could charge you money , but I am more interested in barter , if you are willing to hear me out .
Mike
From Ellen ****** to Me :
Mike ,
What are you looking to barter ?
ELLEN
From Me to Ellen ******:
Helen ,
All I want in return for fixing your hot tub is to let me use it occasionally when I am on a date .
I find it much easier to get chicks from the bar to come back to my place if I tell them I have a hot tub .
The problem is , I live in a basement apartment and do not have a hot tub .
Hot tubs are great for getting chicks drunk ; something about drinking in a hot tub makes them get completely shitfaced without even knowing it .
I do n't know the science behind it , but it is a proven fact that bitches get more drunk in a hot tub .
Before you know it , these chicks are passed out drunk and ready to fuck .
Do n't worry , I wo n't need to use your house or anything when I get my fuck on ; I usually just bang them in the back of my truck and drop them off at a McDonalds .
So basically , in return for fixing your hot tub , all I ask is that you let me use it for 2 - 3 hours about four or five times a week .
Please let me know if this sounds fair to you .
Mike
From Ellen ****** to Me :
Absolutely not .
Are you joking ?
ELLEN
From Me to Ellen ******:
Helen ,
Why not ?
I promise I wo n't pee in the hot tub .
If I accidentally do , I promise I will add extra chlorine to balance out the urine levels .
I wo n't shit in your hot tub either .
If I have to take a shit , I 'll do it in your bushes .
Shit makes for great fertilizer .
Please help me out here .
I can't use the old hot tub I used to go to because I was informed that I would be arrested if I stepped foot on that property again .
I assure you I will have your hot tub running like new once I fix it .
Mike
From Ellen ****** to Me :
The concern of you pissing in my hot tub didnt even cross my mind , but I 'm just going to add that to the list of reasons why I am against this .
Most importantly - I will not let some creep bring women back to my house to rape them in my hot tub !
From Me to Ellen ******:
Whoa there , who said anything about rape ?
This is purely consensual .
From Ellen ****** to Me :
You said you wait until they pass out to have sex with them !
From Me to Ellen ******:
In the state of Pennsylvania , the law states that if you can get the girl back to a hot tub , it is considered to be sexual consent .
Look Helen , I 'm just trying to fix your hot tub .
Not get a lecture on ethics .
Do you want your hot tub fixed or not ?
Mike
From Ellen ****** to Me :
Not by you , you creep !
and my name is ELLEN not Helen , you fuck !
From Me to Ellen ******:
My apologies , Ellen .
I assumed you had made a typo when writing out your name .
Now how about answering my question ?
From Ellen ****** to Me :
Go fuck yourself , loser .

Location history is nothing new to Google Latitude , you either opt in or you do n’t when enabling the service on your phone .
But a list of the places you have been can only tell you so much , so Google has launched the Location History Dashboard in beta to help identify trends in your traveling habits .
It could be the places you stopped on a road trip , the places where you spend the most time , or the places you are visiting more often today than you were a year ago .
The new take on Latitude ’s location history is just enough to start bringing a little more purpose to the service .
Still there is no explicit check - in function and you wo n’t be getting any mayorships out of it , but at least now there is a more interesting way to explore the data that Latitude collects .
As always , the use of location history is strictly by choice and the data is kept private .
Google claims there are over 3 million people using Latitude , and the new dashboard is sure to allow some of them to kill a bit of time examining their travel history , but if Google wants to truly best FourSquare and Gowalla they are going to have to start making the service more social .
If you have been using Latitude with location history enabled , you should be able to access the feature now .
If you are just enabling location history you ’ll have to wait about a week for Google to pool enough data to present you with trending info .
A former Pennsylvania high school student has sued school and county officials for damages in a controversial sexting case .
The student alleges a violation of her constitutional rights , in a civil suit filed last week that could serve as a cautionary tale to other officials considering punishing students over risque self - portraits .
In the complaint filed in a U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania , the former student – identified only as " N.N. " – accuses former District Attorney George P. Skumanick , Jr. , principal Gregory Ellsworth , the Tunkhannock School District and Wyoming County of violating her constitutional rights ( .pdf ) .
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages .
The complaint alleges that officials had no probable cause to seize and search her phone , and violated her privacy and her right to free expression by punishing her for storing nude and semi-nude photos of herself on her phone .
The plaintiff , now 19 years old , was a student at Tunkhannock Area High School in January 2009 when school officials , who discovered that male students had been trading photos of female students showing them in various states of undress , confiscated and searched the phones of her and several other students .
Officials then turned the phones over to the district attorney 's office , which began a criminal investigation .
Then - District Attorney Skumanick , who lost his bid for a sixth term last year , threatened about 16 students – three boys and 13 girls – who either appeared in the images or were found in possession of them with child porn charges unless they agreed to six months of probation , submitted to drug testing and attended a five - week , 10 - hour education program to discuss why what they did was wrong .
He gave the parents of the students 48 hours to agree to the terms .
The plaintiff is now suing the school and county for illegal search and for forcing her to take the educational program .
In a separate but related case , the American Civil Liberties Union sued last year on behalf of three other Tunkhannock students who appeared in risque photos but refused to participate in the forced education program .
The ACLU sought to bar prosecutors from charging the teens with a crime and won a permanent injunction last month .
According to N.N. 's civil complaint , a teacher seized the phone after the plaintiff received a call during class .
The school 's rules require student cellphones to be turned off and stored in lockers during school hours .
Students who violate the rules risk detention and having their phone temporarily confiscated .
A while after the plaintiff 's phone was seized , she was summoned to see the principal , Gregory Ellsworth , who told her that he had gone through her phone and found explicit images stored in the memory .
He told her that he had given the phone to law enforcement officials , and then suspended the plaintiff for three days .
In several of the photos , the plaintiff 's breasts are exposed , and one photo shows her pubic area , according to the court document .
The plaintiff says that except for one image , she took all of the photos herself and never shared the images with any other students .
They were meant to be viewed only by her and her long - term boyfriend .
Even though no charges were brought against her , the images are still part of the government record , and the plaintiff is seeking to have them destroyed .
She 's also seeking to be reimbursed for the $ 100 cost of the educational course and for about $ 71 in lost wages .

Thanks for the great comments !
To new readers of this post - make sure to skim the comments after you finish reading .
There is some great advice there for making the change simpler - especially when you need to be compatible only with 2.6 and not the earlier versions ( 2.6 was especially designed to make future transition to 3 K simpler ) .
Python 3 has been available for a long time already , but the migration of modules to it is going slower than many Python afficionados would have hoped .
Once code is ported to Py3k , it can not run on 2.x .
This is the reason many library authors are afraid to make the step and port their code - they rightfully refuse to maintain two code bases .
So we have a " lack of critical mass " problem .
In my opinion , to make the migration easier , it makes sense to write code that can run on both Python 2 and 3 , at least for some time .
Yes , this can make some parts of the code a bit ugly ( although most of it can be hidden ) but it will allow porting without actually having to maintain two code - bases .
Once the critical mass assembles , the compatibility to 2.x can be dropped .
To contribute my share to the effort , I 've successfully transformed two of my major code - bases to run on both Python 2.6 and 3.1 :
pycparser - the ANSI C parser in pure Python : the new version ( 1.07 ) can run on both versions of Python ( other than that , it is n't different from 1.06 )
Luz - the assembler / linker / CPU simulator suite has also been ported .
This porting was easier than I hoped .
Since this is the first time I 've touched Python 3 , I had to use a few resources for help in the transition .
Some of the best ones : Dive into Python , Mark Lutz 's site and Ned 's post
Here 's a list of some tricks I had to use , in no particular order .
First and foremost , I created a portability .
py file too encapsulate the differences as much as possible .
Sometimes I had to use the following check :
if sys.hexversion > 0 x03000000
To differentiate between Python versions .
Luckily , all such checks could be confined to portability .
py .
Here 's an example of a couple of functions from portability .
py :
def printme ( s ) : sys.stdout.write ( str ( s ) ) def get_input ( prompt ) : if sys.hexversion > 0 x03000000 : return input ( prompt ) else : return raw_input ( prompt )
Python 3 made print into a function , so as a statement it does n't even parse .
printme is a function which can be called by both versions of Python .
It 's not as versatile as print itself , but it 's a small trouble since I mostly used print for debugging , testing and some trivial output .
get_input encapsulates the lack of raw_input in Python 3 .
Another problem I commonly had to tackle is catching exceptions .
Since the syntax was changed in Python 3 , I had to resort to this for portability :
except TypeError : err = sys.exc_info( ) [ 1 ]
This code runs in both versions and places the exception message in err .
Some differences were very easy to handle .
For example Python 3 removed xrange , so I 've just used list ( range .
Had performance really mattered , I would have had to use something more complex .
Also , itertools.imap was removed so I replaced it with iter ( map .
Dictionaries lost their has_key member , but key in dict works well on both versions of Python , so this is another easy change .
Luz is a relatively large project , sub - divided into packages and many modules , so relative vs. absolute imports gave me some trouble .
Luckily , the 2.x version I wanted to be compatible with is 2.6 , so I could just use relative imports everywhere and it works well on both versions .
The full - test running capabilities in Luz gave me some trouble because I 'm using dynamic Python code loading there .
The new module disappeared in Python 3 , but happily imp.new_module replaces it and works in 2.6 as well .
Also , I had to use a trick borrowed from Ned to replace exec with this monstrosity :
# Borrowed from Ned Batchelder if sys.hexversion > 0 x03000000 : def exec_function ( source , filename , global_map ) : exec ( compile ( source , filename , " exec " ) , global_map ) else : eval ( compile ( " " " \ def exec_function ( source , filename , global_map ) : exec compile ( source , filename , " exec " ) in global_map " " " , " < exec_function > " , " exec " ) )
Just like catching exceptions , since exec is syntax , you just can't nicely hide it behind a version check .
The parser chokes on it even if that code section does n't get executed eventually .
Therefore , a brute - force approach using eval ( compile is called for , since this one runs at runtime , when only the relevant interpreter sees it .
That 's about it .
From now on I plan to keep both pycparser and Luz functional on both versions of Python - it should n't be too hard .
In the future when I feel the time is right to make the switch to Py3k , it will be trivial - I 'll just clean - up all the ugly portability code .
P.S. : To complete such a task you really need good unit tests .
I can't imagine making it and staying sane without the extensive tests both code - bases have .
To All Audiophile and Specialty Record Labels
Today is the day to see the extraordinary opportunity in front of you .
The days of selling retro-vinyl titles or dead - format SACDs are over .
The Blu-ray era is here and you have every reason to get involved , as the reasons are so plentiful .
The most compelling reason is the majors are distracted by the low - hanging fruit of downloads , even as there is an enthusiast base of music lovers who can buy thousands if not tens of thousands of your new and even more profitable back - catalogue titles right now .
Additional Resources
• Learn more about SACD here .
• Read a list of the best , audiophile grade Blu-ray players from the likes of Oppo , Denon , Cambridge Audio and many others here .
To recap some of the many reasons why Blu-ray is something you should be jumping into with both feet :
- Blu-ray as an audio format can accurately replicate the master tape - no matter how high its resolution - with a one - for - one copy that blows away the audio performance of any other format on the market today , including vinyl , Compact Disc , DVD - Audio , DVD - Video , SACD and most HD downloads .
- Blu-ray is copy - protected at levels that would make Hollywood studios feel comfortable .
It 's pretty hard to steal the files , yet there is room to give MP3 files or other lower - resolution files to add value for consumers if desired .
- Blu-ray can be connected with one HDMI cable , unlike the ghastly nine - cable nightmare of DVD - Audio and SACD .
- Blu-ray players are downright affordable with retail prices of below $ 200 , yet they pack audio performance simply not available from the best $ 15,000 SACD players and $ 50,000 turntables .
Of course , audiophile - grade Blu-ray players could sound even better , but the barrier to entry is so low for consumers to get in on Blu-ray for music that the opportunity is just screaming at you .
- Blu-ray , unlike SACD ( the current and only real audiophile format left ) , has video capabilities .
Millions of people buy HDTVs every month for HD video .
Imagine selling HD music discs to even 1/100th of one percent of them .
- Labels like 2L from Norway are bundling SACDs with Blu-ray discs for audiophiles to make the most of both formats and to open up the possibility to sell more music to more people .
- Blu-ray as a format can do 5.1 audio or even 7.1 audio to recreate a surround sound experience that makes DVD - Audio or SACD sound " last decade , " even if the audiophile print magazines think " last decade " is somehow more desirable .
DTS Master Audio and Dolby True HD are incredible audio playback formats .
- Every receiver on the market today and dozens of more audiophile - grade AV preamps have HDMI inputs and can reproduce master - quality audio for very little money .
- I could go on and on and on ...
Today the opportunity is sitting right in front of your noses to be more like Microsoft than Micromega and to sell your entire back catalogues all over again on Blu-ray .
Today , the opportunity to license important music from the past and remaster it for HD will get the attention of bigger record labels in ways it would n't have done even five years ago .
Imagine an audiophile or specialty HD audiophile label selling 1,000 copies each at $ 20 per ( the discs do n't have to be cheap , as you need room to pay the artists and labels for the better music , the remastering costs etc. ) - think of the sales for your smaller labels .
If I were going to start an audiophile / specialty label ( do n't think it has n't crossed my mind , but my plate is pretty full producing movies in 4 k like April Showers , in theaters on April 24 , 2009 - shameless plug ) , I would go to DTS and see if I could license their back catalogue of 5.1 mixes of the music of Sting , the Eagles , Queen , Lyle Lovett and many others .
Some were on 5.1 CDs , others on DVD - Audio , but all are close to being ready to be re-released .
What happened to AudioQuest Music ?
Could there be a stash of music waiting to be released in HD on Blu-ray ?
How about JVC Music ?
Think Concord would take your call for you to re-release Telarc recordings on Blu-ray ?
Why would n't they , if you do the heavy lifting and they share in the profits ?
It 's worth a call to ask , but before you make that call , dial up your banker , because as financial institutions free up their lending in the coming months , you might need some upfront money to land and remaster the goodies .
Trust me , it 's worth it long - term .
To the specialty retailers of the world , like Acoustic Sounds , Music Direct and even Amazon.com : how about putting out a purchase order for enough discs so that these small labels can feel the effect ?
How about priming the pump a little , the way the Federal government is trying to stimulate the economy ?
There is only so much risk a small label can take when it is selling its music directly to the consumer .
Look at these labels as your partners and help them gain some market traction .
To audiophile and home theater electronics companies : stop fearing making a higher - end Blu-ray player .
Where is my Meridian Blu-ray player ?
Yes , I want a Sooloos media server , too , but I want a player with all of Meridian 's ( or Krell 's , or Levinson 's or EMM Labs ' or DCS 's or ... ) insight and experience for Blu-ray music and movie playback .
I would pay thousands for it and there are thousands of others like me .
Goldmund can't be the only high - end company on the planet with enough guts to make a high - end Blu-ray player .
It 's time to step up and invest .
OEM companies can help and it does n't have to be that painful or outlandishly costly .

Google has announced the availability of a new tool called GoogleCL that will allow users to interact with the company 's popular Web services directly from the command line .
GoogleCL was developed in Python on top of the gdata - python - client library .
It 's an open - source software project that 's hosted on Google Code and distributed under the Apache license .
Users who want to contribute fixes and improvements can submit patches through the project 's issue tracker .
Although modern desktop computing is increasingly dominated by graphical user interfaces , command line tools are still extremely useful for rapid interaction , simple programmatic automation , and remote system management .
GoogleCL will make Google - hosted data more accessible to common command - line workflows .
The GoogleCL tool offers an easy way to pipe your GMail contact list into sed and awk , or use a shell glob to specify which photos and movies to batch upload to Picasa and YouTube .
It also supports Blogger , Google Calendar , and Google docs .
The tool can be downloaded from its project page on the Google Code Web site .
Google is making available a tarball with the source code and an installable DEB package .
I tested it from the DEB package on my Ubuntu 10.04 desktop computer .
The first time that you access each individual service , it will prompt you for your username and then it will supply an OAuth link that you can copy and paste into a Web browser to complete the authentication process .
After initial account configuration , the tool can be used in pipelines and other non-interactive command line workflows .
I tested several of the features , particularly the GMail contact list support .
It worked well with a Google Apps account that I use with one of my own domains .
The supported services and operations are documented in the project 's user manual .
An assortment of sample uses can be found on the project 's wiki .
Some of the features in GoogleCL , such as Google Docs editing , require at least version 2.0 of the gdata - python - client library .
Unfortunately , the Ubuntu repositories only have version 1.2.4 .
The tool will work with the older version of the library , but will display an error message when the user tries to use a feature that is n't supported .
For more information about the tool , you can refer to the release announcement that was published this morning in Google 's open source blog .
I ’ve touched on this many times before , but since it does n’t look like Joe ‘ we all came from magic ’
Cienkowski is going to provide us with any insight as to why he thinks ‘ evolution is the religion of atheism ’ , other than to repeatedly cut and paste various misspelled lies for Jesus at people who simply want to give him the space to explain his position better , I thought it might be worth going over some of the basics which have emerged from your comments and feedback to this blog over the past few years on the subjects of faith and belief .
Firstly , we know where the idea that accusing atheism of being a religion without a deity comes from , as this article on proud atheists shows : proudatheists.wordpress.com/atheists-want-their-version-of-religion-taught-in-texas
The Fox News mentality , that atheism is bad because it ’s a non-Christian religion , neatly encapsulates the sort of curricular thinking , “ I ’m talking so you do n’t have to ” idiocy we ’ve come to expect from the Murdoch press as a whole .
But in fairness , it must be pointed out that the vast majority of Christians do not ram this garbage down anyone ’s throat , for that very reason .
The ordinary faithful are not oblivious to the counterproductiveness of stating that someone must be mistaken , simply because they religiously adhere to a certain worldview regardless of the facts — which is exactly the point atheism so successfully makes .
So pointing this out on our behalf does seem more than a little redundant — and many of the so - called moderate religious are not unaware of this fact and avoid collaborating with the fringe elements in their own religion who fail to understand it .
Indeed very many of what I call practical Christians ; those who ca n’t quite bring themselves to deny all of it — the “ there must be something , out there ” believers in belief — often make much better arguments in favour of certain aspects of faith , than lazy atheists do in favour of , say , the scientific method and rationalism .
For a good example of this , you might want to read Terminus Technicus , myself and others discussing Christian apologetics and the pattern seeking brain .
But contrast these open concessions towards ordinary rationalism , from the theistic end of the religious scale , with stories like this from dakotavoice.com , on the evangelical mother of six , Brigitte Bedard , who ‘used to be a lesbian atheist ’ and you begin to see it ’s not all sweetness and light between ostensibly well intentioned theists and their non-religious counterparts .
The pitch is well worn , because it works every time — albeit on an already convinced audience :
Find someone with a hedonistic lifestyle , built around drink and drugs and stupid behaviour , fill their head with easy answers as a way out of their bad situation and hey presto , instant overnight proof that the universe was created with Pat Roberson in mind .
“ Here I was , a militant feminist lesbian atheist lying on my apartment floor crying my head off imploring God .
I was n’t in my right mind , but I was desperate for help . ”
Now , I do n’t know about you , but every atheist I know has pretty much one thing in common .
So I think it ’s fairly safe to say , our friend the lesbian and therefore evil Brigitte Bedard was n’t exactly an atheist because she ’d thought about “ it ” at any great length .
She seems like more of a non-religious by default , to me .
And this point is often lost on our Christian attackers , so I ’ll underline it one more time .
Not going to church , does n’t make you an atheist .
Not going to church because you assert the fact that there is no evidence of a supernatural aspect to reality , however , does .
But since when did proving someone ’s thinking is fundamentally flawed by their misinformed opinion ever stop career religionists continuing to think whatever they want to think regardless ?
So we need a new tactic with these people that few atheists are keen to explore .
We need to stop calling it atheism altogether .
I did n’t lose faith , when I realised gods do not exist , I gained reason .
The only way we ’re going to win this war of ideas with those who would destroy everything we stand for , in the name of fulfilling biblical prophecy , is by empowering them with critical thinking .
If that means spelling out for them the logical flaws in their many tirades against everything from science to small ‘ l ’ liberalism , so be it .
But for as long as we do it in the name of ‘ atheism ’ , we ’re setting ourselves up to have more of the same arguments in which they have no hope of understanding our position and we have no hope of understanding the best of theirs .
A YOUNG mother died after doctors failed to spot a 15 cm - long toilet brush handle embedded in her buttock .
A judicial investigation into the death of Cindy Corton , 35 , was told overnight she was left with the bizarre injury after a drunken fall in a friend 's bathroom in 2005 but medics missed it - even after taking X - rays , The Sun reported .
It was two years before Mrs Corton , who was in constant pain , was able to convince doctors that the thin 15 cm - long serrated plastic handle was stuck in the flesh of her bottom .
By then what should have been a routine procedure to remove it had become much more dangerous because the handle had become embedded in her pelvis .
After two unsuccessful operations in 2007 the mother - of - one was in such agony that she agreed to undergo further surgery in June last year despite being told it could prove fatal .
Mrs Corton spent more than 10 hours in surgery at Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham , central England , but died from massive blood loss .
Doctors who first saw her at Lincoln County Hospital and Grantham hospital , both in central England , were slammed for " serious errors " .
Recording a narrative verdict , West Lincolnshire coroner Stuart Fisher , said : " It was a significant foreign object .
It is difficult to imagine anything more significant . "
Mrs Corton 's husband , Peter , 61 , is taking legal action against United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust .
He said after today 's hearing : " OK she was drunk but they did n't take her seriously .
She showed them the wound but they did n't do a proper examination .
" I think it was probably down to the hospitals trying to save money and doing things as cheaply as possible . "

Stating P=NP Without Turing Machines
A statement of P=NP that uses only linear equations and their generalizations
George Dantzig is famous for the invention of the simplex method for solving linear programming problems .
Today I plan on presenting a definition and explanation of P=NP , but avoid the usual technical details that seem to be needed to explain the problem .
The approach will depend greatly on the famous linear programming problem and its generalizations .
Dantzig is a source of the “ legend ” that a student once solved an open problem that he thought was just a hard homework problem .
I heard various versions over the years , but his story is apparently genuine .
I quote his own words :
During my first year at Berkeley I arrived late one day to one of Neyman ’s ( Jerzy Neyman ) classes .
On the blackboard were two problems which I assumed had been assigned for homework .
I copied them down .
A few days later I apologized to Neyman for taking so long to do the homework – the problems seemed to be a little harder to do than usual .
I asked him if he still wanted the work .
He told me to throw it on his desk .
I did so reluctantly because his desk was covered with such a heap of papers that I feared my homework would be lost there forever .
About six weeks later , one Sunday morning about eight o’clock , Anne and I were awakened by someone banging on our front door .
It was Neyman .
He rushed in with papers in hand , all excited : “ I ’ve just written an introduction to one of your papers .
Read it so I can send it out right away for publication . ”
For a minute I had no idea what he was talking about .
To make a long story short , the problems on the blackboard which I had solved thinking they were homework were in fact two famous unsolved problems in statistics .
That was the first inkling I had that there was anything special about them .
I do wonder sometimes if P=NP will be solved this way .
Not knowing that a problem is “ impossible ” must have some psychological advantage .
Can we forget that P=NP is hard and take a fresh look at the problem ?
I wish .
Let ’s turn to the explanation .
If you know what a linear equation is , then I believe you will be able to follow my explanation of what “ P ” is , what “ NP ” is , and what “ P=NP ? ” means .
There will be no Turing machines mentioned anywhere — except here .
This mention does not count .
Even if you are an expert on P=NP , I hope you will like the approach I take here .
Linear Equations
In high school we all learned how to solve linear equations — at least we were “ taught ” how to solve such equations .
No doubt given the equations
we could all solve the linear equations and get that and .
One method is to try some values ; guess values or go through values in some order .
Another is to be more systematic and argue that implies that
which implies
by substitution .
This shows that , and thus and .
There is a systematic method of eliminating one variable at a time that was known to Carl Gauss over 200 years ago , and today we call his method Gaussian Elimination ( GE ) .
This algorithm ( GE ) is used everywhere , it is one of those fundamental algorithms that are central to computations of many kinds .
If Gauss were alive today between royalties on GE and the Fast Fourier Transform , he would be very wealthy .
One of the central questions we need to understand the P=NP question is how to measure the efficiency of algorithms .
One way to calculate the time GE requires is to count only the major operations of addition and multiplication that are performed .
Let ’s say we have equations on variables .
It is not hard to prove the cost of eliminating the first variable is about .
The next variable is a bit cheaper , but still costs at most .
The total cost is roughly
which adds up to order .
Linear Equations Over Non-Negative Numbers
In the above example of equations we did not say it explicitly , but we allowed rationals for the solution .
The solutions for and turned out to be integers , but this is usually not the case — often rational numbers are required .
For example ,
now has the solution and .
Note , the solution uses not only rational numbers , but also uses negative numbers .
Many linear systems that arise in practice require that the solutions be non-negative .
Suppose a company is trying to calculate how many trucks will be needed to haul their products , it is highly likely that that the values of the variables must be non-negative .
It does not make any sense to use trucks .
In general the problem of solving a linear system of equations with the added constraint that all variables are non-negative is called Linear Programming ( LP ) .
There is a fundamental difference and a fundamental similarity between plain linear equations ( LE ) and LP .
You probably did not learn in school how to solve such systems .
Even with a few variables the task of solving such a problem can be a challenge .
The surprise is we know something the great Gauss did not know .
We have a method for solving LP instances that is fast — almost as fast as GE — for solving linear equations .
The result is quite beautiful , was discovered after many doubted it existed , and is used today to solve huge systems .
Just as GE has changed the world and allows the solution of linear systems , the ability to solve LP has revolutionized much of science and technology .
The method is called the simplex method , and was discovered by George Dantzig in 1947 .
One measure of the importance of the LP is it is one of the few mathematical results whose inventors were awarded a Nobel Prize .
In 1975 Tjalling Koopmans and Leonid Kantorovich received this great honor .
You might note that Dantzig did not win , and the reason for that is another story — see here for some insights .
Another measure is the dozens of implementations of the algorithm that are available on the web — see this .
The computational cost of the simplex algorithm is surprisingly not much more than GE ’s cost .
In practice the running time is close to .
The exact running time of the simplex algorithm is complex — it is a technical detail I would like to skip .
But there are two points that I will mention about its running time .
The simplex algorithm is really a family of algorithms .
The algorithms all move from vertex to vertex of a certain geometric object : usually there is a choice for the next step , and the running time is sensitive to this choice .
For some choices it is known to be slow , and for other choices it works well in practice .
Even more complex there are choices that are open whether they always run fast .
The simplex algorithm is not the only way to solve LP ’s in practice or in theory .
I will not get into a discussion of the algorithms that have provable fast running times .
Linear Equations Over Natural Numbers
Linear systems can model even more interesting problems if we allow the solutions to only be natural numbers .
Now the variables must take on values from
The reason this is so useful is one of the great insights of complexity theory .
It was discovered by Gödel , Cook , Karp , and Levin .
These problems are called Integer Programming Problems ( IP ) .
They can express almost any practical or theoretical problem .
In many linear problems you can only allocate a whole number of something : try assigning of a person to a task or setting a value in a boolean circuit to .
These are not possible .
This is the reason IP problems rule , they can be used to solve essentially all problems .
We know more than Gauss , since we can solve LP’s .
But we are not that smart .
We are stuck at IP ’s .
We do not know how to solve these problems .
The central point of the P = NP question is , does there exist an algorithm for these problems like there does for rational linear systems ?
Put another way , does there exist an algorithm for IP ’s that is like those for Gaussian Elimination and LP ?
This is the central question .
A solution would have to take polynomial time — recall LE uses order time and LP uses order time .
No one knows .
The conventional wisdom is that there is no such algorithm , that IP ’s have crossed the threshold and cannot be efficiently solved .
They have extended simple linear systems so far that there can be no efficient way to solve them .
This fundamental question goes by the name of the “ P=NP ” question .
The name is easy to say , “ the P equal N P question , ” and you can write it down quickly .
Often we typeset it as
There are T - shirts for sale , in men ’s and women ’s sizes , that have this on their front .

P NE NP
Where I used to be a faculty member at Princeton , the Computer Science building has encoded in the bricks of the back of the building “ P=NP ? ” in ASCII code .
A flush brick stands for a and a missing brick stands for a .
Clearly , “ P=NP ” is an important problem , or are other conjectures encoded into buildings ?
You might want to know why the problem is called “ P=NP ? ” and not the “ Is there a fast way to solve integer programs problem ? ”
Okay that would an awful name , but why not something better ?
In mathematics there are several ways that problems get named .
Sometimes the first person who states the problem gets it named after them ; sometimes the second person .
Sometimes problems are named in other ways .
Programming IP
We call LP , linear programming , and we call IP , integer programming .
Both are real programming languages , even if they are different from standard programming languages .
A programming language allows one to express computational problems .
The difference with LP and IP is that they are not universal languages , which means they cannot express all computations .
They are not universal in the sense of Church — there are computations they cannot express .
Languages like C , C++ , Perl , Python , and Java are universal languages .
Anything can be expressed in them .
This is both their advantage and their disadvantage .
A universal language is great since it can do anything , but it also is subject to what Alan Perlis used to call the “ Turing tar - pit . ”
Beware of the Turing tar - pit in which everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy .
The dilemma is that if a language is more powerful , then many more problems are expressible in the language , but fewer properties can be efficiently checked .
If a problem can be written as a LP problem , than we know we can determine efficiently if it has a solution .
If , on the other hand , a problem can only be written as an IP problem , then we cannot in general determine if the problem has a solution .
This is the dilemma : one trades power of expression for ease of solution .
But both LP and IP are much more powerful then you might think .
LP can solve many important problems exactly , and even more problems can solved approximately .
IP can do just about anything that arises in practice .
For example IP can be programmed to do all of the following :
Break the AES encryption standard .
Factor an integer , and thus break the RSA public key system .
Find a 3 - edge coloring of a graph , if one exists .
Programming Tricks
Just like any other programming language there are “ tricks ” in programming IP .
To be a master IP programmer is not trivial , and I would like to present just a few simple tricks , and then show how to use them to solve 3 - edge coloring on a cubic graph .
As an IP programmer one trick is to be able use inequalities .
This is really simple : if we want the inequality
then we add a new variable and replace the above by the equality
Clearly , ( 1 ) is true if and only if ( 2 ) is true .
A common use of this is to force variable to lie in the set .
This is done by simply writing .
Since , is a non-negative integer it must be or .
Here is another cool trick .
Suppose we want to constrain to be in a finite set , we can program this in .
For example , to make lie in the set we use the following IP program .
where are all in the set .
Now suppose is a cubic graph on the vertices and edges .
Then , the IP program for 3 - edge coloring is the following : Let be the variables for the program .
Add constraints so that each is valued .
Then add the constraints for each vertex
where are adjacent vertices .
Suppose there is a solution to the program .
I claim that this yields a coloring of the edges .
Just color them according to their values .
The only issue is can some vertex get two colors that are the same .
Suppose the colors used are .
Now .
Clearly , cannot be else the sum is too small , also it can not be else the sum is too large .
So .
Then , which is a contradiction .
Limits on the Power of IP
I have said that IP can handle just about any problem you can imagine .
There are some limits on its power .
For example , there is no way to add constraints so that variables , , and satisfy
This is a curious result that seems “ obvious , ” but I do not know a simple proof .
I would be interested in a simple proof , but for now let ’s just say that there is no way to define multiplication .
Complexity Theory
For those who know some complexity theory , the approach I have taken to explain P=NP may seem a bit strange .
I hope even if you are well versed in complexity theory you will still enjoy the approach I have taken here .
In complexity theory the class of problems solved by LP is essentially all of P , and the class of problems solved by IP is all of NP .
The advantage of the approach here is that P=NP can be viewed as asking the question : Can all IP problems be programmed as LP problems ?
Note , to make this a precise question does require the notion of reduction .
I will not define that precisely here , but imagine that the changing an IP problem to an LP problem must be a reasonable type of transformation .
Conventional Wisdom
Most theorists seem to be sure that IP can not be solved efficiently .
One of the many reasons for this is the power of IP as a programming language .
There is just too much power , which means that if it were easy to solve , then too many problems would be easy .
I wonder before GE was discovered would many have thought that LE ’s are hard to solve , or before simplex was discovered would many have thought that LP ’s were impossible to solve ?
One approach that many have tried to resolve P=NP is to encode IP problems into LP problems .
The obvious difficulty is that a solution to a set of equations may have some of its variables set to proper rationals .
The idea many have tried is to make the linear equations so “ clever ” that there is no way that solutions can be fractional .
No one has yet shown a general method for doing this , which does not mean it is impossible , but it does mean it is hard .
Open Problems
Does this discussion help ?
Or is it better to present P=NP in the normal way ?
What do you think ?
Here is what we know ,
Most believe that all these subset relationships are strict , but it is possible that they all are equal .
This is one of the great mysteries of complexity theory .

As a mechanical engineering student I have some sort of weird fetish for catastrophic mechanical failures .
I saw something similar years ago in person , I wish I had photographed it - a VW 5 - valve that had a timing failure of some sort , and mashed all of the valves into the head .
One of the valve heads had broken off of the stem and embedded itself firmly ( at about a 70 * angle ) in the valve seat .
Clojure .contrib ’s logging / spy macro is really useful for quick investigation of bugs with unclear stack traces , and to check that intermediate values in a calculation are being returned and composed correctly .
Lazy sequences do n’t get logged correctly , however :
> ( log/spy [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] ) [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] ; ; ; prints " [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] => [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] " to the log > ( log /spy ( take 3 [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] ) ) ( 1 2 3 ) ; ; ; prints " ( take 3 [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] ) => clojure.lang.LazySeq@8592 " to the log
The spy macro logs a string realization of the sequence per se , rather than its constituents .
In the case of a concrete , fully realized sequence such as the literal vector in the first example , all values are known in advance , and the vector ’s string realization in the log can helpfully be its actual contents .
In the case of the lazy sequence returned by take , however , we get a less than helpful class name and some sort of instance identifier code rather than the actual contents of the sequence .
A lazy sequence saves resources by merely promising to provide the values when asked .
If they ’re never asked for , they ’re never computed .
Since they have n’t been computed , they ca n’t be printed .
A lazy sequence can also potentially be infinitely long , another good reason why they are not realized by default when converting the sequence to a string .
In our case , we do n’t care about the resource usage , and we ’re sure the sequence is finite .
We want to force all values to be computed for manual inspection .
( There are several ways of going about this . )
The following modification of the spy macro converts the lazy sequence into a regular seq :
( defmacro lazy - spy " Evaluates expr and outputs the form and its result to the debug log .
If the result is a lazy sequence , it is realized concretely in the log .
Returns the result of expr. " [ expr ] `( let [ a# ~ expr ] ( log/log : debug ( str ' ~expr " = > " ( if ( = clojure.lang .
LazySeq ( class a# ) ) ( seq a # ) a# ) ) ) a# ) )
This gives us :
> ( lazy - spy ( take 3 [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] ) ) ( 1 2 3 ) ; ; ; prints " ( take 3 [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] ) => ( 1 2 3 ) " to the log

The evidence that evolution has harnessed quantum entanglement , the subject of another recent report , continues to build .
Berkeley scientists have modeled the existence of quantum entanglement in a biological structure for the first time .
They have shown that , during photosynthesis , these entangled states can exist at high , physiologically relevant temperatures and relatively long timescales .
Classically , one can describe a system by separately considering the energy , momentum , position , or “ state ” of each of the constituent parts that make up that system .
In an entangled quantum system , the state of each part may be related to the state of other parts of the system — they are no longer independent .
Quantum entanglement can occur even if the parts are physically separated .
Photosynthesis in green sulphur bacteria is accomplished by a light - harvesting apparatus in three basic steps .
First , a chlorosome antenna captures photons .
Second , the energy from the captured photon is transferred from the antenna through the Fenna - Matthews - Olson protein ( FMO ) to the reaction core .
Finally , the energy is used by the reaction core to do chemical work .
The FMO is a trimer of proteins , each of which contains seven bacteriochlorophyll - a molecules .
In their work , the scientists have shown that that the states of these bacteriochlorophyll - a molecules could be entangled to one another .
Their model has predicted entangled states in the FMO complex at high temperatures — about 300 K , which is above room temperature — and shown that the entangled states exist at measurable time scales .
The authors note that the FMO complex may be too small to take advantage of the entangled states , but theorize that entangled states in more complex photosynthesis systems may increase the efficiency , regularity , and robustness of photosynthesis .
The entangled states ca n’t be detected at present , but the models have laid out what we should be looking for using new methods that are under development .

Have We Discovered Evidence For Life On Titan
If the loss of hydrogen at the surface is correct , the non-biological explanation requires that there be some sort of surface catalyst , presently unknown , that can mediate the hydrogenation reaction at 95 K , the temperature of the Titan surface .
That would be quite interesting and a startling find although not as startling as the presence of life .
by Chris McKay
Moffett Field CA ( SPX ) Jun 08 , 2010
Recent results from the Cassini mission suggest that hydrogen and acetylene are depleted at the surface of Titan .
Both results are still preliminary and the hydrogen loss in particular is the result of a computer calculation , and not a direct measurement .
However the findings are interesting for astrobiology .
Heather Smith and I , in a paper published 5 years ago ( McKay and Smith , 2005 ) suggested that methane - based ( rather than water - based ) life - ie , organisms called methanogens - on Titan could consume hydrogen , acetylene , and ethane .
The key conclusion of that paper ( last line of the abstract ) was " The results of the recent Huygens probe could indicate the presence of such life by anomalous depletions of acetylene and ethane as well as hydrogen at the surface . "
Now there seems to be evidence for all three of these on Titan .
Clark et al. ( 2010 , in press in JGR ) are reporting depletions of acetylene at the surface .
And it has been long appreciated that there is not as much ethane as expected on the surface of Titan .
And now Strobel ( 2010 , in press in Icarus ) predicts a strong flux of hydrogen into the surface .
This is a still a long way from " evidence of life " .
However , it is extremely interesting .
Benner et al. ( 2004 ) first suggested that the liquid hydrocarbons on Titan could be the basis for life , playing the role that water does for life on Earth .
Those researchers pointed out that " ... in many senses , hydrocarbon solvents are better than water for managing complex organic chemical reactivity " .
Two papers in 2005 followed up on this logic by computing the energy available for methanogenic life based on the consumption of both the organics in Titan 's atmosphere along with the hydrogen in the atmosphere ( McKay and Smith , 2005 ; Schulze - Makuch and Grinspoon , 2005 ) .
Both papers made the case that H2 on Titan would play the role that O2 plays on Earth .
On Earth organisms ( like humans ) can react O2 with organic material to derive energy for life 's functions .
On Titan organisms could react H2 with organic material to derive energy .
The waste product of O2 metabolism on Earth is CO2 and H2O ; on Titan the waste product of H2 metabolism would be CH4 .
As a result of the Cassini mission , there is now abundant evidence for CH4 , even in liquid form , on Titan .
Organic molecules on the surface of Titan ( such as acetylene , ethane , and solid organics ) would release energy if they reacted with hydrogen to form methane .
Acetylene gives the most energy .
However this reaction will not proceed under ordinary conditions .
This is similar to our experience on Earth .
Consider a chocolate bar in a jar full of air .
The organics in the chocolate would release energy if they reacted with the oxygen in the air but the reaction does not proceed under normal conditions .
There are three ways to make it proceed : heat it to high temperatures ( fire ) , expose it to a suitable metal catalyst that promotes the reaction , or eat it and use biological catalysts to cause the reaction .
Biology can thrive in an environment that is rich in chemical energy but requires a catalyst for the chemical energy to be released .
Such is the case on Titan .
McKay and Smith ( 2005 ) predicted that if there were life on Titan living in liquid methane then that life should be widespread on the surface because liquid methane is widespread on the surface .
We have direct evidence that the surface of Titan at the landing site of the Huygens Probe near the equator was moist with methane , and radar and near - infrared imagery from Cassini have revealed extensive polar lakes on Titan , both north and south .
Methane - based life would have a lot of environments in which to live .
Again , this is analogous to Earth .
Life is widespread on Earth because it uses water and water is widespread on Earth .
Furthermore , because it is widespread , life on Earth , in turn , has a profound effect on the environment .
For example , each spring the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere drops as plants consume it to form leaves ; each autumn , the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere goes up as these leaves decompose .
That is , because of the ubiquity of life , the Earth breathes : one breath in during the spring , one breath out during the autumn .
Widespread life has observable effects .
Taking this logic to Titan , McKay and Smith ( 2005 ) predicted that Titanian life at the surface would consume near - surface hydrogen and that this might be detectable .
The depletion of hydrogen is key because all the chemical methods suggested for life to derive energy from the environment on Titan involve consumption of hydrogen ( McKay and Smith 2005 ; Schulze - Makuch and Grinspoon 2005 ) .
Acetylene , ethane , and solid organic material could all be consumed as well .
Acetylene yields the most energy , but all give enough energy for microorganisms to live .
A few notes about liquid methane based life on Titan .
First , while such life would produce CH4 it would not be a net source of CH4 but would be merely recycling C back into CH4 - undoing the photochemistry caused by sunlight in the upper atmosphere .
It does not explain the persistence of CH4 on Titan over geological time .
Second , it is impossible to predict any isotopic effect that this life might have on C .
On Earth , methanogens produce CH4 from CO2 + H2 , or from organic material derived from CO2 .
The net reaction is CO2 + 4H2 => CH4 + 2H2O and thus methanogens on Earth are a net source of CH4 in a world of CO2 .
The enzymes that mediate these reactions create methane with a large isotopic enrichment of 12C over 13C of ~ 5 % .
On Titan , it has been predicted that methanogens would produce CH4 by C2H2 + 3H2 => 2CH4 ( eg. McKay and Smith 2005 ) .
This is obviously not a net source of CH4 : it merely recycles CH4 , thereby undoing the photolysis of CH4 and there is no a priori reason to expect the resulting CH4 to exhibit an isotopic shift from these reactions .
The C - C bond in acetylene is strong but this by itself does not imply a strong isotopic selectivity .
For example , life on Earth breaks the strong bond between the N atoms in N2 without leaving a clear isotopic effect .
Thus , the istopic state of C on Titan is not relevant to the question of the presence of Titanian methanogens ..
The data that suggests that there is less ethane on Titan than expected is well established ( Lorenz et al. 2008 ) .
Photochemical models have predicted that Titan should have a layer of ethane sufficient to cover the entire surface to a thickness of many meters but Cassini has found no such layer .
The new results of Clark et al. ( 2010 ) find a lack of acetylene on the surface despite its expected production in the atmosphere and subsequent deposition on the ground .
There was also no evidence of acetylene in the gases released from the surface after the Huygens Probe landing ( Niemann et al. 2005 , Lorenz et al. 2006 ) .
Thus , the evidence for less ethane and less acetylene than expected seems clear and incontrovertible .
The depletion of ethane and acetylene become significant in the astrobiological sense because of this latest report of a hydrogen flux into the surface
This is the key that suggests that these depletions are not just due to a lack of production but are due to some kind of chemical reaction at the surface .
The determination by Strobel ( 2010 ) that there is a flux of hydrogen into the surface of Titan is not the result of a direct observation .
Rather it is the result of a computer simulation designed to fit measurements of the hydrogen concentration in the lower and upper atmosphere in a self - consistent way .
It is not presently clear from Strobel 's results how dependent his conclusion of a hydrogen flux into the surface is on the way the computer simulation is constructed or on how accurately it simulates the Titan chemistry .
In conclusion , there are four possibilities for the recently reported findings , listed in order of their likely reality :
1 . The determination that there is a strong flux of hydrogen into the surface is mistaken .
It will be interesting to see if other researchers , in trying to duplicate Strobel 's results , reach the same conclusion .
2 . There is a physical process that is transporting H2 from the upper atmosphere into the lower atmosphere .
One possibility is adsorption onto the solid organic atmospheric haze particles which eventually fall to the ground .
However this would be a flux of H2 , and not a net loss of H2 .
3 . If the loss of hydrogen at the surface is correct , the non-biological explanation requires that there be some sort of surface catalyst , presently unknown , that can mediate the hydrogenation reaction at 95 K , the temperature of the Titan surface .
That would be quite interesting and a startling find although not as startling as the presence of life .
4 . The depletion of hydrogen , acetylene , and ethane , is due to a new type of liquid - methane based life form as predicted ( Benner et al .
2004 , McKay and Smith 2005 , and Schulze - Makuch and Grinspoon 2005 ) .

With that hotly - anticipated May 12th release date just around the corner , you might be wondering how Steam on Mac will perform .
You 're in luck , because some of our favorite Mac news sites have just finished testing the software 's closed beta .
The verdict ?
It 's practically the exact same as the Windows version , except there 's almost nothing to buy .
Save for the Growl - like notifications at the top of the screen , the UI is all but indistinguishable , and as promised , data and purchases ( if playable ) automatically carry over in their entirety from your Windows Steam account .
Team Fortress 2 even has cross-platform capability , allowing Mac users to play online with their Windows counterparts , though several journalists noted you might want to invest in a two - button wheel mouse if you do n't want to be found out .
Source Engine performance on Mac was n't quite as good as on Windows in tests using the exact same hardware ( thanks , Boot Camp ) , but admirably comes close nonetheless ; Electronista was able to maintain a similar framerate in Portal just by disabling two levels of anti-aliasing .
Not all Mac users will be able to partake in these games , however ; though a MacBook Pro with a discrete 512MB GeForce 8600 M card could run them well and a GeForce 9400 M laptop managed on low settings , those with only integrated Intel graphics chips might find themselves in for a painful surprise .

“ Law & Order ” is going out with a bang — taking a snarky swipe at the city ’s infamous “ rubber rooms ” for teachers in its series swan song .
NBC ’s war - horse drama , famous for using New York City as its backdrop , ends its 20 - season run May 24 with an episode that pulls no punches , titled “ Rubber Room . ”
There ’s a tangible sense of disdain shown toward the “ rubber - room ” system , in which city teachers collect full salaries for sitting on their butts while awaiting disciplinary hearings — or “ doing crossword puzzles , sorting recipes , ” according to a school administrator who ’s interviewed by “ L& O ” Detectives Lupo ( Jeremy Sisto ) and Bernard ( Anthony Anderson ) .
That system , which cost taxpayers $ 30 million a year , has now been abolished , thanks in part to The Post ’s crusading coverage .
In the “ Rubber Room ” episode , Lupo and Bernard are assigned to investigate a rogue Web site run by an anonymous blogger named “ Moot , ” who ’s apparently armed to the teeth and threatening to blow a city school to smithereens .
Most of Moot ’s rants focus on his former teachers , and after gaining access to a site in which city teachers gossip about their jobs , Lupo and Bernard are steered toward a “ Temporary Assignment Center ” in Queens .
“ Welcome to the rubber room , ” says a droll administrator who shows the detectives two separate rooms in which groups of teachers sit — one plucking his eyebrows , another lazily squeezing a hand exerciser — “ seven hours a day , five days a week ” while waiting for their disciplinary cases to be heard .
Lupo and Bernard then interview several rubber - room teachers who seem to fit the profile of those targeted on Moot ’s site — including a science teacher , now exiled to Suffolk County , who received a four - month suspension for allegedly “ branding kids with crosses ” — when in fact he merely ran a coil over their arms during a class lesson on electric energy .
Another rubber - room teacher tearfully tells the detectives that his 30 - year career was destroyed after he was charged with hitting a student — when all he did was swipe at the kid ’s gelled hair to get him to pay attention .
“ I barely touched him , ” he sobs .
A third teacher says he was accused of child molestation after trying to stop a student from urinating in a classroom trash can .
In typical “ Law & Order ” fashion , Lupo and Bernard crack the case — but you ’ll have to wait for the episode to see the bounce they get from their rubber - room rendezvous .

A rally of about 40 white supremacists Saturday on the lawn of Los Angeles City Hall drew hundreds of counter - protesters , sparked brawls in which two people were severely beaten and ended with crowds of demonstrators hurling rocks and bottles at police and departing supremacists .
The rally , conducted by the National Socialist Movement , prompted the Los Angeles Police Department to go on tactical alert as counter - protesters from throughout the region flooded into downtown L.A .
They included a wide assortment of African American , Jewish , Latino , immigrants - rights and anarchist groups .
While some counter - protesters said they had heard about the event through social media such as Twitter and had come to urge peace in the face of the group ’s hateful message , others had clearly come for a fight .
At least five of them were arrested by the end of the demonstration for throwing eggs and rocks .
Before members of the white supremacist group had arrived , a bare - chested middle - aged man with Nazi insignias tattooed on his chest and back walked into a crowd of hundreds of counter - protesters gathered near 1st and Spring streets .
Surrounded , the man mockingly bobbed his head to the rhythm of demonstrators chanting “ Nazi scum . ”
About a dozen protesters suddenly began pelting the man with punches and kicks .
He fell and was struck on the back with the wooden handle of a protester ’s sign , which snapped in two .
Police eventually reached the man and pulled him from the melee , as blood poured from the back of his neck .
Another man was rushed by a mob on Spring Street .
He was punched in the face and kicked for about 20 seconds before police made it to the scene .
After that beating was broken up , the man began running south on Spring Street , only to be chased down by a protester and slugged in the face .
He collapsed and his face slammed to the curb as protesters began pummeling him again .
The bloodied man was then escorted away by police .
Both victims were treated and released , police said .
His sign , unclear in its intended meaning , read “ Christianity =Paganism=Heathen$ " with an arrow pointing at a swastika .
“ Gosh , I think he just did n’t have a clear message .
I do n’t even think he was a Nazi , ” said one man , looking at the broken pieces of the sign left behind .
The neo - Nazi group had obtained a permit for its demonstration earlier in the week , and police prepared the rally area by taping off a section of City Hall ’s shaded south lawn .
About 12:30 p.m. , members began delivering anti-immigrant tirades and shouts of “ Sieg Heil ” that echoed down the street .
“ We are tired of you clogging up our streets , ” shouted one white supremacist .
Another group member repeatedly denounced illegal immigrants , saying , “ If the city supports illegal aliens and criminals , that is treason . ”
A counter - protester shouted back with a bullhorn .
“ You ’re being protected by black and Latino cops , you cowards ! ” she said .
The rally ended around 2:30 p.m. with counter - protesters rushing toward the criminal courts building parking lot where the white supremacists had parked their cars .
Dozens of them hurled rocks and glass bottles at the neo -Nazis and their police escorts .
One vehicle failed to start .
As a group of white supremacists attempted to jump - start the car , others raised swastika - emblazoned shields over their heads to protect themselves from projectiles .
After the white supremacists left , police allowed the crowds to dissipate .
Cmdr .
David Doan said the LAPD ’s goal was to protect free speech and avoid using force .
“ There was a tremendous amount of restraint shown by our officers , ” he said .
“ We allowed both sides to exercise their 1st Amendment rights . ”
Doan said it was a frustrating situation for LAPD officers .
“ We took some rocks and bottles when they arrived , and we took some again when the car had some trouble starting . ”

StreetCandy Mnemonics and observation can help you to unleash more of your memory power .
It 's a gut - wrenching moment : you need to introduce someone , but you 've completely forgotten their name .
Or you 're in a big meeting and it's your turn to speak , but the vital information has dropped out of your mind .
If this sounds familiar , you 're not alone .
Chances are , we 've all experienced that pit - of - the - stomach feeling when our memory lets us down .
But in a fast - paced , information rich environment , developing a strong memory is more valuable than ever .
The good news is that there are plenty of tools to help .
The ancient Greeks taught their students systems for recalling key information , and many memory - boosting techniques have been developed over the centuries since .
In this article , you can learn tried - and - tested mnemonic systems for making remembering easier , and other principles that you can put to good use immediately .
What Are Mnemonics ?
" Mnemonic " is simply another word for memory tool .
Mnemonics are techniques for re-packaging information , helping your brain to store it safely – and find it again at the right moment .
Think about some of the mnemonics you 've heard over the years .
You may well remember facts , rules or spellings with the help of mnemonics , such as :
" Thirty days hath September , April , June and November … "
" ROY G. BIV " ( for the colors of the rainbow )
" Big Elephants Can't Always Understand Small Elephants " ( to spell the word " because " )
Mnemonics often use rhymes and rhythms to make hard - to - learn information stick in our brains .
Many of them also rely on images , senses , emotions , and patterns – which are key features in the wider memory techniques that have been developed .
Our brains are built to learn like this .
No wonder we find it much harder to remember information presented as black - and - white words on a page !
Tip :
Think of mnemonics as ways to boost what your brain can do anyway .
Often , the information you want is in there " somewhere " – you just need a tool to help you reach it quickly when it counts .
Creating Rich , Reliable Memories
Exploring the common features of well - used memory techniques will help you to choose the most effective strategy for you .
Let 's look at the four key aspects : images , senses , emotions , and patterns .
Images
Research has shown that our memories are activated more strongly by images than words .
We 're particularly good at recognizing pictures we 've seen before .
Think about how many signs , symbols and logos you can identify in a split second .
You can easily start inventing your own images to help you remember .
To remember a task you need to do in the future , you could try creating a vivid mental image of it actually happening .
And when you meet someone new , spend a few seconds picturing something – anything – that might give you a visual reminder of their name .
Senses
Your brain can combine multiple senses to create strong memories .
Some of our most powerful recollections are encoded through smells , tastes and touch sensations , as much as through sights and sounds .
Use as many senses as you can to learn and remember .
Do n't just picture the things to buy at the grocery store : imagine smelling , touching and tasting them , too .
Imagine that you 're learning about a new concept at work .
You could think about building a physical model of it .
Give your memory several different sensory routes back to the original information .
Emotions
Even important and serious material can be given a humorous twist in your imagination .
Make your imagery exciting , weird and wonderful , and you 've got a much better chance of remembering it .
Be playful and mischievous .
It 's no coincidence that rude rhymes are very difficult to forget !
To remember an important idea that comes up in a meeting , highlight what 's most exciting about it – or challenging , surprising or funny .
When you meet someone new , spend a moment thinking about whether their name seems to " match " their character .
Patterns
You give information a pattern when you use rhymes and rhythms , or turn sets of letters into mnemonic words or phrases .
Examples of this are the SMART Goals acronym , which is a mnemonic for goals that are Specific , Measurable , Achievable , Realistic , and Time - bound ; and the phrase Every Good Boy Deserves Football , for remembering the notes on the lines of the treble clef , EGBDF .
As you 'll see below , some memory techniques use spatial patterns to store vast amounts of information .
To remember a telephone number for a short time , you could repeat it to yourself rhythmically .
Or , when you 're taking notes , experiment with different ways of organizing and arranging your words on the page .
Designing Effective Mnemonics
As you start inventing mnemonics of your own , keep in mind three more principles : imagination , association and location .
Imagination : create images that are vivid , engaging , and rich enough to jog your memory .
You could be visualizing a real situation in order to remember and re-use it , or inventing one that will help you write , say or do something in the future .
Association : make the most of your brain 's habit of linking ideas .
Separate pieces of information can be linked so that you remember them all .
That might help you remember all the items to pack for a trip , for example .
Or , two ideas can be paired , so that one thing reminds you of another .
Using that strategy , you might think of your colleague holding a microphone to recall his name is Mike .
Location : use your memories of real - world places to help you remember new material .
Since you can easily remember the layout of your home , why not use the rooms to " hold " items from the list you 're trying to learn ?

The Main Memory Techniques
The three principles above have been developed into a number of specific memory techniques .
They can be divided into three main categories :
1. Image clues : these are memory tools in which ideas are represented by pictures .
Just like logos or icons , image clues can trigger your brain to think about complex ideas .
Memorable , multi-sensory images are associated with others in pairs or sequences , or arranged in your " mind 's eye " around familiar places .
Specific systems have been developed to " peg " new information onto ready - made images .
2. Storytelling strategies : these are tools that capitalize on the fact that well - told stories are automatically memorable .
Storytelling strategies allow you to link individual image clues into long chains , in order to remember lists , processes , and all the points you want to make in essays or presentations .
You can get an extra memory boost by choosing a setting that relates to your subject matter .
3. Spatial systems : these are tools that let you use all the real - world journeys you know to store new information .
These journeys might include your route from home to work , or a favorite countryside walk .
You also know your way around many different buildings , and you can imagine their layouts with ease .
Spatial systems allow you to associate key images with particular places , or to visualize them positioned around familiar routes in your mind .
When the time comes to recall some information , you can go back in your imagination and " find " the images you left behind – helping you to retrieve important details quickly and accurately .
Start experimenting with some of these mnemonic principles and you 'll discover that you can quickly become much more confident about your memory !
Note :
We have a selection of memory - boosting resources that explain how you can apply all the techniques described above .
Image clues are used powerfully in the Number / Rhyme Mnemonic .
The Link and Story Methods explains storytelling strategies .
A good spatial system to start with is the Roman Room System .
It 's even possible to combine different techniques , to create memory methods that are exactly right for you .
BP ’s request for tax records poses a problem for some residents of fishing communities in southeastern Louisiana — the nonconformists who have n’t kept records or reported their cash income .
The first step for a commercial fisherman or coastal business seeking compensation for losses suffered in the oil spill seems simple enough : Submit copies of a commercial fishing license , proof of residence and tax statements .
But the request for tax records poses a serious challenge to some residents of close - knit fishing communities on the swampy edges of southeastern Louisiana , which for generations have harbored self - reliant nonconformists who do n’t pay much heed to everyday rules and regulations .
In other words , they often get paid in cash — and do n’t always report it .
“ I worked for an uncle last year who paid me in cash , ” said a crab fisherman who asked to remain anonymous .
“ The BP guy wanted my tax statements , but how can I pay taxes if everything I earned was in cash ? ”
Many people involved in the seasonal harvesting of shrimp , crabs , oysters and fish — boat washers , fishermen , crab cookers , deckhands , dockworkers — said they felt caught by a pincer of environmental devastation and an assistance program that could expose them to the tax man .
Not surprisingly , only a few folks here were willing to talk openly about the dilemma .
“ We have our own little world , and the whole world is invading it right now , ” said Erwin Menesses , 43 , who specializes in sewing and repairing fishing nets .
“ You are not going to find our legacy in the paperwork they are asking us to produce .
It ’s not there . ”
Another man , who asked that his name not be used because he does not report income from selling hundreds of pounds of blue crab cooked each week in his garage , said he worried BP would turn over records to the Internal Revenue Service .
“ That puts you in the system , ” he said .
“ If the numbers do n’t add up , people who have not been paying taxes are going to regret it . ”
BP officials said that more than 25,000 claims had been submitted and that more than 12,000 payments totaling about $ 36 million had been sent to people facing financial ruin .
As part of an effort to resolve disputes , BP on Wednesday said it would appoint an independent mediator to help review and process claims .
Local elected officials this week began discussions with BP aimed at persuading the company to revise the way it processes claims in order to accommodate people who live and work on the edges of civilization and never bothered to maintain detailed financial records .
“ We want BP to know that their calculations have not been comprehensive enough , ” said St. Bernard Parish President Craig Taffaro .
“ We are talking about people who are scraping by and frightened , and do n’t think in terms of corporate America .
All they want is to return to work and live life the way they have for generations . ”
Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser agreed .
“ The question I ’m asking BP to consider is this :
What are you going to do to make sure the guy who helps unload boats for tips , or the elderly lady who sells shrimp at the corner for a few bucks , gets adequately compensated ? ”
In an interview , BP spokesman Graham MacEwen said , “ BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles has been telling parish council members over the past few days that if someone ’s tax documents are not available , we will find other metrics .
I do n’t know exactly how we are going to do that yet . ”
In the meantime , the problem has people on edge in remote bayou neighborhoods such as Delacroix , a lush narrow island about 4 miles long that is home to alligators , gnarled oaks draped with Spanish moss and hundreds of permanent residents , many of them descendents of Spanish Canary Islanders who settled here in the late 1700s .
Only a few months ago , the chatter on Delacroix ’s rickety wooden docks was optimistic .
Five years after Hurricane Katrina , fishermen and seafood wholesalers were predicting record sales of shrimp and blue crabs .
Standing at the edge of a dock fronting a tawny river shimmering with minnows , Curtis Morales , owner of Island Seafood wholesale company , said , “ Every year since 2007 , product unloaded on this dock has increased by half a million pounds . ”
Morales , who said he keeps meticulous records , recently received an interim check from BP for $ 5,000 .
But he likes to tell of a less fortunate woman he saw at a local disaster center while waiting to submit his claim .
“ This woman in the line next to me told the BP processor she earned $ 800 a week — in cash — as a deckhand , ” he recalled .
“ When he asked her for tax statements , she said she had not filed a federal income tax form since 2000 .
Then she said , ‘ I need a check from you so that I can pay back taxes and then show you the tax records . ’ ”
Over at the little bayou boat marina he bought two years ago , Michael Turgeau was tearing his modest trailer apart in search of any document that he could use to shore up the claim for losses he filed with BP on Tuesday .
Only a few months ago , Turgeau , 47 , was busily preparing for an onslaught of sport fishermen from as far away as Mississippi and Alabama .
His business strategy : $ 10 per boat launch and $ 25 for 100 bait shrimp .
Cash only , please .
“ Man , I wish I ’d done a better job of record - keeping , ” Turgeau said , shaking his head .
“ I took a shot at a claim , but all I had in terms of documents was a fishing license , a bait license and a marina license . ”
“ Trouble is , people around here live differently — always have , ” he added .
“ If BP is really interested in helping us out , they should identify everyone who has had a commercial fishing license for at least two or three years , then close their eyes , do n’t ask questions and just pay them for their losses . ”
Wayne Landry , council chairman for St. Bernard Parish , which includes Delacroix , would not go that far .
But he also worried that an undetermined number of people from fishing outposts would be overlooked because BP and “ the bean counters in the Internal Revenue Service do not deal with culture or heritage ; they deal with numbers . ”

The Head Start program , overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services and administered by the Office of Head Start , provides child development services primarily to low - income families and their children .
Federal law allows up to 10 percent of enrolled families to have incomes above 130 percent of the poverty line -- GAO refers to them as " over- income . "
Families with incomes below 130 percent of the poverty line , or who meet certain other criteria , are referred to as " under- income " .
Nearly 1 million children a year participate in Head Start , and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided an additional $ 2.1 billion in funding .
GAO received hotline tips alleging fraud and abuse by grantees .
In response , GAO investigated the validity of the allegations , conducted undercover tests to determine if other centers were committing fraud , and documented instances where potentially eligible children were put on Head Start wait lists .
The investigation of allegations is ongoing .
To perform this work , GAO interviewed grantees and a number of informants and reviewed documentation .
GAO used fictitious identities and bogus documents for proactive testing of Head Start centers .
GAO also interviewed families on wait lists .
Results of undercover tests and family interviews cannot be projected to the entire Head Start program .
In a corrective action briefing , agency officials agreed to address identified weaknesses .
GAO received allegations of fraud and abuse involving two Head Start nonprofit grantees in the Midwest and Texas .
Allegations include manipulating recorded income to make over - income applicants appear under - income , encouraging families to report that they were homeless when they were not , enrolling more than 10 percent of over - income children , and counting children as enrolled in more than one center at a time .
GAO confirmed that one grantee operated several centers with more than 10 percent over - income students , and the other grantee manipulated enrollment data to over - report the number of children enrolled .
GAO is still investigating the other allegations reported .
Realizing that these fraud schemes could be perpetrated at other Head Start programs , GAO attempted to register fictitious children as part of 15 undercover test scenarios at centers in six states and the District of Columbia .
In 8 instances staff at these centers fraudulently misrepresented information , including disregarding part of the families ' income to register over - income children into under - income slots .
The undercover tests revealed that 7 Head Start employees lied about applicants ' employment status or misrepresented their earnings .
This leaves Head Start at risk that over - income children may be enrolled while legitimate under - income children are put on wait lists .
At no point during our registrations was information submitted by GAO 's fictitious parents verified , leaving the program at risk that dishonest persons could falsify earnings statements and other documents in order to qualify .
In 7 instances centers did not manipulate information .
To see selected video clips of GAO enrollments , see http://www.gao.gov/products/gao-10-733T.
In addition , GAO found that most of the 550 Head Start centers contacted had wait lists .
GAO also found that 2 centers where it enrolled fictitious children later became full and developed wait lists after the fictitious children had been withdrawn .
Only 44 centers reported that they had openings .
GAO interviewed families on wait lists from other centers and found that many stated that their incomes were at or below the federal poverty level .
In some cases , families stated they had experienced some type of domestic violence , or were receiving some type of public assistance , a group automatically eligible for Head Start .
GAO did not attempt to verify family statements .
The 41 - Year - Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It ( 2010 ) 7 of 10
See parents talk about the different ways they address race with their young children as part of " AC360 " special coverage " Black or White : Kids on race " tonight 10 p.m. ET
( CNN ) -- A 5 - year - old girl in Georgia is being asked a series of questions in her school library .
The girl , who is white , is looking at pictures of five cartoons of girls , all identical except for skin color ranging from light to dark .
When asked who the smart child is , she points to a light - skinned doll .
When asked who the mean child is she points to a dark - skinned doll .
She says a white child is good because " I think she looks like me " , and says the black child is ugly because " she 's a lot darker . "
After watching her daughter answer the questions , the mother is brought to tears .
Her daughter is taking part in a new CNN pilot study on children 's attitudes on race and her answers actually reflect one of the major findings of the study , that white children have an overwhelming bias toward white , and that black children also have a bias toward white but not nearly as strong as the bias shown by the white children .
Full coverage : Kids on race
Renowned child psychologist and University of Chicago professor Margaret Beale Spencer , a leading researcher in the field of child development , was hired as a consultant by CNN .
She designed the pilot study and used a team of three psychologists to implement it : two testers to execute the study and a statistician to help analyze the results .
Full doll study results
Her team tested 133 children from schools that met very specific economic and demographic requirements .
In total , eight schools participated : four in the greater New York City area and four in Georgia .
The mother , whose name the study prohibits from being used , says her daughter has " never asked her about color " and that the results of the test were an eye opener , and she says she and her daughter " talked a long time about it "
Her daughter 's perception on race and the fact that the issue was not taken up at home is in many ways typical .
Research and discussions with parents of the children who participated in this study , indicate that white parents as a whole do not talk to their kids about race as much as black parents .
A 2007 study in the Journal of Marriage and Family found that 75 percent of white families with kindergartners never , or almost never , talk about race .
For black parents the number is reversed with 75 percent addressing race with their children .
Po Bronson , author of NurtureShock and an award - winning writer on parenting issues says white parents " want to give their kids this sort of post - racial future when they 're very young and they 're under the wrong conclusion that their kids are colorblind .
...
It 's in the absence of messages of tolerance that they will naturally ... develop these skin preferences . "
Many African - American parents CNN spoke to during the study say they begin discussing race at a very early age because they say they feel they have to prepare their children for a society where their skin color will create obstacles for them .
i Report :
Where do we go from here ?
The study has generated thousands of comments to CNN .
After seeing the report , iReporter Omekongo Dibinga said , " My daughters are 4 and 2 years old .
I did n't realize that at 2 years old I 'd have to start teaching them to be proud of their skin color . "
Watch his reaction
The father of a black girl who took part in the CNN study says , " You can not get away from the fact that race is a factor but hopefully what we instill in them at home will help them to put that in its right place and move on "

Wherever exists exploitation and suppression , rebellion erupts .
If the exploited are a majority of the society , the revolt draws even nearer and comes with a louder bout .
For the past 30 years witnessing China 's meteoric rise , multinationals and upstart home tycoons have rammed up their wealth making use of China 's favorable economic policies as well as oversight loopholes .
In sharp contrast , tens of millions of Chinese blue - collar workers who have genuinely generated the wealth and created the prosperity have been left far behind .
According to the All - China Federation of Trade Unions , a quarter of Chinese workers have not had a raise in pay in the past five years .
The figure is perilously worrisome .
Their harsh working conditions , low living standards and hardships in supporting older and younger family members add up , exacerbating psychological pressure .
The long queues of luxury cars running in China 's cities shine our eyes , verifying modernization of a huge country , but none of the flotilla belongs to the above " quarter of Chinese workers " whose salaries are at a standstill .
It is logical to claim their livelihood is actually on decline taking in account the price rises in the years .
Hence , there came the widely - reported mass labor strike at Japan 's Honda 's joint venture production line in Guangdong Province to demand for a higher pay , and the spate of rising employee suicides crippling Taiwan 's Foxconn Technology Group 's mainland plant in Shenzhen City .
Reports say that the Honda workers ' walk - out since May 27 has forced four Honda automobile assembly lines in China to shut doors because of shortage of key engine parts , inflicting huge losses on the firm .
Honda finally agreed to a 24 percent pay rise to the workers who returned to work last week .
Also , Foxconn management has agreed to workers ' uniform pay rise of 30 percent .
The pay rises are long overdue .
They should have come prior to workers ' took radical measures .
Never expect something like labor strike to happen in China ?
Please bear in mind that workers on this globe belong to the same group .
When the exploited laborers are forced to toil extra time , work under huge pressure and earn disproportional tiny wages -- often at less than 1,500 yuan ( US $ 220 ) a month in China , the disappointment and frustration gather and grow to anger , and eventually revolts break out .
For sure , the Honda and Foxcoon workers will boost and embolden other low - wage workers to move and defend for their legitimate labor and human rights .
The allegation by some that the Honda strike has highlighted tensions between Chinese workers and foreign companies is simply not true , because it 's totally unfair and unruly for businesses to seek exorbitant profits at the cost of their employees .
Now , some analysts have argued that workers ' rising demand for higher salary would deprive China as a source of cheap labor and drive multinationals to move to other countries like India and Vietnam .
But , is n't time for this country to say no to low - value and labor - intensive manufacturing , and make a small climb on the industrial ladder ?
Is n't business 's overexploitation of employees disgraceful ?
Is n't Chinese workers ' demand for a higher pay justified ?
( As a matter of fact , Japanese employees in that Honda plant are paid 50 times more than the average Chinese workers ) .
The government has a role to play .
For many years , it has been , unethically , friendly in policy - making towards businesses in order to ratchet up economic growth , but done little to solidify the interests of the workers .
As a result , as the country has raked in stacks of foreign currencies as reserves , and businesses and tycoons had deep pockets , the welfare of vast laborers has been hardly improved .
The sustainability of the country 's growth is now at stake .
Only when the low - paid , long - neglected and voiceless are taken care of by the government , the blue - collar workers ' unrest , now brewing in some factories , wo n't cascade , spread and form crushing waves .
A new soft drink made from cow 's urine may be launched in India by a hard line Hindu group known for their opposition of Western food imports .
The manufacturers say small quantities of the liquid produced by Hinduism 's revered holy cows is being mixed with products such as aloe vera and gooseberry to fight diseases .
An officer in charge of the manufacturing unit in Kanpur said the product will be sold nationwide and that it will beat other soft drinks .

UC Irvine is set to open an $ 80 - million stem cell research building next week .
On Friday , leaders from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine , UCI and the newly crowned Sue and Bill Gross Hall : A CIRM Institute , will unveil the 100,000 - square - foot research center .
The institute , which was designed exclusively for basic stem cell research and clinical studies , is one of several CIRM has developed in California .
“ CIRM was created for this reason , ” said John Robson , vice president of operations for the institute .
“ Regenerative medicine is the future of medicine ... California is going to lead the way .
” Stem cells are basic human cells that can be grown and developed into body tissues , including those for spinal cords and organs .
In 2004 , about 59 % of California voters passed Proposition 71 , which allocated about $ 3 billion in state funds for stem cell research , including embryonic stem cells .

It is incredibly hard to put into words the absolute horror that is happening in the Gulf of Mexico right now .
The millions of gallons of oil that have gushed into the Gulf of Mexico and BP ’s efforts to fight the massive leak are turning the Gulf into a lifeless toxic stew of oil and chemicals .
The damage caused to wildlife in the Gulf by this spill will be incalculable .
Entire species are at risk of being wiped out .
Scientists are telling us that the primary dispersant being used by BP ruptures red blood cells and causes fish to bleed .
This is by far the greatest environmental disaster in U.S. history , and there is no end in sight .
It is a worse environmental and economic disaster than all of the hurricanes of the past ten years combined .
The great wetlands and beaches along the Gulf of Mexico will never be the same in our lifetimes .
The seafood and tourism industries in the Gulf are being completely destroyed .
The thousands of jobs and businesses being wiped out by this disaster could potentially throw the entire Gulf coast region into a depression .
The damage already caused by this oil spill is beyond measure and yet the government tells us that up to 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) of oil a day continue to flow into the Gulf of Mexico .
Federal officials have expanded the “ no fishing ” area in the Gulf of Mexico to 75,920 square miles .
That is 31 percent of all federal waters in the Gulf .
As the oil continues to spread out there may soon be nowhere to fish .
And the oil is starting to come ashore in more places .
Red - brown oil was found on Alabama ’s Dauphin Island on Tuesday .
As Gulf coast residents slowly watch this oil destroy everything around them they are starting to realize that this is it .
Life along the Gulf of Mexico will simply never be the same again .
The following are 30 shocking quotes about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill that reveal the soul - crushing horror this disaster is causing ….
#1) Councilman Jay LaFont of Grand Isle , Louisiana :
“ As long as you have something to look forward to , a little glimmer of hope , you can move on .
But this just drained everything out of us . ”
# 2) Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish :
“ They said the black oil would n’t come ashore .
Well , it is ashore .
It ’s here to stay and it ’s going to keep coming . ”
#3) Prosanta Chakrabarty , a Louisiana State University fish biologist :
“ Every fish and invertebrate contacting the oil is probably dying .
I have no doubt about that . ”
# 4 ) Marine toxicologist Dr. Susan Shaw , director of the Marine Environmental Research Institute on BP ’s use of chemical dispersants :
“ They ’ve been used at such a high volume that it ’s unprecedented .
The worst of these – Corexit 9527 – is the one they ’ve been using most .
That ruptures red blood cells and causes fish to bleed .
With 800,000 gallons of this , we can only imagine the death that will be caused . ”
# 5) Dr. Larry McKinney , director of the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies in Texas :
“ Bluefin tuna spawn just south of the oil spill and they spawn only in the Gulf .
If they were to go through the area at a critical time , that ’s one instance where a plume could destroy a whole species . ”
# 6) Carol Browner , Barack Obama ’s adviser on energy and climate :
“ This is probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country .
It is certainly the biggest oil spill and we are responding with the biggest environmental response . ”
# 7 ) Richard Charter of the Defenders of Wildlife :
“ It is so big and expanding so fast that it ’s pretty much beyond human response that can be effective . …
You ’re looking at a long - term poisoning of the area .
Ultimately , this will have a multidecade impact . ”
#8 ) Reverand Mike Tran :
# 9 ) Louis Miller of the Mississippi Sierra Club : “ We do n’t know when this will ever be over .
It ’s a way of life that ’s under assault , and people do n’t when their next paycheck is going to be . ”
“ This is going to destroy the Mississippi and the Gulf Coast as we know it . ”
# 10 ) Dean Blanchard , owner of a seafood business :
“ I hold Obama responsible for not making BP stand up and look at the people in the face and fix it . ”
# 11 ) Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal :
“ The day that we ’ve been fearing is upon us . ”
# 12 ) Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , about BP CEO Tony Hayward :
“ We ought to take him offshore and dunk him 10 feet underwater and pull him up and ask him ‘ What ’s that all over your face ? ”
# 13 ) Former Clinton adviser James Carville :
“ The country feels like it ’s entitled to abuse this state and forget about us , and we are sick of it . ”
# 14 ) An anonymous Louisiana resident :
“ A hurricane is like closing your bank account for a few days , but this here has the capacity to destroy our bank accounts . ”
# 15 ) U.S. Representative Edward Markey :
“ I have no confidence whatsoever in BP .
I think that they do not know what they are doing . ”
# 16 ) Gulf coast resident Marie Michel :
“ Immediately , it ’s no more fishing , no more crabbing , no more swimming , no more walking on the beach . ” # 17 ) Brenda Prosser of Mobile , Alabama :
“ I just started crying .
I could n’t quit crying .
I ’m shaking now .
To know that our beach may be black or brown , or that we ca n’t get in the water , it ’s so sad . ”
# 18 ) Qin Chen , an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge on the possibility that a hurricane could push massive amounts of oil ashore along the Gulf :
“ A hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico this year would be devastating . ”
# 19 ) Retired Army General Russel Honore on the effect this spill is having on residents of the Gulf coast :
“ I ’m sure , every time they hear a negative word , their skin crawls , ’ cause they need these jobs . …
This is what ’s going to put their kids in school , and what pays the rent . ”
# 20 ) A group calling itself “ Seize BP ” :
# 21 ) Louisiania Governor Bobby Jindal : “ The greatest environmental disaster with no end in sight !
Eleven workers dead .
Millions of gallons of oil gushing for months ( and possibly years ) to come .
Jobs vanishing .
Creatures dying .
A pristine environment destroyed for generations .
A mega-corporation that has lied and continues to lie , and a government that refuses to protect the people . ”
“ There has been failure , particularly with the effort to protect our coast and our marsh .
And that was the biggest topic of discussion in a very frank meeting we had with the president . ”
# 22 ) BP ’s chief operating officer , Doug Suttles :
“ This scares everybody — the fact that we ca n’t make this well stop flowing , the fact that we have n’t succeeded so far . ”
# 23 ) Doug Rader , chief ocean scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund :
“ You simply can not make more ( reefs ) , unless you have a few thousand years to wait . ”
# 24 ) Public Service Commissioner Benjamin Stevens :
“ You get hit by a hurricane and you can rebuild .
But when that stuff washes up on the white sands of Pensacola Beach , you ca n’t just go and get more white sand . ”
# 25 ) Wilma Subra , a chemist who has served as a consultant to the Environmental Protection Agency :
“ Every time the wind blows from the south - east to the shore , people are being made sick . ”
# 26 ) Hotel Owner Dodie Vegas :
“ It ’s just going to kill us .
It ’s going to destroy us . ”
# 27 ) Louisiana resident Sean Lanier :
“ Until they stop this leak , it ’s just like getting stabbed and the knife ’s still in you , and they ’re moving it around . ”
# 28 ) White House energy adviser Carol Browner :
# 29 ) “ There could be oil coming up until August . ”
Marine toxicologist Dr. Susan Shaw , director of the Marine Environmental Research Institute :
“ We ’ll see dead bodies soon .
Sharks , dolphins , sea turtles , whales : the impact on predators will be seen in a short time because the food web will be impacted from the bottom up . ”
# 30 ) Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser :
“ We will die a slow death over the next two years as this oil creeps ashore . ”
" South Korea 's submission of its report to the UN will clearly force China into making a stance and this will be a challenge .
This will be handled by the Foreign ministry , but my view is that China , in accordance with its rising status as a major country , should not go against the rest of the world , but should consider its interests in line with the majority , " he added .

The news of the departures of J Allard and Robbie Bach from Microsoft 's Entertainment and Devices division has been met with a remarkable breadth of opinion .
Bach and Allard were both instrumental in the development and marketing of the Xbox console .
Bach led Microsoft's Home and Entertainment Group , which encompassed the Xbox , Games for Windows , and Microsoft 's consumer - oriented hardware and software products .
In 2005 , he was made president of the newly formed Entertainment & Devices ( E&D ) division , which spans four areas : the Interactive Entertainment Business , responsible for Xbox , Xbox 360 , Games for Windows , Zune , and Windows Media Center ; the Media Platforms Business , which includes MediaRoom and PlayReady ; the Mobile Communications Business , covering Windows Mobile / Windows Phone , Kin , and related software and services ; and the Specialized Devices & Applications Business , which covers Microsoft Hardware , Surface , Office for Mac , and Windows Embedded .
Allard worked on Xbox , undergoing a remarkable change in image from chubby nerd to laid - back , trendy , all - around cool guy .
After Xbox , he worked on Zune and the recently released Kin .
He was also involved in the fascinating Courier project , terminated last month .
Way back in the 1990s , J Allard was the person who made Microsoft realize the importance of the Web and the Internet , in a memo that brought about a remarkably swift change in direction for the software giant .
Both men claim that their near - simultaneous resignations are coincidental .
Bach says that he 's retiring , more interested in improving his handicap than continuing to work .
Allard says that he wants to pursue his sporting ambitions .
Unlike Bach , Allard says that he 's going to continue to work with Microsoft , advising CEO Steve Ballmer on a number of unspecified projects in the future — in contrast to the past , which he described as 95 % Microsoft , 5 % life , he wants it to be 5 % Microsoft , 95 % life .
There has been recent speculation that J Allard was leaving Microsoft as a result of dissatisfaction over the Courier project .
However , with both being Microsoft veterans ( 22 years for Robbie Bach , 19 for J Allard ) , and both men having no real need to work for a living anymore , it 's just as plausible that they 're leaving for all the reasons they 've publicly stated .
Get out while you can still save your rep ?
All this money has only gotten Microsoft to second place in the market ; both the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 lag far behind Nintendo 's Wii .
Being more cynical , one might be a little surprised that Robbie should choose to retire just as two major E&D products — Natal and Windows Phone 7 — are due to hit the market .
As a rule , people do n't tend to abandon ship shortly before two of the biggest product launches that their division has made for five years unless they want to distance themselves from those products as soon as they can .
As a result of the twin departures , the Entertainment and Devices division is being reorganized .
Neither man is leaving the company immediately .
Robbie Bach will depart some time in the fall , and J Allard after a few months , to ensure a smooth hand - over .
Robbie Bach will not be replaced , or at least not immediately .
Instead , Don Mattrick , vice president of Interactive Entertainment Business , and Andy Lees , vice president of Mobile Communication Business , will report directly to Steve Ballmer , effective July 1st .
Office for Mac is being moved to Microsoft 's Business Division ( where Windows Office resides ) .
The remainder of the Specialized Devices & Applications Business will continue to operate under Bach , with no plan yet confirmed for what happens after that .
Beyond E&D , a number of other bodies are being shuffled around .
But the major impact is in E&D .
The reactions range from " it 's about time " to " this is disastrous . "
A key reason for the different viewpoints is perception of E&D 's performance , especially Xbox's .
Has Xbox successfully established Microsoft as a player in the living room ( if that was even a worthwhile endeavor , which is far from clear ) , or has it been a hugely expensive misadventure ?
Evaluating E&D
Microsoft 's consumer electronics track record is poor .
The original Xbox worked well enough , but lost money hand - over - fist — a consequence of being put together in a hurry , using what were essentially commodity PC parts .
The Xbox 360 has started making money after several years of substantial losses ( exacerbated by chronic unreliability issues ) , but even this modest success is arguably as much to do with Sony 's dubious managerial decisions as it is to any particular quality of the Xbox 360 .
Hoping for your competitor to fail is n't a business model .
And all this money has only gotten Microsoft to second place in the market ; both the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 lag far behind Nintendo 's Wii .
Even that second place is not assured ; Microsoft beat
Sony to market by some months , and attained a sizable sales lead , but Sony is slowly beginning to fight back and diminish that advantage .
On the other hand , the Xbox 360 has some tricks up its sleeve .
Project Natal , due later this year , will bring radically new interaction options to the console by doing away with traditional controllers ; it 's hoped that this will rejuvenate the console and give its sales a healthy boost .
A case can be made , then , that the Xbox has been a success ; with it , Microsoft has established a strong presence in the living room , with a product that 's remarkably popular ( even in spite of its appalling reliability record ) , and the days of massive losses should be in the past , at least until Xbox 4 π is announced .
The success of E&D 's other products — or rather , the lack thereof — is much less contentious .
The Zune was a derivative , " me-too " product , whose major differentiating feature — Wi -Fi — was crippled to the point of uselessness and lumbered with cringe - worthy branding ( " squirt " ) , to boot .
Though its successor , the Zune HD , is a delightful piece of hardware , it too has languished in obscurity — a hamstrung third - party development environment coupled with a complete lack of international availability and weak promotion meant it had no chance of ever competing with the iPod touch .
The frustrating part of the Zune HD is that it really is a good media player .
The Zune software is also attractive and pleasant to use ( if not as fully featured as one would like ) .
But it took too long to arrive ; Microsoft 's initial forays into the media player market , with the ill - fated PlaysForSure scheme and then the original Zune , allowed the iPod and iTunes to become so firmly entrenched that Redmond had virtually no chance of displacing them .
It simply took Microsoft too long to realize that the only way to be effective in these consumer electronics markets was to build the whole widget .
And even that lesson was n't learned properly .
Ms Goldfarb - Albak maintains a kosher diet , but likes working with pigs
By Heather Sharp
BBC News , southern Israel
A female pig by the name of Barbie lies anaesthetised on a bed , a pulse monitor clipped to her snout as it pokes out from under a blanket Staff in blue medical scrubs crowd around her , examining an image of the inside of her colon , shown on a computer screen above the bed .
Unusually in the pig world , Barbie was raised by Jews .
Researcher Sharon Goldfarb - Albak strokes the animal 's head tenderly .
" I love pigs !
The Bible says do n't eat pig , so I do n't eat pig , but that does n't mean I can't pet them and make them my friends , " she says .
The researchers are testing a new design of colonoscope as part of the battle to improve screening for colorectal cancer which , she explains , is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the Western world .
Pork plant Kibbutz Lahav is a controversial enterprise in Israel , the world 's only predominantly Jewish state .
Research manager Ofer Doron tucks into pork chops happily Eating pork is prohibited under Jewish dietary laws , and to many Jews the pig has a deep cultural symbolism representing all that is unholy .
Raising pigs for pork has been banned in Israel since 1963 , apart from in a small , traditionally Arab - Christian area in the north of the country .
The kibbutz maintains vehemently that the primary purpose of its herd is for medical research , which makes the operation legal .
" We work with pigs for the sake of humans , " says Ofer Doron , the manager of the institute .
He explains that the pig has many physiological similarities to humans , and the Kibbutz 's herd is used by companies from around Israel for testing medical devices , drugs and drug delivery systems .
However , it also has a factory .
Animals that have been used in research cannot be used for food , but excess pigs , and those raised to provide organs for research , are processed to be sold for meat .
And when the day 's medical trial is over , some of the researchers tuck in as Mr Doron doles out plates of sizzling pork chops from a barbecue .
Mr Doron is passionately secular and a proud pork eater .
But he says about a quarter of the Kibbutz 's staff are kippa- wearing , religious Jews , happy to work with the pigs for research , but not to consume their meat .
" Saving lives is one of the biggest Jewish commandments , " he says .
The Kibbutz has gathered a collection of model pigs
A short walk along the kibbutz 's leafy paths , Ofer 's father , Eri Doron , 78 , one of the founders of the collective farm , recalls that the pig - farming began almost by accident .
The early kibbutziks were given three pigs as a gift - " from I do n't know where " - which they kept in nearby caves .
An accomplished musician fluent in English , Hebrew , Italian and Hungarian , he tells me he survived unscathed as a teenager , living in Budapest , as Jews from across Eastern Europe were taken to the Nazi death camps .
He was from a religious family , but as a youth would sneak out to restaurants in Hungary to eat pork sausages without his mother 's knowledge .
Eri Doron says the Kibbutz 's first three pigs came as a gift
His father committed suicide shortly after the war ended , and Mr Doron boarded a ship to begin a new life in the recently - founded state of Israel .
The Kibbutz was strongly socialist , and " very revolutionary " , based on utopian Marxist ideals , he says .
And there was no debate at all , he stresses , about keeping pigs - " we are atheists , " he says simply .
Elise Gelkoff , who has lived on the kibbutz for the past 40 years , says secularism in the Kibbutz movement was strongly linked to the post - holocaust mentality .
The aim was to create " new Jew " .
" It was a shared view that we will never be victims again , we will work our own land , we will be strong , we wo n't take part in the superstitions that comprise religion , we 'll see a new clear rationalistic way . "
Growing demand
But over the years , the Kibbutz 's identity has changed .
Pork is on the dining room menu less - just Fridays and holidays - these days , as more traditional and religious Jews have moved in .
Nevertheless , in Israel as a whole , demand for what is sometimes euphemistically dubbed " white meat " has grown in recent decades .
Researchers say pigs have many useful similarities to humans
This is partly because of an influx of secular Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union , but items such a prosciutto are increasingly making an appearance on trendy Tel Aviv menus .
As pork imports are generally banned , most of the meat on sale is domestically produced - with Kibbutz Lahav providing just under a tenth of the total produce .
The kibbutz faces strong criticism in a society with a deep - running secular - religious divide .
Animal rights activists object to its research and say the pigs ' conditions are not good enough , but Ofer Doron says the animals are well looked after and all activities comply with Israeli law .
' Disrespectful '
And although many religious Jews accept the use of pigs for medical purposes , they accuse the kibbutz of using the research as little more than an excuse for selling pork for profit .
And the aversion to pigs runs deep for some - to the point where swine flu was renamed " Mexican flu " to avoid offence .
Rabbi Vilk says he would find it very difficult to touch a pig Rabbi Shlomo Vilk , the leader of a Jerusalem synagogue , says that the pig , even more than other animals considered non-kosher , has become the symbol of everything that for Jews is " unpure , filthy and dirty " .
As well as the dietary prohibition , he says , the Romans who destroyed the second Jewish temple in AD70 had the pig as their emblem , and as a result , Jewish sages also prohibited raising the animals on the land of Israel .
" It became a symbol of something which Jews do n't do to bring it into the public realm , to say ' this is our flag ' and ' this is what we do ' , yes , I do think it 's wrong , " he says .
" This is disrespect for so many Jews . "
Even so , he believes that to use pigs for medical purposes is to find , as he puts it , " sparks of divinity " in the prohibited animals .
But would he go as far as touching one ?
There is a long , awkward silence .
" Do n't push it .
I do n't know , " he says .
" In principle - yes .
In practice , I do n't believe so . "

1.3 ) What does {some strange unix command name} stand for ?
awk = " Aho Weinberger and Kernighan " This language was named by its authors , Al Aho , Peter Weinberger and Brian Kernighan .
grep = " Global Regular Expression Print " grep comes from the ed command to print all lines matching a certain pattern g/re / p where " re " is a " regular expression " .
fgrep = " Fixed GREP " .
fgrep searches for fixed strings only .
The " f " does not stand for " fast " - in fact , " fgrep foobar *.c " is usually slower than " egrep foobar *. c " ( Yes , this is kind of surprising .
Try it . )
Fgrep still has its uses though , and may be useful when searching a file for a larger number of strings than egrep can handle .
egrep = " Extended GREP " egrep uses fancier regular expressions than grep .
Many people use egrep all the time , since it has some more sophisticated internal algorithms than grep or fgrep , and is usually the fastest of the three programs .
cat = " CATenate " catenate is an obscure word meaning " to connect in a series " , which is what the " cat " command does to one or more files .
Not to be confused with C/ A/T , the Computer Aided Typesetter .
gecos = " General Electric Comprehensive Operating Supervisor "
When GE 's large systems division was sold to Honeywell , Honeywell dropped the " E " from " GECOS " .
Unix 's password file has a " pw_gecos " field .
The name is a real holdover from the early days .
Dennis Ritchie has reported : " Sometimes we sent printer output or batch jobs to the GCOS machine .
The gcos field in the password file was a place to stash the information for the $ IDENT card .
Not elegant . " nroff = " New ROFF " troff = " Typesetter new ROFF " These are descendants of " roff " , which was a re-implementation of the Multics " runoff " program ( a program that you 'd use to " run off " a good copy of a document ) .
tee = T From plumbing terminology for a T - shaped pipe splitter .
bss = " Block Started by Symbol " Dennis Ritchie says : Actually the acronym ( in the sense we took it up ; it may have other credible etymologies ) is " Block Started by Symbol . "
It was a pseudo - op in FAP ( Fortran Assembly [ - er ? ] Program ) , an assembler for the IBM 704-709-7090 -7094 machines .
It defined its label and set aside space for a given number of words .
There was another pseudo - op , BES , " Block Ended by Symbol " that did the same except that the label was defined by the last assigned word +
1 . ( On these machines Fortran arrays were stored backwards in storage and were 1 - origin . )
The usage is reasonably appropriate , because just as with standard Unix loaders , the space assigned did n't have to be punched literally into the object deck but was represented by a count somewhere .
biff = " BIFF " This command , which turns on asynchronous mail notification , was actually named after a dog at Berkeley .
I can confirm the origin of biff , if you 're interested .
Biff was Heidi Stettner 's dog , back when Heidi ( and I , and Bill Joy ) were all grad students at U.C. Berkeley and the early versions of BSD were being developed .
Biff was popular among the residents of Evans Hall , and was known for barking at the mailman , hence the name of the command .
Confirmation courtesy of Eric Cooper , Carnegie Mellon University rc ( as in " .cshrc " or " /etc/rc " ) = " RunCom " " rc " derives from " runcom " , from the MIT CTSS system , ca. 1965 .
' There was a facility that would execute a bunch of commands stored in a file ; it was called " runcom " for " run commands " , and the file began to be called " a runcom . " " rc " in Unix is a fossil from that usage . '
Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie , as told to Vicki Brown " rc " is also the name of the shell from the new Plan 9 operating system .
Perl = " Practical Extraction and Report Language " Perl = " Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister " The Perl language is Larry Wall 's highly popular freely - available completely portable text , process , and file manipulation tool that bridges the gap between shell and C programming ( or between doing it on the command line and pulling your hair out ) .

If you are the lucky owner of an Android device , you might struggle from time to time with finding the perfect apps to fit your lifestyle and meet your needs .
And often , the Internet at large can be less than helpful when you 're searching for Android - specific applications .
As we saw during Google I/O , the company was demonstrating a fuller - featured , web - based version of the Android Market .
It 'll likely be seen by consumers soon , but it 's always good to have a few more wrenches in your tool belt when it comes to finding and judging apps .
Here are seven websites for your bookmarking pleasure .
Each one acts as a directory , a review site , a screenshot gallery and a stats board for the wonderful world of Android mobile apps .
Take a look around these sites , and let us know in the comments if we left out any good resources .
We first have the official Android Market website .
However , rather than being an exhaustive guide to the Android app universe , the site is currently " a showcase for some of the featured and top ranked applications and games available , " according to its landing page .
To get the full , official Android Market experience , you 'll have to check your mobile device .
However , we expect this to change relatively soon , especially as more Android apps become available on devices other than our phones .
The site has a decent list of featured and top apps with brief descriptions and two screenshots each .
This resource has a listing for just about every Android app known to humankind .
It 's searchable , thoroughly categorized and contains relatively accurate stats for number of downloads and star rating on Android 's 5 - star scale .
It also contains frank user reviews , screenshots , QR codes for download , and , when available , video demonstrations .
One drawback is that the developer - supplied descriptions are often less than descriptive and , in the case of free trial and subscription apps , can be downright deceptive at times .
When in doubt , check the user reviews .
The UI is also a bit cluttered , and pages can be relatively slow to load .
The site also contains stats , forums and special sections for games and the top app of the day .
For data geeks , Cyrket is the holy grail of Android - related sites .
This one - man project uses " advanced data analysis and extraction to help users find apps to buy and to allow developers to learn how their applications fit into the extended ecosystem of the mobile application marketplace , " or so says the homepage .
There are also plans to include a blog with specific , interesting findings and better ways to discover new apps .
With all this advanced analysis comes a highly useful breakdown of apps ' ratings .
For example , would you rather know that an app gets 4 stars in the Android Market , or that 80 % of users gave the app 4 stars and 15 % gave the app 5 stars ?
You can also find QR codes , screenshots , descriptions and user comments for most apps .
Apps can also be searched and sorted by popularity , rating , price and other factors .
Finally , the interface is simple but clean and useful , with a bare minimum of advertising to interfere with your discovery process .
AndroidZoom is a straightforward , easy - to - use app directory .
Its app pages contain descriptions , screenshots , rating and QR codes , but no user feedback such as reviews or comments .
The site does , however , show similar or related apps from the same and other developers .
You can also see the most viewed and most downloaded applications , and you can browse apps by category or search term .
Apps can be sorted by popularity , rating , date submitted and whether they 're free or paid .
It 's a colorful site full of large - text links and friendly - looking icons ; this is another site that 's simple and gets the app - finding job done .
This site has the usual suspects in features : Search , browsing by category , screenshots , QR codes , etc .
A unique factor of App Store HQ is that it aggregates Android app reviews from around the web , including sites such as this one .
You can browse through apps that are generating a lot of buzz on the web or apps that are heating up in Twitter mentions .
Posts and tweets are aggregated onto an app's page , so you can get a good idea of real - time activity around an app before you decide to download it .
This , we like a lot .
AndBOT is probably one of the best - looking sites when it comes to researching Android apps .
It 's also thoroughly outfitted with a blog and regular app reviews .
You can check out the latest apps , browse featured apps or peruse applications and games in a wide variety of categories .
For each app's page , the site pulls in comments from the Android Market proper and includes stats , screenshots and a QR code for instant download .
You can also see developer info and app permissions .
Finally , we have AppBrain .
This site has search , rankings , categories , screenshots , related apps and on - site commenting features .
It 's also got a fairly simple layout .
One of its unique factors is being able to see changelogs for new versions and dates for how quickly an app progresses through the number - of - downloads tiers .
Better yet , users can sign in with a Google account to enjoy site membership , which includes the ability to make lists of apps , install apps with a single click and write reviews .
Logged - in users can also see " My Apps , " a collection of the apps they 've installed already ; they simply use the AppBrain free mobile application to sync their AppBrain account to their mobile devices .

The advent of the artificial heart has spurred scientists to pursue synthetic kidneys and pancreases as well .
Still , one key obstacle to realizing such devices is powering them after they have been implanted .
Instead of having to constantly recharge them by hooking them up to some external system — or , worse , periodically removing them and replacing their batteries — researchers would prefer that these machines somehow harvest energy from their hosts .
Now there is hope that future implants might be powered not by batteries but by the fuels in our bodies that are used for energy .
Scientists have shown that fuel cells implanted in rats can successfully generate electricity from sugar in the rodent 's bodies .
The devices kept going for months at a time .
The most potent sugar - powered fuel cells to date , so - called glucose biofuel cells , rely on enzymes that harvest electricity from chemical reactions — for instance , the combination of glucose with oxygen , both available in the human ( and rat ) body .
Compounds dubbed " redox mediators " then act like wires , transporting electric charge from these enzymes to electrodes that lead from the fuel cell to whatever device it is powering .
Scientists are currently pursuing a variety of such devices to generate electricity in an environmentally friendly manner .
Unfortunately , the enzymes used in past glucose biofuel cells were not suitable for implants , because they either required highly acidic conditions to work or were inhibited by a variety of ions found in the body .
The newly developed devices lack these constraints and are the first functional implantable glucose biofuel cells , with prototypes in rats stably generating power for at least three months .
" It becomes possible to envisage development of implantable robots capable of compensating for failing functions in human beings , " says researcher Philippe Cinquin , a biomedical engineer at Université Joseph Fourier in Grenoble , France .
Past glucose biofuel cells kept the enzymes and redox mediators in close proximity to electrodes by chemically bonding them on .
However , not all enzymes and redox mediators lend themselves well to such bonding .
Instead , Cinquin , with electrochemist Serge Cosnier and their colleagues , forego these bonds — they just physically pack enzymes and redox mediators into place on electrodes and then wrap the kind of membranes used in dialysis bags around them all .
These semipermeable membranes allow fuel to flow in while keeping the enzymes and redox mediators from leaking out .
That arrangement gave the scientists an opportunity to investigate enzymes that are more compatible with the body , an issue that had been neglected before .
Their most efficient prototype relied on composite graphite discs loaded with the enzymes glucose oxidase and polyphenol oxidase .
Its two electrodes , which altogether took up just 0.266 milliliters of the 5 - milliliter fuel cell , in total generated a peak power level of 6.5 microwatts , or millionths of a watt .
( The current from the fuel cell fed into wires leading out of the body into hardware that controlled and measured the device , so it did not shock the rodents . )
The scientists detailed their findings online May 4 in the journal PLoS ONE .
A milliliter 's worth of these electrodes could in principle generate a peak power level of 24.4 microwatts , more than the 10 microwatts typically needed by pacemakers , the researchers added .
The size of the devices matches well , too — pacemakers are typically between 10 milliliters and 25 milliliters in size , Cinquin says .
Given the success so far in rats and the fact that the prototypes are wrapped in plastics already clinically approved for implants , Cinquin sees no reason why they cannot work in people as well , and he hopes they will find a use in five to 10 years .
A subsidiary company of his university , Floralis , will pursue industrial partners for this work , or perhaps launch a startup .
The first application of these fuel cells could be to power artificial urinary sphincters , which would require up to 200 microwatts , Cinquin explains .
Currently 10,000 new patients each year suffer from incontinence after their prostates are removed , and their only recourse right now is a cumbersome pump inserted into their scrotums that patients have to press in order to urinate .
A more ambitious target would be an artificial kidney , which would require 20 milliwatts , or thousandths of a watt , to perform the same water - maintenance functions as kidneys do in people .
An artificial heart is even further off , requiring at least several watts .
" The device they demonstrate brings a new level of performance to implantable biofuel cells , " says chemical physicist and chemical engineer Plamen Atanassov at the University of New Mexico , who did not take part in this study .
However , " it is an open question as to whether their device can become more powerful to sufficiently revolutionize the field — I think they 've pretty much taken it to the limit , " Atanassov adds .
The problem lies in the extracellular fluid such devices would get their fuel from in the body — the levels of the oxygen there are roughly 1,000 times less than the available glucose .
" I do n't think there 's enough of an oxygen supply there , " he says .
Cinquin is more confident they can improve the performance of the devices by tinkering with enzymes and redox mediators .
In as yet unpublished work , " we have already improved performance by a factor of at least 50 , " he says .
" Powering artificial hearts by glucose biofuel cells remains a long - term research objective . "
As expected , retail chain Borders today started selling the Kobo eReader device in Australia for $ 199 both through its stores and online , promising that the Kobo platform would allow readers to access their eBooks on other platforms such as the iPhone and iPad .
In a statement issued by Borders at the Sydney launch of the device , REDGroup Retail , which operates the Borders brand in Australia , said that over 2 million titles – including “ a great range of dedicated Australian content ” –- would be available over the Kobo platform .
“ Through our partnership with global eBook retailer Kobo , we are bringing a whole new level of choice , control and flexibility to Australian book lovers , ” said REDGroup group managing director Dave Fenlon .
Fenlon said the Kobo eBooks could be accessed on the iPhone , BlackBerry , Android , iPad , PC or dedicated eReading device .
“ We have developed a range of free apps for iPhone , iPad and other leading devices in the market so eBooks can be downloaded directly to those devices , ” he said .
The company is also planning to advance its technology so that customers will be able to bookmark pages in books and have those bookmarks automatically transfer across to other devices when they open a specific eBook .
Australian content
Fenlon said Borders had created an “ eBook store for Australians ” to specifically serve the local market .
“ We are delighted to have secured content deals with Australian publishers , both large and independent , ensuring long - term sustainable content for our eBook platform , ” he said .
“ Over 100 publishers have come on board .
New titles will constantly be added to the already 2 million available , ensuring we always have a comprehensive content offering . ”
“ Australians are early adopters of new technology and moreover they are avid readers , and we believe there is a very strong appetite for eBooks in this country . ”
In Borders ’ press pack it had promotional material for Australian titles such as Ray Martin ’s autobiography .
Borders also said it would make 100 eBooks available free with its eReader – although most of those listed in promotional material were titles for which copyright restrictions have expired – such as Jane Austen ’s Pride and Prejudice or Leo Tolstoy ’s War and Peace .
Full specifications for the Kobo eBook reader are available online , but in brief , the device has a 6 ” screen and weighs 221g .
It does n’t have an LCD screen like the Apple iPad – instead using the e-ink format which the Amazon Kindle shares .
Borders said the eReader can hold 1,000 eBooks and can also have its storage expanded with an additional SD memory card .
However , unlike the Amazon Kindle , users will not be able to download eBooks directly to the device – they will need to sync it with their PC first .

In this CCTV image provided by the Alice Springs Reptile Centre , a seven - year - old boy throws a turtle over a wall in Alice Springs , Australia , on Wednesday .
( ( Alice Springs Reptile Centre / Associated Press ) )
The director of an Australian zoo said on Friday he is " horrified " after a seven - year - old boy broke into the zoo , fed an assortment of animals to a crocodile and clubbed various lizards to death with a rock .
The boy 's attacks happened early Wednesday and were captured on a zoo security camera , said Rex Neindorf , director of the Alice Springs Reptile Centre in Australia 's Northern Territory .
The boy , whose identity cannot be revealed , jumped the zoo 's security fence before bludgeoning three lizards to death with a rock , including the zoo 's much - loved 20 - year - old goanna , which he then fed to " Terry , " an 11 - foot , 440 - pound saltwater crocodile , said Neindorf .
The boy also threw several live animals into the crocodile 's enclosure , and at one point tried to clamber over the fence surrounding the enclosure in an effort to get closer to the crocodile .
A total of 13 animals , including a turtle , bearded dragons and a thorny devil were killed as a result of the attacks , said Neindorf .
" We 're horrified that anyone can do this and saddened by the age of the child , " said Neindorf .
The animals , worth about $ 5,500 , were n't rare but they will be hard to replace , he said .
Commenting on the surveillance footage at the scene , Neindorf said the boy 's face appeared to be largely blank during his rampage .
" It was like he was playing a game . "
The zoo 's security system , which relies on sensors to detect intruders , probably did n't spot the boy because of his small size , said Neindorf .
No charges for boy , parents face lawsuit
Under Northern Territory law , no child under the age of 10 can be criminally charged , so Alice Springs police will not be pressing charges against the boy .
But Neindorf said he will sue the boy 's parents .
" I just want people to learn that they can't let their children go and run amok , " Neindorf said .
" If we ca n't put the blame onto the child , then someone has to accept the responsibility . "
According to the new study , the majority of people rated online privacy as one of their major concerns when using the internet after both Google and Facebook were hit by rows over people 's private details being disclosed on the web .

We know that Prius owners love their cars .
Sometimes they talk endlessly about them , their great fuel efficiency , how cool the all - electric mode is , and so forth .
But could you get so enthusiastic about Prius that you 'd let your own child starve to death ?
Good .
We did n't think so .
And , no , it 's not what you 're thinking .
This has nothing to do with the iconic hybrid-electric Toyota Prius .
Instead , in a bizarre quirk of language , a South Korean 3 - D fantasy game is called Prius Online .
According to CNN , Kim Yun-jeong , 25 , and her partner , Kim Jae - beom , 41 , left their 3 - month - old daughter Kim Sa-rang unattended during marathon sessions in the virtual world -- in which they raised a virtual girl named Anima , who gained magical powers as she grew .
Kim Jae - beom will serve two years in prison , while a similar sentence was suspended for Kim Yun- jeong , who is expecting the couple 's second daughter in August .
Both defendants appeared contrite in court .
CNN notes that the highly publicized case has contributed to a growing debate in South Korea over gaming addiction and its effects on the larger society , in particular those people who are already marginally connected or estranged .

So far I ’ve been incredibly underwhelmed at what we ’ve seen from this film .
The poster was a jumbled mess and uninspired , but the just announced teaser trailer might even be worse .
Typically the teaser trailer is the first time we get to see footage of the film , and it ’s a good way to get audiences excited .
Apparently these filmmakers were n’t aware of this .
The teaser trailer shows absolutely no footage from the film .
In fact all we get to see is a black screen that flashes words across the screen as audio clips from the film are played in the background .
On top of that the teaser makes the film seem incredibly dark and ominous and supposedly makes the founders of Facebook look bad .
This is opposed to the book ( The Accidental Billionaires ) upon which the movie is based on , which takes a comedic approach to the subject matter .
Either way the trailer does n’t exactly make one want to see it , and I ’m seriously starting to question the marketing strategy of this film .
It ’s almost like they do n’t want people to watch it .

Women who drink tea have an increased risk of developing Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) compared with those who drink none ( p=0.04 ) , according to results presented at EULAR 2010 , the Annual Congress of the European League Against Rheumatism in Rome , Italy .
Further results from the same study showed no correlation between the amount of coffee consumption and RA incidence ( p=0.16 ) .
The results of the US based longitudinal cohort study involving 76,643 women showed a positive association of incident RA in tea drinkers with an increasing Hazard Ratio ( HR ) observed alongside tea consumption ( p=0.03 ) .
Consuming any amount of tea carried a significant risk of developing RA ( HR 1.40 ( 95 %CI 1.01 - 1.93 ) p=0.04 ) and women who drank ≥ 4 cups of tea per day had an increased risk of developing RA compared to those who drank none ( HR 1.78 ( 95 %CI 0.83-3.82 ) ) .
An analysis of the method of preparation of coffee ( filtered vs unfiltered ) and presence or lack of caffeine in the beverage did not show any significant associations with RA or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE , an autoimmune disease in which the immune system harms the body ’s own healthy cells and tissues ) ( RA : filtered p=0.08 , unfiltered p=0.38 , SLE : filtered p=0.74 , unfiltered p=0.97 ) .
No increase was shown in the risk of developing RA in participants who drank coffee compared to those that did not ( RA : HR 1.09 ( 95 %CI 0.77-1.54 p=0.63 ) .
“ We set out to determine whether tea or coffee consumption , or the method of preparation of the drinks was associated with an increased risk of RA or SLE – it is surprising that we saw such differences in results between tea and coffee drinkers , ” said Professor Christopher Collins , Assistant Professor of Medicine , Georgetown University Medical Center , Washington , USA .
“ This does make us wonder what it is in tea , or in the method of preparation of tea that causes the significant increase in risk of developing RA . ”
Data on women aged 50 - 79 were taken from the Women ’s Health Initiative Observational Study database ( a major 15 - year research program to address the most common causes of death , disability and poor quality of life in postmenopausal women ) where participants completed a self - administered questionnaire providing information on daily consumption of coffee and tea .
The relationships between drinking tea and coffee and the risk of RA or SLE were assessed in age - adjusted models and in multivariate Cox proportional hazard models ( a statustical approach to estimating survival data ) .
At three years follow up , the diagnosis of incident RA was determined using self - reporting and respondent ’s feedback on use of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDS ) .
The variables studied in the RA population were also investigated in women with SLE , but no significant associations were found .
“ These are very interesting findings and we hope that additional research will investigate this topic further .
We do assert the need for caution in the interpretation of these findings as no strong causation effect has been confirmed , and encourage patients with rheumatic diseases to consult their physician before making any significant changes to their diet or caffeine intake ” said Professor Paul Emery , President of EULAR and arc Professor of Rheumatology , Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine , University of Leeds , UK

Introducing LaMake , a LaTeX build and deployment system April 18 , 2010
[ Dear Planet KDE , sorry in advance for a totally non-KDE blog entry .
I ’ll stop blogging about this topic on Planet after this announcement . ]
University courses have started again , so I have to stop hacking on Palapeli , and start hacking on uni-related stuff .
At the lecture hall , we write all lecture notes in LaTeX ( including formulas , diagrams , images etc. ) and publish the documents on our website .
At least theoretically .
In reality , we have not come around to updating any documents or publishing new ones over the whole last semester .
There must be technical solution for this social problem !
And there is one : fully automated nightly builds .
As the only one here who owns a web server ( which also hosts our internal Git repo ) , the task of setting up the build server was assigned to me .
Until now , my build system was a hacky script “ build.sh ” , wrapped by another equally - named hacky script in another directory .
It was not very efficient , but got the job done for years .
Anyhow , this solution is total cr… I mean , uh … very suboptimal for this new runtime environment .
The problem is that an automated LaTeX build system is a quite complicated task because of the ( La ) TeX system ’s legacy .
It ’s not like a usual compiler which you run once over your file and get the desired output .
Running LaTeX generates several temporary storage files , which need to be processed afterwards , and only then will another LaTeX run create the expected result by reading the changed temporary files .
When I edit a LaTeX file , generating the PDF in general takes 3 LaTeX runs , but in distinct situations , one or two runs are sufficient .
A good build system should recognize these situations .
Most existing LaTeX build systems have exotic dependencies ( such as scons ) which I do not want on my web server .
Then there are Makefile - based LaTeX build systems such as latex - makefile .
If you ’re brave enough , take a look at this Makefile .
This looks like a complete documentation of all of GNU make ’s features , e.g. functions ( I never knew such things were possible in Makefiles ) , so no chance one can safely add additional features without breaking everything ( unless you ’re a GNU make guru … I ’m not ) .
So yet again , I considered it easier to write my own system , called LaMake .
After two evenings of work , I am at the point where LaMake replaces my current build system with ease and a much better architecture , and even provides me with some new features such as “ lamake clean ” .
Much is left to do , though .
As usual when you quickly need to replace a working system with new code , some parts are designed in a straight - forward manner .
Also , the functionality is quite limited ( e.g. no BiBTeX support because we do not use it here ) .
Still , if you are interested in a Qt - based LaTeX build and deployment system , come join me at http://gitorious.org/lamake.
At the moment , documentation is limited to the “ USAGE ” file in the repository , but that should be enough to get you started in no time .
Washington , D.C. , June 4 , 2010 – Space industry leaders , astronauts , and the Commercial Spaceflight Federation are issuing the following statements following today ’s launch of the Falcon 9 vehicle :
Bretton Alexander , President of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation :
“ Today is a historic day for SpaceX .
The Falcon 9 rocket rising into the sky was carrying the hopes and dreams of the hundreds of engineers who worked on this new project .
And I know that thousands of well - wishers across the country were cheering that rocket on .
For a brand - new rocket to accomplish this much on its first mission is truly impressive , given the historical difficulties of first flights . ”
Mark Sirangelo , Chairman of Sierra Nevada Corporation Space Systems and Chairman of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation :
“ Congratulations to Elon Musk and everyone working at SpaceX .
The broader commercial space community has received a fantastic piece of good news today . ”
Russell “ Rusty ” Schweickart , former Apollo 9 astronaut :
“ As a former Apollo astronaut , I think it ’s safe to say that SpaceX and the other commercial developers embody the 21st century version of the Apollo frontier spirit .
It ’s enormously gratifying to see them succeed today . ”
Frank DiBello , President and CEO of Space Florida :
“ This is another giant leap forward on the path of commercial spaceflight .
Florida ’s aerospace workforce can take special pride that SpaceX ’s launch happened right here at Cape Canaveral .
This success means more jobs for Florida and Floridians , and this success also means a major new force in the evolution of a vibrant commercial space capability for the nation . ”
Dr. Peter H. Diamandis , Chairman of the X PRIZE Foundation :
“ In President Barack Obama ’s new plan for NASA , a new player has taken center stage – American capitalism and entrepreneurship – and today ’s SpaceX launch strengthens my hope that commercial space companies will at long last remove the cost barrier that slows our exploration of the solar system . ”
Eric Anderson , Chairman and CEO of Space Adventures :
“ It ’s a tremendous accomplishment for SpaceX to succeed on the first try for Falcon 9 .
There ’s a bright future ahead for the commercial spaceflight industry and today was a big day . ”
Byron Lichtenberg , former Space Shuttle astronaut :
“ I expect that there will be a lot more astronauts in the future because of today ’s success .
Lower cost launches means more flights , which means more astronauts .
We ’ve only had 500 astronauts in the history of the Space Age , but I hope to see thousands more in the decades to come . ”
The Planetary Society , the world ’s largest space advocacy organization by membership :
“ With this success for the commercial spaceflight industry , the United States is better positioned to ramp up its ambitions for exploring the solar system .
The proposal to refocus NASA ’s human spaceflight program beyond low - Earth orbit now looks more achievable , as this flight demonstrated that commercial rockets may soon be ready to carry supplies and , we hope , astronauts to the International Space Station . ”
Dr. Alan Stern , former NASA Associate Administrator for Science and now Associate Vice President at the Southwest Research Institute :
“ Congratulations to SpaceX on this phenomenal achievement .
Falcon 9 and other commercial rockets will allow America to more quickly supplant Russian rides to orbit for our astronauts , to encourage the development of space tourism and other businesses in low Earth orbit , and to more economically transport crew and cargo to orbit so that we can afford human exploration of new worlds within NASA ’s budget . ”
World Cup 2010 fans watch England take on US
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Millions of people across the UK have watched the England football team open their World Cup campaign in South Africa with a 1 - 1 draw against the USA .
The British Beer and Pub Association expected nearly four million fans to head to pubs and big screens were set up across the UK for public viewing .
Prime Minister David Cameron offered support in a video message to the team .
ITV apologised after an " interruption " on its high definition service meant viewers missed England 's opening goal .
During the half - time break , presenter Adrian Chiles said : " Apologies for those watching in HD , I believe there was some interruption in your coverage . "
England captain Steven Gerrard scored after four minutes in Rustenburg , with USA registering an equaliser just before the interval .
England goalkeeper Rob Green fumbled a long - range shot that trickled over the line , before a goalless second half left each team with one point for a draw .
In the UK , thousands of people were expected to watch the game on big screens in venues such as Millennium Square , in Leeds , and the Hammersmith Appollo , in west London .
Continue reading the main story View from the US
The hype may not be quite as all - consuming as it is in England , but the US is taking the World Cup seriously .
With the time difference meaning matches are much earlier , bars in places like New York and Washington DC will open at 7 am for the benefit of fans .
There will also be outdoor screenings .
There 's a wealth of coverage in newspapers and key matches like today 's from Rustenburg will be on ABC , the equivalent of ITV or BBC .
Then there is blanket coverage on the ESPN sports channel , with British commentators like Martin Tyler and Ally McCoist brought in .
Yes , Americans still insist on calling football " soccer " to distinguish it from American football , but there is plenty of evidence that World Cup fever is taking hold .
One newspaper columnist went as far as joking that an England defeat on Saturday would be the biggest American - inflicted humiliation since the battle of Yorktown in 1781 .
And up to 3,000 people were due to watch the game on big screens at Great Notley Country Park , in Essex .
Meanwhile , US servicemen and women based at Mildenhall airbase were cheering on their countrymen .
The British Beer and Pub Association predicted that nearly four million fans flocking to pubs were likely to generate a £ 35 m sales boost , with an extra nine million pints of beer sold .
And supermarkets were expecting their busiest day since Christmas .
Sainsbury 's said it had prepared for a 500 % increase in pizza and pint glass sales .
In addition to his video message , Mr Cameron gave his backing to the FA 's England Football Day campaign , which aims to encourage more people to take an interest in the game .
The prime minister said : " I want to wish the England team and Fabio Capello every piece of good luck for the whole of the World Cup , but starting with tonight 's vital game against the United States of America .
" I keep saying we are all in this together , and that is particularly true when cheering on the England team . "
The prime minister has agreed that the England flag will fly over Downing Street for the duration of the World Cup .
President Barack Obama slammed Republican opponents Saturday for their “ obstruction ” in Congress and called for a “ willingness to score fewer political points ” in order to deal with the nation ’s problems .
The United States “ is facing a host of big and difficult challenges , ” Obama noted in his weekly radio and Internet address , saying Americans need a “ willingness in Washington to put the public ’s interests first . ”

Obama said he was “ disappointed ” at obstacles put up by opposition lawmakers this week to the Democrat ’s economic recovery efforts in the US Senate , including legislation to extend unemployment benefits .
Hailing the bill as vital protection for workers , as well as the bill ’s other provisions such as homebuyers ’ tax credits , Obama lamented that Republican leaders would not “ even allow this legislation to come up for a vote . ”
If the “ obstruction continues , unemployed Americans will see their benefits stop .
Teachers and firefighters will lose their jobs …
All we ask for is a simple up or down vote .
That ’s what the American people deserve , ” he said .
In a stinging hit back at the White House , Republican Senator Roger Wicker delivered his party ’s weekly response in a bid to reinforce perception that Obama was too late getting involved in the massive oil slick hitting the Gulf of Mexico .
“ I ’m glad President Obama is finally putting this catastrophe at the top of his agenda , but his response has been too slow , ” said the Mississippi lawmaker .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ He was slow in listening to state and local leaders , slow in getting skimmers to the Gulf , slow in understanding the seriousness of this crisis , and slow in taking ownership and responsibility for the recovery .
Many of his actions have actually taken us in the wrong direction , ” he said .
Wicker said Obama ’s primetime Oval Office address on Tuesday about the oil spill disaster and US energy policy was a failure because “ now is not the time to push a controversial , job - killing , partisan agenda through Congress . ”

After a German injunction took out its ISP , The Pirate Bay went dark yesterday .
Today , it 's back up .
Just another round of Whac - A - Mole ?
Yes , but this time the game got more serious : Sweden 's Piratpartiet ( Pirate Party ) , a legitimate political party with two members in the European Parliament , has taken on direct responsibility for hosting the site .
" When other politicians appoint committees and try to pass the buck , the Pirate Party instead takes responsibility and acts with its own resources to protect the nation ’s information safety and fundamental freedom of speech .
We are now The Pirate Bay ’s Internet service provider , " said Pirate Party leader Rick Falkvinge .
This sounds principled — noble even .
The Pirate Party goes on to say that " the proposals to censor The Pirate Bay from the Internet [ are ] an attempt to silence one of today ’s most important voices related to civil liberties and freedom on the net .
It is nothing less than political censorship , which every democratically minded person must condemn . "
Enter Dr. Lolcat
If you 're a Pirate Bay administrator , however , here 's how you sum up all the high - minded talk about censorship , free speech , and democracy :
LOL ! AS U MITE HAS READ OR NOTICD , PEEPS ONCE AGAIN R TRYIN 2 SHUT US DOWN .
DIS WILL NOT SUCCED , LOL .
OURS RLY NICE WEBHOST WUZ THREATEND WIF RLY HUGE FINE , SO WE DECIDD 2 MOOV TEH SIET SO DAT THEY DIDNT GOT INTO TROUBLE , LOL .
TEH DECISHUN 2 MOOV WUZ TAKEN BY US , TEH PIRATE BAY , LOL .
TEH PIRATE BAY IZ AN UNSINKABLE SHIP .
IT WILL SAIL TEH INTERWEBS 4 AS LONG AS WE WANTS IT 2 .
REMEMBR DAT , K THX .
TPB , ONLY IN IT 4 TEH LULZ SINCE 2003 .
Are they in it " 4 the lulz , " or for democracy ?
A set of bolded letters in the all - caps blog post gave us an answer : " ASSCLOWNS OV TEH RIAA . "
The post was authored by one " Dr. LOLCAT . "
The Pirate Party 's decision to host the site poses a direct challenge to the Swedish legal system , which has already found the site operators guilty of copyright infringement ( an appeal will be heard later this year ) .
Christian Engström , the first Pirate MEP sent to Brussels , wants to alter the legal structure of copyright Europe - wide , and this move will certainly raise the question more urgently in the Swedish press .
" Limiting file sharing with laws and punishments does n’t work , " wrote Engström recently .
" More of the same wo n’t either .
File sharing is here to stay , like it or not .
We should keep copyright , but limit it to when there is commercial intent .
All noncommercial copying and use , such as file sharing , should be legalized ...
What the society has been doing so far is n’t working .
There is no way to stop file sharing .
It ’s time we tried something else . "
He believes that people will always spend the same amount of money on entertainment , and the file - sharing does n't reduce this pool of money .
Instead , it merely shuffles it around , away from plastic discs and toward live music , for instance .
Copyright should only cover " commercial " use .
" All it takes is the political momentum to get things moving , " he wrote .
" I am hoping that we can build that momentum in the European Parliament .
I think it can be done . "
Ways to comply
The record labels are n't so keen on this approach , and they have traveled across Europe grabbing injunctions against ISPs , against BitTorrent search engines like Mininova and The Pirate Bay , and against The Pirate Bay 's own hosting services .
This week , they secured such an injunction against Cyberbunker , a German ISP that was hosting The Pirate Bay 's front page ( the trackers are hosted elsewhere ) .
The first page of the injunction
While Sven Olaf Kamphuis , the man who runs Cyberbunker , has unabashed sympathies for the Pirate Party and The Pirate Bay , he was facing fines of € 250,000 per infringement and possible jail time as long as he kept hosting the site .
Despite his desire to fight , Kamphuis had no real choice but to honor the injunction .
" Yes , we did [ take down the site ] , " he told Ars , " as it is a legally valid prohibition for us to provide Internet for the servers of The Pirate Bay as long as there are torrent files on it for those six movies . "
According to the injunction from a Hamburg court , the six films referenced by Kamphuis are : The Bounty Hunter , Alice in Wonderland , Our Family Wedding , Green Zone , Repo Men , and Cop Out .
These were the films cited by the studios in their complaint to the court .
Kamphuis told us The Pirate Bay faced three options .
First was the choice to remove all torrent files from the site and use magnet links , which do n't require a tracker .
This is " not desirable as a lot of clients still require . torrent files . "
Second , the site could filter out those six particular film names from its index , but this " could lead to the movie torrent files still being available under a misspelled name . "
Finally , The Pirate Bay could get another ISP .
" They are working on it as we speak , " said Kamphuis .
He was right .
Though the site still conceals the location of its servers , it has now returned to Sweden for its connection to the Internet , and The Pirate Party has decided to get involved .
The Western was all the rage back in the day –way back , in fact .
Before anyone on the Elder - Geek staff was born , in fact .
Since their heyday , we ’ve seen a few Westerns on the big screen , but their numbers have dwindled considerably , not to mention their quality .
As a result of an apparent lack of appeal , Western games are few and far between .
Ask most people and they ’d be hard pressed to give you a list of 10 worth playing .
But I ’ve spent the past few months collecting and checking out the genre and I ’ve come up with what I believe to be the Top 10 Video Game Westerns .
10 . Oregon Trail
You know a game is worth its salt when players have fond memories of dying of dysentery .
The Oregon Trail was a staple in schools in the 80’s and 90’s and it lives on with recent ports to the iPhone and DSiWare .
A shining example of educational games , it ’s a bona - fide classic , and definitely worthy of being on this list .
9. Darkwatch
A standard FPS with a Western aesthetic , Darkwatch cast the player as Jericho Cross , an outlaw who turns into a vampire after robbing the wrong train .
Recruited into a clan of undead hunters , the game follows Jericho ’s pursuit of the head vampire , Lazarus , and his attempts to regain his humanity .
Infusing classic Western themes with a bit of survival horror , Darkwatch was enjoyable for Western fans , but failed to rise above some of the greater shooters on the Xbox or PS2 .
8. Red Dead Revolver
Rockstar San Diego had n’t exactly tested their mettle in the action adventure genre when they released Red Dead Revolver in 2004 .
Much more accustomed to racing games and the Midnight Club series , it was understandable when the game turned out to be less than spectacular .
Everyone was looking forward to ‘ Grand Theft Auto in the West , ’ but most were disappointed .
Shooting and movement controls were in need of refinement , and while the script was sharp , the story really only served to shepherd the player from mission to mission .
Steeped in the Spaghetti Western , Red Dead Revolver had style in spades , but not enough substance to put it higher on this list .
7. Oddworld : Stranger ’s Wrath
This is a seemingly odd choice , but rest assured that the game qualifies as a Western .
You play the bounty hunter , Stranger , on his journey to earn moolah , kill demons , and essentially just stay alive .
Exclusive to the Xbox , its graphics were excellent for 2005 , and unique gameplay aspects like the ‘ live ammunition ’ ( firing furry critters as opposed to real ammo ) added that special Oddworld charm .
The game will live on when it ’s released as part of the Oddbox on Steam this Winter alongside the rest of the series .
6. Wild Gunman
Considered by some to be a baby ’s toy , Wild Gunman was fun in the arcades ( and will continue to be fun until at least 2015 ) and even more fun at home just because , as kids , you never felt as deadly as when you were holding that NES Zapper .
Japanese kids were treated to an even better experience with the Famicom exclusive revolver attachment which was deemed too realistic looking for the US market .
With simple gameplay and no asshole dog to break your spirit when you missed , Wild Gunman was a staple of the NES library .
5. Sunset Riders
The year is 1991 and Konami is King .
The Sunset Riders arcade game comes out and proceeds to gobble up quarters until the home console releases in 1992 ( on Sega Genesis ) and 1993 ( on SNES . )
The arcade continues to rob children of their allowance , but those lucky enough manage to convince their parents to buy them a copy .
Using gameplay mechanics perfected in Contra , this Western - themed run & gun is probably one of the most memorable Westerns out there .
It satisfied the niche market of video game Westerns but was also appealing to pretty much all gamers who knew and trusted Konami quality .
4. Tin Star
I ’m probably one of the few who played Tin Star , but it will always have a special place in my heart .
Set in a version of the Ol ’
West entirely populated by robots , you play Tin Star on a mission to capture the Black Bart & his Bad Oil Gang of mechanical menaces .
Accompanied by your faithful steed , Aluminum , and with plenty of comedy to go around , Tin Star does n’t take itself too seriously , which is partly why it can still be enjoyed today .
The game could be played with the standard SNES controller , the battery - draining light gun , or the SNES mouse , with any control scheme but the light gun being preferable .
A rail - shooter , the game was universally accessible and massively entertaining , and considering its gameplay , I ’m very surprised that it is n’t on the Virtual Console yet , because it ’s tailor - made for motion controls .
3. Gun
In 2005 , Neversoft traded in skateboards for horses for the surprisingly good Gun .
With an intriguing plot that hooked you from the get - go and a star - studded cast including Thomas Jane , Kris Kristofferson , Brad Dourif , Ron Perlman , and Tom Skerritt , it was an example of good gaming narratives .
The gameplay could have used a bit more tweaking , especially the horse controls , but it was never unplayable .
There ’s still a rumor floating about concerning a sequel , but whether Activision will ever get around to it is unknown .
2. Outlaws
After the success of Star Wars : Dark Forces , LucasArts modified the engine to create the masterpiece that is Outlaws .
Playing as US Marshall John Anderson , you have to kill the bad guys as per usual , and while the game ’s storyline is not without merit , the real draw is the gameplay .
There are few things more satisfying than riding into town and killing off an entire gang of outlaws .
The music was also memorable for being recorded using authentic instruments as opposed to MIDI , which was still the standard in 1997 .
Throw in a fantastic multiplayer component and extra post - release content , and you have one of the best Westerns out there .
To this day it has a cult - like following , but the severely dated nature of its technology prevents it from persevering .
With any luck , it ’ll soon be on Steam , or , if the Western Gods see fit , there ’ll be an enhanced remake for PSN & XBLA .
1. Call of Juarez : Bound in Blood
I might be in a minority here , but CoJ: BiB hit all the right notes for me .
The storyline and acting were excellent with just the right amount of melodrama , it featured numerous references to classic film Westerns , the gameplay was solid , varied , and enjoyable , and it all translated into an addictive series of online multiplayer options .
In fact , the only thing that would ’ve made this game better would have been cooperative play , which was curiously absent .
Despite a few flaws , it ’s the best video game Western out there , one of the better games of 2009 , and well worth the $ 20 bucks you ’ll probably spend if you choose to pick it up .
And thus the list has ended .
I ’m off to play Red Dead Redemption .
Expect a review soon .
Update : Red Dead Redemption takes the cake .
Some celebrities , however , drastically misjudge their demographic and we wind up with releases of classical Renaissance ballads as sung by Brock Lesnar or a line of fur coats sponsored by Moby .
The right celebrity endorsement can make a good product exponentially better .
Sure , we like Hot Pockets as much as the next starving guy well below the poverty line , but put Hulk Hogan 's face on them ?
Now you 're talking , buddy !
Get your hands off our Hulk Pockets , or feel the pain , brother !
7 Kanye West's Travel Agency

By now we expect rappers to expand their brands : Energy drinks , clothing lines , hot dogs ( finally all of America can put a Snoop Dogg in their mouth ) but discount bundled family vacation packages to Tampa with air and hotel included do not fit the classical definition of " gangsta . "
But hey , it 's Kayne West , we 're talking about here .
He never truly marketed himself as a " hardcore " rapper , he 's most famous for his hedonism and that might translate to vacations .
If it 's done by Kanye West , this travel website 's got to be deluxe :
All done up in red leather and auto - tuned out the ass , right ?
Not so much , no .
Kanye Travel features a giant flash animation of some kind of rap - based satellite orbiting the Earth .
If you hover your mouse over it , you can make it dance !
" If they can do this , surely they can book my vacation ! "

And then if you click it , well , nothing happens .
The site is sporting a plethora of buttons , most of which do n't work , but maybe that 's a statement :
This site is so rich it 's got buttons that do n't even go nowhere !
Kanye 's makin ' it rain buttons , yo !
But the weirdest part is that , aside from his name upfront , there is no sign of Kanye anywhere .
If there 's one thing Kanye is all about , it 's Kanye , and not a trace of him anywhere .
No " Kanye Krazy Savers , " no travel tips on which cities have the best asses , not even a spinning Kanye head placeholder while the page loads .
This appears to be a no- frills discount travel website built in all earnestness .
Kanye
West started a travel website because he is passionate about deals .
Seriously , according to press releases proudly exclaiming the amount of work Kanye and his business partners did to secure deals with airline , hotel and car rental concerns to offer the best travel deals :
As a general strike is mooted to coincide with Europe - wide action , the anarcho - syndicalist CNT union is warning that one day outings will not be enough to deter deep public sector cuts
Spain 's fifth general strike hasbeen set for September 29th amidst massive public sector cuts and attacks on job security passed by the ruling Socialist Party - and the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo is calling for it to be made indefinite .
Following a one day public - sector strike earlier this month the union is warning that “ gesture strikes ” will not be enough to force the government to change course .
In a statement after the June 8th event they said : “ The government ’s plans to stabilise the economy through reducing the public deficit by 11 % have placed the cost of the economic crisis on the shoulders of the disadvantaged .
“ It is evident that the proposals are designed to satisfy banks and employers by compromising with the neoliberal designs that prevail in the EU . ”
“ If there had been earlier mobilisations the government would not have dared to present the measures announced and would have had to cut elsewhere .
It would have had to seek income where the money really is – on the bench , through corporate taxes , inheritance , hedge funds etc .
“ We believe it is a mistake to continue ‘ negotiating ’ labour reform , which is simply a concession to employers .
The only possiblility for correcting this situation is to fight this economic aggression through social confrontation , to continue and expand protests to all sectors . ”
“ These great evils can only be treated with great remedies , and such remedies do not include , of course , a 24 - hour general strike which , assuming that UGT and CCOO ( the two major reformist unions in Spain ) dared to actually convene one , would act only as a giant safety valve for employee discontent .
“ An indefinite general strike paralysing the country until the government withdraws anti-worker and anti-social actions would by contrast act as a binder for workers to recover their class consciousness and act together , with an eye to the destruction of the capitalist system through social revolution which is the only truly effective medicine against congenital diseases of the system .
Larger TUC - style unions called the public - sector strike on June 8th , which the left claimed got 75 % of public sector workers out ( state sources put it 16 % ) and saw tens of thousands of people on the streets in protest .
The public sector accounts for around 2.5 million jobs in Spain .
However the measure has made little impact on narrowly - passed plans to slash 5 % from public sector pay , part of a 15 billion euro package of austerity measures being implemented in the next few years .
Other measures include the uncoupling of pension payments from inflation , an end to tax breaks for new parents and cuts in public investment and development aid of up to 6 billion euros .
The Party is also taking the opportunity to “ free up the labour market ” by making it easier to hire and fire workers , a measure which would be likely to help drive a general strike outside the public sector .
Its actions , taken as Spain is threatened by international markets over its debt ratio , are widely seen as a betrayal of the electoral promises which put the Socialist Party ( PSOE ) and Jose Zapatero into power in 2004 on the back of widespread discontent with the right , though anarchist groups in the country have pointed to the situation as emblematic of party politicians ’ inability to represent working people .
In an editorial for the periodical CNT , the union noted : “ Economic crises are inherent in the capitalist system and will , unfortunately for humanity , regularly occur as long as the system exists .
“ At the end of the day , the problem lies in the balance of power between two social classes with conflicting interests - the bourgeois class , which holds exclusive ownership of the means of production and distribution , and the proletarian class , which has no more than their manual and intellectual labour to sell as dearly as possible .
The salary of the employee , and therefore the worker himself , is just another cost of production like machinery , electrical power or fuel .
“ And when the worker is considered this way , not as a human being but as a cost to be cut without a second thought , you can do with them what you will , without remorse .
That is neither more nor less than what capitalists do with us now .
“ We can not remain silent before these measures announced by the government , which will result in yet more desecration of labour right to add to a long list of infamies imposed since this pompously - named “ democracy ” came into existence .
Lowering the salaries of officials and freezing or eliminating pensions , among other measures , are not appropriate ways to solve the so - called crisis , and will have the determined opposition of the CNT . ”

Hey man , thanks for the Info .
Ive not got the money required ( and prolly never will ) to hire a pro .
What the heel makes a pro anywAy ?.
I have to learn to do this myself as I cant even afford to buy firewood .
I live in a remote area , theres plenty of trees and the local authorities allow firewood collection for domestic use without a permit or fees .
so i need to learn how to do this just to keep warm .
In fact im dam lucky i even have a wood fire heater , I sure as hell cant afford electric heating .
I understand this is extremely dangerous .
Im hoping that with an attitude of respect for what I am doing , I will keep myself and others safe .
My chainsaw is not big enough to do the biggest trees too .
however today my first tree is some kind of Australian Bottle brush , and while its not huge , it is near a whole heap of fences .
so im in research mode ATM .
If you DO have the money it is prolly smart to hire a pro .
But if your broke , and you must keep yourself and / or family warm , then dont be afraid , people have been risking their lives to keep warm or collect food / water or other essentials since the first cavemen .
I also just gotta say this .
Dont listen to the people who are suggesting you ignore this guide .
They are all happy to say this article is wrong , but best I can tell none are suggesting how its wrong , let alone how to do it right .
I 've been asking around a little , and I 'd be looking at between $ 100 for a guy a few miles away to come do it ( but he was drunk when I visited him , and hes not a pro , licensed or insured ) all the way up to $ 400 for a licensed dude with a business ( I assume hes insured ) to travel an hour to get here .
Either way , even if it was $ 100 for a pro , i cant afford that every time I need firewood .
How does one become a pro ? are there courses , apprenticeships , trainee ships etc ?
Is one called a pro , just from being licensed and insured ?

In case any advertisers on Facebook were concerned that yesterday ’s privacy changes could impact them , the company sent out an email to all of them explaining that they ’d be unaffected .
See the email below .
Facebook is worried that advertisers have been troubled by the variety of confusing product launches and related issues over the past month .
It is trying to clear any issues up now before people get so concerned that they stop spending money .
One note is that while yesterday ’s changes wo n’t have a direct affect on advertisers , they do include better options lettings users hide their interests ( which Pages they “ Like ” ) .
If users decide they want to do this , their friends wo n’t be able to see the connections .
This could make it more difficult for people to find and engage with Pages they may actually care about , reducing the overall effectiveness of the product — however , it ’s not clear that any substantial number of users are hiding this information .
Here ’s the email :
Hi XXXXXX ,
Facebook will roll out changes today that will make it easier for our users to understand and control their privacy settings .
As this change will have an impact on our users , we wanted to let you , a valued advertising partner , know about it .
Please note that this change will not affect your advertising campaigns and there is no action required on your part .
Facebook is a company that moves quickly , constantly innovating and launching new products to improve the user experience .
The feedback we heard from users was that in our efforts to innovate , some of our privacy settings h ad become confusing .
We believe in listening to our users and taking their feedback into account whenever possible .
We think the following changes address these concerns by providing users with more control over their privacy settings and making them more simple to use .
Starting today , Facebook will :
* Provide an easy - to - use “ master ” control that enables users to set who can see the content they share through Facebook .
This enables users to choose , with just one click , the overall privacy level they ’re comfortable with for the content they share on Facebook .
Of course , users can still use all of the granular controls we ’ve always offered , if they wish .
* Significantly reduce the amount of information that must be visible to everyone on Facebook .
Facebook will no longer require that users ’ friends and connections are visible to everyone .
Only Name , Profile Picture , Networks and Gender must be publicly available .
Users can opt to make all other connections private .
* Make it simple to control whether other applications and websites access any user information .
While a majority of our users love Facebook apps and Facebook - enhanced websites , some may prefer not to share their information outside of Facebook .
Users can now opt out with just one click .
I encourage you to take a moment to read our CEO Mark Zuckerberg ’s blog post and check out the new Facebook Privacy Page .

Context - Keeping and Community Organizing
David Bernstein makes the strongest libertarian case I can imagine for Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
His key point — which I fully embrace — is that the Southern states operated the equivalent of a “ white supremacist cartel ” in public accommodations .
At the risk of making my assignment as critic more difficult for myself , I ’d like to elaborate this point .
Standard libertarian criticism of Title II , which prohibits racial discrimination in public accommodations , appears to treat the targeted restaurants and hotels as purely private businesses that , however odious their racial policies , were unjustifiably imposed on by government policies that violated private property rights .
But this account misses something crucial .
Outwardly those businesses looked like private enterprises , but the substance was different .
As Bernstein points out , the social - legal environment in the pre-1964 South , when Jim Crow reigned , was hardly what any libertarian would envision as a laissez - faire environment .
Rather , the region was in the grip of a pervasive social system based on white supremacy — one enforced by formal government rules , discretionary official decision - making , and extralegal measures , ranging from social pressure all the way to violence that was countenanced and even participated in by government officials .
A racially liberal entrepreneur who sought to compete next door to a segregated restaurant in the downtown of a Southern city would have been in for a difficult time .
How would the city ’s zoning , licensing , and building - code authorities have reacted ?
How inclined would they have been to find myriad reasons why that restaurant was n’t qualified to operate ?
Assuming the restaurateur overcame those obstacles , might n’t he have had trouble buying equipment and food from suppliers once they had been visited by the local White Citizens ’ Council , sometimes known as the “ white - collar Klan ” ?
The WCC might also have had something to say to prospective employees .
If that form of persuasion did n’t suffice , the actual Ku Klux Klan would have been available for nocturnal assignments .
Property damage and physical intimidation might have been used to persuade the agitator not to upset the town ’s “ way of life , ” which , up until then , was perfectly satisfactory .
No need to call the cops ; they were probably there already .
Any libertarian would object if a municipal fire department had a policy of ignoring burning homes in the black part of town .
If the municipality contracted out its firefighting services to a “ private ” company with the same racial policy , libertarians would similarly object on grounds of equality under the law .
They would not be fooled by the mere façade of private enterprise .
Form does not alter substance .
But that would also be true for the white - supremacist cartels that operated public accommodations throughout the South .
So libertarians should not regard those businesses as mere private enterprises .
The key to understanding this matter is what libertarian scholar Chris Matthew Sciabarra calls dialectics , or context - keeping .
As he wrote in The Freeman , “ Society is not some ineffable organism ; it is a complex nexus of interrelated institutions and processes , of volitionally conscious , purposeful , interacting individuals — and the unintended consequences they generate . ”
Thus dialectics “ counsels us to study the object of our inquiry from a variety of perspectives and levels of generality , so as to gain a more comprehensive picture of it .
That study often requires that we grasp the object in terms of the larger system within which it is situated , as well as its development across time .
( Emphasis added . )
Applying Sciabarra ’s principle , we can see that racial discrimination at particular “ private ” Southern lunch counters and hotels before 1964 cannot be judged apart from the “ larger system within which it is situated . ”
The full context must be kept in view .
Ironically , an example of dialectical thinking , albeit applied to bank regulation , is provided by Rep. Ron Paul , father of Rand Paul , whose rejection ( before his acceptance ) of Title II prompted the recent controversy .
In 1999 the elder Paul opposed repeal of a key section of the New Deal - era Glass - Steagall Act , which separated commercial from investment banking .
Considering Ron Paul ’s commitment to a free market , his opposition to repeal of an intervention might seem illogical .
Yet he opposed it because “ This increased indication of the government ’s eagerness to bail out highly - leveraged , risky and largely unregulated financial institutions bodes ill for the … future as far as limiting taxpayer liability is concerned . ”
Paul was thinking dialectically : Removing a restriction from a form of business that enjoys government privileges is not necessarily a libertarian move .
Context is crucial .
By the same token , Professor Bernstein argues that imposing a restriction on a form of business that enjoys government privileges is not necessarily an unlibertarian move .
Again , context is crucial .
So does this mean that Professor Bernstein is right that libertarians ought to have supported Title II in 1964 ?
I do n’t think so .
Professor Bernstein seems to reluctantly accept Title II only because a “ massive federal takeover of local government to prevent violence and threats against , and extralegal harassment of , those who chose to integrate ” would have been “ completely impractical . ”
Undoubtedly so .
But why does that exhaust the options ?
Why assume government is the only salvation ?
That ’s an odd position , indeed , for a libertarian .
Professor Bernstein does not so much as mention another strategy for ending racial discrimination in public accommodations : direct nonviolent social action by the people affected and those in sympathy with them .
We ca n’t dismiss that as impractical because it had been working several years before Title II was enacted .
Beginning in 1960 sit-ins and other Gandhi - style confrontations were desegregating department - store lunch counters throughout the South .
No laws had to be passed or repealed .
Social pressure — the public shaming of bigots — was working .
Even earlier , during the 1950s , David Beito and Linda Royster Beito report in Black Maverick , black entrepreneur T.R.M .
Howard led a boycott of national gasoline companies that forced their franchisees to allow blacks to use the restrooms from which they had long been barred .
It is sometimes argued that Title II was an efficient remedy because it affected all businesses in one fell swoop .
But the social movement was also efficient : whole groups of offenders would relent at one time after an intense sit -in campaign .
There was no need to win over one lunch counter at a time .
Title II , in other words , was unnecessary .
But worse , it was detrimental .
History ’s greatest victories for liberty were achieved not through lobbying , legislation , and litigation — not through legal briefs and philosophical treatises — but through the sort of direct “ people ’s ” struggle that marked the Middle Ages and beyond .
As a mentor of mine says , what is given like a gift can be more easily taken away , while what one secures for oneself by facing down power is less easily lost .
The social campaign for equality that was desegregating the South was transmogrified when it was diverted to Washington .
Focus then shifted from the grassroots to a patronizing white political elite in Washington that had scurried to the front of the march and claimed leadership .
Recall Hillary Clinton ’s belittling of the grassroots movement when she ran against Barack Obama : “ Dr. King ’s dream began to be realized when President Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 … .
It took a president to get it done . ”
We will never know how the original movement would have evolved — what independent mutual - aid institutions would have emerged — had that diversion not occurred .
We do know , as Professor Bernstein reminds us , that Title II became a precedent for laws forbidding all types of private “ discrimination ” that were in no way rooted in government - sanctioned cartels .
Bernstein may see the South ’s social system as providing a “ limiting principle ” for when antidiscrimination laws are permissible , but this overlooks the perverse dynamic of the political world .
Simply put , after 1964 there just was no way that antidiscrimination laws were going to be confined to Jim Crow - type cases .
Libertarians need not shy away from the question , “ Do you mean that whites should have been allowed to exclude blacks from their lunch counters ? ”
Libertarians can answer proudly , “ No .
They should not have been allowed to do that .
They should have been stopped — not by the State , which ca n’t be trusted , but by nonviolent social action on behalf of equality . ”
The libertarian answer to bigotry is community organizing .

Batavia , Ill . —Scientists of the DZero collaboration at the Department of Energy ’s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory announced Friday , May 14 , that they have found evidence for significant violation of matter - antimatter symmetry in the behavior of particles containing bottom quarks beyond what is expected in the current theory , the Standard Model of particle physics .
The new result , submitted for publication in Physical Review D by the DZero collaboration , an international team of 500 physicists , indicates a one percent difference between the production of pairs of muons and pairs of antimuons in the decay of B mesons produced in high - energy collisions at Fermilab ’s Tevatron particle collider .
The dominance of matter that we observe in the universe is possible only if there are differences in the behavior of particles and antiparticles .
Although physicists have observed such differences ( called “ CP violation ” ) in particle behavior for decades , these known differences are much too small to explain the observed dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe and are fully consistent with the Standard Model .
If confirmed by further observations and analysis , the effect seen by DZero physicists could represent another step towards understanding the observed matter dominance by pointing to new physics phenomena beyond what we know today .
Using unique features of their precision detector and newly developed analysis methods , the DZero scientists have shown that the probability that this measurement is consistent with any known effect is below 0.1 percent ( 3.2 standard deviations ) .
“ This exciting new result provides evidence of deviations from the present theory in the decays of B mesons , in agreement with earlier hints , ” said Dmitri Denisov , co-spokesperson of the DZero experiment , one of two collider experiments at the Tevatron collider .
Last year , physicists at both Tevatron experiments , DZero and CDF , observed such hints in studying particles made of a bottom quark and a strange quark .
When matter and anti-matter particles collide in high - energy collisions , they turn into energy and produce new particles and antiparticles .
At the Fermilab proton - antiproton collider , scientists observe hundreds of millions every day .
Similar processes occurring at the beginning of the universe should have left us with a universe with equal amounts of matter and anti-matter .
But the world around is made of matter only and antiparticles can only be produced at colliders , in nuclear reactions or cosmic rays .
“ What happened to the antimatter ? ” is one of the central questions of 21st–century particle physics .
To obtain the new result , the DZero physicists performed the data analysis “ blind , ” to avoid any bias based on what they observe .
Only after a long period of verification of the analysis tools , did the DZero physicists look at the full data set .
Experimenters reversed the polarity of their detector ’s magnetic field during data collection to cancel instrumental effects .
“ Many of us felt goose bumps when we saw the result , ” said Stefan Soldner - Rembold , co-spokesperson of DZero .
“ We knew we were seeing something beyond what we have seen before and beyond what current theories can explain . ”
The precision of the DZero measurements is still limited by the number of collisions recorded so far by the experiment .
Both CDF and DZero therefore continue to collect data and refine analyses to address this and many other fundamental questions .
“ The Tevatron collider is operating extremely well , providing Fermilab scientists with unprecedented levels of data from high - energy collisions to probe nature ’s deepest secrets .
This interesting result underlines the importance and scientific potential of the Tevatron program , ” said Dennis Kovar , Associate Director for High Energy Physics in DOE ’s Office of Science .
The DZero result is based on data collected over the last eight years by the DZero experiment : over 6 inverse femtobarns in total integrated luminosity , corresponding to hundreds of trillions of collisions between protons and antiprotons in the Tevatron collider .
“ Tevatron collider experiments study high - energy collisions in every detail , from searches for the Higgs boson , to precision measurement of particle properties , to searches for new and yet unknown laws of nature .
I am delighted to see yet another exciting result from the Tevatron , ” said Fermilab Director Pier Oddone .
DZero is an international experiment of about 500 physicists from 86 institutions in 19 countries .
It is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy , the National Science Foundation and a number of international funding agencies .
Fermilab is a national laboratory funded by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy , operated under contract by Fermi Research Alliance , LLC .

If you did n't get the latest memo about the most current person you 're supposed to totally hate and persecute and make their life a hell and a torment , allow me to fill you in .
Fox News has identified this person as Suzan Hezbon of Highland Park , Illinois .
Please commence hating Ms. Suzan Hebson of Highland Park Illinois as soon as possible , thank you .
The school official who nixed a girls ' high school basketball team 's planned trip to Arizona once supported a controversial program that required ninth - graders to attend a “ freshman advisory ” class at which gay upperclassmen shared stories of their high school experiences .
She .
Tried .
To. Make .
Them .
Gay .
Also she hates girls who play basketball , and loves illegal Mexicans .
Hate her .
Feel the hate build within you .
And the stupid .
This is the good part :
The following year , Hebson was made principal of Deerfield High School , where she became embroiled in another controversy — this time related to the inclusion of the play “ Angels in America : A Gay Fantasia on National Themes ” in students ’ required reading material .
Parents were alarmed by the book ’s explicit content , which includes highly offensive racial slurs , vivid depictions of gay sex and a sexually explicit scene involving Mother Teresa .
Hauser ’s group took their complaints to the state attorney general ’s office , and school officials backed down , replacing “ Angels in America ” with another play .
She tried to make them gay by making them read a gay play .
Oh , and she is killing babies .
Again , kindly commence the hatred of Ms. Suzan Hebson as soon as is practicable .
And if you please determine right away if she has granite countertops in her kitchen .
And if she has any relatives or loved ones , remember , they are as contemptible as she is , and they should be identified and fired and humiliated , in the name of American Morality .
Although caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive drug worldwide , its potential beneficial effect for maintenance of proper brain functioning has only recently begun to be adequately appreciated .
Substantial evidence from epidemiological studies and fundamental research in animal models suggests that caffeine may be protective against the cognitive decline seen in dementia and Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) .
A special supplement to the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease , " Therapeutic Opportunities for Caffeine in Alzheimer 's Disease and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases , " sheds new light on this topic and presents key findings .
Guest editors Alexandre de Mendonça , Institute of Molecular Medicine and Faculty of Medicine , University of Lisbon , Portugal , and Rodrigo A. Cunha , Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology of Coimbra and Faculty of Medicine , University of Coimbra , Portugal , have assembled a group of international experts to explore the effects of caffeine on the brain .
The resulting collection of original studies conveys multiple perspectives on topics ranging from molecular targets of caffeine , neurophysiological modifications and adaptations , to the potential mechanisms underlying the behavioral and neuroprotective actions of caffeine in distinct brain pathologies .
" Epidemiological studies first revealed an inverse association between the chronic consumption of caffeine and the incidence of Parkinson 's disease , " according to Mendonça and Cunha .
" This was paralleled by animal studies of Parkinson 's disease showing that caffeine prevented motor deficits as well as neurodegeneration " Later a few epidemiological studies showed that the consumption of moderate amounts of caffeine was inversely associated with the cognitive decline associated with aging as well as the incidence of Alzheimer 's disease .
Again , this was paralleled by animal studies showing that chronic caffeine administration prevented memory deterioration and neurodegeneration in animal models of aging and of Alzheimer 's disease . "
Key findings presented in " Therapeutic Opportunities for Caffeine in Alzheimer 's Disease and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases " :
Multiple beneficial effects of caffeine to normalize brain function and prevent its degeneration
Caffeine 's neuroprotective profile and its ability to reduce amyloid - beta production
Caffeine as a candidate disease - modifying agent for Alzheimer 's disease
Positive impact of caffeine on cognition and memory performance
Identification of adenosine A2A receptors as the main target for neuroprotection afforded by caffeine consumption
Confirmation of data through valuable meta- analyses presented
Epidemiological studies corroborated by meta- analysis suggesting that caffeine may be protective against Parkinson 's disease
Several methodological issues must be solved before advancing to decisive clinical trials
Mendonça and Cunha also observe that " the daily follow - up of patients with AD has taught us that improvement of daily living may be a more significant indicator of amelioration than slight improvements in objective measures of memory performance .
One of the most prevalent complications of AD is depression of mood , and the recent observations that caffeine might be a mood normalizer are of particular interest . "
The supplement was funded by the Associação Industrial e Comercial do Café , while leaving full scientific independence to all contributors .
The entire issue has been made available on a no - fee basis at http://iospress.metapress.com/content/t13614762731/.
Comics readers hear the phrase thrown around pretty often , but yesterday really was the end of an era :
After 86 years of daily publication saw its circulation numbers dwindle down to less than 20 newspapers , the " Little Orphan Annie " comic strip came to an end .
And the ending is completely insane .
Seriously .
Popular perception of the strip may be rooted in the rags - to - riches musical version that hit movie screens in 1982 , but as early as the late ' 20s , " Annie " had shifted to focus on almost Dick Tracian levels of brutality and crime , a tradition the last team , Jay Maeder and Ted Slampyak , were keeping alive and well in the current stories .
Did you know , for instance , that the last " Annie " storyline involved Annie getting embroiled in a plot to distribute fake passports to Mexican drug dealers , from whom she is " rescued " by an aging war criminal ?
Of course you did n't .
You were n't reading it .
That 's why it got canceled .
It 's a shame , too , because reading back through the archives to figure out the ending , I discovered that " Annie " was about as taut ( if occasionally surreal ) a thriller as one is likely to find on the newspaper comics page .
But then you get to that ending .
For some background , here 's what 's happened up to now :
After tumbling to the passport plot , Annie gets kidnapped by gangsters , because getting kidnapped by gangsters is pretty much what she does .
Said gangsters are murderous enough to bludgeon a man to death right there underneath the Jumble ...
I just love that Sandy 's all " Yep .
That 's a dead body . "
That dog's had a crazy life .
... which does n't give anyone much hope for Annie 's chances of survival .
Things seem so hopeless , in fact , that the police spend a Sunday strip informing Daddy Warbucks that his adopted daughter has most likely been shot in the head execution style and fed to sharks .
Really .
If the cancellation order had come down a week sooner , a gang of frenzied sharks circling Annie 's waterlogged remains would 've been the very last image of her , but instead , the story does go on for another week , where we learn that Annie was n't killed , she was rescued from the gangsters by a renegade war criminal named The Butcher of the Balkans .
Thus , in the final strip , Annie has been kidnapped by a literal genocidal maniac , while Daddy Warbucks zones out , convinced that she has been murdered but unaware that she is still alive and in need of rescue :
And that 's where it ends .
Surely the creators had at least some warning that this was coming , but instead of wrapping the story up , they just cut it off right in the middle , and 86 years of stories end with Annie in South America being essentially pressganged into service to war criminal while Daddy Warbucks does his best impression of Kirk at the end of " Wrath of Khan . "
And just to put the icing on the depression cake , the very last panel is a vague promise of a resolution that is most likely never going to come .
Since then , a third case has surfaced :
He is accused of coercing a woman to have sex with him in 2006 by claiming he could help her cousin , who had recently been arrested on drug charges .
Detective Sandino faces three misdemeanor counts of depriving the women of their civil rights and faces a maximum of three years in prison .
He was released on $ 250,000 bond .
He also faces misdemeanor charges of official misconduct and second degree harassment in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn stemming from the episode at central booking in 2009 .
A lawyer for Detective Sandino , Peter E. Brill , denied the accusations , which he called “ old news . ”
In Mr. Rosario ’s trial , one woman told her story publicly for the first time from the witness stand on Tuesday .
The woman , a 29 - year - old mother of one , testified that Mr. Rosario had lured her with promises to give her applications , for a job as a crossing guard and for after - school programs for her son .

When he arrived at her apartment building with the applications on the night of March 30 , 2008 , she said , he told her to get into his car so he could explain the applications .
They were in English , and she speaks only Spanish .
But once she got into the car , she testified through an interpreter , he began driving and telling her , “ Do n’t be afraid . ”
He eventually stopped the car , told her he wanted to feel her heart and groped her breast , she said .
After she pushed his hand away , she said , he showed her a necklace that she believed to be associated with Santeria .
The woman testified that Mr. Rosario said the necklace “ gave him the power to feel people ” and said he could tell that she “ had suffered a lot in this lifetime . ”
He told her he wanted to help her , she said .
NEW ORLEANS —
For weeks , Governor Bobby Jindal has attacked BP and the Coast Guard for not having adequate plans and resources to battle the oil spill .
But interviews with state and federal officials and experts suggest that Louisiana , from the earliest days of the spill in the Gulf of Mexico , has often disregarded its own longstanding plans and specialists in favor of large - scale proposals that many say would probably have had limited effectiveness and could have even hampered the response .
The state ’s approach has also at times appeared divided :
While some state officials work alongside the Coast Guard and BP every day , others , including the governor , have championed a go - it - alone approach .
Such a stance is popular in a place justifiably skeptical of federal disaster response after Hurricane Katrina .
The federal response , at times slow and disorganized , has been a matter of grave concern to this state , with its fragile coastline .
Jindal , a Republican like all but one of the other Gulf State governors , has been alone among them for his publicly critical stance toward the federal agencies in the response .
Experts said such antagonism could actually slow down that response .
“ You can ask for the moon and say you did n’t get it , but I do n’t think that ’s going to add anything to the response capabilities , ’’ said Doug Lentsch , who was chief of the Coast Guard ’s Pollution Response Branch in Washington during the Exxon Valdez disaster .
“ When that stuff happens , you actually take away the ability of the unified command to get their job done . ’’
A review of Louisiana ’s pre-spill preparation suggests that the state may be open to the same criticisms that Jindal has leveled .
The state has an oil spill coordinator ’s office .
Its staff shrank by half over the last decade , and the 17 - year - old oil spill research and development program that is associated with the office had its annual $ 750,000 in financing cut last year .
The coordinator is responsible for drawing up and signing off on spill contingency plans with the Coast Guard and a committee of federal , state , and local officials .
Some of these plans are rife with omissions , including pages of blank charts that are supposed to detail supplies of such equipment as oil - skimming vessels .
A draft action plan for a worst - case scenario is among many requirements in the southeast Louisiana proposal listed as “ to be developed . ’’
State officials said that many of those gaps had been addressed but that the information had not yet been formally incorporated into the plan by the Coast Guard .
The plans , in conjunction with state and federal laws , outline a response structure , called a unified command .
In the event of a spill , state officials , the responsible party , and federal authorities — usually the Coast Guard — are supposed to work together to marshal resources and create day - to - day action plans .
From the first days of the spill , state representatives at a command center in Houma have been following that script , signing off on the action plans with the Coast Guard and BP .
But on the first weekend in May , after the governor declared a state of emergency and weeks before heavy oil began to hit the coast , senior members of the Jindal administration decided the unified command was not working .
“ We very quickly ran into challenges with the different entities carrying out their responsibilities under that framework , ’’ said Garret Graves , director of the governor ’s office of coastal activities , citing a lack of urgency and decisiveness by the Coast Guard .
“ That ’s where I think the inefficiencies were realized , and that ’s why the state began taking an alternative path . ’’
Under the law , oil spill experts said , there are only two kinds of government plans pertaining to spills , and the state is partly responsible for both .
There are area contingency plans , which the state helps draw up and are meant to be in place when a spill occurs ; and there are action plans , which the state helps put together on a day - to - day basis after a spill .
It is just as much the state ’s responsibility as anyone ’s if a spill occurs and there is no up - to - date contingency plan , said retired Coast Guard Captain Donald S. Jensen , a former federal on - scene coordinator for several oil spills .
In other news :
■ BP ’s effort to drill a relief well through 2 1/2 miles of rock to stop the Gulf spill is on target for completion by mid-August , the oil company giant said yesterday .
■ The first tropical depression of the Atlantic season formed in the Caribbean , raising concerns about what might happen to efforts to contain the oil if bad weather forces BP to abandon its effort .
It ’s still too early to tell exactly where the storm might go and how it might affect oil on and below the surface of the Gulf .

Many parents want to know how to get a baby to sleep through the night Leaving young babies to cry themselves to sleep can harm their developing brains , a parenting expert claims .
Dr Penelope Leach says recent scientific tests show high levels of the stress hormone cortisol develop in babies when no one answers their cries .
If this happens over long periods and repeatedly , it can be " toxic " to their brains , she says in a new book .
Dr Leach suggested unattended extreme crying bouts of 30 minutes or more could be damaging to babies .
The claims come in a new book called The Essential First Year - What Babies Need Parents to Know .
Some neuroscientists describe it as toxic
Dr Leach Dr Leach told the BBC News website : " We are talking about the release of stress chemicals .
The best known of them is cortisol , which is produced under extreme stress . "
" One is not talking about a wakeful baby lying there gurgling , one is talking about a baby that is crying hard and nobody is responding .
" When that happens , and particularly if it happens over a long period , the brain chemical system releases cortisol and that is very bad for brain development .
" Some neuroscientists describe it as toxic . "
The psychologist and parenting expert , who first found fame in the 1970s with her book , Your Baby and Child , said the important thing was for a parent to respond .
The mother - of - two said it was not necessary for the parent to discover why the baby was crying .
" If you do not respond and if you refuse to respond , the baby knows no response is coming , " she added .
" The reason that a baby gives up after half an hour , three - quarters of an hour or an hour is that it has given up and that its expectations have been altered .
" I 've heard it said that babies stop crying because they have learned that mummy wants them to go back to sleep .
" Babies are not capable of that sort of learning . "
' Harder work '
There was no scientific evidence that suggested allowing a baby to " cry - it - out " taught them how to go sleep , she added .
It was possible for a parent to make it clear to a baby that they always come , but that they would not always do what the baby wanted , she added .
" You can show you are quite different at night - that you do n't pick him up and play with him , try to stimulate him or get his Lego out .
" We are trying to teach the baby to become diurnal - to know the difference between day and night . "
She said it was much harder work than closing a door on a shrieking baby but made for a better loving relationship .
She said she was not " getting at parents " in her new book , just trying to provide them with good advice grounded in science .

BP 's out - of - control well will go on spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico for the next two years or more if all attempts to contain or plug the gusher fail , oil industry experts said today .
The estimates , based on new figures supplied by BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , during seven contentious hours of testimony to Congress on Thursday , suggest the potential environmental and economic devastation would far outstrip the damage done so far by the ruptured well , which has been spewing for 60 days .
Hayward told a Congressional committee on Thursday the reservoir still held 50 m barrels , providing fresh urgency to efforts to contain the oil , or seal off the gusher completely with a relief well .
Using the government 's present flow estimates of up to 60,000 barrels a day , BP 's well could go on gushing for two to four years , unless it is stopped .
BP and the administration say they are containing a rising share of the oil from the well , and hope to plug the gusher completely by August , when two relief wells will be complete .
BP said today that the relief wells were within 60 metres of the ruptured well .
The consequences of failure are enormous .
" If it went uncontrolled it could certainly leak for two years and certainly longer than that , said Philip Johnson , a professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Alabama .
But he said the leak rate would fall sharply over time once the natural gas in the reservoir is exhausted .
" That is the driving force , " he said .
" As soon as that is gone , it wo n't leak at any serious rate . "
Hayward 's statement to Congress represents the first definitive word so far from BP on the potential it saw in the Macondo well .
BP exploration plans , submitted to the US government , had suggested production in the order of 15,000 barrels a day , a figure confirmed by Hayward to Congress .
But the 50 m figure cited by Hayward took some industry insiders by surprise .
There have been reports the reservoir held up to 500 m barrels – the figure quoted by Hayward 's questioner , Joe Barton , a Republican from Texas .
" I would assume that 500 m barrels would be a more likely estimate , " said Tadeusz Patzek , the chairman of the department of petroleum and geosystems engineering at the University of Texas at Austin .
" I do n't think you would be going after a 50 mbarrel reservoir so quickly .
This is just simply not enough oil to go after . "
BP spokesmen said that Barton was referring to recoverable oil rather than the total size of the reservoir .
" We have n't made an assessment of the reserves as far as I know , " said Toby Odone , a BP spokesman .
" You start evaluating the reservoir once you complete the well .
Obviously we did n't get to that point . "
The figure was one of the few kernels of solid information offered up by Hayward , who was widely criticised for stonewalling and obfuscation in his appearance before Congress .
The performance did little for BP 's financial position .
Its shares fell back today after Moody 's cut the company 's credit rating to A2 .
Moody 's said it was concerned about the escalating costs of the oil spill , and warned the $ 20 bn ( £ 13,5 bn ) compensation fund agreed earlier this week might not cover all of BP 's liabilities .
" This assessment reflects a substantial upward revision of the estimated size of the leak , the continued failure to bring the leaking Macondo well under control , and the mounting costs and claims for damages , " the ratings agency said .
" Uncertainty over the ultimate cost for massive litigation claims and other contingent liabilities will be an overhang on BP 's creditworthiness that will persist for years to come , " it added .
Ken Feinberg , who was appointed to oversee the $ 20bn claims fund , has promised to turn around claims within 60 days .
However , Hayward did get a vote of sympathy from John Hofmeister , a former president of Shell , who has himself testified to Congress on six occasions .
He noted Hayward was operating under the threat of criminal investigation , and said he would have taken a similar legalistic approach were he in the same situation .
" It 's not possible for a CEO to know everything that is going on at every level of production , " he told MSNBC television .
" The Congressmen are very unfair to demand he know what happened at a meeting that took place four or five levels below him . "
The Detroit Red Wings have selected center Louis - Marc Aubry from Montreal of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League with their third - round pick ( 81st overall ) in the NHL entry draft Saturday at Staples Center in Los Angeles .
Aubry ( 6 - foot - 3 , 186 ) had 15 goals and 18 assists in 66 games last season .
His father , Pierre , played in 202 NHL games with the Quebec Nordiques and Red Wings from 1980 - 85 .
“ Do you support allowing people to carry loaded guns into an American airport ? ” Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey asked the attorney general at a recent Appropriations Committee hearing .
The proper answer to this question would seem to be : “ Huh ? ” However , Eric Holder is a dignified guy , so he settled for “ very worrisome . ”
Lautenberg has a knack for proposing laws against things that most people would presume were illegal already .
You may remember him from such past hits as “ Let ’s Not Let Convicted Felons Buy Weapons at Gun Shows ” and “ Do n’t Sell Assault Rifles to People on the Terrorist Watch List . ”
Neither is anywhere near being passed .
Or even coming up for a vote .
Now he ’s got a bill making it illegal to carry a firearm into an airport .
It was inspired by the Georgia State Legislature , which recently passed a bill requiring the Atlanta airport to let people with gun permits take their weapons into the lobby , baggage claim , food courts — everywhere short of the point where you take off your shoes .
21 Kids , 11 Mothers , 1 Father : Ways to Collect Child Support
A 29 - year - old man in Tennessee apparently has been really busy ... fathering children , and now appearing at the court house , that is .
KAKE reports that Desmond Hatchett is claiming to have fathered 20 and just maybe 21 or more kids ( he says he knows all their names and ages ) by at least 11 different mothers .
Desmond Hatchett 's circumstances surfaced after Tennessee authorities took him to court for failing to pay his child support , which considering he reportedly earns minimum wages , might not be too surprising .
Indeed , the story noted that even though the various " mothers of Hatchett 's children are supposed to get anywhere from $ 25 to $ 309 a month ... when his paycheck is garnished amongst them all , some women only get a $ 1.98 a month . "
Even though Hatchett 's case is extreme and most people hopefully wo n't face 10 other parents seeking child support from the same person , what measures are available for a custodial parent to go about collecting unpaid child support ?
There are actually a variety of methods which can be used to collect child support from " deadbeat " parents or those that are simply temporarily behind .
Here 's a quick list with descriptions of key options :
1 ) Wage deduction orders or garnishment - garnishment of wages is a common way to collect currently due and previously unpaid child support .
This is basically where a court orders an employer to withhold a certain amount ( capped by law ) which is then passed on to the custodial parent .
2 ) Tax Refunds - states can intercept any tax refunds due to parents with unpaid child support .
This can be a good option for large past due amounts where a large refund is anticipated .
3 ) Liens on Property - another option is to have the state place a lien on property owed by the delinquent parent ( assuming they have something of value such as a car , real estate , etc. ) .
This essentially puts a legal burden on the property , and the amount of the lien must be satisfied when it is sold
4 ) Contempt of Court -
This may presumably be how Desmond Hatchett has reportedly enjoyed some jail time .
A court has the power to impose fines and jail terms upon a finding of contempt of court via a failure to pay ordered child support .
But this is usually a last resort , as jailing a parent ( at the expense of time they could / should be working ) does n't necessarily help with child support payments .
For what it 's worth , Hatchett has indicated his procreation days are over , " ' I 'm done .
I 'll say I 'm done , ' he said . "
Apparently residents in Knoxville are n't taking his word , as one story suggested that many " called for him to be castrated . "
A group of fundamentalist settlers torched , on Saturday , several farmlands in Wad al - Maleh in the northern plains of the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank .
The torched lands were planted with wheat and barley .
Eyewitnesses reported that the Palestinian firefighters arrived at the scene and prevented a bigger disaster .
The Popular Campaign in the Northern Plains reported that Israeli soldiers are aiding the settlers in their attacks instead of stopping they , and that the army obstructs firefighters and civil defense teams from reaching their destination .
The army did not evacuate the settlers and did not conduct any arrests .
Yet , the solders several residents who rushed to the torched lands in order to extinguish the fire .
The attack came only two weeks after the soldiers forced the residents out of the Ein al - Hilwa area as the settlers are planning to install an illegal outpost there .
Manute Bol hospitalized
Former Washington Bullets center Manute Bol was hospitalized in Northern Virginia with kidney failure and Stevens - Johnson Syndrome last week , according to a friend and associate .
Tom Prichard , who has worked with Bol on building a school in Sudan through the group Sudan Sunrise , said that Bol was returning from several months in Sudan , where his health had deteriorated .
Prichard said Bol flew into Dulles and had to stay overnight near the airport before a flight back to his family in Kansas ; after friends asked the hotel manager to check on Bol , he was rushed to a local hospital .
Prichard said that Bol has undergone three rounds of dialysis , and that the Stevens - Johnson Syndrome might necessitate a move to a burn unit .
" He 's at great risk , " Prichard said .
" He 's in a bad way . "
Bol , 47 , had been in Sudan to work on his school project , but was asked to stay through the elections this spring , Prichard said .
The former center canceled a string of speaking engagements , including an appearance at a Wizards game , to help with the elections in his county , a key electoral region .
While Bol was gone , his wife also gave birth to a daughter , whom he has yet to meet .
Prichard said Bol is on morphine and in terrible pain , but is able to talk with visitors and seems to be stabilizing .
" He 's pleased that he accomplished what he was so determined to do in Sudan , " Prichard said .
" He was fighting with every bit of his strength to try to keep Southern Sudan on course towards a referendum in January of next year .
...
It put him right on the edge of survival , and he made it . "
Prichard encouraged well - wishers to post messages on the Manute Bol Get Well Soon Facebook page ; friends will print out the messages there and bring them to the hospital .

STRATFOR often discusses how Russia is on a bit of a roll .
The U.S. distraction in the Middle East has offered Russia a golden opportunity to re-establish its spheres of influence in the region , steadily expanding the Russian zone of control into a shape that is eerily reminiscent of the old Soviet Union .
Since 2005 , when this process began , Russia has clearly reasserted itself as the dominant power in Armenia , Belarus , Kazakhstan , Azerbaijan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan and Ukraine , and has intimidated places like Georgia and Turkmenistan into a sort of silent acquiescence .
But we have not spent a great amount of time explaining why this is the case .
It is undeniable that Russia is a Great Power , but few things in geopolitics are immutable , and Russia is no exception .
Russian Geography , Strategy and Demographics
Russia ’s geography is extremely open , with few geographic barriers to hunker behind .
There are no oceans , mountains or deserts to protect Russia from outside influences — or armies — and Russia ’s forests , which might provide some measure of protection , are on the wrong side of the country .
The Russian taiga is in the north and , as such , can only provide refuge for Russians after the country ’s more economically useful parts have already fallen to invaders ( as during the Mongol occupation ) .
Despite its poor geographic hand , Russia has managed to cope via a three - part strategy :
Lay claim to as large a piece of land as possible .
Flood it with ethnic Russians to assert reliable control .
Establish an internal intelligence presence that can monitor and , if need be , suppress the indigenous population .
Throughout Russian history , this strategy has been repeated until the Russian state reached an ocean , a mountain chain , a desert , or a foe that fought back too strongly .
In many ways , the strategies of the Kremlin of 2010 are extremely similar to those of Catherine the Great , Ivan the Terrible or Joseph Stalin .
But it is no longer the 17th century , and this strategy does not necessarily play to Russia ’s strengths anymore .
The second prong of the strategy — flooding the region with ethnic Russians — is no longer an option because of Russia ’s demographic profile .
The Russian birth rate has been in decline for a century , and in the post - Cold War era , the youngest tranche of the Russian population simply collapsed .
The situation transformed from an academic debate about Russia ’s future to a policy debate about Russia ’s present .
The bust in the birth rate in the 1990s and 2000s has generated the smallest population cohort in Russian history , and in a very few years , those post - Cold War children will themselves be at the age where they will be having children .
A small cohort will create an even smaller cohort , and Russia ’s population problems could well evolve from crushing to irrecoverable .
Even if this cohort reproduces at a sub-Saharan African birthrate , even if the indications of high tuberculosis and HIV infections among this population cohort are all wrong , and even if Russia can provide a level of services for this group that it could n’t manage during the height of Soviet power , any demographic bounce would not occur until the 2050s — once the children of this cohort have sufficiently aged to raise their own children .
Until 2050 , Russia simply has to learn to work with less .
A lot less .
And this is the best - case scenario for Russia in the next generation .
Simply put , Russia does not have the population to sustain the country at its present boundaries .
As time grinds on , Russia ’s capacity for doing so will decrease drastically .
Moscow understands all this extremely well , and this is a leading rationale behind current Russian foreign policy : Russia ’s demographics will never again be as “ positive ” as they are now , and the Americans are unlikely to be any more distracted than they are now .
So Russia is moving quickly and , more important , intelligently .
Russia is thus attempting to reach some natural anchor points , e.g. , some geographic barriers that would limit the state ’s exposure to outside powers .
The Russians hope they will be able to husband their strength from these anchor points .
Moscow ’s long - term strategy consistently has been to trade space for time ahead of the beginning of the Russian twilight ; if the Russians can expand to these anchor points , Moscow hopes it can trade less space for more time .
Unfortunately for Moscow , there are not many of these anchor points in Russia ’s neighborhood .
One is the Baltic Sea , a fact that terrifies the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
Another is the Carpathian Mountains .
This necessitates the de facto absorption not only of Ukraine , but also of Moldova , something that makes Romania lose sleep at night .
And then there are the Tien Shan Mountains of Central Asia — which brings us to the crisis of the moment .
The Crisis in Kyrgyzstan
The former Soviet Central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan is not a particularly nice piece of real estate .
While it is in one of those mountainous regions that could be used to anchor Russian power , it is on the far side of the Eurasian steppe from the Russian core , more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,800 miles ) removed from the Russian heartland .
The geography of Kyrgyzstan itself also leaves a great deal to be desired .
Kyrgyzstan is an artificial construct created by none other than Stalin , who rearranged internal Soviet borders in the region to maximize the chances of dislocation , dispute and disruption among the indigenous populations in case the Soviet provinces ever gained independence .
Stalin drew his lines well : Central Asia ’s only meaningful population center is the Fergana Valley .
Kyrgyzstan obtained the region ’s foothills and highlands , which provide the region ’s water ; Uzbekistan gained the fertile floor of the valley ; and Tajikistan walked away with the only decent access to the valley as a whole .
As such , the three states continuously are jockeying for control over the only decent real estate in the region .
Arguably , Kyrgyzstan has the least to work with of any of the region ’s states .
Nearly all of its territory is mountainous ; what flat patches of land it does have on which to build cities are scattered about .
There is , accordingly , no real Kyrgyz core .
Consequently , the country suffers from sharp internal differences : Individual clans hold dominion over tiny patches of land separated from each other by rugged tracts of mountains .
In nearly all cases , those clans have tighter economic and security relationships with foreigners than they do with each other .
( click here to enlarge image )
A little more than five years ago , Western nongovernmental organizations ( and undoubtedly a handful of intelligence services ) joined forces with some of these regional factions in Kyrgyzstan to overthrow the country ’s pro-Russian ruling elite in what is known as a “ color revolution ” in the former Soviet Union .
Subsequently , Kyrgyzstan — while not exactly pro-Western — dwelled in a political middle ground the Russians found displeasing .
In April , Russia proved that it , too , can throw a color revolution and Kyrgyzstan ’s government switched yet again .
Since then , violence has wracked the southern regions of Jalal - Abad , Batken and Osh — strongholds of the previous government .
In recent days , nearly 100,000 Kyrgyz residents have fled to Uzbekistan .
The interim government of Prime Minister Roza Otunbayeva is totally outmatched .
It is not so much that her government is in danger of falling — those same mountains that make it nearly impossible for Bishkek to control Osh make it equally difficult for Osh to take over Bishkek – but that the country has de facto split into ( at least ) two pieces .
As such , Otunbayeva — whose government only coalesced due to the Russian intervention — has publicly and directly called upon the Russians to provide troops to help hold the country together .
This request cuts to the core weakness in the Russian strategy .
Despite much degradation in the period after the Soviet dissolution , Russia ’s intelligence services remain without peer .
In fact , now that they have the direct patronage of the Russian prime minister , they have proportionally more resources and influence than ever .
They have proved that they can rewire Ukraine ’s political world to expunge American influence , manipulate events in the Caucasus to whittle away at Turkey ’s authority , cause riots in the Baltics to unbalance NATO members , and reverse Kyrgyzstan ’s color revolution .
But they do not have backup .
Were this the 19th century , there would already be scads of Russian settlers en route to the Fergana to dilute the control of the locals ( although they would certainly be arriving after the Russian army ) , to construct a local economy dependent upon imported labor and linked to the Russian core , and to establish a new ruling elite .
( It is worth noting that the resistance of Central Asians to Russian encroachment meant that the Russians never seriously attempted to make the region into a majority - Russian one .
Even so , the Russians still introduced their own demographic to help shape the region more to Moscow ’s liking . )
Instead , Russia ’s relatively few young families are busy holding the demographic line in Russia proper .
For the first time in Russian history , there is no surplus Russian population that can be relocated to the provinces .
And without that population , the Russian view of the Fergana — to say nothing of Kyrgyzstan — changes dramatically .
The region is remote and densely populated , and reaching it requires transiting three countries .
And one of these states would have something to say about that .
That state is Uzbekistan .
The Uzbek Goliath
After the Russians and Ukrainians , the Uzbeks are the most populous ethnicity in the former Soviet Union .
They are a Turkic people who do not enjoy particularly good relations with anyone .
Uzbekistan ’s ruling Karimov family is roundly hated both at home and abroad ; the Central Asian country boasts one of the most repressive governing systems in modern times .
Uzbekistan also happens to be quite powerful by Central Asian standards .
There are more Uzbeks in Central Asia than there are Kyrgyz , Turkmen , Tajiks and Russians combined .
The Uzbek intelligence services are modeled after their Russian counterparts , interspersing agents throughout the Uzbek population to ensure loyalty and to root out dissidents .
It is the only country of the five former Soviet states in the region that actually has a military that can engage in military action .
It is the only one of the five that has most of its cities in logical proximity and linked with decent infrastructure ( even if it is split into the Tashkent region and the Fergana region by Stalinesque cartographic creativity ) .
It is the only one of the five that is both politically stable ( if politically brittle ) and that has the ability to project power .
And it is also the only Central Asian state that is self - sufficient in both food and energy .
To top it all off , some 2.5 million ethnic
Uzbeks reside in the other four former Soviet Central Asian states , providing Tashkent a wealth of tools for manipulating developments throughout the region .
And manipulate it does .
In addition to the odd border spat , Uzbekistan intervened decisively in Tajikistan ’s civil war in the 1990s .
Tashkent is not shy about noting that it thinks most Tajik , and especially Kyrgyz , territory should belong to Uzbekistan , particularly the territory of southern Kyrgyzstan , where the current violence is strongest .
Uzbekistan views many of the Russian strategies to expunge Western interests from Central Asia as preparation for moves against Uzbekistan , with the Russian - sponsored coup in Kyrgyzstan an excellent case in point .
From March through May , Uzbekistan began activating its reserves and reinforcing its Fergana border regions , which heightened the state of fear in Bishkek from shrill to panic mode .
Given Uzbek means , motive and opportunity , Moscow is fairly confident that sending Russian peacekeepers to southern Kyrgyzstan would provoke a direct military confrontation with an angry and nervous Uzbekistan .
In STRATFOR ’s view , Russia would win this war , but this victory would come neither easily nor cheaply .
The Fergana is a long way from Russia , and the vast bulk of Russia ’s military is static , not expeditionary like its U.S. counterpart .
Uzbek supply lines would be measured in hundreds of meters , Russian lines in thousands of kilometers .
Moreover , Uzbekistan could interrupt nearly all Central Asian natural gas that currently flows to Russia without even launching a single attack .
( The Turkmen natural gas that Russia ’s Gazprom normally depends upon travels to Russia via Uzbek territory . )
Yet this may be a conflict Russia feels it cannot avoid .
The Russians have not forward - garrisoned a military force sufficient to protect Kyrgyzstan , nor can they resettle a population that could transform Kyrgyzstan .
Therefore , the Russian relationship with Kyrgyzstan is based neither on military strategy nor on economic rationality .
Instead , it is based on the need to preserve a certain level of credibility and fear — credibility that the Russians will protect Kyrgyzstan should push come to shove , and Kyrgyz fear of what Russia will do to it should they not sign on to the Russian sphere of influence .
It is a strategy strongly reminiscent of the U.S. Cold War containment doctrine , under which the United States promised to aid any ally , anytime , anywhere if in exchange they would help contain the Soviets .
This allowed the Soviet Union to choose the time and place of conflicts , and triggered U.S. involvement in places like Vietnam .
Had the United States refused battle , the American alliance structure could have crumbled .
Russia now faces a similar dilemma , and just as the United States had no economic desire to be in Vietnam , the Russians really do not much care what happens to Kyrgyzstan — except as it impacts Russian interests elsewhere .
But even victory over Uzbekistan would not solve the problem .
Smashing the only coherent government in the region would create a security vacuum .
Again , the Americans provide a useful corollary : The U.S. “ victory ” over Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq and the Taliban ’s Afghanistan proved that “ winning ” is the easy part .
Occupying the region over the long haul to make sure that the victory is not worse than the status quo antebellum is a decade - to - generational effort that requires a significant expenditure of blood and treasure .
Russia desperately needs to devote such resources elsewhere — particularly once the United States is no longer so preoccupied in the Middle East .
Russia is attempting to finesse a middle ground by talking the Uzbeks down and offering the compromise of non-Russian troops from the Collective Security Treaty Organization , a Russian - led military organization , as an alternative to Russian forces .
This may resolve the immediate crisis , but neither the Uzbeks nor the challenges they pose are going anywhere .
And unlike Russia , Uzbekistan boasts very high demographic growth .
The bottom line is this : Despite all of Russia ’s recent gains , Moscow ’s strategy requires tools that the Russians no longer have .
It requires Moscow delving into the subregional politics of places that could well bleed Russia dry — and this is before any power that wishes Russia ill begins exploring what it and the Uzbeks might achieve together .

UPDATE
Dmsl is an active project on github and I am looking for active developers that can submit any bugs they may come across .
I have been using it in production environments for nearly one year as of 12/2011 .
Refer to the repository README for an in depth look at current development , http://github.com/dasacc22/dmsl/blob/master/README
So it has been a busy past few days .
During which I have written up an implementation of HAML in python .
The closest thing I saw to this before was GRHML , whose site seems non-functional and I had a hard time finding information on its status .
So without further ado , let me introduce DAML , my HAML implementation .
: title = ' Hello World ! ' %html %head % title {title} % body :include (' header.html ' ) : greeting = lambda x : ' %p Hello , { 0}'.format(x ) : greeting ( 'user ' ) : greeting ( 'me ' ) : greeting ( ' world ' ) : items = [ 'a ' , 'b ' , 'c' , ' d ' ] : def is_last ( i ) : : return len( items ) is i+1 and ' ( class=last ) ' or '' %h2 Loop Method 2 ( python list comprehension ) %ul :[' %li{0} { 1}'.format( is_last( i ) , x ) for i , x in enumerate ( items ) ] : include (' footer.html ' )
Ok , now this is n’t all it does but let me talk about a couple things first .
For one , this project , as of today , is only 3 or 4 days old .
Its hard for me to recall b/c I ’ve poured a lot of time into trying to make this run as fast as possible .
Today on the other hand has produced a lot of slow downs and hackish code for implementing features like Django code blocks .
For you XSL people ( which would be me ) that means a way to name and call templates from other templates .
So anyway , a lot of this code from today ( and yesterday ) needs some love .
With that said , lets go over some differences between HAML and DAML when it comes to marking up HTML .
You ’ll notice right away that declaring tags is straight forward and precisely the same .
I ’ve never actually used HAML so I dont know its exact syntax , but I spent a lot of time perusing the documentation for HAML .
Now the actual text processor in DAML is quite fast for building documents .
At one point during development , when i was still testing speeds in comparison to HAML , I had results along the lines of 0.21 ms processing time for DAML versus 2.4 ms processing time for HAML .
This was for plain - jane HTML declaration .
Lets look at some of that now with DAML .
%html %head % title Good Stuff % body #header Some stuff here and indentions of plain text will all be part of this div . span while this child div whose class = " span " will be embedded within the above div while this text is tailed and multilined too %p and heres some random content too % strong that can be played however you like .
%p one thing worth noting is that new tags % strong need to be on %em new lines so keep that in mind .
All of this renders fine of course .
But I still have a TODO list for handling stuff unrelated to python expression evaluating .
Namely comments , escaping , whitespace control .
This is pretty much in line with HAML thus far although I often see blank lines in HAML appended with equals - sign and I cant recall what for .
Regardless , the next thing to note is the use of variables .
Which loosely follows the string .
Formatter ( and would fully support it if not for speed issues at the moment , but soon hopefully ) .
Lets go over an example of setting and using variables .
: title = ' Hello World ! '
%h1 {title}
Simple , eh ?
Now here ’s the deal .
There is a sand - boxed python eval going on .
All lines starting with : colons are getting added to an evaluation queue that gets compiled and eval’d .
Currently you would tag variables just like using string .
Formatter and in the future , this will support all the goodies associated with it .
Currently though whats going on is its simply accessing the variable declared ( versus string .
Formatter being setup with the documents namespace and getting called ) .
Never - the - less , this works fine so far .
Lets look at some other things we can do with “ : ”
:l = [ ] : for x in range ( 20 ) : : l.append(x ) %div :[ ' %p { 0 } '. format( x+1 ) for x in l ]
Notice first , that you can basically freely declare normal python code blocks .
You can also declare functions to make use of as shown with the initial intro document .
I would say , ideally , the syntax I would want to go for in the majority of cases is something like ( for - loop with plain - text block not yet functional )
# body :items = [ 'a ' , 'b ' , 'c' , ' d ' ] : is_last = lambda i : len( items ) is i+1 and ' ( class=last ) ' or '' %ul : for i , x in enumerate ( items ) : % li:is_last ( i ) {x} # div.class ( attr=val , attr2=val2 ) oh and here 's this too
So this is something I am working towards , but you can totally declare : func ( * args ) inline right now and it works .
Notice , going back to the plain - text that you can freely declare % tag#id.class ( attr=val ) in almost any order , the only except is you can not start a line with ( attr=val ) nor can you declare ( attr=val ) ( attr=val ) though the latter may be added .
Part of my TODO list is to have the ability to span attributes across multiple lines .
Ill touch on one last bit here , I implemented something similar to django blocks ( at its most basic level ) .
Its a wee bit limited until i implement multiline filter options as part of the preprocessor I * just * started working on not but 4 hours ago .
But let me show what the final syntax would look like
: extends (' template.daml ' ) : block header % h1 {title} OVERRIDE !
Now the above does n’t work until i finish a bit on this preprocessor but to show you how that will work , let me show you how the above does currently work
: extends (' template.daml ' ) : block ( ' header
% h1 {title} OVERRIDE !')
Now that does work , and as you can see , my preprocessor is basically going to go through for indented portions of text under colon directive calls and push it into the related function thats in the sandboxed globals .
This basically means that you can write all sorts of text filters and everything really really easy b/c then back on your end you may have a need to do “ blank ” with “ blah .
So ..
my_python_code.py
------------------------- def my_filter(s ) : s = s.splitlines ( ) for x in s : pass # do blank with blah return s
I ’ve basically tried to unify a number of features of HAML here so that anything can be easily overridden or customized and extended .
Nothing thats just built - in and untouchable .
There ’s even more to come surely but I am honestly way burnt out on this .
Let me lastly explain just how FAST this works currently .
Now before I went in today / yesterday adding in all these crazy bits and pieces , I grabbed the bench suite from genshi that benchmarks all the most popular python templating engines .
I wrote my template to do everything to spec as the others were doing and these were my results .
Mako : 0.38ms
DAML : 0.44ms
Cheetah : 0.66ms
Genshi-Text : 0.96ms
and after that it just trailed off into really big numbers with Genshi coming in at 1.5 ms ?? and django at 2.4ms ??
So this thing has the potential to be FAST .
Now since the hackery I ’ve pulled in the past number of hours I ’ve actually almost doubled my processing time and the above test for DAML now runs at 0.85 ms but keep in mind i have done no optimization / refactoring / code - cleanup / obvious - bug - fixes - needed to the codebase i just recently committed .
So that portion needs some love and I ’d love to get the speed back down to what it was just early yesterday morning .
Now , if your interested in the project , pleeease check it out at github , http://github.com/dasacc22/dmsl and play around with it .
I ’m going to slow my development down to a crawl comparitively as I ’m really burnt out .
I wont be implementing any new features and I ’ll be cleaning up my code base yet again and trying to write beautiful code to everything ive hacked together today / last - nite .
And please feel free to contact me by email or comments or however regarding this project .
I would like to get the code cleaned up so that I can collaborate on different things to really bring this project up to par .
Thanks , and enjoy

The 10 big fictions of Rabbit - Proof Fence
The 2002 film , Rabbit - Proof Fence , directed by Phil Noyce , is advertised as “ a true story ” .
Many school teachers think it is an accurate portrayal of history .
It is anything but .
The film gets the names of the major characters and locations right , but not much else .
It is a work of dramatic fiction that tells at least ten major falsehoods .
1 . The three girls Molly , Gracie and Daisy were not taken by surprise and removed by force from Jigalong .
The violent removal scene in the film is entirely fictional .
The girls ’ mothers knew beforehand they were to go with Constable Riggs and , without any protest , they reluctantly acquiesced in the removal .
The girls left Jigalong on horseback , not locked in a motor car .
2. The Western Australian Chief Protector , A.O. Neville , did not remove the girls as part of some government plan to “ breed out the colour ” .
Molly , aged 14 , and Gracie , aged 11 , were removed because they were having sex with the white fence workers who stopped at the Jigalong depot overnight .
Fifteen years earlier , Molly ’s mother had done the same with a young English fence inspector , who soon moved on .
At the time , in all Australian states , under - age white girls were removed for the same reason .
3. Daisy , aged 8 , was removed because she was betrothed to marry a full - blood Aboriginal man old enough to be her grandfather .
In traditional Aboriginal society , girls this age could be married .
They had sexual relations immediately .
Daisy could be removed from Jigalong under the 1905 Aboriginal
Act because she was a half - caste girl .
Had she been a full - blood Aborigine she could not have been legally removed and would have had to go through with the marriage .
The lay missionary Mary Bennett told the Moseley Royal Commission in 1934 that if full - blood girls who married at this age conceived , the babies always died either before or during childbirth , and the child mother often died with them .
4 . The speech in the film to a Perth ladies charity society by actor Kenneth Branagh , playing A.O. Neville , was never made by the real Neville .
The words did not come from a transcript found in any historical archive but were created for the film by screenwriter Christine Olsen .
5 . When the girls were removed in 1931 , Neville did not have control over the marriages of all the Aborigines in the state .
The Western Australian government never gave him either the legal authority or the funding to manage Aboriginal people ’s affairs in the way the film alleges .
6 . The Moore River Settlement was not an institution solely for children , as the film depicts .
It was a welfare settlement for Aborigines of all ages .
Most of its children went there with their parents .
When the three girls arrived in 1931 , unaccompanied children were in a minority , comprising only 64 of the 400 inhabitants .
Between 1915 and 1940 , an average of only ten unaccompanied children a year were sent to Moore River .
In 1931 , Molly , Gracie and Daisy were three of only four children in the whole state sent there , out of an Aboriginal population of 29,000 .
7 . The Moore River Settlement was not , as the film portrays it , a prison .
Most Aboriginal people went there voluntarily and temporarily to gain access to welfare .
Between 1930 and 1934 Moore River admitted 1067 people , but over the same period 1030 people left .
8 . On their great trek home , the girls were not pursued by a sympathetic black tracker .
9 . They did not receive any help along the way from a sexually - exploited Aboriginal domestic servant .
10 .
They did not cross the north - western desert unassisted , nearly perishing in the process .
The girls were eventually brought home to Jigalong by a white cattle station contractor , riding on his camels .
The filmmakers did very little original research themselves .
Instead , their main source was the book written by Molly ’s daughter , Doris Pilkington , called Follow the Rabbit - Proof Fence ( 1996 ) , which they adapted with creative licence .
If history teachers insist on discussing this topic , they will find the book a much more reliable resource than the film .
Indeed , Pilkington did a good job of research and most of what she says is backed by evidence .
Her only serious mistake was to believe that the Moore River Settlement was an institution exclusively for children .
Her book does not contain a number of the film ’s anachronisms about Neville ’s ad­ministration , does not misrepresent his ideas and , unlike the film , does not invent scenes for dramatic effect .
All the above information about the three girls is discussed in more detail and with complete references to sources in the Preface to The Fabrication of Aboriginal History , Volume Three , The Stolen Generations .
Chapter Eight contains a detailed account of the number of admissions , policies and conditions at the Moore River Settlement .
Chapter Nine discusses Aboriginal practices in relation to child marriage and sexuality , and the response by governments and missionaries .
In December 2009 , the film ’s director Phil Noyce and screenwriter Christine Olsen responded in the press to my criticisms of their work .
Noyce said I was “ either extremely lazy or just plain dishonest ” in my examination of the evidence ( Sydney Morning Herald , 15 December 2009 , p 4 ) .
To establish their case , Noyce and Olsen produced a letter by the Superintendent of the Jigalong depot , A.J. Keeling , written on July 10 , 1930 .
Although Keeling had earlier argued for the removal of the three half - caste girls because they “ were not getting a fair chance as the blacks consider the half - castes inferior to them ” , in this letter he reconsidered his position .
“ They lean very much towards the black and on second thought I do n’t suppose there would be much gained in removing them . ”
But this letter does not prove anything .
When he received Keeling ’s letter in July , Neville did not act on it .
He did not take a decision to remove the girls until five months later .
The real catalyst was a letter he received from a different source .
On 9 December 1930 , Mrs Chellow of Murra Munda Station near Jigalong wrote to him about Molly and Gracie ’s behavior .
“ I think you should see about them as they are running wild with the whites ” .
It was only after receiving this letter that Neville put in motion the procedures that would eventually see the girls sent to Moore River in July 1931 .
At the time , ladies like Mrs Chellow could not frankly discuss sex­ual matters in an official letter , but there is no doubting the message she wanted to convey .
“ Running wild ” , when applied to girls , was a contemporary euphemism for promiscuity ; “ running wild with the whites ” meant Molly and Gracie were having sex with the whites .
Doris Pilkington disputes this .
She responded to my interpretation saying her mother told her “ running wild ” simply meant that the girls were watching musterers catch and brand calves , “ cheering them on and all that ” .
( The Australian , 15 December 2009 , p 7 ) It is understandable that Pilkington would want to defend her mother ’s reputation but women of Mrs Chellow ’s generation ( like my own mother and her friends , who commonly used " running wild " to describe promiscuous teenage girls ) knew well what it meant .
The term came from the title song of the 1923 American musical review “ Runnin ’ Wild ” by Arthur Gibbs , Joseph Grey and Leo Wood .
Anyone who wants to pursue its contemporary meaning should check out the movie Some Like it Hot where Marilyn Monroe sings a raunchy version that leaves nobody in any doubt .

Earlier today , Microsoft issued a press - release which stated that subsidiary Rare has received a new , distinctive look in anticipation of the 25th anniversary of the developer later this summer .
Rare was officially founded in 1985 and developed popular first - party titles for SNES and Nintendo 64 during the ’90s , such as Goldeneye 007 , Perfect Dark , and the Banjo - Kazooie series .
After the organization was acquired by Microsoft in 2002 , the organization developed titles for the first - generation Xbox , two launch - titles for the Xbox 360 and later created the Viva Piñata - series .
The founders of the studio , brothers Tim and Chris Stamper , had already left the organization in 2007 .
Microsoft calls the identity of the studio both “ modern and classic ” , stating these are adjectives that describe Rare well .
Four distinct logos have been released , all of which can be found after the jump .
It is currently unclear why the new identity of Rare includes four different logos .
The website of the studio will also undergo a full re-launch in the near future , refecting the new identity .
It is unclear on which projects Rare is currently working , though more details are expected to be revealed at the upcoming E3 .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Israel has said it will continue a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip despite growing global pressure to lift the siege after a navy raid on a Turkish ferry carrying aid killed nine activists this week .
What is the legality of the blockade and did Israel ’s intervention breach international law ?
Below are some questions and answers on the issue :
CAN ISRAEL IMPOSE A NAVAL BLOCKADE ON GAZA ?
Yes it can , according to the law of blockade which was derived from customary international law and codified in the 1909 Declaration of London .
It was updated in 1994 in a legally recognized document called the “ San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea . ”
Under some of the key rules , a blockade must be declared and notified to all belligerents and neutral states , access to neutral ports cannot be blocked , and an area can only be blockaded which is under enemy control .
“ On the basis that Hamas is the ruling entity of Gaza and Israel is in the midst of an armed struggle against that ruling entity , the blockade is legal , ” said Philip Roche , partner in the shipping disputes and risk management team with law firm Norton Rose .
WHAT ARE INTERNATIONAL WATERS ?
Under the U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea a coastal state has a “ territorial sea ” of 12 nautical miles from the coast over which it is sovereign .
Ships of other states are allowed “ innocent passage ” through such waters .
There is a further 12 nautical mile zone called the “ contiguous zone ” over which a state may take action to protect itself or its laws .
“ However , strictly beyond the 12 nautical miles limit the seas are the “ high seas ” or international waters , ” Roche said .
The Israeli navy said on Monday the Gaza bound flotilla was intercepted 120 km ( 75 miles ) west of Israel .
The Turkish captain of one of the vessels told an Istanbul news conference after returning home from Israeli detention they were 68 miles outside Israeli territorial waters .
Under the law of a blockade , intercepting a vessel could apply globally so long as a ship is bound for a “ belligerent ” territory , legal experts say .
CAN ISRAEL USE FORCE WHEN INTERCEPTING SHIPS ?
Under international law it can use force when boarding a ship .
“ If force is disproportionate it would be a violation of the key tenets of the use of force , ” said Commander James Kraska , professor of international law at the U.S. Naval War College .
Israeli authorities said marines who boarded the Turkish vessel Mavi Marmara opened fire in self - defense after activists clubbed and stabbed them and snatched some of their weapons .
Legal experts say proportional force does not mean that guns cannot be used by forces when being attacked with knives .
“ But there has got to be a relationship between the threat and response , ” Kraska said .
The use of force may also have other repercussions .
“ While the full facts need to emerge from a credible and transparent investigation , from what is known now , it appears that Israel acted within its legal rights , ” said J. Peter Pham , a strategic adviser to U.S. and European governments .
“ However , not every operation that the law permits is necessarily prudent from the strategic point of view . ”
OPPONENTS HAVE CALLED ISRAEL’S RAID “ PIRACY . ” WAS IT ?
No , as under international law it was considered a state action .
“ Whether what Israel did is right or wrong , it is not an act of piracy .
Piracy deals with private conduct particularly with a pecuniary or financial interest , ” Kraska said .
HAVE THERE BEEN ANY SHIPPING DISRUPTIONS AFTER THE RAID ?
None so far but the International Chamber of Shipping ( ICS ) , an association which represents 75 percent of the world ’s merchant fleet , has expressed “ deep concern ” over the boarding by Israeli forces , arguing that merchant ships have a right to safe passage and freedom of navigation in international waters .
“ These fundamental principles of international law must always be upheld by all of the world ’s nations , ” the ICS said .

If you 're in the military , here 's a tip : do n't put upcoming missions in your Facebook status .
You would n't think someone would need to tell you that , but here we are .

A raid on suspected militants in the West Bank was cancelled yesterday after an Israeli soldier updated his Facebook status to read " On Wednesday we clean up Qatanah , and on Thursday , god willing , we come home . "
The solider has since , unsurprisingly , been relieved of combat duty for being a moron .
He 'll also spend 10 days in prison for his update .
Trying to educate soldiers on the importance of not leaking classified info to Facebook , the Israel Defense Forces have started putting up new posters in bases :
In posters placed on military bases , a mock Facebook page shows the images of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Syrian President Bashar Assad and Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah .
Below their pictures - and Facebook " friend requests " - reads the slogan : " You think that everyone is your friend ? "

I really want to see one of those posters .
Anyone in the IDF want to send us a picture ?

I wo n't post it on Facebook , promise .

While this campaign has been very successful , thousands of people still do n't know about the military recruiting provision of No Child Left Behind or the Pentagon 's illegal database .
The report Trafficking in persons to Europe for sexual exploitation , issued by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) , shows that criminal groups make around $ 3 billion per year through sexual exploitation and the forced labour of some 140,000 people at any given time .
The vast majority of victims tend to be young women who are subjected to rape , violence , imprisonment , drugging and other forms of abuse , according to UNODC .
Around the world , more than 2.4 million people – up to 80 per cent women and girls – are currently being exploited as victims of human trafficking , either for sexual or labour exploitation , the UN has said .
Other forms of human trafficking include domestic servitude , the removal of organs and the exploitation of children .
At the same event , Spain , which holds the European Union ( EU ) presidency , became the first country in the region to join the Blue Heart Campaign , which aims to raise awareness about human trafficking among governments , civil society , the media and the general public .
Speaking at the event , Antonio Maria Costa , Executive Director of UNODC , urged all Europeans to join the Blue Heart campaign .
“ Europeans believe that slavery was abolished centuries ago .
But look around – slaves are in our midst .
We must do more to reduce demand for slave - made products and exploitation , ” Mr. Costa added .
In Europe , more than half of the victims are from the Balkans and the former Soviet Union , with 13 percent originating in South America , seven per cent in Central Europe , five per cent in Africa and three per cent in East Asia .
The UNODC report also showed that while men were most often convicted as traffickers , women are often used to front gangs to entrap victims .
The UN agency also found a “ strong correlation ” between the nationality of the trafficked victims and their recruiters .
Mr. Barba said Ms. Wegan and Father Roqueñi outlined the case and hand - delivered a two - page complaint to Father Girotti about the sexual abuses the eight men had suffered , many of them in the 1950s .
As they left the building , Mr. Barba said , the group met Cardinal Ratzinger and kissed his ring .
They did not discuss the case .
Later , Ms. Wegan said the cardinal had wanted to meet them , according to Mr. Barba .
By February 1999 , the Congregation had officially accepted the case , according to a letter from Ms. Wegan .
Father Maciel could not be tried for sexual abuse , because — at the time — the crimes were beyond the statute of limitations .
But the Congregation , which policed doctrinal matters , accepted the case on the grounds that he had granted absolution to an accomplice in crime — in this case , meaning his sexual abuse victims — which had no statute of limitations .
If found guilty , he could have been excommunicated .
( Two years later , Cardinal Ratzinger decreed that that crime would also have a statute of limitations , removing the legal basis for an accomplice absolution charge , the complainants pointed out .
It remains unknown why Cardinal Ratzinger did so or whether his decision had to do with Father Maciel ’s case . )
At around the same time as the case was accepted , Father Athié , who had become interested in the matter and was helping Father Maciel ’s victims , wrote a letter outlining another abuse charge and gave it to Bishop Carlos Talavera of Mexico , who told him that he had delivered it to Cardinal Ratzinger .
In it , Father Athié described the detailed deathbed confession in 1995 of Father Juan Manuel Fernández Amenábar , who had told Father Athié about years of abuse by Father Maciel .
In an interview , Father Athié said Bishop Talavera — who has since died — told him that the cardinal had read the letter and decided not to proceed with the case .
“ Ratzinger said it could not be opened because he was a person very beloved by the pope , ” referring to Father Maciel , “ and had done a lot of good for the church .
He said as well , ‘ I am very sorry , but it is n’t prudent , ’ ” Father Athié said .
Saúl Barrales , a schoolteacher who once worked as Father Maciel ’s secretary and is a cousin of Bishop Talavera , said he had heard the same account of the conversation from the bishop .
Just before Christmas 1999 , Ms. Wegan , the lawyer , wrote to Mr. Barba and Mr. Jurado to say she had “ sad news . ”
She said that she had spoken twice to Father Girotti and that he had told her they had done some research into the matter , but had decided to close the inquiry “ for now . ”
SSRI drugs sell on false ' chemical imbalance ' theory
Every year around the world we take $ 13bn ( lb6.6bn ) - worth of antidepressants , and more than 80 per cent of those prescriptions are for an SSRI ( serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors ) such as Prozac , Paxil and Zoloft .
The SSRI is one of the best selling drugs in medicine , and its enormous success is based on the ' chemical imbalance theory ' : people become depressed because they are low in serotonin , a neurotransmitter , or chemical transmitter , which acts on the peripheral and central nervous system .
An SSRI redresses this chemical imbalance by helping to promote serotonin levels , and can treat not only depression , the manufacturers claim , but also other psychiatric problems such as social anxiety disorder and obsessive - compulsive disorder .
The SSRI has signalled a revolution in mental care .
Suddenly , clinical and severe depression is something that the sufferer does n't just have to endure , or learn to get over .
Instead , there 's a simple remedy to hand : a chemical to treat a chemical .
As a result , we 've become a ' Prozac Nation ' , as Elizabeth Wurtzel 's best - selling book has classified all of us to be .
The drug industry has been the major promoter of the depression - serotonin theory - for obvious reasons - but , astonishingly , it has never been proven since it was postulated in 1967 , despite many attempts to do so .
As the theory is unproven , it 's not surprising that the SSRI is far less effective than drug companies are claiming .
In a meta - analysis of published and unpublished trials , researchers found that the trials , usually funded by the manufacturer , either put an unwarranted positive spin on the results , or were suppressed if the results were not positive ( NEJM , 2008 ; 358 : 252-60 ) .
The chemical imbalance theory
It 's generally accepted by doctors - and the public - that severe depression in particular is the result of a chemical imbalance , and especially low levels of serotonin , a neurotransmitter .
Joseph Schildkraut was one of the pioneers of the general theory that chemical imbalances cause depression , and , in 1965 , he postulated that depression was associated with low levels of a neurotransmitter .
These imbalances caused mood swings , and the problem could be corrected by drugs , he said .
Two years later , researchers zoned in on serotonin as the responsible neurotransmitter ( Br J Psychiatry , 1967 ; 13 : 1237-64 ) .
But this acceptance has far more to do with aggressive marketing by the drug companies , who sell their SSRIs on the basis of the theory , than research from neuroscientists who have tried , unsuccessfully , for 40 years to come up with conclusive evidence to prove the theory .
Researchers who analysed the cerebrospinal fluid of clinically depressed and suicidal patients could n't find any difference in their serotonin levels compared with healthy controls .
Even participants in medical trials whose levels of serotonin were deliberately lowered did n't become depressed ( Pharmacopsychiatry , 1996 ; 29 : 2 - 11 ) , while depressed people who were given huge increases of serotonin did n't witness any improvement to their condition ( Arch Gen Psychiatry , 1975 ; 32 : 22-30 ) .
Not only has neuroscience been unable to prove the theory in independent studies , it has found plenty of evidence to suggest that depression and other mental disorders are the result of far more complex factors than a simple neurotransmitter deficiency .
The lack of supportive evidence is n't helped by the fact that nobody knows what an ideal serotonin level is supposed to look like , let alone the profile of a pathological imbalance .
" There is not a single peer - reviewed article that can be accurately cited to directly support claims of serotonin deficiency in any mental disorder , " says Jeffrey Lacasse , from Florida State University , and co-author of the essay ' Serotonin and Depression : A Disconnect Between the Advertisements and the Scientific Literature ' ( PLoS Med , 2005 ; 12 : 1211 - 6 ) .
The psychiatric bible , The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , which lists the definitions of all psychiatric diagnoses , does not list serotonin as a cause of any mental disorder , while the American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Clinical Psychiatry ( 4th ed , Washington DC , American Psychiatric Press ) describes serotonin deficiency as " an unconfirmed hypothesis " , adding : " Additional experience has not confirmed the monoamine depletion hypothesis . "
The SSRI explosion
Despite this lack of evidence , SSRI drug sales increased by 353 per cent between 1981 and 2000 ( Annals of Pharmacotherapy , 2002 ; 36 : 1375 - 9 ) .
It 's anticipated that SSRI sales will peak in 2010 with global revenues of $ 14.6bn , and Japan is expected to be a major market for growth in the next couple of years , with sales anticipated to increase 52 per cent ( Datamonitor ) .
The first blockbuster SSRI , Prozac ( fluoxetine hydrochloride ) , was launched in 1986 , and is " the most widely prescribed antidepressant medication in history " , according to its manufacturer , Eli Lilly .
Another SSRI , Pfizer 's Zoloft ( sertraline ) , was the 10th best - selling drug in the world in 2003 , with sales of $ 3.4bn .
Before the SSRIs were developed , just 100 people per million were diagnosed as being depressed ; today , it apparently affects 100,000 people per million ( Healy , D. Let Them Eat Prozac ; New York , NYU Press 2006 ) .
The depression - serotonin hypothesis has been actively promoted by the drug companies in advertisements to doctors and the general public , and in seminars to professionals , and so successfully that it has been widely accepted as a biological fact .
In the US , where drug companies are permitted to market directly to consumers , Pfizer 's TV advertising for Zoloft has claimed that depression may be due to a chemical imbalance , and that " Zoloft works to correct this imbalance " .
In supportive literature for its SSRI , Pfizer states that " scientists believe that it ( depression ) could be linked with an imbalance of a chemical in the brain called serotonin " .
SmithKline Beecham , the manufacturer in the US of the SSRI Paxil ( paroxetene ) , states on its website : " Scientific evidence suggests that depression and certain anxiety disorders may be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain .
Paxil helps balance your brain 's chemistry . "
The depression - serotonin hypothesis is repeated constantly by SSRI manufacturers even though the FDA has sent 10 warning letters to them since 1997 , while the Irish Medical Board has banned GlaxoSmithKline from claiming in its patient information that Paxil corrects a chemical imbalance .
Nonetheless , it continues to repeat the claim on its website and in other countries .
Despite these occasional slaps across the wrist , manufacturers are generally allowed to continue promoting the hypothesis .
The SSRIs do n't work
Not surprisingly for drugs that are based on a false hypothesis , they do n't work too well .
In a recent meta - analysis of 74 trials on 12 antidepressants that had been logged with the FDA , researchers from Oregon Health and Science University discovered that the manufacturers either tried to hide the fact or put a positive spin on results that suggested the drug was not helpful .
The researchers found 22 studies that had negative results were not published , while a further 11 had positive conclusions that were not warranted by the research findings .
Of the published trials , 94 per cent were positive - suggesting the drug was considerably better than a placebo in treating depression - but the FDA analysis of the same trials concluded that just 51 per cent were positive ( NEJM , 2008 ; 358 : 252-60 ) .
In a separate analysis of clinical trials of SSRIs submitted to the FDA , researchers discovered that a placebo , or sugar pill , replicated up to 80 per cent of the benefits of the drug itself , and that 57 per cent of all trials , published and unpublished , failed to demonstrate a statistically - significant difference between the drug and a placebo ( US FDA , 2002 ; Prev Treat 5 : article 23 ) .
Other drugs and remedies for depression seem to work just as well as - if not better than - an SSRI drug , which is a further challenge to the depression - serotonin hypothesis .
A Cochrane review of various antidepressants found there was no major difference in effectiveness between SSRIs and tricyclics , an older class of antidepressants that were developed in the 1950s ( Cochrane Database Syst Rev , 2000 ; CD002791 ) .
In randomized trials , buproprion , marketed as Wellbutrin and Zyban , an antidepressant that is more commonly used today as a stop - smoking drug , and reboxetine , marketed as Edronax or Norebox , were just as effective in the treatment of depression , and yet neither interferes with serotonin levels ( buproprion study : J Clin Psychiatry , 1997 ; 12 : 532 - 7 ; reboxetine study : J Clin Psychiatry , 2000 ; 61 : 31-8 ) .
The herbal remedy St John 's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) was more effective than an SSRI in one trial involving patients with moderate to severe depression ( BMJ , 2005 ; 330 : 503 ) , and the drug was even beaten by a placebo in another trial of patients with severe depression ( JAMA , 2002 ; 287 : 1807 - 14 ) .
Exercise was just as effective a remedy against depression when it was pitted against Zoloft in a randomized trial of older patients with severe depression ( Arch Intern Med , 1999 ; 159 : 2349 -56 ) .
SSRI dangers
The FDA has issued more public warnings and black box notices - prominent announcements on the drug 's literature and patient information sheets - about the dangers of SSRIs than almost any other drug family .
Although the drugs come with a vast array of adverse reactions , drug regulators are especially concerned by the SSRI 's potential to increase the risk of suicide .
The risk was thought to be greatest among adolescents and teenagers , but the FDA has admitted that anybody who takes an SSRI is at greater risk of committing suicide .
At an FDA drugs advisory committee meeting held in December , 2006 , psychiatrist Dr David Healy told the members : " The idea that you would have a risk in one age group but not in another is just wrong . "
Another psychiatrist , Dr Peter Breggin , also testified , and said : " America 's drug watchdog needs to come clean because it 's been approving depressants as antidepressants .
The primary data on suicidality has been generated in short - term controlled clinical trials planned by drug companies , carried out by drug company hacks , and evaluated by drug company employees at corporate headquarters .
If that kind of carefully - cultivated evaluation bears such bad fruit , imagine what the real data must show . "
Despite these very real dangers , doctors continue to prescribe SSRIs to children .
In one study , researchers discovered that children as young as six years were being prescribed an SSRI , and they were 52 per cent more likely to commit suicide within the following two months .
Overall a child on an SSRI was 15 times more likely to commit suicide than one not taking the drug ( Arch Gen Psych , 2006 ; 63 : 865-72 ) .
In addition to the suicide risk , SSRIs have been linked to a wide range of other adverse reactions .
Prozac alone has 242 different side effects listed , including 34 problems of the genital and urinary tract .
In one review of drug reactions , " during a 10 - year period Prozac was associated with more hospitalizations , deaths or other serious adverse effects reported to the FDA than any other drug in America " ( Moore , T : Prescription for Disaster .
New York , Dell Publishing , 1998 ) .
The most common problems associated with SSRIs are neurological ( 22 per cent ) , psychiatric ( 19.5 per cent ) , gastrointestinal ( 18 per cent ) and dermatological ( 11.4 per cent ) ( Drug Safety , 1999 ; 20 : 277-87 ) .
Every SSRI manufacturer has lawsuits pending .
Forest Laboratories , which makes Lexapro ( escitalopram oxalate ) and Celexa ( citalopram ) has been involved in at least 25 active lawsuits recently , says US law firm Pogust & Braslow , and most of these involve cases of unexplained suicide or attempted suicide .
Off - label prescribing
One major cause of the enormous success of the SSRIs has been off - label prescribing by doctors - where they either prescribe to people , such as the very young , for whom proper safety trials have never been undertaken , or for problems for which it was never intended .
Although the SSRIs are labelled as antidepressants , the FDA has allowed them to be used as remedies for eight psychiatric disorders , including ' social anxiety disorder ' , obsessive - compulsive disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder .
Despite this broad definition of an antidepressant , one study discovered that 75 per cent of all prescriptions for SSRIs were off - label for treatments for which the drugs had not been approved ( J Clin Psych , 2006 ; 67 : 972-82 ) .
Lead author Dr Hua Chen from the University of Houston said the findings reveal a " significant gap " in the US drug safety system as off - label prescribing regularly exposes patients to drugs that are untested for their condition or age .
Over the years SSRIs have been prescribed for pain , insomnia , shyness , menstrual discomfort , dementia , and restless leg syndrome , and to every age group , including young children and to pregnant women , even though there is evidence to suggest that the drugs are harmful to an expectant mother and her fetus ( NEJM , 1996 ; 335 : 1010 - 15 ) .
While it is not illegal for a doctor to prescribe a drug for off - label use , drug companies are not allowed to promote a drug for unapproved use , although it is known to be a widespread practice and one that has been the subject of a US House Committee hearing .
Conclusion
The SSRIs are some of the most dangerous drugs ever developed , and yet they are probably the least effective .
Based on an unproven theory , they usually fare little better than placebo , which suggests that any benefit is generated by the patient himself , rather than from any chemical inter-action .
Depression can be a debilitating problem , but it's one that can be successfully resolved without the use of SSRIs .
Perhaps the most important contribution that SSRIs have made to our understanding of severe depression is the power and importance of our own minds .

In fact he said he did n’t understand gold .

What Has Government Do ... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 1.83 Buy New $ 25.00 ( as of 08:05 EST - Details )
Some commentators are beginning to join the debate on the pro’s and con ’s of a return to the gold standard .
One said he would bet his career that this will never happen .
Most laugh at the prospect .
The fact is it is happening now .
The new controversy over a reversion to a gold standard is welcome .
Many who comment , pro and con on the possibility are new to the subject , and as such have not really thought through some of the implications .
I have been writing articles on the gold standard since the early 70’s and I welcome the new commentators to this debate .
Two points I would like to make to anyone who participates :
One , any return to a gold standard will come well into the future .
A return to the gold standard will be incremental .
You can not graft a gold standard onto the present system .
It presupposes fiscal responsibility , balanced budgets , monetary stability and free trade .
A political and economic transformation would need to occur first .
And two , it will look much different from gold standards of the past .
No one knows  or can know  what a future gold standard will look like .
The reason is that technology has changed .

End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
My suggestion to Ron Paul and all those wanting to return to gold , is the best way to accomplish this is not by proclaiming your determination to replace the Federal Reserve Board with the gold standard , but to attack the legal tender laws of this country .
I was one of the few back in the early 70’s along with Ron Paul that fought for the legalization of gold to be allowed back into the American system .
That was the first step in returning to the gold standard .
Today is very much the same .
The next step is to institutionalize competing monies .
The key is to go after the governments monopoly on money .
If broken , gold will find it ’s way into the monetary system , as it is today , and reclaim it ’s superior role as long as it is not prevented from doing so .
Legal tender laws do just that .
They prevent choice .
Today , to be an advocate of a gold standard is to be laughed at and ridiculed as naive .
But , to be against legal tender laws , wipes the snickers off the face of those against gold very quickly .
To be against legal tender laws is to be for freedom of choice and against government coercion .
You will not find the same chuckles from " intellectuals " when confronted with a proposal of this nature .
On the contrary , you will find terror .

This goes to the heart of government power .
It goes to the use of force .
It goes to governments ability to control people , raise taxes , borrow money , and inflate .
This is the tactic and strategy required to achieve an honest money once again in this country .
Let the private market develop a private money and compete with government money , and then we will see who has money and who does not .
The Revolution : A Mani ... Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.99 Buy New $ 6.99 ( as of 11:00 EST - Details )
With this in mind , the following is an article I wrote recently on the subject :
Government has a monopoly on money .
It declares what can and can not be legal tender .
It controls the value of money through setting the supply and the price of money by setting short term interest rates .
We have been on a fiat standard for a century .
Fiat means " decree " and that is what government does  sometimes subtly , sometimes brutally .
But make no mistake , the government controls money .
The force of a monopoly alone , however , is insufficient to prevent individuals from protecting their wealth .
So , governments best chance of preserving stability is through trust , confidence , and credibility .
Lose these things and government will eventually lose control .
Today , we see this very scenario playing out before our eyes .
Over the last few years , there has been a move away from government money and towards gold .
Not too long ago , governments were net sellers of gold .
Every year they would announce how much gold they were going to sell into the market .
It was part of " demonitization " , which represented a monetary philosophy that accepted the fact that gold was a " barbarous relic " that had little relevance in today ’s modern financial system .
If governments needed money , they would simply print it .
If they needed more gold , they would print that too .
They created " paper gold " , known as Special Drawing Rights , or SDR’s .
These would act as reserves instead of the metal itself .

Firm ’s stock sale nearly twice as large as any other institution ; Represented 44 percent of total BP investment
The brokerage firm that ’s faced the most scrutiny from regulators in the past year over the shorting of mortgage related securities seems to have had good timing when it came to something else : the stock of British oil giant BP .
According to regulatory filings , RawStory.com has found that Goldman Sachs sold 4,680,822 shares of BP in the first quarter of 2010 .
Goldman ’s sales were the largest of any firm during that time .
Goldman would have pocketed slightly more than $ 266 million if their holdings were sold at the average price of BP ’s stock during the quarter .
ADVERTISEMENT
If Goldman had sold these shares today , their investment would have lost 36 percent its value , or $ 96 million .
The share sales represented 44 percent of Goldman ’s holdings — meaning that Goldman ’s remaining holdings have still lost tens of millions in value .
The sale and its size itself is n’t unusual for a large asset management firm .
Wall Street brokerages routinely buy and sell huge blocks of shares for themselves and their clients .
In light of a recent SEC lawsuit arguing that Goldman kept information about a product they sold from their clients , however , the stock sale may raise fresh concern among Goldman ’s critics .
Goldman is also a frequent target of liberals and journalists , including Rolling Stone ‘s Matt Taibbi , who famously dubbed the firm a “ vampire squid . ”
Two calls placed to Goldman Sachs ’ media office in New York Wednesday morning after US markets opened were not immediately returned , though Raw Story decided to publish the story quickly after the calls since the stock sale had been already noted online .
Others also sold stock
Other asset management firms also sold huge blocks of BP stock in the first quarter — but their sales were a fraction of Goldman’s .
Wachovia , which is owned by Wells Fargo , sold 2,667,419 shares ; UBS , the Swiss bank , sold 2,125,566 shares .
Wachovia and UBS also sold much larger percentages of their BP stock , at 98 percently and 97 percent respectively .

Wachova parent Wells Fargo , however , bought 2.3 million shares in the quarter , largely discounting Wachovia ’s sales .
Those reported buying BP ’s stock included Wellington Management , a large asset firm , and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
BP is struggling to cap a massive oil leak at one of its drill sites in the Gulf of Mexico .
The firm ’s myriad safety violations over the years have come to light in lieu of the Gulf disaster .

BP traded on average at $ 56.86 in the first quarter , according to GuruFocus , a site that monitors the major trading moves of prominent investors .
A list of major institutions ’ sales of BP stock are available at the market research website Morningstar .
It ’s certainly unknown as to why the firms sold their holdings .
In its analysis of the company in mid-March , Morningstar , the market research site , gave the company an average rating of three out of a possible five stars .

“ BP ’s valuation carries more uncertainty than ExxonMobil ’s or Shell ’s because the firm is less integrated , with more of its earnings coming from the [ exploration and production ] business than from potentially offsetting refining operations , ” the site ’s analyst wrote .
“ Like its peers , a sustained drop in oil and gas prices can hurt upstream earnings .
Lower crude - oil feedstock costs could help refining margins , but refined product pricing lags could quickly swing refining profits to losses .
BP ’s global business faces potential disruptions caused by political risks , particularly with its heavy exposure to Russia .
Disruptions caused by environmental and operational constraints could further limit earnings potential . ”
The transnational oil company , like other energy giants , was hit with lower oil and gas prices in the past year after the price of oil surged in 2008 .
“ BP ’s fourth quarter marked another quarter of year - over - year production gains , with a 3 % increase thanks to new field startups , ” Morningstar ’s analyst wrote in another note , after BP turned in better than expected fourth quarter results in February .
“ BP reported fourth - quarter replacement cost profit of $ 3.4 billion , up 33 % from year - ago earnings of $ 2.6 billion , as upstream earnings growth was more than enough to offset downstream weakness .
For the full year , BP ’s earnings of $ 14 billion were 45 % below year - ago earnings of $ 26 billion , in part because of lower oil prices earlier in the year .
We ’re encouraged by BP ’s sequential earnings gains as new projects and cost - cutting efforts drive upstream results . ”

The SEC filed a civil lawsuit against Goldman Sachs and one of its vice presidents in April , asserting that the firm had committed fraud by misrepresenting a mortgage - investment product inherently designed to fail .
The company helped a hedge fund trader create a mortgage investment that gained value as mortgage borrowers defaulted en masse .
In response , Goldman said the SEC ’s charges were Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ completely unfounded in law and factÃ¢â‚ ¬Â and averred that it would Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ vigorously contest them and defend the firm and its reputation .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
The firm has also faced criticism over giant bonuses paid to staff amidst the US financial crisis .
Goldman reduced the sizes of its staff bonuses this year to $ 16.9 billion , and said it would pay its chief executive $ 9 million , far less than the previous year .
Goldman also announced it would create a $ 500 million program to help small businesses .
Critics noted that the figure represented just 3 % of the bonus pool .
In a speech at the Eisenhower Presidential Library to mark the 65th anniversary of the German surrender , he said : " I do think that as we look to the future , particularly for the next couple of years or so while we 're in Iraq and Afghanistan , I think the Congress and the president would look long and hard at another military operation that would cost us $ 100 billion a year .
This list looks at fish that were around in remote , prehistoric times and have survived to our time , still keeping their “ prehistoric ” looks to prove it .
Feel free to mention those I have excluded in the comments .
10 Hagfish
According to the fossil record , hagfish have existed for over 300 million years , which means they were already old when dinosaurs took over the world !
Found in relatively deep waters , these animals are sometimes called slime eels , but they are not really eels , and actually , they may not even be fish at all , according to some scientists .
They are very bizarre animals in all regards ; they have a skull but lack a spine , and they have two brains .
Almost blind , they feed at night on the carcasses of large animals ( fish , cetaceans etc ) which fall to the sea bottom .
They owe their “ slime eel ” nickname to the fact that they produce a slimey substance to damage the gills of predatory fish ; as a result , they have virtually no natural enemies .
9 Lancetfish
The lancetfish has a very obvious “ prehistoric ” appearance , with those fierce - looking , sharp teeth on its jaws and the sail on its back , reminiscent of that of some dinosaurs ( although , in the lancetfish the sail is actually an enlarged dorsal fin ) .
Even its scientific name has a dinosaurian sound to it ( Alepisaurus ferox ) .
Up to two meters ( 6 ′ 6 ″ ) in length , this predator is found in all the oceans except for polar regions ; very voracious , it feeds on smaller fish and squid , and has known to feed on members of its own species sometimes .
8 Arowana
Belonging to the ancient group of the Osteoglossids , these fish already existed in the Jurassic period .
Today , they are found in the Amazon , and in parts of Africa , Asia and Australia .
Sometimes kept as exotic pets , arowanas are voracious predators that feed on any small animal they can catch , including birds and bats which they catch in mid flight ( they are able to leap up to 2 meters ( 6 ′ 6 ″ ) into the air ) .
In China , arowanas are known as “ dragon - fish ” due to their appearance , and they are thought to be harbingers of good luck .
7 Frilled Shark
This deep sea predator , one of the most primitive sharks alive today , is a relic from the Cretaceous period , when dinosaurs ruled the Earth .
Seldom seen alive , and only recently filmed for the first time , the frilled shark can grow up to 2 meters ( 6 ′ 6 ″ ) ( with females being larger than males ) and they live in deep waters , where they feed mostly on squid .
They are not dangerous to humans , and as a matter of fact , most frilled sharks spend their whole lives without seeing a human being .
Only dead or dying specimens are usually seen and recorded by fishermen or scientists .
6 Sturgeon
Another survivor from the age of dinosaurs ( they were already around in the early Jurassic ) , the sturgeon is well known for being one of the main sources of caviar ( which is made out of their roe or egg masses ) ; due to overfishing , these magnificent , armored fish are sadly endangered nowadays .
The largest sturgeon species can grow up to 6 meters ( 19 ′ 7 ″ ) long , being as large as most great white sharks ; they feed on small animals from the sea bottom and pose no danger to humans , unless provoked ( although they are so big that they have hurt , and even killed , people unintentionally by leaping out of the water and landing on boats ! )
5 Arapaima
A close relative to the arowana ( see # 8 ) , the Amazonian arapaima is sometimes considered to be the largest freshwater fish in the world .
According to early descriptions , it could grow up to 4.5 meters ( 14 ′ 8 ″ ) long , but today , enormous individuals like these are seldom found and most adult arapaimas average 2 meters ( 6 ′ 6 ″ ) long .
These slow moving predators feed on smaller fish , crustaceans and whatever small animal they can fit in their mouth .
An interesting trait of this fish is that it needs to breath oxygen from the air , like a cetacean , in order to survive .
Arapaimas pose no danger to humans and are often hunted for their meat ; unfortunately , they are very scarce nowadays .
Although the arapaima seemingly appeared in the Miocene period , it belongs to a much older family , the Osteoglossidae , and therefore its origins can be traced back to the age of dinosaurs .
4 Sawfish
This critically endangered animal is a survivor from the Cretaceous period , and can be found both in saltwater or in rivers and creeks , and has been found up to 100 kms inland .
Up to 7 meters ( 23 ′ ) in length , sawfish may look like sharks but are actually more closely related to rays .
Their “ saw ” is both a weapon and a sensory organ , covered on electro - sensitive pores which allow it to sense prey despite its terrible eyesight .
Although usually peaceful , the sawfish can become extremely dangerous if provoked .
Due to an extraordinary fossil , we know that gigantic , prehistoric sawfish were probably a staple food for the largest carnivorous dinosaur , Spinosaurus , as a vertebra from the fish was found stuck between the dinosaur ’s teeth .
3 Alligator Gar
This formidable , thick scaled predator is found in the southern US and northern and eastern Mexico , being the largest freshwater fish in North America ( although it sometimes wanders into the sea ) .
It can grow up to 4 meters ( 13 ′ ) long and weigh up to 200 kgs ( 440lbs ) .
Gator gars are so called because of their reptilian appearance and long jaws , armed with a double row of sharp teeth .
They are voracious ambush predators and have been known to bite humans on occasion , although no confirmed deaths due to alligator gars have been recorded to date .
Gars are among the oldest fish alive today ; their origins can be traced back to the Cretaceous period .
2 Polypterus Senegalus
These african fish are often called “ dinosaur eels ” , due to their reptilian appearance and serrated dorsal fin , reminiscent of some dinosaurs ’ spiked backs .
They are not really eels , but members of the bichir family .
Bichirs were already around in the Cretaceous , so the “ dinosaur ” part of their name is actually fitting in a way .
Although often sold as exotic pets , dinosaur eels are prone to escaping their fish tanks .
They can survive out of the water for long periods of time as long as their skin remains wet , which enables them to wander far away from their tank .
1 Coelacanth
The Coelacanth is the most famous of all “ living fossils ” and deserves to be # 1 in this list , because it is the best example of a “ Lazarus taxon ” , this is , animals that were supposed to be long extinct and are unexpectedly found to be alive .
Coelacanths were supposed to have become extinct in the Cretaceous period , along with the dinosaurs , but in 1938 , a live specimen was caught in South Africa .
Since then , more specimens have been seen and photographed , and a second coelacanth species was even found in Indonesia in 1999 .
Coelacanths are large predators , up to 2 meters ( 6 ′ 6 ″ ) long ; they feed on smaller fish , including small sharks , and are usually found in deep , dark waters .
Although rarely captured and consumed due to their horrible taste , coelacanths are critically endangered nowadays .

The blessing of the news , in this article by Charlie Savage in The New York Times is far from surprising .
EA argued as early as the first week of the Obama Administration that the President 's declaration that he would close the US detention facility at Guantanamo Bay would be challenged and undermined by his own officials .
And , even without that subversion , the process was bound to be beset by legal and political complexities .
Still , to have this coldly set out --- it's not just that Guantanamo did not close by Obama 's promised date of 31 January 2010 ; it will not close by 31 December or , indeed , in 2011 or 2012 --- is harsh confirmation .
The bottom line , beyond the rationalisations , is that many people around the world have seen Guantanamo as a powerful symbol of the hypocrisy and danger of American power .
Now they may see it as a symbol as a failure of Barack Obama to deliver on his promises to re-shape that power for co-operation rather than punishment .
Stymied by political opposition and focused on competing priorities , the Obama administration has sidelined efforts to close the Guantánamo prison , making it unlikely that President Obama will fulfill his promise to close it before his term ends in 2013 .
When the White House acknowledged last year that it would miss Mr. Obama ’s initial January 2010 deadline for shutting the prison , it also declared that the detainees would eventually be moved to one in Illinois .
But impediments to that plan have mounted in Congress , and the administration is doing little to overcome them .
“ There is a lot of inertia ” against closing the prison , “ and the administration is not putting a lot of energy behind their position that I can see , ” said Senator Carl Levin , the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and supports the Illinois plan .
He added that “ the odds are that it will still be open ” by the next presidential inauguration .
And Senator Lindsey Graham , a South Carolina Republican who also supports shutting it , said the effort is “ on life support and it ’s unlikely to close any time soon . ”
He attributed the collapse to some fellow Republicans ’ “ demagoguery ” and the administration ’s poor planning and decision - making “ paralysis .
” The White House insists it is still determined to shutter the prison .
The administration argues that Guantánamo is a symbol in the Muslim world of past detainee abuses , citing military views that its continued operation helps terrorists .
“ Our commanders have made clear that closing the detention facility at Guantánamo is a national security imperative , and the president remains committed to achieving that goal , ” said a White House spokesman , Ben LaBolt .
Still , some senior officials say privately that the administration has done its part , including identifying the Illinois prison — an empty maximum - security center in Thomson , 150 miles west of Chicago — where the detainees could be held .
They blame Congress for failing to execute that endgame .
“ The president ca n’t just wave a magic wand to say that Gitmo will be closed , ” said a senior administration official , speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking on a sensitive issue .
The politics of closing the prison have clearly soured following the attempted bombings on a plane on Dec. 25 and in Times Square in May , as well as Republican criticism that imprisoning detainees in the United States would endanger Americans .
When Mr. Obama took office a slight majority supported closing it .
By a March 2010 poll , 60 percent wanted it to stay open .
One administration official argued that the White House was still trying .
On May 26 , Mr. Obama ’s national security adviser , James Jones , sent a letter to the House Appropriations Committee reiterating the case .
But Mr. Levin portrayed the administration as unwilling to make a serious effort to exert its influence , contrasting its muted response to legislative hurdles to closing Guantánamo with “ very vocal ” threats to veto financing for a fighter jet engine it opposes .

Android overtook Microsoft Corp ’s Windows Mobile , the data from research firm Gartner showed , leaving Google well placed amid the increasing popularity of mobile browsing as handsets look set to soon surpass computers for accessing the web .
The Android operating system , which was in 10 percent of smartphones sold in the quarter , still lags Nokia Oyj ’s Symbian as well as products from Research in Motion Ltd and Apple Inc .
Gartner said Android beat Apple in the North American market in the first quarter and would catch the iPhone maker globally soon .
“ You have one vendor with one model and eight to nine vendors with many models -- of course you get bigger volumes , ” said Carolina Milanesi , research vice president at Gartner .
All top handset vendors except Nokia have either launched or are planning to unveil smartphone models running on the Android operating system .
The growth of Android -- whose features include easier access to Google services -- helped smartphone sales jump 49 percent in the January - March quarter , Gartner said .
The global cellphone market grew 17 percent year - on - year in the quarter , its fastest pace in four years , as demand started to recover following last year ’s recession .
Market leader Nokia saw its share slip to 35 percent in the three months , while closest rival Samsung raised its market share to 20.6 percent , Gartner said .
Milanesi said Gartner raised its view for global phone market growth in 2010 to around 14 percent from a previous 11 percent .

" We 've been looking for a guy with this kind of ability for a long time , " said Pirates manager John Russell , adding that Goldwater will start in left field for the Triple - A Indianapolis Indians Thursday .
" And hearing that he only needed two strides to cross over the grass median strip tells me he might be able to stretch out a double .
Players like that do n't come around every day in Pittsburgh . "
Team officials are hopeful this decision will work out as well as their 2003 signing of starting pitcher Paul Maholm , whom they acquired after seeing Maholm accurately toss a used tissue into the garbage .

If you have discovered your animal guardian , then you know what a silly sense of humor they have .
Part of the pleasure of their company is laughter and innocent joy .
How do you know who your animal guardian is ?
It 's so simple !
You just ask .
In the book , The Golden Compass , your guardian is referred to as your daemon .
We are born with one and they are our guardians , differing from a totem or medicine animal .
One of the easiest ways to make contact is through a meditation or dream .
Before going to sleep , state aloud and very clearly that you are ready to meet your animal guardian .
You may need to do this more than once .
If he / she appears in a dream , do n't forget to ask its name .
This is like a cosmic ignition key that activates your relationship .
You will begin to experience their presence wherever you go .

McDonald ’s will recall about 12 million “ Shrek ” drinking glasses because federal regulators found they contain the toxic metal cadmium , which poses health risks .
The glasses have been sold for $ 2 apiece at McDonald ’s restaurants across the country as a promotional tie - in with the movie “ Shrek Forever After . ”
Purchasers will be advised to keep them away from children and to return them to McDonald ’s for a refund .
The recall , which will be officially announced Friday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission , was set in motion by an anonymous tip to Rep. Jackie Speier ( D - Hillsborough ) last week .
She alerted the commission , which tested the glasses and confirmed the presence of cadmium in the paint used for the decorative characters .
Cadmium is a carcinogen and can cause kidney , lung , intestinal and bone damage .
Speier ’s office said McDonald ’s voluntarily agreed to recall the glasses at the urging of the commission .
A McDonald ’s spokesman , Walt Riker , said in an interview : “ We ’ve had a good , constructive two - way dialogue with the congresswoman ’s office and with the Consumer Product Safety Commission . ”
Although Speier commended McDonald ’s for acting quickly , her office said the fast - food giant and other corporations must “ do a better job of thoroughly reviewing their domestic and international supply chains to keep products with potentially dangerous elements from ever hitting their shelves . ”
It was not immediately known where the glasses were produced or how the paint used in the “ Shrek ” characters came to contain cadmium .
“ Our children ’s health should not depend on the consciences of anonymous sources , ” Speier said .
“ Although McDonald ’s did the right thing by recalling these products , we need stronger testing standards to ensure that all children ’s products are proven safe before they hit the shelves .
Cadmium is a toxic substance that is extremely dangerous to the developmental health of children . ”
The commission declined to comment Thursday evening .
In the past , the commission has warned manufacturers to avoid cadmium in children ’s products , and last month it ordered the recall of children ’s jewelry contaminated by the toxic metal .
Speier said the McDonald ’s episode pointed to the need for stronger safety measures .
Earlier in the year , she introduced legislation banning cadmium and other toxic metals from children ’s jewelry .

Kamui Kobayashi has revealed that he never knew his last corner move on Sebastien Buemi in the European Grand Prix was his last chance of the race .
The Japanese and his Sauber team had gambled on not stopping for tyres during the first safety car period , and that move helped him run third for much of the event .
Following a switch to the super soft compound a few laps from home , Kobayashi used his rubber advantage to drive past both Fernando Alonso and Buemi in the closing stages - and later confessed he did not know how near the end of the race it was .
" It was a great race , " Kobayashi told AUTOSPORT .
" With the prime tyre I had really constant pace , which was good .
" I knew if I over drove I would kill the tyres , but when I changed I was only ninth - and knew I had better grip .
I tried to overtake as many people as possible and got Fernando and Buemi .
" But I was concentrating so hard on overtaking people that I did n't know how many laps were left .
Then suddenly I understood , when I saw lots of guys waving at me , that that was the end of the race . "
Kobayashi has also thanked Alonso for being so co-operative during their battle - fearing that if the Spaniard had given him a harder time they would have crashed .
" It was very risky for me , but I had no accident , " said Kobayashi .
" He is a very good driver so he knows everything that happens around his car .
" At the beginning of my move , in one moment , he tried to close the door but he recognised that we would crash if he closed the door .
So he just gave it away .
It was a great move for him and I really have to say thanks for him . "
Although Kobayashi's brilliant drive at Valencia owed much to good luck behind the safety car , he is upbeat about a better performance from Sauber at the next race at Silverstone .
" This year I could not show so much my race performance because we had so many accidents .
I was not really confident in the car , or track , but in Valencia I was quite confident and my pace was okay .
" I believe Silverstone will be good .
Our car will be better there than Valencia and Canada because we are better in high speed corners , so I suppose it will be a better performance than here , and maybe we have a good opportunity to score points as well . "
I ’m waiting for actual photos of the event from the official photographer , but for now I ’ll make do with what can be found on the Internet .
For those who do n’t know , the Oxford Union is the top of the food chain for scholarly debate .
This is a significant win .
Founded in 1823 at the University of Oxford , but maintaining a separate charter from the University , The Oxford Union is host to some of the most skillful debates in the world .
Many eminent scholars and personalities have come and either debated or delivered speeches in the chamber .
Monckton was invited as part of the formal Thursday debate .
It is described as follows :
The Union is the world ’s most prestigious debating society , with an unparalleled reputation for bringing international guests and speakers to Oxford .
It has been established for 182 years , aiming to promote debate and discussion not just in Oxford University , but across the globe .
Here is a view inside from a previous debate :
From the SPPI Blog , an account of the debate :
Oxford Union Debate on Climate Catastrophe
Source : SPPI
Army of Light and Truth 135 , Forces of Darkness 110
For what is believed to be the first time ever in England , an audience of university undergraduates has decisively rejected the notion that “ global warming ” is or could become a global crisis .
The only previous defeat for climate extremism among an undergraduate audience was at St. Andrew ’s University , Scotland , in the spring of 2009 , when the climate extremists were defeated by three votes .
Last week , members of the historic Oxford Union Society , the world ’s premier debating society , carried the motion “ That this House would put economic growth before combating climate change ” by 135 votes to 110 .
The debate was sponsored by the Science and Public Policy Institute , Washington DC .
Serious observers are interpreting this shock result as a sign that students are now impatiently rejecting the relentless extremist propaganda taught under the guise of compulsory environmental - studies classes in British schools , confirming opinion - poll findings that the voters are no longer frightened by “ global warming ” scare stories , if they ever were .
When the Union ’s president , Laura Winwood , announced the result in the Victorian - Gothich Gladstone Room , three peers cheered with the undergraduates , and one peer drowned his sorrows in beer .
Lord Lawson of Blaby , Margaret
Thatcher ’s former finance minister , opened the case for the proposition by saying that the economic proposals put forward by the UN ’s climate panel and its supporters did not add up .
It would be better to wait and see whether the scientists had gotten it right .
It was not sensible to make expensive spending commitments , particularly at a time of great economic hardship , when the effectiveness of the spending was gravely in doubt and when it might do more harm than good .
At one point , Lord Lawson was interrupted by a US student , who demanded to know what was his connection with the Science and Public Policy Institute , and what were the Institute ’s sources of funding .
Lord Lawson was cheered when he said he neither knew nor cared who funded the Institute .
Ms. Zara McGlone , Secretary of the Oxford Union , opposed the motion , saying that greenhouse gases had an effect [ they do , but it is very small ] ; that the precautionary principle required immediate action , just in case and regardless of expense [ but one must also bear in mind the cost of the precautions themselves , which can and often do easily exceed the cost of inaction ] ; that Bangladesh was sinking beneath the waves [ a recent study by Prof .
Niklas Moerner shows that sea level in Bangladesh has actually fallen ] ; that the majority of scientists believed “ global warming ” was a problem [ she offered no evidence for this ] ; and that “ irreversible natural destruction ” would occur if we did nothing [ but she did not offer any evidence ] .
Mr. James Delingpole , a blogger for the leading British conservative national newspaper The Daily Telegraph , seconded the proposition , saying that – politically speaking – the climate extremists had long since lost the argument .
The general public simply did not buy the scare stories any more .
The endless tales of Biblical disasters peddled by the alarmist faction were an unwelcome and now fortunately failed recrudescence of dull , gray Puritanism .
Instead of hand - wringing and bed- wetting , we should celebrate the considerable achievements of the human race and start having fun .
Lord Whitty , a Labor peer from the trades union movement and , until recently , Labor ’s Environment Minister in the Upper House , said that the world ’s oil supplies were rapidly running out [ in fact , record new finds have been made in the past five years ] ; that we needed to change our definition of economic growth to take into account the value lost when we damaged the environment [ it is artificial accounting of this kind that has left Britain as bankrupt as Greece after 13 years of Labor government ] ; that green jobs created by governments would help to end unemployment [ but Milton Friedman won his Nobel Prize for economics by demonstrating that every artificial job created at taxpayers ’ expense destroys two real jobs in the wealth - producing private sector ] ; that humans were the cause of most of the past century ’s warming [ there is no evidence for that : the case is built on speculation by programmers of computer models ] ; that temperature today was at its highest in at least 40 million years [ in fact , it was higher than today by at least 12.5 F° for most of the past 550 million years ] ; and that 95 % of scientists believed our influence on the climate was catastrophic [ no one has asked them ] .
Lord Monckton repeatedly interrupted Lord Whitty to ask him to give a reference in the scientific literature for his suggestion that 95 % of scientists believed our influence on the climate was catastrophic .
Lord Whitty was unable to provide the source for his figure , but said that everyone knew it was true .
Under further pressure from Lord Monckton , Lord Whitty conceded that the figure should perhaps be 92 % .
Lord Monckton asked : “ And your reference is ? ” Lord Whitty was unable to reply .
Hon .
Members began to join in , jeering “ Your reference ?
Your reference ? ” Lord Whitty sat down looking baffled .
Lord Leach of Fairford , whom Margaret Thatcher appointed a Life Peer for his educational work , spoke third for the proposition .
He said that we no longer knew whether or not there had been much “ global warming ” over the 20th century , because the Climategate emails had exposed the terrestrial temperature records as defective .
In any event , he said , throwing good money after bad on various alternative - energy boondoggles was unlikely to prove profitable in the long term and would ultimately do harm .
Mr. Rajesh Makwana , executive director of “ Share The World ’s Resources ” , speaking third for the opposition , said that climate change was manmade [ but he did not produce any evidence for that assertion ] ; that CO2 emissions were growing at 3 % a year [ but it is concentrations , not emissions , that may in theory affect climate , and concentrations are rising at a harmless 0.5 % a year ] ; that the UN ’s climate panel had forecast a 7 F° “ global warming ” for the 21st century [ it ’s gotten off to a bad start , with a cooling of 0.2 F° so far ] ; and that the consequences of “ global warming ” would be dire [ yet , in the audience , sat Mr. Klaus - Martin Schulte , whose landmark paper of 2008 had established that not one of 539 scientific papers on “ global climate change ” provided any evidence whatsoever that “ global warming ” would be catastrophic ] .
Lord Monckton , a former science advisor to Margaret Thatcher during her years as Prime Minister of the UK , concluded the case for the proposition .
He drew immediate laughter and cheers when he described himself as “ Christopher Walter , Third Viscount Monckton of Brenchley , scholar , philanthropist , wit , man about town , and former chairman of the Wines and Spirits Committee of this honourable Society ” .
At that point his cummerbund came undone .
He held it up to the audience and said , “ If I asked this House how long this cummerbund is , you might telephone around all the manufacturers and ask them how many cummerbunds they made , and how long each type of cummerbund was , and put the data into a computer model run by a zitty teenager eating too many doughnuts , and the computer would make an expensive guess .
Or you could take a tape - measure and ” – glaring at the opposition across the despatch - box – “ measure it ! ” [ cheers ] .
Lord Monckton said that real - world measurements , as opposed to models , showed that the warming effect of CO2 was a tiny fraction of the estimates peddled by the UN ’s climate panel .
He said that he would take his lead from Lord Lawson , however , in concentrating on the economics rather than the science .
He glared at the opposition again and demanded whether , since they had declared themselves to be so worried about “ global warming ” , they would care to tell him – to two places of decimals and one standard deviation – the UN ’s central estimate of the “ global warming ” that might result from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration .
The opposition were unable to reply .
Lord Monckton told them the answer was 3.26 plus or minus 0.69 Kelvin or Celsius degrees .
An Hon .
Member interrupted : “ And your reference is ? ” Lord Monckton replied : “ IPCC , 2007 , chapter 10 , box 10.2 . ” [ cheers ] .
He concluded that shutting down the entire global economy for a whole year , with all the death , destruction , disaster , disease and distress that that would cause , would forestall just 4.7 ln( 390/388 ) = 0.024 Kelvin or Celsius degrees of “ global warming ” , so that total economic shutdown for 41 years would prevent just 1 K of warming .
Adaptation as and if necessary would be orders of magnitude cheaper and more cost - effective .
Mr. Mike Mason , founder and managing director of “ Climate Care ” , concluded for the opposition .
He said that the proposition were peculiar people , and that Lord Monckton was more peculiar than most , in that he was not a real Lord .
Lord Monckton , on a point of order , told Mr. Mason that the proposition had avoided personalities and that if Mr. Mason were unable to argue other than ad hominem he should “ get out ” .
[ cheers ]
Mr. Mason then said that we had to prepare for climate risks [ yes , in both directions , towards cooler as well as warmer ] ; and that there was a “ scientific consensus ” [ but he offered no evidence for the existence of any such consensus , still less for the notion that science is done by consensus ] .
The President thanked the speakers and expressed the Society ’s gratitude to the Science and Public Policy Institute for sponsoring the debate .
Hon .
Members filed out of the Debating Chamber , built to resemble the interior of the House of Commons , and passed either side of the brass division - pole at the main door – Ayes to the right 135 , Noes to the left 110 .
Motion carried .

During a keynote at the OSCON conference in 2008 , Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth urged the Linux development community to improve its focus on usability .
He vowed that Canonical would contribute financial and technical resources to help make Linux more beautiful and functional .
He aimed to raise the bar and set a whole new standard — not just for Linux , but for the entire desktop computing industry .
" The great task ahead of us over the next two years is to lift the experience of the Linux desktop from something that is stable and robust and not so pretty , to something which is art , " he said in 2008 .
" Not emulate , but blow right past Apple in the user experience we deliver to our end users . "
The Linux platform has evolved considerably in the two years that have passed since he set that goal , and Ubuntu 10.04 , which was officially released last week , offers us an opportunity to evaluate the progress that Canonical and the Ubuntu community have made in their collaborative pursuit of Shuttleworth 's ambitious vision .
The new version of Ubuntu is codenamed Lucid Lynx , and is a long - term support ( LTS ) release , which means that package updates will be available for an extended duration .
Typical Ubuntu versions get 18 months of updates , but LTS releases are supported for three years on desktop computers and five years on servers .
The LTS releases are important because the longer support cycle tends to attract the interest of hardware vendors and business users .
This is Ubuntu 's chance to prove itself as a worthy contender for the mainstream desktop .
In this in - depth review , we will take a close look at some of the new features and attempt to determine if Lucid Lynx purrs or growls .
Theme update
One of the most significant changes in Lucid is the introduction of a new default theme .
Ubuntu has shed its previous style in favor of a new look that features black trim , orange highlighting , and an aubergine wallpaper .
The new theme is part of a broader branding overhaul that will redefine Ubuntu 's visual identity .
When the first release of Ubuntu was launched in 2004 , it had a distinctive brown theme that was intended to reflect the spirit of " humanity " that defined the distribution 's brand .
Although orange and other colors were introduced in subsequent releases , the predominantly brown color palette has persisted for the past five years , becoming a common target of criticism among Ubuntu 's users .
During the development of Ubuntu 8.04 , the previous long - term support release , Canonical 's artists began to contemplate the possibility of making sweeping changes to the default theme .
A black and orange color scheme was one of the concepts that was discussed at the Ubuntu Developer Summit for 8.04 in 2007 .
The redesign was deferred and reconsidered in later development cycles but did not become a serious undertaking until work began on Lucid .
Lucid 's updated themes were first made public at the beginning of March when Canonical announced its plans to revise Ubuntu 's branding .
The new default theme , called Ambiance , uses the popular Murrine Gtk+ theme engine .
Window menus , titlebars , and panels are black , with a slight gradient at the top that gives them the appearance of depth and roundness .
The color of the window background and scrollbar is light beige , but the buttons are shaded darker with a vertical gradient .
The selection highlighting , progress bars , checkboxes , and radiobuttons have a salmon color that stands out strongly against the rest of the color scheme .
The Ambiance theme
Ambiance is enabled by default , but there is also a variant called Radiance that is included in the standard Ubuntu installation .
Radiance looks nearly identical , but has a different color palette — slightly lighter widget colors and a cream - colored gradient for the menus , window titlebars , and panels .
The Radiance theme
The new default wallpaper is a simple blend of black , purple , and white with a radial gradient and a lens flare .
Although the wallpaper 's colors are visually appealing and contrast well with the dark panels , its simplicity instills a sense of incompleteness .
It seems very empty , an effect that is exacerbated by Ubuntu 's practice of not displaying standard icons on the desktop .
Ubuntu 's new default desktop wallpaper
Users who are easily distracted by a busy wallpaper will likely appreciate Ubuntu 's default , but I personally favor a more vibrant look .
OMG !Ubuntu , a popular Ubuntu enthusiast blog that often showcases high - quality community theming projects , recently highlighted some impressive alternative Ubuntu wallpapers designed by Pr09studio .
Among the gems is an especially stunning piece that serves as a perfect replacement for the default wallpaper .
The style of the default icon theme has largely been retained from the previous version , but with an updated palette .
Some icons are more pronounced , with stronger gradients and richer colors .
The folders , for example , have gone from a very light orange to bright salmon .
Purple highlighting has been added to many icons , particularly those that display the desktop .

The orangutan smiling at her little bebeh just melts my cantankerous soul .
Thank you for these wonderful pictures !
Nicholas , a Boing Boing reader in Toronto , says ,
I read your article about how Voltage Pictures was planning to sue BitTorrent
users who downloaded their films .
Being the concerned citizen that I am
I emailed their president Nicolas Chartier to politely register my
disapproval .
I got a direct response from him ( not just a form letter ) ,
and it was … well , you 've got to read it for yourself .
If you 've heard the name " Nicolas Chartier " before , it 's probably because the Hurt Locker producer was banished from the Oscars after sending an earlier round of impulsive emails .
Here 's another gem to remember him by .
Mr. Chartier 's response is below ( emphasis added by the editor ) , followed by the full text of our reader 's ( very polite ) email , after the jump .

Subject : RE : Hurt Locker lawsuit Hi Nicholas , please feel free to leave your house open every time you go out and please tell your family to do so , please invite people in the streets to come in and take things from you , not to make money out of it by reselling it but just to use it for themselves and help themselves .
If you think it 's normal they take my work for free , I 'm sure you will give away all your furniture and possessions and your family will do the same .
I can also send you my bank account information since apparently you work for free and your family too so since you have so much money you should give it away …
I actually like to pay my employees , my family , my bank for their work and like to get paid for my work .
I 'm glad you 're a moron who believes stealing is right .
I hope your family and your kids end up in jail one day for stealing so maybe they can be taught the difference .
Until then , keep being stupid , you 're doing that very well .
And please do not download , rent , or pay for my movies , I actually like smart and more important HONEST people to watch my films .
best regards , Nicolas Chartier

Lotus has announced that it has recruited Force India design director Mark Smith to become its technical director .
A statement from Lotus said that Smith would join its team after working a ' notice period ' at Force India .
Fellow Force India design team members Lewis Butler and Marianne Hinson have also been announced as new additions to Lotus ' technical line - up , as chief designer and head of aerodynamics respectively .
All three have previously worked with Lotus chief technical officer Mike Gascoyne in other teams .
" I 'm exceptionally pleased to welcome Marianne and Lewis to Lotus Racing , and I 'm very excited to once again be teaming up with Mark Smith who I have previously worked with at Jordan , Renault and Force India , " said Gascoyne .
" Lewis and I were together at Force India , and Lewis also worked with Mark Smith at Red Bull , and Marianne and I have known each other since 1999 when I gave her her first job in F1 at Jordan , so we all know each other very well .
" Mark Smith and I were first at Jordan together where our first car was the 199 , Jordan 's most successful F1 entrant , and then he came with me to Renault where we helped put them back on the top step of the podium , and put in place the team that went on to win two world championships .
" Most recently we were together at Force India , and I 'm delighted he sees the potential we have here , and has seized the opportunity to work with me , Tony [ Fernandes ] and the whole team on helping Lotus Racing reach the front of the grid . "
Team owner Tony Fernandes also welcomed the new appointments , saying he was particularly pleased to attract established technical names early in his team 's existence .
" I am honoured that these fantastic talents have put their careers and their faith in Lotus Racing , and see the very bright future we all have together here , " he said .
" Formula 1 is a small world and the fact that they are coming to our team shows what we have already achieved in a very short period .
" Nothing will stop us from bringing in the best people we can , and we will give them the best working environment , and create the perfect atmosphere for them to fulfil their own potential , and help us in our quest to reach the top . "
Doomed Labour's £ 1.3 TRILLION last spending spree revealed :
As the economy nosedived , your millions were wasted on grandiose schemes
T he extraordinary extent of Labour 's final spending spree - which cost the public purse £ 1.3 trillion even as the economy was sinking - was laid bare for the first time last night .
Bills included £ 50 million to promote ballet and music , £ 5.6 million for pensions for the Royal Household and £ 38.4 million for gipsy encampments .
Details of the spending - which saw public expenditure rise by 15 per cent over two years - are contained in a vast Treasury database which the Coalition has made public .
The so - called Combined Online Information System ( Coins ) is so impenetrable that experts are having to pore over it to extract details .
The first comprehensive analysis , by software firm Rosslyn Analytics for the Daily Mail , shows that even as the economy was spiralling into recession , Labour kept the spending taps on - sanctioning expenditure that ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous .
A portion of the money will have been to support Gordon Brown 's economic philosophy to increase public spending to stimulate the fragile economy .
But the figures also reveal a significant level of more questionable spending
A portion of the money will have been to support Gordon Brown 's economic philosophy to increase public spending to stimulate the fragile economy .
But the figures also reveal a significant level of more questionable spending .
They show that the department run by former Children 's Secretary and Labour leadership hopeful Ed Balls lavished nearly £ 50 million on programmes for ballet , dance and music in schools .
The National Measurements Office , which orders retailers to weigh their goods in kilograms rather than pounds , in line with EU diktats , cost £ 150 million .
Another quango , Natural England , cost £ 442 million .
The Department for Environment also spent £ 95 million on an obscure ' National Environment Enjoyment programme ' .
Initially staff could not say what the money was spent on .
They later clarified it was for management of national parks .
The Cabinet Office had to fund £ 14 billion for gold - plated pensions for Whitehall staff , more than double the amount that needs to be cut from public spending this year .
The Coins figures show that pension costs for the Royal Household reached £ 5.6 million , while highly - paid judges received £ 267 million in taxpayers ' money for their retirement schemes .
The Electoral Commission , which has been widely criticised for its handling of the election and its failure to prevent postal voting fraud , cost £ 48 million to run over two years .
THE £ 38.4M GIPSY SITE FUND
As taxpayers struggled to afford their own homes through the recession , more than £ 38.4 million was used to fund sites for travellers .
Councils were asked to apply for the grants through the Department for Communities and Local Government for funds to ' provide amenities and purchase sites for gipsies ' .
Previous guidelines released by Labour stated that gipsies needed caravan sites as they suffer an ' aversion to bricks and mortar ' .
Even areas of outstanding natural beauty were not offlimits .
Yesterday the new Coalition Government axed the grants .
A spokesman for the department said : ' The current economic climate means that we need to act quickly and take difficult decisions about reducing grants due to be paid to local government . '
And in the middle of the recession , MPs cost the state £ 178 million in salary and expenses .
Bailing out the banks cost taxpayers nearly as much as funding the NHS over the last two years .
Taxpayers shelled out £ 132.4 billion to bail out financial institutions other than Northern Rock and Bradford and Bingley .
Northern Rock cost £ 20.3 billion to nationalise while Bradford and Bingley was even more expensive , at £ 24.6 billion .
Overall , pension payouts were the third most expensive area of government expenditure - underlining the high costs to Britain of an ageing population .
At nearly £ 128.4 billion , the cost of paying the state pension is more than double England 's £ 59 billion schools budget .
And while Britain is struggling with a recession , the Labour Government continued to send money abroad .
Around £ 1.6 billion was given to the European Union to distribute to poor countries , despite the UK already having its own Department for International Development ( DfID ) .
A further £ 1.3 billion was spent on ' reducing poverty in Asia ' , the continent that has seen the largest surge in economic growth in the past decade .
The Government has said it will make the database figures more accessible by August .

KBR Inc. was selected for a no - bid contract worth as much as $ 568 million through 2011 for military support services in Iraq , the Army said .
The Army announced its decision yesterday only hours after the Justice Department said it will pursue a lawsuit accusing the Houston - based company of taking kickbacks from two subcontractors on Iraq - related work .
The Army also awarded the work to KBR over objections from members of Congress , who have pushed the Pentagon to seek bids for further logistics contracts .
The Justice Department said the government will join a suit filed by whistleblowers alleging that two freight - forwarding firms gave KBR transportation department employees kickbacks in the form of meals , drinks , sports tickets and golf outings .
“ Defense contractors cannot take advantage of the ongoing war effort by accepting unlawful kickbacks , ” Assistant Attorney General Tony West said in a statement .
KBR , the Army ’s largest contractor in Iraq , will review the litigation when it is received and “ will continue to cooperate with the government , ” company spokeswoman Heather Browne said in an e-mail .
“ Gifts of dinners , baseball tickets and similar items would violate KBR policies and KBR was not aware of these violations . ”
KBR will continue to provide services in Iraq such as housing , meals , laundry , showers , water purification and bathroom cleaning under the new order , which was placed under a military contract KBR won in late 2001 , shortly after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan .

In the United Arab Emirates , a country that prides itself on modernity and its willingness to advance women 's rights , the criminal court in Abu Dhabi has sentenced an 18 - year - old Emirati woman to a year in prison for illicit sex after she reported that six men had gang - raped her .
Sadly , her treatment , though outrageous , is not unusual in the UAE .
It comes as no surprise that more than half of Emirati women questioned in a survey in January by the YouGov Siraj consulting organisation said they would not report sexual assault or rape to police .
The woman , whose name authorities have not made public , said in court that she had agreed to go for a drive with a 19 - year - old male friend .
News media reported that she said the friend called five other men to meet them , and when they arrived , they raped her .
During the first hearing on 17 May in Abu Dhabi 's criminal court , the six men were charged with rape , four in absentia as the authorities had not found them .
The forensics unit at the Abu Dhabi judicial department noted that evidence of assault was visible on the woman 's body .
Despite the physical evidence and the charges against all six men , the criminal court also charged the woman with illicit sex , or sex outside marriage , which is punishable by imprisonment and flogging in the UAE .
The prosecutor argued that the fact that she went for a drive with a man was sufficient proof that she consented to having sex .
A week later , during the second hearing , the woman retracted her statement , reportedly to avoid lashes and a jail sentence for extramarital sex .
She said that she was beaten by her brother after he found out that she had been speaking to men , and that as a result , she decided to report that she had been raped .
On 13 June , the Abu Dhabi criminal court sentenced both the woman and her 19 - year - old friend to one year in prison for engaging in consensual sex .
The court acquitted all the men of rape , finding four of them guilty of less serious charges of " moral crime " .
The UAE has made commendable strides in promoting women 's education , entrepreneurship and political participation .
When it comes to seeking justice for sexual violence , however , women in the UAE still face formidable – and often insurmountable – barriers .
Rape is a serious crime in the UAE , but the very act of reporting a rape automatically puts a woman in danger of being charged with illicit sex .
The law places an almost impossible burden of proof on rape victims to show that sex was nonconsensual .
In a similar case reported earlier this year , a British woman told Dubai police that a hotel worker raped her while she was on vacation in Dubai with her fiancé to celebrate their engagement .
The Dubai criminal court charged the woman and her fiancé with having sex outside marriage .
The same court charged the hotel worker with rape .
When the couple provided documents to prove that they were planning to get married , the extramarital sex charges against them were dropped .
But the court also freed the hotel worker , and the public prosecutor appears to have concluded that the woman had fabricated the story .
On top of risking prosecution , a rape survivor in the UAE is also likely to face ostracism by society , and even her family .
For many Emiratis , a family 's honour depends on a woman 's good reputation , and society is quick to judge sexual assault victims as " immoral " .
By making it almost impossible for a victim to prove rape , and then treating the brave few who choose to report rape as criminals , the UAE discriminates against women and violates their fundamental right to due process of the law .
This treatment causes women to live in fear and makes the trauma of rape worse .
The UAE , first and foremost , urgently needs to reform its penal code and rules of evidence .
Reporting a rape should never be grounds for charging a victim with illicit sex .
And the UAE should ensure that consensual sex in private between adults is not a criminal offence .
The UAE should also improve law enforcement and judicial practices , and offer health and other services to sexual violence victims .
Police , investigators , public prosecutors and judges should receive proper training to handle these cases , and policewomen with specialised training should be available to assist and support women who report rape .
Instead of being thrown behind bars , rape victims should receive medical treatment , psychological counselling and other support services .
Finally , the UAE should do more to promote women 's full equality in society , including combating stereotyped views concerning women 's morality and sexuality .
The UAE 's law on illicit sex is not unusual in the region , but the government 's public commitment to gender equality is .
If the UAE is serious about promoting women 's rights , it needs to ensure an effective response to sexual violence .
If I ask you what happened on may , 22 .
1980 you ’ll probably ask back something like : ” Are you kidding with me ? ”
But if I ask you about noticing anything different at Google -s home page on may , 22 .
what are you going to say then ?
Yes , 30 years have passed since Pacman first appeared so let us take look at how he was born and how did he grow up in one of the most adorable games ever made .
Games today are so flashy and expensive to make that they almost seem to miss the point .
So bent on outdoing the last game made by a competitor , they seem to lose sight of the most important things in the consumers .
Because of that , it is always nice to look back and see how a simple game like Pacman touched the hearts of gamers all around the world and still remains a favorite of many in the present .
History
To start out with , lets give a brief history of how the game of Pacman was first made and how it gained such popularity .
The maze game was made when the creator saw a pizza with one slice missing , think about what Pacman looks like , and was supposed to revolve around eating .
It was first made in 1980 but was not very popular as games like Space Invaders made it overlooked in Japan .
It was originally named Puckman .
Later in 1980 , the game was sent to the United States and renamed under the name we recognize it as today .
In America the newly named Pacman was a big hit and a welcome change from the same old games Americans were used to .
It took no real time after that for the rest of the world to catch onto the game and join in the celebration .
If you are wondering why the name was changed , Americans thought the name Puckman would be changed by vandals to a cuss word ( replace the P with a F ) .
In Europe , Puckman games can still be found .
Another fun fact about Pacman is that a perfect game is when you are able to finish all two hundred and fifty five levels without ever being caught .
It was first done in 1999 by someone with way too much time on their hands .
Why has Pacman been popular for so long ?
Well there are several reasons why .
For one it is really easy to play , there is nothing more to the game then moving Pacman with the control buttons , four in total , up , down , right , or left .
Anyone who knows what the buttons are can play the game perfectly well within seconds of picking it up .
Nowadays games focus so much on making controls hard and take long to pick up .
It just seems to take away from the overall gaming experience provided by current games .
Another fun feature to the game was the eating .
Who did n’t want to spend their entire day just eating and running away from ghosts ?
And how much fun was it when you could actually eat the ghosts and they ran away ?
Pacman ’s unique gaming was clearly a reason why the game has lasted so long .
Concerned about new Chinese data collection policies , Go Daddy announced Wednesday that it will no longer allow customers to sign up for new .
CN domain names .
Concerned about new Chinese data collection policies , Go Daddy announced Wednesday that it will no longer allow customers to sign up for new .
CN domain names .
The domain registrar will continue to manage existing .
CN domain names .
" There appears to be a recent increase in China 's surveillance and monitoring of the Internet activities of its citizens , " Christine Jones , general counsel for Go Daddy , told the Congressional - Executive Commission on China ( CECC ) , a committee comprised of nine senators and nine House members that monitors Chinese human rights .
This increased surveillance and reporting requirements have prompted Go Daddy to stop new Chinese registrations .
" We did n't want to act as an agent of the Chinese government , " Jones said .
" We can't let them be strong and us be weak all the time .
We just have to stop it , and then we 'll start offering .
CN domain names again . "
Go Daddy has offered .
CN domain names since 2005 , and is authorized by the China Internet Network Information Centre ( CNNIC ) to do so .
Traditionally , Go Daddy has collected the first and last names of registrants , as well as their physical address , telephone number , and e-mail address  and reported that data to the CNNIC .
In December 2009 , however , CNNIC announced that it would now require people registering new .
CN domain names to also submit color headshot photos , business identification , and physical signed registration forms .
A month later , CNNIC announced that Chinese nationals would no longer be able to register domain names through non-Chinese registrars , and Go Daddy halted all new .CN registrations .
But on Feb. 3 , 2010 , CNNIC said it would re-open .
CN domain registration to international companies .
The stricter data collection requirements remained in effect , however , and Chinese officials took it one step further to require existing .
CN domain name holders to retroactively submit photos , business information , and registration forms .
" We were advised that domain names of registrants who did not register as required would no longer resolve .
In other words , their domain names would no longer work , " Jones said .
The new rules affected about 1,200 Go Daddy customers .
Go Daddy contacted these people , informed them of the requirements , and told them this new information would be provided to CNNIC .
Only about 20 percent of those 1,200 people provided the data .
" The domain names of the remaining 900 or so customers remain at risk of cancellation .
That means thousands of Web sites the Chinese authorities may successfully disable because of retroactive application of this new set of rules , " Jones said .
" For these reasons , we have decided to discontinue offering new .
CN domain names at this time . "
Go Daddy statements steal spotlight from Google
The purpose of Wednesday hearing was to examine the effect of Chinese Internet regulation in light of Google 's recent decision to in China .
that it would re-direct Google.cn traffic to its non-censored Hong Kong site at Google.com / hk .
Alan Davidson , director of U.S. public policy for Google , appeared at the hearing and said that in the wake of Monday 's switch , " we have already seen intermittent censorship of certain search queries on both Google.com.hk and Google.com . "
Davidson said that Google 's ultimate goal is not to get other U.S. Internet companies to follow in its footsteps .
" Our long - term hope is that we can offer our services in China , " he said .
The Chinese embassy declined to send a representative to appear in person at the hearing , but they did send a statement .
" Foreign companies need to abide by Chinese laws and regulations when they operate in China .
Google has violated the written promise it made when entering the Chinese market by stopping filtering its searching service and making thinly veiled accusation against China , " the statement said .
" This is totally wrong .
We are firmly opposed to the politicization of commercial issues . "
Chinese officials met with Google on Jan. 29 and Feb. 25 , during which " the Chinese side emphasized that China still welcomes Google 's operation and development in China provided that it abides by Chinese laws , " the Chinese said .
" The Chinese government is committed to the opening up of the Internet , " the embassy said .
In a Tuesday press conference , Qin Gang , spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry , said that " the Chinese Government administers the Internet according to law and this position will not change . "
Sen. Byron Dorgan , a North Dakota Democrat and chairman of the CECC , said that " China too often wants a one - way relationship with the world . "
" China wants to participate in the marketplace , the marketplace of goods , but to keep the marketplace of ideas outside of their country , controlled by themselves , " Dorgan said .
" Respected countries do n't pick and choose to participate in only slivers of the world . "
Google 's decision to stop censoring Chinese search results was prompted by an attack originating in China that attempted to access Google intellectual property , as well as the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists .
Jones said Wednesday that Go Daddy has also been the victim of Chinese - based attacks .
" In the first three months of this year , we have repelled dozens of extremely serious DDoS attacks that appear to have originated in China , based on the IP addresses from which the attacks derived , " Jones said .
" Had our security systems not countered these attacks , the result would have been a widespread take - down of our customers ' hosted Web sites . "
Go Daddy has also battled Chinese - based spam zombies and payment fraud coming out of that country , Jones said .
Go Daddy has not had any of its intellectual property stolen , Jones said .
Most of the attacks the company has endured are designed to disable Go Daddy - hosted Web sites , she said .
Those sites mostly deal with content the Chinese find objectionable , such as Tiananmen Square anniversary sites or blogs that discuss Buddhist monks .
China has rarely asked Go Daddy to shut down sites trafficking in counterfeit goods , for example , " because , frankly , I think they support that , " Jones said .
Ovechkin's endless acceptance speech
We 've all watched the award shows where someone 's acceptance speech goes long , and the music and the announcer voice come up , and the speaker attempts to drone on over the music for a second or two , and then maybe they shout out a last few thanks reallyreallreally quickly in an increasingly high - pitched voice and then they kind of awkwardly walk off the stage while smiling and maybe joking with one of the presenters , who is n't paying attention and is instead imagining the open bar at the after - party .
Well , the routine is a bit different when the speaker is a 233 - pound left wing with a habit of smashing the enemy .
So in this case -- Alex Ovechkin winning the Ted Lindsay Award , the MVP as voted by the NHL 's players -- the sequence went like this .
1 ) Ovechkin is cut off by the music and the announcer .
2 ) Ovechkin raises his arms and attempts to figure out where his sound went , appearing to mouth " I 'm not done . "
3 ) Comedian Reese Waters comes out to a different mic and gets ready to do whatever it is that comedians do at NHL award shows .
4 ) Ovechkin attempts to continue giving thanks on an emptying stage , into a dead mic , while Waters looks backward , trying to figure out if this is some gimmick that got left out of his script .
5 ) Everyone else walks off the stage .
6 ) Since it 's clear that he wo n't move , and no one wants to make him , Ovechkin 's mic suddenly comes alive again , and he just calmly goes back into his speech , without hurrying or apologizing or even acknowledging that he just totally smashed protocol with a forearm shiver to the nose .
Mark Critz celebrates his victory in the special election in Pennsylvania 's 12th district , pointing to his daughter 's shirt which says ' Vote for Critz . '
The GOP 's special failure
All the evidence pointing to monster Republican House gains this fall — the Scott Brown upset win in Massachusetts , the scary polling numbers in once - safely Democratic districts , the ever - rising number of Democratic seats thought to be in jeopardy — was contradicted Tuesday .
In the only House race that really mattered to both parties — the special election to replace the late Democratic Rep. John Murtha in Pennsylvania ’s 12th District — Republicans failed spectacularly , losing on a level playing field where , in this favorable environment , they should have run roughshod over the opposition .

Given the resources the GOP poured into the effort to capture the seat and the decisiveness of the defeat — as it turned out , it was n’t really that close — the outcome casts serious doubt on the idea that the Democratic House majority is in jeopardy and offers comfort to a Democratic Party that is desperately in search of a glimmer of hope .
The district itself could n’t have been more primed for a Republican victory .
According to one recent poll , President Barack Obama ’s approval rating in the 12th was a dismal 35 percent , compared to 55 percent who disapproved .
His health care plan was equally unpopular — just 30 percent of those polled supported it , while 58 percent were in opposition .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was even more disliked in the blue - collar , western Pennsylvania - based seat : Just 23 percent viewed her favorably , compared to 63 percent who viewed her unfavorably .
Still , Democrat Mark Critz managed to pull off an eight - point victory , 53 percent to 45 percent , over Republican Tim Burns in a district that John McCain narrowly won in 2008 — the only one in the nation that voted for John Kerry in 2004 and McCain four years later .
The race marked the third highly - contested , fair - fight special House election that the GOP has dropped in the last year .
The seat Murtha held for 36 years is precisely the sort of Rust Belt district — economically populist and culturally traditional — that Republicans must win to claim the 40 seats necessary to take back the House .
Yet the way Critz and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee won the contest offered a reminder that the prospect of a GOP majority remains a mirage .
And Tuesday ’s result has Democrats breathing a sigh of relief , thinking they ’ve found a formula to mitigate their losses in what will still be a difficult election season .
The playbook from the Pennsylvania special election is n’t complicated :
Make the election a choice between two local candidates and not a national referendum on the Democratic Party or the state of the nation ; savage the Republican from the outset and do n’t let up ; keep the focus on jobs and core economic issues ; most important , separate yourself from your national party ’s policies and politicians as necessary .
“ The lesson will be define the choice very early , ” said DCCC Chair Chris Van Hollen in an interview .
“ This is not a referendum on how you feel about the general direction of the country , it ’s a choice about how we move forward .
And you have to define the differences on key policy issues . ”
In the case of Critz , that meant hammering Burns as being in favor of outsourcing jobs overseas and highlighting his willingness to cut Social Security benefits – significant liabilities in an economically - beleaguered and aging congressional district .
Meanwhile , Critz , a longtime Murtha aide , talked up what he had done on behalf of the district and pledged to continue in his former boss ’s tradition of bringing home federal dollars to the region .
Just as important , he made plain that he was a Murtha - style Democrat– pro-gun , anti-abortion and unafraid to cross his national party .
Critz opposed the healthcare bill and kept his distance from Obama and Speaker Nancy Pelosi – both of whom Republicans tried to tie him to .
Van Hollen pointed out that , while he may have come out against the healthcare bill , Critz also opposed repealing it .
But the Democratic campaign chief acknowledged that some of his candidates would have to keep clear of Obama this year
“ There are some districts where he ’s strong and some where he ’s less strong , ” Van Hollen said , before hastening to add that he still thinks the president is a great national spokesman for the party .
In districts like Critz ’s , though , the lesson appeared to be that Democrats would be better off keeping their national leaders away — or perhaps only bringing in select figures who can still appeal to centrists , such as former President Bill Clinton , who appeared in Johnstown on Sunday with Critz and Murtha ’s widow .
But if Republicans and their outside allies think they can cruise to victory this fall by simply airing ads linking House Democrats to Obama and Pelosi – as they tried in this contest – they may come up short .
“ The Republican strategy of just trying to focus on personalities , whether President Obama or Speaker Pelosi , that ’s not a winning strategy , ” Van Hollen said .
Republicans made little attempt to sugar - coat the results — except to note that they had fought the contest on the same day as the state ’s high - profile Democratic Senate primary .
“ Tonight ’s result was undoubtedly disappointing , but we will take the lessons learned from this campaign and move forward in preparation for November , ” said National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Pete Sessions in a statement .
Sessions also sought to shame Democrats for how they won the Pennsylvania seat , accurately summing up a component of their ungainly , whatever - it - takes survival strategy .
“ This hard - fought race gave us an early preview of what Democrats will attempt to do in the fall in order to survive , ” he said .
“ They will steer clear of publicly campaigning with President Obama and Speaker Pelosi , distance themselves from the Democratic agenda , and attempt to co-opt Republican positions on the issues . ”
However they ’re doing it , though , it ’s worked when it mattered .
Even as Obama ’s fortunes have declined , House Democrats have managed to win a string of nationally - watched special elections .
Last March they narrowly won in a competitive , upstate New York district that had elected both Democrats and Republicans in recent years .
Then , in November , Democrats capitalized on a Republican feud and won another upstate New York district — one that had previously been in GOP hands since before the Civil War .
Next comes Saturday ’s House special election in Hawaii .
In that unusual three - way contest , two Democrats are poised to split the party vote in the heavily Democratic 1st District , which would enable Republican Honolulu City Councilman Charles Djou to win with a plurality .
Winning the seat would help deflect attention from Tuesday ’s loss .
But the unique circumstances of the Hawaii race mean a GOP victory there wo n’t be nearly as meaningful as it would have been in Pennsylvania .

Wheat Gluten , Leaky Gut , and Autoimmune Disease Part Four
by Jeffrey Dach MD
Paradigm Shift about “ Leaky Gut ”
I simply had to attend a recent medical meeting , held literally in my back yard at the Ft. Lauderdale Harbor Marriot , presenting information about a paradigm shift in our understanding of the origin and cause of autoimmune diseases .
Above left image : Norman Borlaug standing in wheat field in Mexico posing for LIFE Magazine in November 1970 , courtesy of Time / Life Magazine .
Borlaug received the Nobel Prize for his semi - dwarf high yield wheat which averted global famine , literally saving 3 billion lives .
My Own Clinical Experience
From my own clinical experience over the past ten years evaluating and treating patients with autoimmune disease , it has become blatantly obvious that wheat gluten consumption is a major causative factor .
Latest Medical Research Conclusively Proves Connection
Working as a solo medical practitioner brought me to this conclusion .
However the meeting brought home a gratifying point that this is indeed correct .
I was astounded as I listened to William Davis MD and Alessio Fasano MD describe the latest research proving conclusively the connection between wheat leaky gut and autoimmune disease .
The exact mechanism has been elucidated .
Three previous newsletters have discussed this connection .
This article is Part Four .
See Part One , See Part Two .
See Part Three .
The GI Mucosa , Tight Junction , Zonulin , Guten and “ Leaky Gut ”
For the past century , medical science believed the gastrointestinal tract is a closed tube representing a sealed mucosal barrier .
This barrier keeps the “ bad things ” out , such as bacteria and large macromolecules .
The idea of a “ leaky gut ” expounded by alternative medicine docs and naturopaths has been vehemently rejected by mainstream medicine for decades .
Monumental Paradigm Shift
In a monumental paradigm shift , groundbreaking research has been published in the mainstream medical literature accepting the concept of leaky gut and autoimmune disease .
Imagine Max Kaiser or Alex Jones getting a half hour time slot on CNN news every night , something that could never happen in a million years .
This is the kind of thing we are talking about .
Doctors Who Know the Game
There are many doctors who have been aware of this connection , and publicized it for many years .
This list includes :
Jonathan Wright MD
James Braly MD ( Gluten powerpoint Slides )
and Dr. Christopher Reading .
The meeting established overwhelming medical evidence that , yes , they were right all along .
How It Works : Tight Junctions Open and Close in Response to Zonulin
Electron microscopy from Japan shows the “ Tight Junctions ” between GI mucosa epithelial cells opening and closing in response Zonulin release ( this is a controller protein ) . ( 5 - 12 ) ( link ) .
Click
Here to see images of tight junction .
Zonulin is a protein involved in control of the Tight Junctions .
Thanks to Alessio Fasano MD for his discovery of the Zonulin molecule , and much of the published research comes from his lab at the University of Maryland .
He was there at the meeting presenting his findings . ( 5 - 12 )

Gliadin , and Excess Zonulin in Genetically Susceptible Individuals
In genetically susceptible individuals , possessing the HLA DQ gene , an excessive amount of Zonulin is released upon ingestion of gliadin , a protein in wheat products .
( 5 - 12 ) The excess Zonulin then opens the Tight Junctions between the GI epithelial cells allowing large macromolecules to leak through the GI epithelial layer and allows larger partially digested food particles , proteins and peptide fragments , as well as enteric micro-organisms ( gram negative rods ) to leak into the blood stream . ( 5 - 12 )
Not Normally Found in the Blood Stream
Needless to say , these particles are not normally found in the blood stream , end up being recognized as “ foreign ” by the immune system , and then produce inflammatory infiltrate in the wall of the GI tract , as well antibodies which can be picked up in the blood sample for IgG Food allergy testing .
Molecular Mimicry
Through the wonders of “ molecular mimicry ” this immune response may “ cross - react ” with our own tissues in an unpredictable manner producing auto - immune diseases such as Celiac disease , Rheumatoid arthritis , Type One Diabetes , Multiple Sclerosis , Hashimoto ’s Thyroiditis , Graves Disease , Myasthenia Gravis , Psoriatic Arthritis , Sjogrens Syndrome , Ankylosing Spondylitis , Polymyositis , Dermatomyositis and many others .
Graves ’ Disease Caused by Yersinia Molecular Mimicry ( 23 - 29 )
An example of this molecular mimicry is found in Graves Disease , in which antibodies to the enteric gram negative organism , Yersinia , have been found to cross react with the TSH receptor , producing hyperthyroidism by stimulating the TSH receptors in the thyroid gland . ( 23 - 29 )
Gluten consumption opens the tight junctions allowing the Yersinia organism to pass across the mucosal barrier into the blood stream .
The immune system generates antibodies to the Yersinia which crossreact with the TSH receptors , producing Graves hyperthyroidism .
Elimination of wheat products will eventually prove to be curative .
However , medical treatment with Beta Blockers ( propranolol , atenolol ) and PTU - type drugs ( Tapazole ) to prevent thyroid storm is advisable in the short term .
How does the Yersinia from the gastrointestinal tract get into the blood stream ?
You guessed it : Gluten ingestion triggers Zonulin release causing Tight Juctions to open , causing “ leaky gut ” in genetically susceptible individuals .
This “ leaky gut ” allows the Yersinia organism to enter the blood stream .
Microbial Peptides , Molecular Mimicry and Autoimmune Disease
Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) has been linked to molecular mimicry with the Proteus bacteria , and Ankylosing Spondylitis is associated with Klebsiella microbe . ( 15 - 17 )
Mouse Model of Multiple Sclerosis – Inducing MS with Molecular Mimicry
Microbial peptides common to several different classes of bacteria can induce Multiple Sclerosis ( MS - like ) disease in humanized mice .
The anti-microbial antibodies also crossreact with myelin basic protein , a candidate MS auto - antigen . ( 17 )
Type One Diabetes ( Juvenile Diabetes ) and Celiac Disease are additional text book examples of autoimmune diseases associated with Gluten induced leaky gut . ( 5 - 12 )
Elimination of Wheat From the Diet Cures Auto - Immune Disease
I was taught in medical school that auto - immune diseases are incurable with unknown etiology , meaning the cause is unknown , and once you get it , there is no known cure for it .
Mainstream treatment of auto - immune disease has changed very little over the last 60 years , using an array of immune suppressive drugs such as prednisone , methotrexate , AZT azothiprine , cyclophosphamide etc .
The newer agents , the TNF alpha inhibitor drugs such as infliximab , adalimumab and etanercept also suppress the inflammatory response without addressing the cause of the illness .
Needless to say , these treatments leave much to be desired , and in some cases may cause horrendous side effects which end up worse than the underlying disease .
The Real Cause is Wheat Gluten in Genetically Suspectible Individuals
As brought to light at the meeting , the real cause of autoimmune disease is wheat gluten ingestion , and the real cure is elimination of wheat products from the diet .
As simple and straight forward as this sounds , mainstream medicine is still deaf to this message , refusing to discuss the evidence already published in their own mainstream medical journals .
Such is the way of medical science .
The wheels of progress turn slowly .
Our Testing Protocol for Auto - Immune Disease
Our testing protocol for gluten sensitivity includes a blood panel which may reveal a typical pattern of vitamin and mineral deficiencies ( low B12 , low Iron , Low Ferritin , Low Selenium , etc ) caused by malabsorption .
Low triglycerides or low cholesterol levels are also useful indicators of underlying gluten sensitivity , leaky gut , and malabsorption .
IgG Food Allergy Testing - Blood Test
In our office we routinely use an IgG food allergy kit .
This kit is inexpensive and easy to do at home .
The test kit comes in a small box containing a spring loaded lance for puncturing the finger , as well as the paper blotter collection strip for the sample blood spots which are air dried and sent to the lab in a mailer .
This is done at home .
Results have been extremely useful .
The web site for this kit is Here .
Anti-Gliadin Antibody - Stool Test
In addition , we use Enterolab for anti-gliadin antibody testing .
Enterolab provides a home kit for antibody testing for gluten sensitivity .
This is done on a stool sample sent into the lab from your home .
The kit also include cheek swab for genetic testing .
The web site to obtain the kit is Enterolab.com
ALCAT testing - another excellent test
Perhaps more accurate and sensitive than IgG blood antibody testing is the ALCAT technique which examines white blood cell response to various food antigens .
After all , the immune cell is the white blood cell .
Their technique isolates the white cell layer from the blood sample and runs it through a sophisticated “ Coulter Counter ” which compares white cell morphology to controls after allowing the white cells to react with the offending food antigens .
The ALCAT test is done by Cell Science Systems , conveniently located near my office at 852 South Military Trail in Deerfield Beach .
They offer a free blood draw service at the lab for patients who live in the area .
Cyrex Lab Testing
Perhaps the one lab most dedicated to sophistated and high end gluten sensitivity testing is Cyrex Labs .
They offers several useful “ arrays ” of antibody testing to evaluating wheat gluten sensitivity , leaky gut , cross reactive foods , and autoimmune susceptibility .
Why Wheat is the Culprit - William Davis MD – Wheat Has Been Changed !!
We previously discussed how the new high yield semi dwarf wheat is a major cause of our epidemic of auto - immune disease , which has increased by a factor of four over the past two decades .
Wheat consumption is also a major cause of our current epidemic of obesity and diabetes . ( 4 )
William Davis MD explains how modern wheat was genetically modified in the 1970 ’s by Norman Borlaug , a plant geneticist and pathologist who won the Nobel Prize and Congressional Gold Medal for developing a high yield dwarf wheat which averted a global famine crisis .
This new high yield wheat was a blessing because it literally saved two or three billion people from dying of starvation .
See Norman Borlaug web site .
Norman Borlaug died at the age of 95 in 2009 .
See Obituary in the LA Times .

Blessing and Curse - Adverse Health Effects of Modern Wheat
The new high yield wheat was no doubt a blessing , however , the “ curse ” or downside is the magnified adverse health effects .
Changes made to the gliadin protein in the new “ high yield , semi- dwarf ” wheat have quadrupled the incidence of celiac disease ( 6 ) and other auto - immune diseases .
Opiate Activity of Wheat
Opiate activity of semi- digested peptide fragments from the gliadin protein stimulate the appetite centers of the brain causing “ constant hunger ” increased caloric intake and obesity .
Because the wheat opiates are addictive , elimination of wheat may cause withdrawal effects in susceptible people .

Wheat Induces Hyperglycemia and Diabetes
Dr Davis spoke extensively on the wheat - Amylopectin component causing hyperglycemia and insulin resistance diabetes , now reaching epidemic proportions in our population .
Wheat protein fragments called peptides act as opiates and stimulate appetite .
Wheat amylopectin A raises blood sugar higher than nearly all other foods .
Wheat germ agglutinin ( a lectin ) is a direct intestinal toxin .
Modern
Wheat is inherently unhealthy and everyone should eliminate wheat from the diet .
Conclusion :
The evidence is now overwhelming that modern wheat is not only the cause of our epidemic of auto - immune disease in genetically susceptible individuals , modern wheat is also the cause of our epidemic of obesity and diabetes .
Eliminating wheat from the diet is curative .

Modern wheat a “ perfect , chronic poison , ” doctor says 2012-09-03 , CBS News Posted : 2012-09-18 09:13:28
Modern wheat is a “ perfect , chronic poison , ” according to Dr. William Davis , a cardiologist who has published a book , [ Wheat Belly : Lose the Wheat , Lose the Weight , and Find Your Path Back to Health ] all about the world ’s most popular grain .
Davis said that the wheat we eat these days is n’t the wheat your grandma had : “ It ’s an 18 - inch tall plant created by genetic research in the ’60s and ’ 70s , ” he said .
“ This thing has many new features nobody told you about , such as there ’s a new protein in this thing called gliadin .
It ’s not gluten .
I ’m not addressing people with gluten sensitivities and celiac disease .
I ’m talking about everybody else because everybody else is susceptible to the gliadin protein that is an opiate .
This thing binds into the opiate receptors in your brain and in most people stimulates appetite , such that we consume 440 more calories per day , 365 days per year . ”
Davis said a movement has begun with people turning away from wheat – and dropping substantial weight .
“ We ’re seeing hundreds of thousands of people losing 30 , 80 , 150 pounds .
Diabetics become no longer diabetic ; people with arthritis having dramatic relief .
People losing leg swelling , acid reflux , irritable bowel syndrome , depression , and on and on every day . ”
To avoid these wheat - oriented products , Davis suggests eating “ real food , ” such as avocados , olives , olive oil , meats , and vegetables .
“ ( It ’s ) the stuff that is least likely to have been changed by agribusiness , ” he said .
“ Certainly not grains .
When I say grains , of course , over 90 percent of all grains we eat will be wheat . ”

A decade ago celiac disease was considered extremely rare outside Europe and , therefore , was almost completely ignored by health care professionals .
In only 10 years , key milestones have moved celiac disease from obscurity into the popular spotlight worldwide .
Now we are observing another interesting phenomenon that is generating great confusion among health care professionals .
The number of individuals embracing a gluten - free diet ( GFD ) appears much higher than the projected number of celiac disease patients , fueling a global market of gluten - free products approaching $ 2.5 billion ( US ) in global sales in 2010 .
This trend is supported by the notion that , along with celiac disease , other conditions related to the ingestion of gluten have emerged as health care concerns .
This review will summarize our current knowledge about the three main forms of gluten reactions : allergic ( wheat allergy ) , autoimmune ( celiac disease , dermatitis herpetiformis and gluten ataxia ) and possibly immune - mediated ( gluten sensitivity ) , and also outline pathogenic , clinical and epidemiological differences and propose new nomenclature and classifications .

Presence of celiac disease epitopes in modern and old hexaploid wheat varieties : wheat breeding may have contributed to increased prevalence of celiac disease .

Gluten proteins from wheat can induce celiac disease ( CD ) in genetically susceptible individuals .
Specific gluten peptides can be presented by antigen presenting cells to gluten - sensitive T - cell lymphocytes leading to CD .
During the last decades , a significant increase has been observed in the prevalence of CD .
This may partly be attributed to an increase in awareness and to improved diagnostic techniques , but increased wheat and gluten consumption is also considered a major cause .
To analyze whether wheat breeding contributed to the increase of the prevalence of CD , we have compared the genetic diversity of gluten proteins for the presence of two CD epitopes ( Glia - α9 and Glia -α20 ) in 36 modern European wheat varieties and in 50 landraces representing the wheat varieties grown up to around a century ago .
Glia -α9 is a major ( immunodominant ) epitope that is recognized by the majority of CD patients .
The minor Glia -α20 was included as a technical reference .
Overall , the presence of the Glia - α9 epitope was higher in the modern varieties , whereas the presence of the Glia -α20 epitope was lower , as compared to the landraces .
This suggests that modern wheat breeding practices may have led to an increased exposure to CD epitopes .

Four opioid peptides were isolated from the enzymatic digest of wheat gluten .
Their structures were Gly - Tyr - Tyr - Pro-Thr , Gly - Tyr - Tyr - Pro , Tyr - Gly - Gly - Trp - Leu and Tyr - Gly - Gly - Trp , which were named gluten exorphins A5 , A4 , B5 and B4 , respectively .
The gluten exorphin A5 sequence was found at 15 sites in the primary structure of the high molecular weight glutenin and was highly specific for delta - receptors .
The structure - activity relationships of gluten exorphins A were unique in that the presence of Gly at their N - termini increased their activities .
Gluten exorphin B5 , which corresponds to [ Trp4 , Leu5 ] enkephalin , showed the most potent activity among these peptides .
Its IC50 values were 0.05 microM and 0.017 microM , respectively , on the GPI and the MVD assays .

Fasano A 2012 Aug Interview – Discovery of Zonulin

Interview with Dr Fasano
RHR : Pioneering Researcher Alessio Fasano M.D. on Gluten , Autoimmunity & Leaky Gut
And then in the mid-‘80s , a group of Japanese scientists said , well , actually the spacing between cells is not cemented .
They are doors , almost always closed , but they are doors .
And that was quite an interesting discovery .
And then over the years , more and more information came about , you know , how these doors are made , but what was the missing link was what kind of molecule , substance , or signal or whatever would modulate these doors so they can be opened and closed .
And that ’s where we stumbled by mistake studying celiac disease that we make a molecule that we call zonulin that regulates the permeability of this space .
And again , through celiac disease we learned that this molecule is produced in excess , in an exaggerated fashion , by people with celiac disease , now finally explaining the inexplicable , how this protein can come through , because now if you have this door stuck open , everybody from the environment can sneak into our body , including gluten , and with that , trigger the autoimmune response .
So that led us to put forward this new paradigm in which the recipe for autoimmunity is made not by two , but three ingredients :
You have to be genetically predisposed , you have to have an environmental factor that is the instigator of the immune response , but at the same time you have to have a breach of this barrier so these two elements can interplay .
SIBO Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth
So what we understand is that at least for the zonulin pathway — and I ’m sure there are going to be many others if they physiologically control the permeability — there are two major stimuli that we found to release zonulin in everybody — everybody .
If you have bacteria in your small intestine , where supposedly they should not be there because we ’ve been built so that bacteria will be confined in our intestinal tract all in the colon at the very end , where there are no nutrients anymore so they cannot steal .
But if there are bacteria , they eventually will be able to colonize the small intestine by going through all these layers of defense that we have been evolving with as human beings , like saliva , the gastric juice defending from almost all bacteria , pancreatic juice , bile , glycocholic — in other words , if this bacteria will go through all of this and will land on the epithelial cells of the intestine and start to sit there and steal nutrients that we ingest with diet , if we have one last thing that we can do to get rid of these guys , enterocytes , i.e. these epithelial cells , when colonized by bacteria , they release a large amount of zonulin .
They open this space , water comes in from underneath the intestine into the lumen , will dilute the toxins produced by these bacteria , but at the same time will flush them out so that they will be moved out and removed from the small intestine .
This is one stimulus .
The other stimulus — and I believe that this is more by mistake of evolution rather than planned design as for the proximal bile contamination — is gluten itself .
We identified two fragments , one of the gluten components , it ’s called gliadin , that when introduced to epithelial cells they induce , like for bacteria , zonulin release .
And this , again , happens to everybody .
What is the difference between everybody and the people that develop a problem with gluten like celiac disease is that while for me , for example , because I do n’t have a problem .
I eat a Big Mac .
I have gluten in there .
These fragments release zonulin , which increases permeability .
Stuff comes through , including gluten .
My immune system that is tuned to do the job right will clean up the mess , and I will not even know that all that happened .
Also because this open - and - close is short .
It ’s a matter of minutes that it will open and a matter of minutes that will turn to be closed .
Gluten Sensitive People People with celiac disease , on the other hand , when they do something like that , not only do they have much more zonulin produced than I do , but also the opening is much more prolonged because these doors get stuck open , and therefore you give much more time for substances from the environment , including gluten , to come through .
And now on this other side , you find this immune system that is not tuned to do the job right , and when they see this enemy , they start to mount an immune response to attack your own body , and that leads to celiac disease .
Dr. Aristo Vojdani ’s work in Cyrex Laboratories and what your opinion is on that test , which screens for antibodies to gluten and zonulin and actinomycin and lipopolysaccharide .
Zonulin geneticalluy upregulated
Dr. Alessio Fasano : Yeah , so far , we have seen this , because we had enough data , in three autoimmune diseases .
We have seen this in celiac disease and type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis .
When we discovered what zonulin is all about in terms of genes , now we know that zonulin is the precursor of a molecule , a protein called haptoglobin 2 , so we know what kind of molecule it is .
And using that as a biomarker , we see that there are three major categories of conditions that see zonulin upregulated or present in a mutated fashion .
These are autoimmune diseases , and besides the three that I just mentioned , it has been proven in Crohn ’s disease , for example , and in another category there are tumors ovarian cancer , pancreatic cancer , glioma , these kinds of cancers , and then in diseases of the nervous system , including schizophrenia and autism . — –

What No One Is Saying About Zonulin — Is Celiac About More Than Genes and Gluten ?
celiacs produce 30 times as much zonulin as non-celiacs , even though the non-celiacs were not eating gluten - free diets while the celiacs had been off gluten for over two years !

Physiological , pathological , and therapeutic implications of zonulin - mediated intestinal barrier modulation : living life on the edge of the wall .
Fasano A. University of Maryland School of Medicine , Mucosal Biology Research Center , Health Science Facility II , Baltimore ,
The anatomical and functional arrangement of the gastrointestinal tract suggests that this organ , beside its digestive and absorptive functions , regulates the trafficking of macromolecules between the environment and the host through a barrier mechanism .
Under physiological circumstances , this trafficking is safeguarded by the competency of intercellular tight junctions , structures whose physiological modulation is mediated by , among others , the recently described protein zonulin .
To prevent harm and minimize inflammation , the same paracellular pathway , in concert with the gut - associated lymphoid tissue and the neuroendocrine network , controls the equilibrium between tolerance and immunity to nonself antigens .
However , if the tightly regulated trafficking of macromolecules is jeopardized secondary to prolonged zonulin up - regulation , the excessive flow of nonself antigens in the intestinal submucosa can cause both intestinal and extraintestinal autoimmune disorders in genetically susceptible individuals .
This new paradigm subverts traditional theories underlying the development of autoimmunity , which are based on molecular mimicry and / or the bystander effect , and suggests that the autoimmune process can be arrested if the interplay between genes and environmental triggers is prevented by re-establishing intestinal barrier competency .

Abstract
Recent studies indicate that besides digestion and absorption of nutrients and water and electrolytes homeostasis , another key function of the intestine is to regulate the trafficking of environmental antigens across the host mucosal barrier .
Intestinal tight junctions ( TJs ) create gradients for the optimal absorption and transport of nutrients and control the balance between tolerance and immunity to nonself antigens .
To meet diverse physiological challenges , intestinal epithelial TJs must be modified rapidly and in a coordinated fashion by regulatory systems that orchestrate the state of assembly of the TJ multiprotein network .
While considerable knowledge exists about TJ ultrastructure , relatively little is known about their physiological and pathophysiological regulation .
Our discovery of zonulin , the only known physiologic modulator of intercellular TJs described so far , has increased our understanding of the intricate mechanisms that regulate the intestinal epithelial paracellular pathway and has led us to appreciate that its upregulation in genetically susceptible individuals leads to autoimmune diseases .

Intestinal permeability and its regulation by zonulin : diagnostic and therapeutic implications .

Abstract
One of the most important and overlooked functions of the gastrointestinal tract is to provide a dynamic barrier to tightly controlled antigen trafficking through both the transcellular and paracellular pathways .
Intercellular tight junctions ( TJ ) are the key structures regulating paracellular trafficking of macromolecules .
Although steady progress has been made in understanding TJ ultrastructure , relatively little is known about their pathophysiological regulation .
Our discovery of zonulin , the only known physiological modulator of intercellular TJ described so far , increased understanding of the intricate mechanisms that regulate gut permeability and led us to appreciate that its up - regulation in genetically susceptible individuals may lead to immune - mediated diseases .
This information has translational implications , because the zonulin pathway is currently exploited to develop both diagnostic and therapeutic applications pertinent to a variety of immune - mediated diseases .

Abstract
The primary functions of the gastrointestinal tract have traditionally been perceived to be limited to the digestion and absorption of nutrients and to electrolytes and water homeostasis .
A more attentive analysis of the anatomic and functional arrangement of the gastrointestinal tract , however , suggests that another extremely important function of this organ is its ability to regulate the trafficking of macromolecules between the environment and the host through a barrier mechanism .
Together with the gut - associated lymphoid tissue and the neuroendocrine network , the intestinal epithelial barrier , with its intercellular tight junctions , controls the equilibrium between tolerance and immunity to non-self antigens .
Zonulin is the only physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions described so far that is involved in trafficking of macromolecules and , therefore , in tolerance / immune response balance .
When the finely tuned zonulin pathway is deregulated in genetically susceptible individuals , both intestinal and extraintestinal autoimmune , inflammatory , and neoplastic disorders can occur .
This new paradigm subverts traditional theories underlying the development of these diseases and suggests that these processes can be arrested if the interplay between genes and environmental triggers is prevented by reestablishing the zonulin - dependent intestinal barrier function .
This review is timely given the increased interest in the role of a “ leaky gut ” in the pathogenesis of several pathological conditions targeting both the intestine and extraintestinal organs .
Zonulin has been observed to be involved in intestinal innate immunity ( 53 ) and to be upregulated in several autoimmune diseases , including celiac disease ( CD ) and type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) , in which TJ dysfunction seems to be the primary defect
Bottom : quantitative real - time PCR of the CXCR3 gene confirmed an increased expression of the receptor compared with nonceliac controls that decreased after treatment with a gluten - free diet .

Stimuli That Cause Zonulin Release in the Gut
Among the several potential intestinal luminal stimuli that can trigger zonulin release , we identified small intestinal exposure to bacteria and gluten as the two more powerful triggers ( Fig. 7 ) .
Enteric infections have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several pathological conditions , including allergic , autoimmune , and inflammatory diseases , by causing impairment of the intestinal barrier .
We have generated evidence that small intestines exposed to enteric bacteria secreted zonulin
In addition to bacterial exposure , we have shown that gliadin also affects the intestinal barrier function by releasing zonulin ( 35 ) .
This effect of gliadin is polarized , i.e. , gliadin increases intestinal permeability only when administered on the luminal side of the intestinal tissue ( 35 ) ( Fig. 7 ) .
This observation led us to the identification of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 as the target intestinal receptor for gliadin ( 92 ) .
Our data demonstrate that in the intestinal epithelium , CXCR3 is expressed at the luminal level , is overexpressed in CD patients
Zonulin Is Upregulated in the Intestinal Mucosa of Celiac Disease Patients .
A fast - growing number of diseases are recognized to involve alterations in intestinal permeability related to changes in TJ competency .
These comprise autoimmune diseases , including T1D , multiple sclerosis , and rheumatoid arthritis , in which intestinal TJs allow the passage of antigens from the intestinal milieau , challenging the immune system to produce an immune response that can target any organ or tissue in genetically predisposed individuals ( 1 , 13 , 57 , 58 , 70 , 151 ) .
TJs are also involved in cancer development , infections , and allergies ( 32 , 55 , 57 , 147 ) .
CD and T1D autoimmune models suggest that when the finely tuned trafficking of macromolecules is deregulated in genetically susceptible individuals , autoimmune disorders can occur ( 56 ) .
This new paradigm subverts traditional theories underlying the development of autoimmunity , which are based on molecular mimicry and / or the bystander effect , and suggests that the autoimmune process can be arrested if the interplay between genes and environmental triggers is prevented by reestablishing the intestinal barrier function .
The classical paradigm of inflammatory pathogenesis involving specific genetic makeup and exposure to environmental triggers has been challenged recently by the addition of a third element , the loss of intestinal barrier function .
Genetic predisposition , miscommunication between innate and adaptive immunity , exposure to environmental triggers , and loss of intestinal barrier function secondary to the activation of the zonulin pathway by food - derived environmental triggers or changes in gut microbiota all seem to be key ingredients involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation , autoimmunity , and cancer .
This new theory implies that once the pathological process is activated , it is not auto - perpetuating .
Rather , it can be modulated or even reversed by preventing the continuous interplay between genes and the environment .
Since zonulin - dependent TJ dysfunction allows such interactions , new therapeutic strategies aimed at reestablishing the intestinal barrier function by downregulating the zonulin pathway offer innovative and not - yet - explored approaches for the management of these debilitating chronic diseases .

Leaky Gut and Autoimmune Diseases by Alessio Fasano 2011
A fast growing number of diseases , including autoimmune diseases , are recognized to involve alterations in intestinal permeability related to changes in TJ competency .
Molecular Mimicry
The connection between infection and autoimmune disease is often explained by a mechanism known as “ molecular mimicry , ” whereby microbial antigens are postulated to resemble self - antigens .
Key Points
1. Autoimmune diseases involve a miscommunication between innate and adaptive immunity ;
2. Continuous stimulation by environmental triggers ( such as gluten ) seems to be necessary to perpetuate the auto - immune process .
The autoimmune response can theoretically be stopped and reversed if the environmental trigger ( gluten ) is eliminated .
3 . In addition to genetic predisposition and exposure to triggering antigens , the loss of the protective function of mucosal barriers ( Leaky Gut ) is necessary for autoimmunity to develop .
Besides celiac disease , several other autoimmune diseases , including type 1 diabetes [ 13 , 14 ] , multiple sclerosis [ 15 , 16 ] , and rheumatoid arthritis [ 17 ] , are characterized by increased intestinal permeability secondary to noncompetent
TJs that allow the passage of antigens from the intestinal flora , challenging the immune system to produce an immune response that can target any organ or tissue in genetically predisposed individuals [ 18 –21 ] .
The Zonulin Pathway - Zonulin discovered by Fasano ’s Group
The discovery of zonula occludens toxin ( Zot ) , an enterotoxin elaborated by Vibrio cholerae that reversibly opens TJ .
Zonulin is overexpressed in tissues and sera of subjects affected by autoimmune diseases ,
Celiac Disease - Gluten
There are at least 50 toxic epitopes in gluten peptides exerting cytotoxic , immunomodulatory , and gut permeating activities .
Once gluten is removed from the diet , serum zonulin levels decrease , the intestine resumes its baseline barrier function , the autoantibody titers are normalized , the
autoimmune process shuts off and , consequently , the intestinal damage ( that represents the biological outcome of the autoimmune process ) heals completely .

Abstract Celiac disease ( CD ) and schizophrenia have approximately the same prevalence , but epidemiologic data show higher prevalence of CD among schizophrenia patients .
The reason for this higher co-occurrence is not known , but the clinical knowledge about the presence of immunologic markers for CD or gluten intolerance in schizophrenia patients may have implications for treatment .
Our goal was to evaluate antibody prevalence to gliadin ( AGA ) , transglutaminase ( tTG ) , and endomysium ( EMA ) in a group of individuals with schizophrenia and a comparison group .
AGA , tTG , and EMA antibodies were assayed in 1401 schizophrenia patients who were part of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness study and 900 controls .
Psychopathology in schizophrenia patients was assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale ( PANSS ) .
Logistic regression was used to assess the difference in the frequency of AGA , immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) , and tTG antibodies , adjusting for age , sex , and race .
Linear regression was used to predict PANSS scores from AGA and tTG antibodies adjusting for age , gender , and race .
Among schizophrenia patients , 23.1 % had moderate to high levels of IgA - AGA compared with 3.1 % of the comparison group ( ? 2 = 1885 , df = 2 , P < .001 . )
Moderate to high levels of tTG antibodies were present in 5.4 % of schizophrenia patients vs 0.80 % of the comparison group ( ? 2 = 392.0 , df = 2 , P < .001 ) .
Adjustments for sex , age , and race had trivial effects on the differences .
Regression analyses failed to predict PANSS scores from AGA and tTG antibodies .
Persons with schizophrenia have higher than expected titers of antibodies related to CD and gluten sensitivity .

Allergic disorders such as atopic dermatitis and asthma are common hyper - immune disorders in industrialized countries .
Along with genetic association , environmental factors and gut microbiota have been suggested as major triggering factors for the development of atopic dermatitis .
Numerous studies support the association of hygiene hypothesis in allergic immune disorders that a lack of early childhood exposure to diverse microorganism increases susceptibility to allergic diseases .
Among the symbiotic microorganisms ( e.g. gut flora or probiotics ) , probiotics confer health benefits through multiple action mechanisms including modification of immune response in gut associated lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) .
Although many human clinical trials and mouse studies demonstrated the beneficial effects of probiotics in diverse immune disorders , this effect is strain specific and needs to apply specific probiotics for specific allergic diseases .
Herein , we briefly review the diverse functions and regulation mechanisms of probiotics in diverse disorders .

Autoimmunity in Rheumatic Diseases Is Induced by Microbial Infections via Crossreactivity or Molecular Mimicry .
Rashid T , Ebringer A. Source Analytical Sciences Group , Kings College London , 150 Stamford Street , London SE1 9NN , UK .
Abstract A general consensus supports fundamental roles for both genetic and environmental , mainly microbial , factors in the development of autoimmune diseases .
One form of autoimmune rheumatic diseases is confined to a group of nonpyogenic conditions which are usually preceded by or associated with either explicit or occult infections .
A previous history of clinical pharyngitis , gastroenteritis / urethritis , or tick - borne skin manifestation can be obtained from patients with rheumatic fever , reactive arthritis , or Lyme disease , respectively , whilst , other rheumatic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) , and Crohn ’s disease ( CD ) are usually lacking such an association with a noticeable microbial infection .
A great amount of data supports the notion that RA is most likely caused by Proteus asymptomatic urinary tract infections , whilst AS and CD are caused by subclinical bowel infections with Klebsiella microbes .
Molecular mimicry is the main pathogenetic mechanism that can explain these forms of microbe - disease associations , where the causative microbes can initiate the disease with consequent productions of antibacterial and crossreactive autoantibodies which have a great impact in the propagation and the development of these diseases .

Antibodies to proteus in rheumatoid arthritis .
Ebringer A , Ptaszynska T , Corbett M , Wilson C , Macafee Y , Avakian H , Baron P , James DC .
Abstract Antibodies to proteus species were measured in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) and ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) and in healthy controls by a Coombs agglutination method .
The titres to Proteus mirabilis were higher in 30 RA patients being treated with gold than in 24 patients with active AS ( p less than 0.001 ) , 28 patients with inactive AS ( p less than 0.001 ) , and 41 healthy control subjects ( p less than 0.001 ) .
Control studies with Klebsiella pneumoniae var oxytoca showed high antibody titres only in active AS patients .

Environmental factors account for 75 % of the risk of developing multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .
Numerous infections have been suspected as environmental disease triggers , but none of them has consistently been incriminated , and it is unclear how so many different infections may play a role .
We show that a microbial peptide , common to several major classes of bacteria , can induce MS - like disease in humanized mice by crossreacting with a T cell receptor ( TCR ) that also recognizes a peptide from myelin basic protein , a candidate MS autoantigen .
Structural analysis demonstrates this crossreactivity is due to structural mimicry of a binding hotspot shared by self and microbial antigens , rather than to degenerate TCR recognition .
Biophysical studies reveal that the autoreactive TCR binding affinity is markedly lower for the microbial ( mimicry ) peptide than for the autoantigenic peptide .
Thus , these data suggest a possible explanation for the difficulty in incriminating individual infections in the development of MS .
Taken altogether , our data suggest that low - affinity hotspot mimicry ( limited to a small number of key aspects of the TCRbinding footprint ) , rather than high - affinity structural mimicry ( requiring replication of all features of the binding footprint ) , may be the more common contributor in the initiation not only of MS but also of other autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis and Type 1 diabetes , in which infections have likewise been implicated .
Moreover , the same disease - inducing mimicry peptides can be conserved in many common bacteria , which might explain why it has been difficult to incriminate individual infections in the development of autoimmune diseases .

Leaky Gut : Why It Happens and What To Do About It Zonulin is activated by gliadin Gliadin is a protein in wheat , that like gluten , is a trigger for people with the autoimmune disease celiac .
However , this study published in the Scandiavian Journal of Gastroenterology in 2006 clearly showed that gliadin can affect zonulin even in people without the genetics for celiac .
The researchers concluded that , Based on our results , we concluded that gliadin activates zonulin signaling irrespective of the genetic expression of autoimmunity , leading to increased intestinal permeability to macromolecules .
This is extremely significant because it means that anyone who eats food containing gliadin is at risk for developing leaky gut from this food .
What foods contain gliadin ?
Grains contain gliadin .
The gluten - free diet is conventional treatment for celiac .
Some people do very well with this but there is research that shows that only 66 % of celiacs fully heal on the gluten - free diet after 5 years .

Thyrotrophin ( TSH ) binding sites on Yersinia enterocolitica recognized by immunoglobulins from humans with Graves ’ disease .
Heyma P , Harrison LC , Robins - Browne R. Abstract
Antibodies against the gram negative enteric bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica have been found in a high proportion of persons with autoimmune thyroid disorders , especially in those with Graves ’ disease or hyperthyroidism ( Shenkman & Bottone , 1981 ) .
There is strong evidence that Graves ’ disease is caused by receptor autoantibodies which mimic the bioeffects of thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) on the thyroid ( Manley , Knight & Adams , 1982 ) .
Recently , saturable binding sites for TSH were demonstrated in Y. enterocolitica under non-physiological conditions ( Weiss et al. , 1983 ) .
We have characterized TSH binding sites on Y. enterocolitica under physiological conditions and studied their interaction with Graves ’ immunoglobulins ( Ig’s ) .
Saturable and specific binding of receptor - purified 125I - TSH to lysozyme / EDTA - treated Y. enterocolitica ( serotype 03 ) was demonstrated under both non-physiological and physiological conditions .
Scatchard binding plots were linear indicating a single class of binding site ( Kd 1 X 10 ( - 7 ) M , maximum of 30,000 binding sites per cell ) .
In the presence of Graves ’
Ig ’s the binding of 125I - TSH to Y. enterocolitica was significantly inhibited .
Graves ’
Ig ’s also precipitated a protein of relative molecular mass ( Mr ) 64,000 from Triton - solubilized , 125I - labelled Y. enterocolitica , similar in size to one of the proteins precipitated by Graves ’
Ig ’s from human thyroid membranes .
These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that thyroid autoimmunity may be triggered by bacterial infection via a mechanism involving crossreactivity at the level of the TSH receptor .
They also suggest that elements of mammalian endocrine systems are highly conserved and have a function in prokaryotes .

[ Antibodies to Yersinia enterocolitica in immunogenic thyroid diseases ] .
[ Article in German ] Petru G , Stünzner D , Lind P , Eber O , Möse JR .
In 1976 Shenkman et al. revealed that in patients with thyroid disorders antibodies against Yersinia enterocolitica could be demonstrated in increased frequency .
In 1983 Ingbar et al. first established that the gram - negative bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica shows on its surface saturable binding sites for thyrotropin ( TSH ) .
If such binding sites resemble immunologically human TSH receptors this would indicate that TSH receptor antibodies could be produced in selected individuals having been infected with bacteria showing TSH receptors .
The aim of our study was to compare the incidence of antibodies against Yersinia enterocolitica in two groups of thyroid disorders which are either immunogenic ( Graves ’ disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis ) or non-immunogenic ( toxic adenomas , endemic goitre ) .
In our series of 111 patients antibodies against Yersinia enterocolitica were demonstrated in a significantly higher percentage ( 36.3 % ) in patients suffering from immunogenic than in patients with non-immunogenic thyroid disorders ( 19.6 % ) .
The antibody titres were mainly directed towards Yersinia subtypes 8 and 3 .
It may , therefore , be assumed that the gram - negative bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica may have an active part in triggering immunogenic thyroid diseases such as Graves ’ disease or Hashimoto thyroiditis .

Antibodies to Yersinia enterocolitica serotype 3 in autoimmune thyroid diseases .
Takuno H , Sakata S , Miura K. Third Department of Internal Medicine , Gifu University School of Medicine , Japan .
Abstract
The prevalence of increased titres of antibodies to Yersinia enterocolitica ( serotype 3 ) has been studied in sera from patients with various thyroid diseases .
In contrast to the low prevalences of the antibodies in healty subject ( 24.3 % ) , titres ( greater than 10 ) of anti-Yersinia enterocolitica ( anti- Yersinia ) were found more frequently in patients with thyroidal disorders , especially in Graves ’ disease ( 70.0 % ) .
Furthermore , high titres of the antibodies ( greater than or equal to 160 ) were found only in patients with Graves ’ disease .
There was no significant correlation between the titers of anti - Yersinia antibodies and those of anti-TSH receptor antibodies in sera from patients with Graves ’ disease .
In seven individual samples of sera , the anti- Yersinia antibody titer was high before treatment , but the decrease in the anti-TSH receptor antibody titer following treatment was associated with a simultaneous decline in anti-Yersinia antibodies in all of them .
A highly positive and significant correlation between the titers of anti-TSH receptor antibodies and anti-Yersinia antibodies was obtained in each of them .
These findings could be merely a reflection of the measurement of the cross-reaction of anti-Yersinia antibodies with anti-TSH receptor antibodies but the possibility of an association between Yersinia infection and the production of anti-TSH receptor antibodies in at least some patients with Graves ’ disease cannot be ruled out .

It has previously been proposed that subclinical Yersinia enterocolitica infection may play a role in autoimmune thyroid disease ( AITD ) .
In this study , we investigated the relationship between the thyroid autoantibodies and the antibodies that produced against different serotypes of Y. enterocolitica .
A total of 215 subjects were included into the study ( 65 newly diagnosed Graves ’ disease [ GD ] , 57 Hashimoto ’s thyroiditis [ HT ] , 53 nontoxic diffuse goiter [ NTDG ] , and 40 subjects for control group [ CG ] ) .
Thyroid receptor antibodies ( TRAb ) , thyroid and agglutinating antibodies against Y. enterocolitica serotype O:3 , O:5 , O:8 , O:9 were measured in the blood samples .
The highest incidence of Y. enterocolitica antibody positivity was measured in GD ( 53.8 % for O:3 , 29.2 %
for O:5 , 44.6 % for O:8 , and 40 % for O:9 ) and followed by HT .
In patients with GD , TRAb levels were also higher than in patients with HT , NTDG , and CG .
There was no difference between NTDG and CG in respect to the titer levels and the positivity of both TRAb and Y. enterocolitica antibodies .
There was also a weak linear correlation between TRAb level and the titer of antibodies against Y. enterocolitica antigens .
It can be concluded that Y. enterocolitica infection may play a role in etiology of GD in Turkey .

Too early to dismiss Yersinia enterocolitica infection in the aetiology of Graves ’ disease : evidence from a twin case - control study .
Brix TH , Hansen PS , Hegedüs L , Wenzel BE .
Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism , Odense University Hospital , Odense , Denmark .
Yersinia enterocolitica ( YE ) infection has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of Graves ’ disease ( GD ) .
The association between YE and GD could , however , also be due to common genetic or environmental factors affecting the development of both YE infection and GD .
This potential confounding can be minimized by investigation of twin pairs discordant for GD .
We first conducted a classical case - control study of individuals with ( 61 ) and without ( 122 ) GD , and then a case - control study of twin pairs ( 36 ) discordant for GD .
Immunoglobulin ( Ig ) A and IgG antibodies to virulence - associated Yersinia outer membrane proteins ( YOPs ) were measured .
The prevalence of YOP IgA and IgG antibodies .
RESULTS : Subjects with GD had a higher prevalence of YOP IgA ( 49 % vs. 34 % , P = 0.054 ) and YPO IgG ( 51 % vs. 35 % , P = 0.043 ) than the external controls .
The frequency of chronic YE infection , reflected by the presence of both IgA and IgG YOP antibodies , was also higher among cases than controls ( 49 %vs. 33 % , P = 0.042 ) .
Similar results were found in twin pairs discordant for GD .
In the case - control analysis , individuals with GD had an increased odds ratio ( OR ) of YE infection : IgA 1.84 ( 95 % CI 0.99 -3.45 ) and IgG 1.90 ( 95 % CI 1.02 - 3.55 ) .
In the co-twin analysis , the twin with GD also had an increased OR of YE infection : IgA 5.5 ( 95 % CI 1.21-24.81 ) and IgG 5.0 ( 95 % CI 1.10 - 22.81 ) .
CONCLUSION :
The finding of an association between GD and YE in the case - control study and within twin pairs discordant for GD supports the notion that YE infection plays an aetiological role in the occurrence of GD , or vice versa .

The Electoral College is an antidemocratic relic .
Everyone who remembers 2000 knows that it can lead to the election of the candidate who loses the popular vote as president .
But the Electoral College 's other serious flaws are perhaps even more debilitating for a democracy .
It focuses presidential elections on just a handful of battleground states , and pushes the rest of the nation 's voters to the sidelines .
There is an innovative new proposal for states to take the lead in undoing the Electoral College .
Legislatures across the country should get behind it .
Both parties should have reason to fear the college 's perverse effects .
In 2000 , the Democrats lost out .
But in 2004 , a shift of 60,000 votes in Ohio would have elected John Kerry , even though he lost the national popular vote decisively .
Just as serious is the way the Electoral College distorts presidential campaigns .
Candidates have no incentive to campaign in , or address the concerns of , states that reliably vote for a particular party .
In recent years , the battleground in presidential elections has shrunk drastically .
In 1960 , 24 states , with 327 electoral votes , were battleground states , according to estimates by National Popular Vote , the bipartisan coalition making the new proposal .
In 2004 , only 13 states , with 159 electoral votes , were .
As a result , campaigns and national priorities are stacked in favor of a few strategic states .
Ethanol fuel , a pet issue of Iowa farmers , is discussed a lot .
But issues of equal concern to states like Alabama , California , New York and Indiana are not .
